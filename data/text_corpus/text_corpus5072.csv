25360,morphological physiological behavioral and life history traits of zooplankton are vital when assessing their roles in marine ecosystem a recent study has shown that certain traits of marine copepod change with life stage where fast growing young nauplii have low n p ratio selecting for p rich food and excreting at high n p while older slow growing copepodites are characterized by higher n p selecting for n rich food and excreting at low n p we developed a simple model for incorporating these age specific traits within the european regional seas ecosystem model framework to test the importance of these traits in the marine ecosystem our results suggest that copepod s community growth is limited by different factors in different life stages nauplii population is limited by prey s

phytoplankton can be limited by phosphorus p or nitrogen n some zooplankton are known to be more n limited while others require more p for growth elser and urabe 1999 for example calanoid copepods are

andersen and hessen 1991 in certain environments zooplankton with high n p ratios excrete at low n p ratios leading to n limitation in the ambient waters and thus for phytoplankton similarly environments dominated by zooplankton with low n p ratios can lead to p limitation for phytoplankton sterner 1990 in addition to interspecific variabilities intraspecific variabilities such as age and sex are also significant for zooplankton e g van someren gréve et al 2017 it is well known that copepods go through multiple complex life stages with five to six naupliar stages followed by five copepodite stages before reaching adulthood kiørboe and sabatini 1995 each life stage during ontogeny is characterized by different traits for example younger nauplii grow faster than older copepodites and growth rate declines continually in the copepodite stages carlotti and sciandra 1989 faster growing nauplii are typically richer in p as higher growth rates are associated with higher p demand according to the growth rate hypothesis elser et al 1996 a recent study has also found age specific variability in food selectivity where younger nauplii selectively feed on prey with lower n p ratios while older copepodites prefer prey with higher n p when multiple food sources are available meunier et al 2016 here we present simple formulations for incorporating these age specific traits bodyc n p growth rate and food preference based on food quality of copepod into an existing state of art marine biogeochemical model ersem european regional seas ecosystem model butenschön et al 2016 using this model we conduct numerical experiments in a 0d chemostat setting to assess the impacts of incorporating these age specific traits on food web dynamics and nutrient cycling previous modeling studies have shown that zooplankton s active prey switching based on the food quality of phytoplankton significantly affects both plankton dynamics and nutrient cycling mitra and flynn 2006 sailley et al 2014 these studies however did not consider zooplankton cannibalism and zooplankton zooplankton grazing which exists in the ersem framework in this work we developed a new food selectivity formulation which includes zooplankton zooplankton grazing as well as cannibalism in order to extract age specific traits we used data from laboratory experiment of a common marine copepod species acartia tonsa meunier et al 2016 2 method ersem represents the marine carbon and nutrient cycle with full dynamic stoichiometry c n p and chl in all its functional types including organic matter butenschön et al 2016 the model consists of 4 phytoplankton functional groups picophytoplankton nanophytoplankton microphytoplankton and diatoms 3 zooplankton types heterotrophic flagellates microzooplankton and mesozooplankton and heterotrophic bacteria fig 1 these plankton functional types are chiefly based on size and each zooplankton functional types are capable of predating on different prey including cannibalism according to size details on ersem are extensively described elsewhere butenschön et al 2016 so here we describe our new contribution to the model which is incorporation of age specific traits i e food quality dependence of body c n p growth rate and food preference copepods represent the mesozooplankton which are the top predators in ersem to incorporate their age specific traits in the model we formulated i c n p ratios ii maximum assimilation rate and iii flexible food preference as a function of mesozooplankton age i and ii are obtained directly from the linear regression applied to the experimental data by meunier et al 2016 and iii is a modified formulation of the active prey switch model by fasham et al 1990 extended here to incorporate the food quality of the prey as explained below we are not explicitly modeling the age structure of mesozooplankton population in the model rather we are using their c n p and maximum growth rate as a proxy for the mean age of the mesozooplankton population hence this formulation is fundamentally different from zooplankton models that explicitly model each life stage e g carlotti and sciandra 1989 fennel 2001 pinceel et al 2016 wang et al 2014 essentially this study can be interpreted as a sensitivity test on how changes in the c n p ratios the maximum assimilation and the prey selectivity of mesozooplankton affect marine ecosystem dynamics 2 1 c n p as a function of age all zooplankton functional types in ersem have their cellular c n and p as the state variables

while heterotrophic flagellates heterotrophs and microzooplankton have variable c n p ratios to the extent that the c n p ratios in the prey of mesozooplankton deviate from its fixed internal ratio there is a food or nutritional imbalance in such a case mesozooplankton in ersem release c n and p at different rates so as to maintain its internal ratio these c n and p released as a result of this homeostatic regulation are added to large particulate organic matter pool we used the experimental data of meunier et al 2016 to obtain a relationship between c n p of marine copepod acartia tonsa as a function of age fig 2 by carrying out standard linear regression statistically significant p 0 05 linear equations describing relationship between age and c n p are obtained 5 c p molar 5 77 age days 52 6 6 n p molar 1 94 age days 7 15 between the age of 1day to 14days c p ratio more than triples from 40 to 130 fig 2 top and n p ratio also increases from 6 5 to 32 fig 2 bottom since we are not explicitly modeling the different life stage of mesozooplankton these ratios are assumed to reflect the mean c n p ratios of mesozooplankton population rather than individual c n p in other words high n p means that mesozooplankton population is mostly composed up of older copepodites and vice versa for low n p 2 2 maximum assimilation rate as a function of age in their experiment meunier et al 2016 demonstrate statistically significant relationship p 0 05 between relative growth rate age and body n p where relative growth rate decrease linearly with age and n p faster growth rates of nauplii are associated with higher p content in agreement with the growth rate hypothesis elser et al 1996 their results suggest that the relative growth rate changes by 0 06 d 1 for each day of aging i e product of relative growth rate per n p and the relative change in n p per age in our model we thus assume the same for the maximum assimilation rate of mesozooplankton dotted line fig 2 bottom 7 g max d 1 0 06 a g e d a y s 1 36 accordingly at the age of 6days the maximum assimilation rate is exactly 1 0 d 1 which is equal to the predefined value in ersem 2 3 flexible grazing preference as a function of age in the original ersem each zooplankton has a fixed biomass independent prey preference based on the predator prey size relationship appendix a table a1 for example mesozooplankton prefers grazing on microzooplankton 0 25 and mesozooplankton 0 25 i e cannibalism the most followed by diatoms 0 15 microphytoplankton 0 15 scavenging on medium sized pom 0 1 heterotrophic flagellates 0 05 and nanophytoplankton 0 05 the preferences are normalized and add up to 1 assigning fixed preferences however ignores the fact that some mesozooplankton can preferentially prey on food that best satisfies their nutrient requirement for different life stages meunier et al 2016 the experiment of meunier et al 2016 shows that nauplii with lower n p prefer prey rich in p while copepodites with higher n p prefer prey rich in n as an alternative to ersem s original fixed prey preferences we formulated a new flexible food preference scheme based on the commonly used active predator switch model known as the fasham formulation fasham et al 1990 vallina et al 2014 and extended it to incorporate the dependence on food quality the original active predator switch proposed by fasham et al 1990 is 8 ϕ j ρ j p j ρ j p j where ϕj is the variable preference of prey type j it is a product of ρj the density independent grazing preference for prey j and pj the biomass of prey j in our formulation we adopt the default values of ρj from ersem fasham s formulation describes how predators preferentially select the most abundant prey reflecting an increase in capture efficiency as biomass of a given type of prey increases relative to others vallina et al 2014 the constant preference ρj is related to predator prey size ratios and the matchup between attack survival strategies the product of ρj and pj is normalized such that the sum of all the prey preference for a given predator adds up to 1 we modified this original fasham s formulation to incorporate age specific food preference by assuming that a predator would preferentially select prey that has a higher food quality i e n p ratios that most closely match the predator s nutritional requirement eq 8 is thus modified as follows 9 ϕ j ρ j p j fq j ρ j p j fq j where fqj is a food quality of prey j measured in terms of the deviation from the ideal food n p 10 fq j 1 σ 2π exp 1 2 δ n p j σ 2 11 δ n p j ideal food n p food n p ideal food n p as illustrated in fig 3 fq of each prey fqj is a gaussian function of the fractional difference between ideal food s n p ratio and food s actual n p ratio and takes the maximum value when that difference is zero definition of ideal food n p follows the threshold elemental ratio anderson et al 2005 raubenheimer et al 2009 12 ideal food n p consumer n p gge n gge p where gge x is the gross growth efficiency of element x e g if all ingested x leads to growth gge x equals 100 experimental results of meunier et al 2016 show no statistically significant difference between the n p of new tissue built and n p ingested for both nauplii and copepodites hence we assume that both gge of n and gge of p equal 100 this assumption is often made in other studies anderson 1992 urabe and watanabe 1992 therefore fq is highest when food n p equals consumer s n p although fq would be the highest for cannibalism by this definition our formulation does not necessarily lead to cnibalism being the most preferred feeding option this is because food preference is not determined solely on the basis of fq but is also a function of density independent preference ρj and prey biomass pj however to prevent excess cannibalism by mesozooplankton we set an upper bound for preference of cannibalism to be 0 25 25 a default value used in the original ersem as copepod s n p changes with age fig 2 the peak of fq curve shifts with age fig 3 nauplius has the peak shifted to the left i e preference for lower n p and copepodite has the peak shifted to the right i e preference for higher n p reflecting their change in food s ideal n p food quality function is a gaussian such that food quality is the same for a positive deviation of food n p from the predator s n p as for a negative deviation by the same absolute value this is based on the observation that excess nutrient as well as lack of nutrients can limit ingestion rate a phenomena known as stoichiometric knife edge boersma and elser 2006 bullejos et al 2014 laspoumaderes et al 2015 hence our definition of food quality differs from other zooplankton models which assume that simply an increase in prey nutrient content equal higher food quality branco et al 2010 zhao et al 2008 the parameter σ in eq 10 is a measure of the strength of food selectivity where a large σ gives a broad food preference profile indicating weak selectivity of prey based on n p in contrast a small σ indicates a sharp food preference profile and strong selectivity by changing the value of σ this formulation can simulate weaker non selective feeding behavior of copepod isari et al 2013 as well as a more strongly selective behavior for this study we assumed that the value of σ is constant with age as there is not yet any experimental evidence on how σ changes over the life stages of copepod yet the usage of gaussian function for describing food quality has a useful property over quadratic function for example since gaussian function has only two unknown parameters and that the area under the food quality function is always normalized to 1 therefore the effects of food quality and food quantity on food preference can effectively be decoupled 2 4 experimental setup our modified ersem was run in a zero dimensional homogenously mixed chemostat setting under constant light 100wm 2 and temperature 10 c there is thus no seasonality in order to investigate the effects of mesozooplankton s age specific traits each set of experiments was run by assuming a different fixed mean age of mesozooplankton between 1 and 14days the selection of mean age is reflected in mesozooplankton c n p as well as the maximum assimilation rate based on eqs 5 7 for each experiment simulations were run for 5 years during which the model becomes steady and the results from the final year were averaged external nutrient supply rate of n and p is fixed at 0 1 d 1 with n p stoichiometry of 17 1 17mm 1mm all living functional types phytoplankton zooplankton and bacteria are initialized with the biomass of 20 mgc m 3 with n and p at the redfield stoichiometry molar of c n p 106 16 1 except for mesozooplankton which has different c n p for each age experiment labile dom was seeded with 80 mgc m 3 of carbon and 1 and 0 1mmolm 3 of n and p respectively semi labile dom and pom were assumed to be zero initially all the numerical experiments were carried using matlab and the computational codes are available for download from author s github github com tanio003 ersem agemodel 3 results biomass of mesozooplankton at equilibrium changes with the mean age i e via n p ratio and the degree of food selectivity i e σ value fig 4 when prey selectivity based on food quality is strong i e small σ fig 4a mesozooplankton biomass takes a unimodal pattern where biomass is highest when the mean mesozooplankton age is 4 6days bodyn p of 12 20 at the younger nauplii stage age of 1 3days n p ratio of mesozooplankton is 7 10 fig 2 which is significantly lower than the n p ratios of most of its prey that there is not adequate prey that can satisfy nauplii s nutritional requirement in this case their choice of diet is limited to cannibalism and few p rich prey nanophytoplankton and heterotrophic flagellates fig 5 a although the maximum assimilation rate is highest at the nauplius stage fig 2 the scarcity of food choice leads to a very low biomass of mesozooplankton likewise at the later copepodite stage age 9days prey is limited to few n rich organisms with high n p the dearth of prey choices due to large difference between their own n p and prey s n p at young 1 4days and old age 9 14days is a major factor contributing to the unimodal biomass pattern of mesozooplankton when food selectivity is strong furthermore the growth of mesozooplankton at older age is diminished by aging related reduction in the maximum assimilation rate as mesozooplankton s mean age approaches late nauplius to early metamorphosis phase age of 3 6days their body n p approaches the external nutrient supply flux ratio of 17 and the ratios of most other plankton as more prey now have n p ratios close to mesozooplankton s ideal food n p mesozooplankton has a greater selection of food fig 5a under this high food selectivity scenario mesozooplankton prefers feeding on microzooplankton followed by nanophytoplankton mesozooplankton medium size pom and heterotrophs preference increases for microzooplankton and medium sized pom mpom but decreases for heterotrophs during this life stage hence we observe concurrent decrease in microzooplankton biomass and increase in biomass of heterotrophs fig 4a as mesozooplankton becomes less selective based on food quality i e larger σ meaning more generalist in terms of grazing the window in which mesozooplankton can grow becomes wider compare fig 4a and b as σ becomes even larger the mesozooplankton response for different values of their internal n p ratio approaches the fasham formulation fig 4c or the original ersem s fixed preference formulation fig 4d both of which have no food quality dependence on prey preference with the fasham and fixed preference formulations mesozooplankton can feed on all prey even during the early nauplius stage and the late copepodite stage fig 5c and d this contrasts with the low σ case where available prey types were limited to one or two prey types fig 5a this is a major finding of this study where the age dependent food selectivity of mesozooplankton can alter the overall food web dynamics as evident in fig 4 the total biomass of all plankton functional types was not significantly affected by both the age and the food preference this suggests that the top down control by the mesozooplankton was not strong in these model runs incorporating flexible grazing formulations for microzooplankton and heterotrophs as well could lead to a stronger top down control armengol et al 2017 although this is outside the scope of this study indeed in another set of experiments where we allowed microzooplankton and heterotrophs food preference to be flexible we did see transition from bottom up to top down control with increasing magnitude of σ larger σ i e lower food selectivity allows grazer to forage on phytoplankton even under conditions of nutrient imbalance which leads to a stronger top down control age dependent traits also affect nutrient dynamics fig 6 in addition to trophic interactions when food preference is independent of food quality fasham and fixed preference released n p deviates substantially from body n p fig 6a during nauplius stage low internal n p they preferentially release more n compared to p hence released n p is above the 1 1 line during copepodite stage age 9days body n p is higher leading to low n p release ratio below 1 1 line this is a typical behavior of copepod as they can release n or p preferentially in order to maintain homeostasis sterner 1990 on the other hand when food quality dependence is high i e low σ released n p more closely matches the 1 1 line at low σ mesozooplankton s food imbalance is small so that they have little excess n or p to release although the metabolic costs associated with extra release of n and or p is not explicitly included in the model this can be an important trait in the actual marine environment elser et al 2016 plath and boersma 2001 the trade off associated with this food selection behavior is that their food choice becomes limited when their ideal food n p deviates from food s n p ratio similar relationship holds between n p ratio of large pom lpom and n p of mesozooplankton fig 6b since lpom is mostly made up of released materials from mesozooplankton n p ratio of lpom is closely tied to released n p ratio of mesozooplankton except for the fact that lpom sinks and gets decomposed to dom when prey selection is not determined by food quality fasham or fixed n p ratio lpom is higher and lower than body n p during nauplius and copepodite stage respectively on the other hand when prey selection is sensitive to food quality n p ratio of lpom matches n p ratio of mesozooplankton influences of mesozooplankton nutrient release on the ambient water s inorganic n p and bulk pon to pop ratio were marginal not shown due to the fact that mesozooplankton made up only 10 of the total biomass and that external nutrient supply flux was high enough to keep nutrient concentration replenished minimizing the top down control a further study incorporating selective feeding of other zooplankton types heterotrophs and microzooplankton may increase the effects of consumer driven nutrient cycling indeed microzooplankton and heterotrophs also appear capable of selectively feeding on prey that most satisfies metabolic needs and to maintain c n p homeostasis meunier et al 2012 4 discussion for the first time we introduced age specific traits of marine zooplankton within the framework of an existing state of the art ecosystem model our modeling approach uses mesozooplankton c n p ratio as a proxy for the mean age instead of modeling the age structure explicitly this approach relies on average population age structure of mesozooplankton following a unimodal structure a unimodal population structure was reported in the north sea by the classic study of rakusa suszczewski 1967 more recently villar argaiz et al 2002 observed a unimodal age structure of copepod during the large portion of ice free period for the calanoid copepod mixodiaptomus lacinatus the unimodal structure is indicated by the time evolution of the age class abundances of the calanoids in addition an individual based modelling study also predicts a unimodal population structure of copepod calanus sinicus population in yellow sea during large portion of the stratified season wang et al 2014 our numerical experiments show variations in response of plankton community and its stoichiometry to changes in mesozooplankton s mean age age specific traits internalc n p ratios and growth rate and food preferences high food selectivity leads to unimodal biomass distribution of mesozooplankton although there are multiple explanations for a unimodal population age structure in nature villar argaiz et al 2002 our study indicates that one possible explanation is that young naupliar growth is limited by scarcity of food choice at the same time old copepodite growth is limited by nutrition imbalance and reduction of assimilation rate these results provide testable and viable hypothesis on how age specific traits of mesozooplankton modify plankton community structure an important future implication of this study is that the increasing n p supply ratio due to the large addition of anthropogenic nitrogen into the oceans beusen et al 2016 bouwman et al 2017 can significantly impact the age structure of copepod populations and modify the ocean n cycle for example nitrogen loading can favor older populations with higher optimal n p over younger population with lower optimal n p in a negative feedback the increase in abundance of older copepods with a preference for n may lead to a larger n export via large pom i e copepods fecal pellets and excretion thus ameliorating the excess n condition although questions remain on how age specific traits of zooplankton impact nutrient cycling and food web dynamics on large spatial scales formulations provided here can easily be incorporated into a wide variety of global biogeochemical models for further studies acknowledgements we thank robert

g max d 1 0 06 a g e d a y s 1 36 accordingly at the age of 6days the maximum assimilation rate is exactly 1 0 d 1 which is equal to the predefined value in ersem 2 3 flexible grazing preference as a function of age in the original ersem each zooplankton has a fixed biomass independent prey preference based on the predator prey size relationship appendix a table a1 for example mesozooplankton prefers grazing on microzooplankton 0 25 and mesozooplankton 0 25 i e cannibalism the most followed by diatoms 0 15 microphytoplankton 0 15 scavenging on medium sized pom 0 1 heterotrophic flagellates 0 05 and nanophytoplankton 0 05 the preferences are normalized and add up to 1 assigning fixed preferences however ignores the fact that some mesozooplankton can preferentially prey on food that best satisfies their nutrient requirement for different life stages meunier et al 2016 the experiment of meunier et al 2016 shows that nauplii with lower n p prefer prey rich in p while copepodites with higher n p prefer prey rich in n as an alternative to ersem s original fixed prey preferences we formulated a new flexible food preference scheme based on the commonly used active predator switch model known as the fasham formulation fasham et al 1990 vallina et al 2014 and extended it to incorporate the dependence on food quality the original active predator switch proposed by fasham et al 1990 is 8 ϕ j ρ j p j ρ j p j where ϕj is the variable preference of prey type j it is a product of ρj the density independent grazing preference for prey j and pj the biomass of prey j in our formulation we adopt the default values of ρj from ersem fasham s formulation describes how predators preferentially select the most abundant prey reflecting an increase in capture efficiency as biomass of a given type of prey increases relative to others vallina et al 2014 the constant preference ρj is related to predator prey size ratios and the matchup between attack survival strategies the product of ρj and pj is normalized such that the sum of all the prey preference for a given predator adds up to 1 we modified this original fasham s formulation to incorporate age specific food preference by assuming that a predator would preferentially select prey that has a higher food quality i e n p ratios that most closely match the predator s nutritional requirement eq 8 is thus modified as follows 9 ϕ j ρ j p j fq j ρ j p j fq j where fqj is a food quality of prey j measured in terms of the deviation from the ideal food n p 10 fq j 1 σ 2π exp 1 2 δ n p j σ 2 11 δ n p j ideal food n p food n p ideal food n p as illustrated in fig 3 fq of each prey fqj is a gaussian function of the fractional difference between ideal food s n p ratio and food s actual n p ratio and takes the maximum value when that difference is zero definition of ideal food n p follows the threshold elemental ratio anderson et al 2005 raubenheimer et al 2009 12 ideal food n p consumer n p gge n gge p where gge x is the gross growth efficiency of element x e g if all ingested x leads to growth gge x equals 100 experimental results of meunier et al 2016 show no statistically significant difference between the n p of new tissue built and n p ingested for both nauplii and copepodites hence we assume that both gge of n and gge of p equal 100 this assumption is often made in other studies anderson 1992 urabe and watanabe 1992 therefore fq is highest when food n p equals consumer s n p although fq would be the highest for cannibalism by this definition our formulation does not necessarily lead to cnibalism being the most preferred feeding option this is because food preference is not determined solely on the basis of fq but is also a function of density independent preference ρj and prey biomass pj however to prevent excess cannibalism by mesozooplankton we set an upper bound for preference of cannibalism to be 0 25 25 a default value used in the original ersem as copepod s n p changes with age fig 2 the peak of fq curve shifts with age fig 3 nauplius has the peak shifted to the left i e preference for lower n p and copepodite has the peak shifted to the right i e preference for higher n p reflecting their change in food s ideal n p food quality function is a gaussian such that food quality is the same for a positive deviation of food n p from the predator s n p as for a negative deviation by the same absolute value this is based on the observation that excess nutrient as well as lack of nutrients can limit ingestion rate a phenomena known as stoichiometric knife edge boersma and elser 2006 bullejos et al 2014 laspoumaderes et al 2015 hence our definition of food quality differs from other zooplankton models which assume that simply an increase in prey nutrient content equal higher food quality branco et al 2010 zhao et al 2008 the parameter σ in eq 10 is a measure of the strength of food selectivity where a large σ gives a broad food preference profile indicating weak selectivity of prey based on n p in contrast a small σ indicates a sharp food preference profile and strong selectivity by changing the value of σ this formulation can simulate weaker non selective feeding behavior of copepod isari et al 2013 as well as a more strongly selective behavior for this study we assumed that the value of σ is constant with age as there is not yet any experimental evidence on how σ changes over the life stages of copepod yet the usage of gaussian function for describing food quality has a useful property over quadratic function for example since gaussian function has only two unknown parameters and that the area under the food quality function is always normalized to 1 therefore the effects of food quality and food quantity on food preference can effectively be decoupled 2 4 experimental setup our modified ersem was run in a zero dimensional homogenously mixed chemostat setting under constant light 100wm 2 and temperature 10 c there is thus no seasonality in order to investigate the effects of mesozooplankton s age specific traits each set of experiments was run by assuming a different fixed mean age of mesozooplankton between 1 and 14days the selection of mean age is reflected in mesozooplankton c n p as well as the maximum assimilation rate based on eqs 5 7 for each experiment simulations were run for 5 years during which the model becomes steady and the results from the final year were averaged external nutrient supply rate of n and p is fixed at 0 1 d 1 with n p stoichiometry of 17 1 17mm 1mm all living functional types phytoplankton zooplankton and bacteria are initialized with the biomass of 20 mgc m 3 with n and p at the redfield stoichiometry molar of c n p 106 16 1 except for mesozooplankton which has different c n p for each age experiment labile dom was seeded with 80 mgc m 3 of carbon and 1 and 0 1mmolm 3 of n and p respectively semi labile dom and pom were assumed to be zero initially all the numerical experiments were carried using matlab and the computational codes are available for download from author s github github com tanio003 ersem agemodel 3 results biomass of mesozooplankton at equilibrium changes with the mean age i e via n p ratio and the degree of food selectivity i e σ value fig 4 when prey selectivity based on food quality is strong i e small σ fig 4a mesozooplankton biomass takes a unimodal pattern where biomass is highest when the mean mesozooplankton age is 4 6days bodyn p of 12 20 at the younger nauplii stage age of 1 3days n p ratio of mesozooplankton is 7 10 fig 2 which is significantly lower than the n p ratios of most of its prey that there is not adequate prey that can satisfy nauplii s nutritional requirement in this case their choice of diet is limited to cannibalism and few p rich prey nanophytoplankton and heterotrophic flagellates fig 5 a although the maximum assimilation rate is highest at the nauplius stage fig 2 the scarcity of food choice leads to a very low biomass of mesozooplankton likewise at the later copepodite stage age 9days prey is limited to few n rich organisms with high n p the dearth of prey choices due to large difference between their own n p and prey s n p at young 1 4days and old age 9 14days is a major factor contributing to the unimodal biomass pattern of mesozooplankton when food selectivity is strong furthermore the growth of mesozooplankton at older age is diminished by aging related reduction in the maximum assimilation rate as mesozooplankton s mean age approaches late nauplius to early metamorphosis phase age of 3 6days their body n p approaches the external nutrient supply flux ratio of 17 and the ratios of most other plankton as more prey now have n p ratios close to mesozooplankton s ideal food n p mesozooplankton has a greater selection of food fig 5a under this high food selectivity scenario mesozooplankton prefers feeding on microzooplankton followed by nanophytoplankton mesozooplankton medium size pom and heterotrophs preference increases for microzooplankton and medium sized pom mpom but decreases for heterotrophs during this life stage hence we observe concurrent decrease in microzooplankton biomass and increase in biomass of heterotrophs fig 4a as mesozooplankton becomes less selective based on food quality i e larger σ meaning more generalist in terms of grazing the window in which mesozooplankton can grow becomes wider compare fig 4a and b as σ becomes even larger the mesozooplankton response for different values of their internal n p ratio approaches the fasham formulation fig 4c or the original ersem s fixed preference formulation fig 4d both of which have no food quality dependence on prey preference with the fasham and fixed preference formulations mesozooplankton can feed on all prey even during the early nauplius stage and the late copepodite stage fig 5c and d this contrasts with the low σ case where available prey types were limited to one or two prey types fig 5a this is a major finding of this study where the age dependent food selectivity of mesozooplankton can alter the overall food web dynamics as evident in fig 4 the total biomass of all plankton functional types was not significantly affected by both the age and the food preference this suggests that the top down control by the mesozooplankton was not strong in these model runs incorporating flexible grazing formulations for microzooplankton and heterotrophs as well could lead to a stronger top down control armengol et al 2017 although this is outside the scope of this study indeed in another set of experiments where we allowed microzooplankton and heterotrophs food preference to be flexible we did see transition from bottom up to top down control with increasing magnitude of σ larger σ i e lower food selectivity allows grazer to forage on phytoplankton even under conditions of nutrient imbalance which leads to a stronger top down control age dependent traits also affect nutrient dynamics fig 6 in addition to trophic interactions when food preference is independent of food quality fasham and fixed preference released n p deviates substantially from body n p fig 6a during nauplius stage low internal n p they preferentially release more n compared to p hence released n p is above the 1 1 line during copepodite stage age 9days body n p is higher leading to low n p release ratio below 1 1 line this is a typical behavior of copepod as they can release n or p preferentially in order to maintain homeostasis sterner 1990 on the other hand when food quality dependence is high i e low σ released n p more closely matches the 1 1 line at low σ mesozooplankton s food imbalance is small so that they have little excess n or p to release although the metabolic costs associated with extra release of n and or p is not explicitly included in the model this can be an important trait in the actual marine environment elser et al 2016 plath and boersma 2001 the trade off associated with this food selection behavior is that their food choice becomes limited when their ideal food n p deviates from food s n p ratio similar relationship holds between n p ratio of large pom lpom and n p of mesozooplankton fig 6b since lpom is mostly made up of released materials from mesozooplankton n p ratio of lpom is closely tied to released n p ratio of mesozooplankton except for the fact that lpom sinks and gets decomposed to dom when prey selection is not determined by food quality fasham or fixed n p ratio lpom is higher and lower than body n p during nauplius and copepodite stage respectively on the other hand when prey selection is sensitive to food quality n p ratio of lpom matches n p ratio of mesozooplankton influences of mesozooplankton nutrient release on the ambient water s inorganic n p and bulk pon to pop ratio were marginal not shown due to the fact that mesozooplankton made up only 10 of the total biomass and that external nutrient supply flux was high enough to keep nutrient concentration replenished minimizing the top down control a further study incorporating selective feeding of other zooplankton types heterotrophs and microzooplankton may increase the effects of consumer driven nutrient cycling indeed microzooplankton and heterotrophs also appear capable of selectively feeding on prey that most satisfies metabolic needs and to maintain c n p homeostasis meunier et al 2012 4 discussion for the first time we introduced age specific traits of marine zooplankton within the framework of an existing state of the art ecosystem model our modeling approach uses mesozooplankton c n p ratio as a proxy for the mean age instead of modeling the age structure explicitly this approach relies on average population age structure of mesozooplankton following a unimodal structure a unimodal population structure was reported in the north sea by the classic study of rakusa suszczewski 1967 more recently villar argaiz et al 2002 observed a unimodal age structure of copepod during the large portion of ice free period for the calanoid copepod mixodiaptomus lacinatus the unimodal structure is indicated by the time evolution of the age class abundances of the calanoids in addition an individual based modelling study also predicts a unimodal population structure of copepod calanus sinicus population in yellow sea during large portion of the stratified season wang et al 2014 our numerical experiments show variations in response of plankton community and its stoichiometry to changes in mesozooplankton s mean age age specific traits internalc n p ratios and growth rate and food preferences high food selectivity leads to unimodal biomass distribution of mesozooplankton although there are multiple explanations for a unimodal population age structure in nature villar argaiz et al 2002 our study indicates that one possible explanation is that young naupliar growth is limited by scarcity of food choice at the same time old copepodite growth is limited by nutrition imbalance and reduction of assimilation rate these results provide testable and viable hypothesis on how age specific traits of mesozooplankton modify plankton community structure an important future implication of this study is that the increasing n p supply ratio due to the large addition of anthropogenic nitrogen into the oceans beusen et al 2016 bouwman et al 2017 can significantly impact the age structure of copepod populations and modify the ocean n cycle for example nitrogen loading can favor older populations with higher optimal n p over younger population with lower optimal n p in a negative feedback the increase in abundance of older copepods with a preference for n may lead to a larger n export via large pom i e copepods fecal pellets and excretion thus ameliorating the excess n condition although questions remain on how age specific traits of zooplankton impact nutrient cycling and

25361,there is an increasing need to understand ecosystem responses to multiple stressors in that such complex responses depend not only on species level responses but also on species interactions and ecosystem structure in this study we used a multi model ecosystem simulation approach to explore the combined effects of fishing and primary productivity on different components of the food web across a suite of ecosystems and a range of model types simulations were carried out under different levels of primary productivity and various fishing scenarios in addition to exploring synergistic additive or antagonistic combined effects of multiple stressors we included a fourth category dampened which refers to less negative or less positive impacts compared to additive ones and in contrast to previous studies we explicitly considered the direction positive or negative of the combined effects we focused on two specific combined effects negative synergism and positive dampened associated with the risk of resultant lower fish biomass than expected under additive effects through a meta analysis of the multi models simulation results we found that i the risk of negative synergism was generally higher for low trophic level ltl taxa implying that following an increase of fishing pressure on a given ltl stock the subsequent decrease of biomass under low primary productivity would be larger than expected under additive effects and ii the risk of positive dampened effects was generally higher for high trophic level htl taxa implying that given a management measure aimed at reducing the impact of fishing on htl stocks the subsequent rebuilding of these stocks would be slower than expected our approach to categorizing and exploring cumulative effects can be applied to evaluate other community properties and provide guidance for fisheries management keywords marine ecosystem fishing combined effect meta analysis synergism multiple drivers 1 introduction extensive studies have been conducted using empirical data from marine ecosystems to investigate individual effects of various stressors particularly of fishing and environmental change e g fu et al 2015 shackell et al 2012 yet research into the cumulative and interactive impacts of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems is more limited moreover most studies analyzing the cumulative and interactive effects of stressors on marine ecosystems focus on impacts at the single species level crain et al 2008 however impacts of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems depend not only on species level responses to stressors but also on species interactions species diversity and redundancy and ecosystem structure vinebrooke et al 2004 crain et al 2008 planque et al 2010 this highlights the need to understand community level and whole ecosystem responses to multiple stressors breitburg et al 1998 empirical studies exploring the effects of fishing and environmental change often assume that the combined effects of these two stressors are additive e g halpern et al 2007 2008 link et al 2010 miller et al 2011 i e that they are equal to the sum of the individual stressor impacts however crain et al 2008 found after reviewing 171 studies mostly experimental ones and manipulating two or more stressors in marine and coastal systems that the combined effects of stressors varied across studies manifesting as additive 26 of the studies synergistic 36 or antagonistic effects 38 synergism is used to define a combined effect of multiple stressors that is greater than the addition of effects produced by the stressors acting in isolation antagonism is a cumulative effect with a lower magnitude than the sum of isolated effects folt et al 1999 darling and côté 2008 however antagonism specifically designates situations where the pressures act effectively in opposition or where the combined effect is opposite to the additive effect in conservation science it is commonly believed that ecological synergies are associated with deleterious consequences for ecological systems paine et al 1998 sala et al 2000 harley et al 2006 halpern et al 2008 brook et al 2008 and that they have the potential to either reduce ecosystem resilience or push ecosystems into alternative states that would not have been reached with individual stressors acting in isolation mcclanahan et al 2002 folke et al 2004 however in the applied context of fisheries management synergistic or antagonistic combined effects may have different implications depending on the response direction positive or negative of the combined effects these management implications were not addressed in the afore mentioned studies understanding that a conceptually robust definition and systematic classification of synergism and antagonism is a prerequisite for improving the ability to predict and manage the interactive effects of multiple stressors piggott et al 2015 re conceptualized synergism and antagonism by combining both the magnitude and response direction of combined effects and illustrated how the traditional direction independent classification of these terms may prove problematic travers trolet et al 2014 introduced dampened effect as a third category of combined effects in addition to synergism and antagonism referring to less negative or to less positive impacts on a given ecosystem component in this study we further categorized the three types of combined effects synergism dampened effect and antagonism according to their direction positive or negative and ecological consequence risk being defined as combined effect resulting in lower fish biomass than expected under additive effects see section 2 5 for detailed definitions of the different categories of combined effects empirically it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the frequency with which synergistic antagonistic and additive effects may be expected in the presence of multiple stressors given the diversity of stressor combinations that can potentially co occur across a broad range of marine ecosystems crain et al 2008 darling and côté 2008 halpern et al 2008 costello et al 2010 ecosystem simulation models such as ecopath with ecosim ewe christensen and walters 2004 mackinson et al 2009 osmose shin and cury 2004 travers et al 2009 travers trolet et al 2014 and atlantis fulton et al 2004 griffith et al 2011 2012 are increasingly being used worldwide to investigate impacts of fishing and environmental change on marine ecosystems they are useful for the study of potential synergistic or antagonistic effects of stressors in marine ecosystems since they can be employed as virtual laboratories where stressors can be controlled and dynamics can be tracked at different aggregation levels i e at the species community and ecosystem levels e g griffith et al 2012 travers trolet et al 2014 using an atlantis model of the southeastern australian marine ecosystem griffith et al 2012 found that the different trophic levels of a marine community responded differently to combined changes in fishing and environment with benthic invertebrates responding antagonistically to the combination of ocean warming ocean acidification and fishing pressure while both top predator and planktonic groups responded synergistically practically this would mean that pelagic and demersal fisheries should be managed differently under environmental change travers trolet et al 2014 also suggested differential types of response depending on the trophic level considered using an osmose model of the southern benguela ecosystem they suggested that small pelagic species were more prone to detrimental combined effects of fishing and environmental change than other trophic levels heymans and tomczak 2016 using an ewe model of the northern benguela ecosystem found that while the main driver of demersal species was fishing for pelagic species it was fishing and climate which caused changes in network structure simulating interaction effects of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems is at its infancy there is ample scope to improve broaden and generalize the outcome of these recent modelling studies by developing more realistic end to end models e g travers et al 2007 rose et al 2010 addressing uncertainty by comparing simulations across ecosystems and models or refining the scenarios in this study we explored two stressors fishing and changes in primary productivity with the latter representing one aspect of environmental change across nine marine ecosystems using ecosystem models that differ in their structure and assumptions we specifically investigated the combined effects of these two stressors on fish biomasses at different trophic levels given recent empirical studies showing that the response of ecosystem indicators to individual stressors was dependent on the fishing strategy and history shannon et al 2014 it is critical to explore different fishing strategy scenarios when investigating the combined impacts of fishing and environment on ecosystems therefore ecosystem simulations in this study were carried out using different fishing strategies where either all trophic level all high trophic level htl or low trophic level ltl taxa i e species or groups were subjected to various levels of fishing mortality abiding by our new categorization of combined effects we specifically explored negative synergism and positively dampened effects and contrasted relative risks of these two effects between htl and ltl taxa in a meta analysis context koricheva et al 2013 these analyses aimed at enhancing our understanding of the combined effects of fishing and primary productivity and providing guidance for fisheries managers 2 materials and methods 2 1 ecosystem models nine ecosystems are represented using one of four different ecosystem modelling approaches fig 1 ecopath with ecosim ewe christensen and walters 2004 osmose shin and cury 2004 atlantis fulton et al 2004 and a size spectrum model blanchard et al 2014 five ecosystems were modelled with ewe the black sea akoglu 2013 the southern benguela shannon et al 2004 2008 smith et al 2011 the southern catalan sea coll et al 2006 coll et al 2013 the western scotian shelf araújo and bundy 2011 2012 and western scotland alexander et al 2015 osmose was used to model two ecosystems west coast canada fu et al 2013 and the west florida shelf grüss et al 2016 the southeastern australian ecosystem was modelled with atlantis fulton et al 2014 and the north sea was modelled with a size spectrum model blanchard et al 2014 all models used in the present study have been published and validated against observations of abundance biomass and or catch data 2 2 fishing strategies prior to simulation runs fishing mortality corresponding to the maximum sustainable yield fmsy was estimated in each ecosystem for each exploited taxon by reconstructing the yield to fishing mortality curve catch as a function of fishing mortality rate while holding the fishing mortality of all other taxa in the ecosystem constant at their respective current fishing mortality rates fcurr for each ecosystem we separated all taxa into two categories i e focus and non focus taxa with a focus taxon i being fished at f i λ f m s y i year 1 and a non focus taxon j being fished at its respective f c u r r j by varying the multiplier λ we implemented different levels of fishing mortality on focus taxa within each ecosystem we investigated three different fishing strategies an all trophic level f all strategy a high trophic level f htl strategy and a low trophic level f ltl strategy while the f all strategy represents broad scale exploitation where the focus taxa are all taxa retained in commercial or subsistence fisheries the f htl strategy focuses on predatory taxa which include large demersal and large pelagic taxa the f ltl strategy focuses on all forage taxa retained in commercial or subsistence fisheries here forage taxa are defined as pelagic taxa which as adults mainly feed on plankton phyto zoo or ichthyoplankton any pre recruit stages that are represented in the models are excluded from the fishing scenarios as are air breathing animals i e marine mammals marine turtles and seabirds for each fishing strategy we experimented with a range of multipliers λ 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 1 5 covering a representative range of the yield fishing mortality curve the multiplier approach allows comparability across ecosystems 2 3 primary productivity because physical drivers were not explicit in all ecosystem models we forced changes in phytoplankton biomass to represent changes in primary productivity one of the few aspects of environmental change that are comparable across all ecosystem models in ewe and osmose we forced phytoplankton biomass directly in the size spectrum model the plankton carrying capacity parameter was adjusted because plankton biomass emerges in this model rather than being set directly in atlantis nutrient inputs from point sources and upwelling were forced so that the resulting change in phytoplankton matched what would have occurred if the primary production had been forced directly we represented directional primary productivity change by simply applying a multiplier γ 0 85 0 9 0 95 1 1 05 1 1 directly to modelled phytoplankton biomass this range of variability encompasses the range of changes observed in the last decade in the ecosystems studied here boyce et al 2014 2 4 response variables in parallel to the trophic grouping used for the fishing strategies the response variables used here are the aggregated biomass of all htl or ltl taxa averaged over the last ten years of simulation after a spin up time that is specific to each model for each trophic taxa and each fishing strategy in an ecosystem we analyzed 36 scenarios 6 fmsy multipliers 6 multipliers of phytoplankton biomass the control scenario has both the fmsy and phytoplankton biomassmultipliers set to 1 with resultant biomass bc within each scenario k the relative change in biomass is calculated as δ b k c o m b k b c b c for the combined effects with both fishing and phytoplankton biomass varying simultaneously the relative biomass change for additive effects δ b k s e p is the sum of relative biomass change with each of the two factors varying independently while the other remains at its control level 2 5 types of combined effects and risk to characterize the types of effects resulting from the combination of fishing and phytoplankton biomass change we adopted the following definitions of the different types of combined effects with risk zones defined where combined effects result in lower fish biomass than expected under the assumption of additive effects the 1 1 line in fig 2 aside from additive effects 1 1 line the combined effects are as follows i when both δ b k c o m and δ b k s e p are positive in quadrant i if δ b k c o m δ b k s e p the combined effects are considered positive synergistic otherwise positive dampened while positive synergism results in higher fish biomass than expected under the assumption of additive effects positive dampened effect results in lower biomass thus constituting a risk ii when both δ b k c o m and δ b k s e p are negative in quadrant iii if δ b k c o m δ b k s e p the combined effects are considered negative synergistic otherwise negative dampened negative synergism exacerbates the reduction of fish biomass compared with the additive effects so it is considered a risk a negative dampened effect results in higher biomass than expected under additive effects iii in this study effects on fish biomass are categorized as antagonistic when the combined effects and the sum of separate effects have opposite directions of change in this sense the definition of antagonism is more specific than that used in other studies e g crain et al 2008 in the case where δ b k c o m 0 and δ b k s e p 0 in quadrant ii the combined effects are positive antagonistic otherwise negative antagonistic in quadrant iv since positive antagonism results in higher fish biomass than expected under additive effects there is no risk associated with it on the contrary negative antagonism falls within the risk area based on the types of combined effects defined above we assigned each scenario to one of the six categories positive synergism positive dampened positive antagonism negative synergism negative dampened and negative antagonism to report the frequency based on occurrence and intensity of each effect the intensity of an effect is represented by the absolute difference between δ b k c o m and δ b k s e p in order to reflect both occurrence and intensity of the combined effects weighted frequency i e frequency intensity is used for the following analyses 2 6 meta analysis while we appreciate that using statistics on model data breaks the fundamental assumption that the underlying model is unknown it is often still a useful approach for summarizing ecosystem model results moreover in this case a statistical approach is particularly appropriate as calculating the true underlying model across the entire ensemble of models is extremely difficult to compare combined effects of fishing and phytoplankton biomass change across ecosystems fishing strategies and trophic groups we adopt a meta analytic approach while traditional statistical reports include information on significance such as p value such values do not tell the size of a difference between two measures nor can it easily be compared across studies in contrast in any meta analysis the relevant results of each study are expressed in terms of an outcome measure putting the results on a common scale this common outcome measure is called the effect size and it is the magnitude of the effect size that is compared and combined across studies in this study the relative risk rr is used as the effect size we specifically aimed at comparing the rr between the ltl and htl groups to determine if these two trophic groups respond differently to the fishing and phytoplankton biomass changes explored and if they have different levels of ecological risk thereby requiring separate consideration treatment and advice in fisheries management we compared the nine ecosystems under the three fishing strategies the rr value is computed as rr p 1 p 2 for the first type of ecological risk negative synergism for instance p 1 is the proportion of negative synergism for the ltl group p 2 is the proportion for the htl group following the standard practice the statistical analysis was performed on the logarithms of the ratios since ln rr is nearly normal and the standard error of ln rr is estimated as s e 1 p 1 n 1 p 1 1 p 2 n 2 p 2 1 2 fleiss and berlin 2009 to summarize results from the nine ecosystems quantitatively we used a random effects model a full model without discriminating fishing strategies to determine the level of heterogeneity among the ecosystems that could be introduced by the different ecosystem structures and or different modelling approaches in addition a likelihood ratio test between the full model and a reduced model that included fishing strategy as a moderator was conducted to indicate if fishing strategy mattered to the results according to koricheva et al 2013 the random effects model can be written as θi ln rr ui where θi is the estimated effect size of the true effect size ln rr for ecosystem i and u i n 0 τ i 2 with τ 2 representing the amount of heterogeneity among the true effects if τ 2 0 then there is no heterogeneity among true effects i e θ 1 θ 2 θk θ so that ln rr θ denotes the true effect following raudenbush 2009 the best estimate of ln rr noted ln r ˆ r is the average of θi weighted by precision i e the reciprocals of the variance τ i 2 i e ln r ˆ r i 1 k θ i τ i 2 i 1 k 1 τ i 2 where i 1 k 1 τ i 2 1 is the variance the null hypothesis of homogeneity is tested using cochran s q test q i 1 k θ i ln r ˆ r 2 τ i 2 if the null hypothesis is rejected based on a given p value the extent of heterogeneity among the true effects is represented by the simple ratio h q k 1 under the null hypothesis of homogeneity h has an expected value of unity an h value of 2 implies that the variation in the estimated effect size θi is twice what would be expected under the null hypothesis the meta analysis was conducted using the metafor package viechtbauer 2010 3 results the combined effects of fishing and phytoplankton biomass change on fish biomass varied among the different trophic groups ltl htl and all within each ecosystem fig 3 in particular the most frequently occurring effect differed between htl and ltl groups in each ecosystem with only three exceptions the black sea where dampened effects occurred more frequently for both htl and ltl groups the southern catalan sea and the southern benguela where synergistic effects occurred more often across all the ecosystems the htl group was most likely subjected to dampened effects the ltl group on the other hand was more prone to synergistic effects the intensity of synergistic effects was generally larger than that of dampened effects fig 4 antagonistic effects particularly positive antagonism were the least frequent in our simulation experiments however the intensity of this effect tended to be larger than those from the synergistic and dampened effects fig 4 implying that when antagonism happens the resulting response of the fish community could be much larger than what would be expected under other types of combined effects because the different directions of the synergistic dampened and antagonistic effects have different ecological risks presenting different implications for fisheries management we organized the combined effects based on their risk or non risk feature with two exceptions west coast canada and western scotland all ecosystems either had more or less risky combined effects for both htl and ltl groups fig 5 the non risky combined effects i e positive synergism negatively dampened effects and positive antagonism were predominant for both htl and ltl groups in several ecosystems e g the north sea the southeastern australian ecosystem and the west florida shelf in contrast the risky combined effects i e negative synergism positively dampened effects and negative antagonism played important roles in some other ecosystems e g the black sea the southern catalan sea and the southern benguela in order to differentiate the different types of risky combined effects we contrasted the ltl and htl groups to determine how prone they were to each of the ecological risks within each ecosystem and under each fishing strategy most r ˆ r values of negative synergistic effects were at or above 1 fig 6 the r ˆ r value averaged over all ecosystems and fishing strategies was significantly greater than 1 with p 0 021 table 1 this suggested that the risk of a negative synergistic interaction between fishing and phytoplankton biomass change was significantly higher for the ltl group than for the htl group the p value for the likelihood ratio test between the full model shown in fig 6 and the reduced model was 0 939 indicating the conclusion drawn here was irrespective of fishing strategy the ratio of total heterogeneity to total variability was 53 table 1 indicating more than half of the variability was due to heterogeneity across the ecosystem simulation models the h value of 2 279 table 1 implied that the variation in r ˆ r was more than double of what would be expected under the null hypothesis of homogeneity in contrast most r ˆ r values of positive dampened effect were at or below 1 fig 7 the r ˆ r value averaged over all the ecosystems and fishing strategies was significantly less than 1 i e 0 752 with p 0 006 table 1 this suggested that the risk of positive dampened effects was lower for the ltl group than for the htl group the likelihood ratio test p 0 476 between the full model shown in fig 7 and the reduced model indicated that fishing strategy was not a factor affecting the conclusion drawn here the amount of heterogeneity was high 74 compared to the total variability again indicating significant heterogeneity across the ecosystem simulation models when we explored the risk of relative biomass change falling below the additive 1 1 line i e negative synergistic positive dampened and negative antagonistic effects the r ˆ r value averaged over all ecosystems and fishing strategies was 0 903 not significantly different from 1 at p value of 0 05 table 1 because the relative risk of negative synergism and that of positive dampened was opposite the combination of these two types of risk would not be significantly different between the htl and ltl groups in addition the fact that the r ˆ r value was slightly less than 1 could be solely a result of the southeastern australia ecosystem where the r ˆ r values were significantly less than 1 under all three fishing strategies fig 8 meaning for this ecosystem the risk of having detrimental combined effects for htl species was globally higher than for ltl species 4 discussion with the growing need to apply ecosystem based approaches to marine resource management research on cumulative impacts from multiple stressors has become a focal topic in marine science rosenberg and mcleod 2005 leslie and mcleod 2007 particularly under the current situation where both climate change and overfishing are affecting the productivity and structure of marine ecosystems at unprecedented rates kirby et al 2009 while interactions between fishery exploitation and environmental change may result from combinations of various environmental variables that operate through different pathways as an initial step we investigated variation in primary productivity as representing one aspect of environmental change our research employed a multi model ecosystem simulation approach to explore the combined effects of fishing and primary productivity on different components of the food web while combined effects of fishing and environmental change on fish communities have been investigated within a single ecosystem using a single ecosystem model griffith et al 2011 2012 travers trolet et al 2014 this research is the first to investigate the combined effects across a diverse series of marine ecosystems and models following the traditional classification of combined effects without considering the direction of change triggered we found that the htl group was most likely subjected to dampened effect and the ltl group to synergistic effect across all the ecosystems the least frequent combined effect was antagonism suggesting that whether adverse or positive effects of fishing and phytoplankton biomass change rarely cancel one another out since we classified as antagonistic effects only those cases where the combined effects and the separate effects occurred in opposite directions the result derived here concerning the frequency of antagonism is not comparable with previous studies e g crain et al 2008 rosenblatt and schmitz 2014 the infrequent occurrence of antagonism accompanied with its significantly larger intensity absolute difference between δ b k c o m and δ b k s e p could be related to ecological surprises reported in natural systems lindenmayer et al 2010 or particularly in marine ecosystems and fisheries management when the response of target populations to specific management measures such as rebuilding measures are contrary to predictions and counter intuitive pine et al 2009 our results suggest we could better understand ecological surprises if essential drivers are explicitly taken into account and the appropriate scenarios are tested with models incorporating those drivers managers are often bound to assess the consequences of ecological surprises a posteriori their capacity to be prepared for such events would increase if our capacity to predict those rare events is improved such efforts can forewarn managers about potential future states and rare events so managers can trigger appropriate management responses that are robust to such conditions across ecosystems and fishing strategies dampened effects were rather common although all previous research with the exception of travers trolet et al 2014 had classified this effect as antagonism because directional change had not been considered in earlier studies one example of such a dampening process is when the food web is under organizational control of key ltl taxa known as wasp waist control cury et al 2000 bakun 2006 in this case the availability of the ltl taxa may absorb the stressors and typically determines the fate of the predatory fish stocks in conjunction with the effects of fishing pressure upon them therefore any bottom up or top down cascading impact is likely to be dampened in the food web this is true even though the ltl taxa tend to be under heavy fisheries exploitation only when the impact of a driver is so strong that it undermines the resilience of the trophic groups do the combined effects appear to act synergistically on the ecosystem as evidenced by the infamous mnemiopsis anchovy shift in the black sea in 1989 akoglu et al 2014 or the shift from anchovy sardine to goby jellyfish in the northern benguela ecosystem heymans and tomczak 2016 in contrast to previous studies we explicitly considered the direction of the combined effects and specifically associated each direction dependent combined effect with ecological risk while the frequencies of the traditionally defined synergism dampened effects and antagonism in an ecosystem often display irregular patterns fig 3 the frequencies of risky and non risky combined effects tend to have similar patterns between the htl and ltl groups fig 5 implying if risky combined effects dominate for the htl group so do for the ltl group this indicates that it is useful to classify the combined effects according to the risk and non risk categories because this classification reveals an ecosystem s vulnerability to risks irrespective of the trophic groups examined therefore this classification boosts confidence in determining the risky business related to combined effects through specifically contrasting the ltl and htl groups in relation to a specific risky combined effect we obtained findings that have important implications for fisheries management first the risk of negative synergism is significantly higher for the ltl group than for the htl group whatever the fishing strategy considered this implies that following an increase of fishing pressure on a given ltl stock the subsequent decrease of biomass under low phytoplankton biomass will be higher than that expected if only the fishing driver is taken into account in the assessment second the risk of positive dampened effect is significantly higher for the htl group than for the ltl group whatever the fishing strategy considered this means that given a management measure for reducing the impact of fishing on htl stocks the subsequent rebuilding of these stocks will be slower than expected under an assessment taking into account the fishing driver only third the overall risk of relative biomass change falling below that expected under additive effects is not significantly different between the htl and ltl groups due to the fact that the relative risk of negative synergism and that of positively dampened effect cancel one another out this indicates the importance of differentiating the different types of risk when exploring the combined effects of multiple stressors in fisheries management in order to better understand triggers causing the risky combined effects i e negative synergism positively dampened effects and negative antagonism we further explored the occurrences of these risky combined effects over the multiplier spaces of fishing mortality and phytoplankton biomass under different fishing strategies see appendix b for more details as expected risky combined effects generally occur at low phytoplankton biomass and high fishing mortality however under fishing strategy f htl the all and ltl groups are more likely subject to negative synergism and positively dampened effects at low fishing mortality and low phytoplankton biomass this is likely due to the fact that lower fishing mortality on the htl group results in higher htl biomass and thus higher predation mortality on the ltl group such findings have been made possible by employing the ecosystem models that detail the dynamics of different trophic groups and fishing strategies at different trophic levels future research on the development and application of more scenarios of ecosystem dynamics and services using these ecosystem models across broad spatial scales will be beneficial for moving toward ecosystem based approaches to marine resource management aside from the general patterns across the ecosystems related to the combined effects understanding how the characteristics of the different ecosystems are related to combined effects is also beneficial we attempted to functionally link the obtained simulated patterns to features of ecosystem structure see appendix c for more details further research is warranted in order to achieve more definite conclusions overall meta analysis has allowed us to compare combined effects across different ecosystems through comparable simulation experiments with differences existing in both the ecosystem structure and model structure such comparison provides us with good opportunities to explore commonalities and divergences among various ecosystems both of which will lead to greater understanding of the combined effects however due to the small number of simulation scenarios the confidence intervals of the estimated relative risk figs 6 8 were rather wide future simulations and comparisons can be improved by implementing significantly more scenarios of interactions between fishing mortality and phytoplankton biomass change and by including a range of feasible parameterizations per model to capture ecological uncertainty around individual system function and responses the finding that more than half of the variability was due to heterogeneity across the ecosystem simulation models indicates that a broader scale of comparison is warranted in order to verify the conclusions drawn from this study future comparisons can be done within a single ecosystem but employing a variety of ecosystem models or across different ecosystems but using the same ecosystem model in order to address uncertainties in either ecosystem structure or model structure nevertheless the current study has taken a positive step forward by convening research scientists across different continents to carry out unified simulation experiments using existing modelling capacities future research will benefit from comparative modelling approaches running common scenarios and methods

25361,there is an increasing need to understand ecosystem responses to multiple stressors in that such complex responses depend not only on species level responses but also on species interactions and ecosystem structure in this study we used a multi model ecosystem simulation approach to explore the combined effects of fishing and primary productivity on different components of the food web across a suite of ecosystems and a range of model types simulations were carried out under different levels of primary productivity and various fishing scenarios in addition to exploring synergistic additive or antagonistic combined effects of multiple stressors we included a fourth category dampened which refers to less negative or less positive impacts compared to additive ones and in contrast to previous studies we explicitly considered the direction positive or negative of the combined effects we focused on two specific combined effects negative synergism and positive dampened associated with the risk of resultant lower fish biomass than expected under additive effects through a meta analysis of the multi models simulation results we found that i the risk of negative synergism was generally higher for low trophic level ltl taxa implying that following an increase of fishing pressure on a given ltl stock the subsequent decrease of biomass under low primary productivity would be larger than expected under additive effects and ii the risk of positive dampened effects was generally higher for high trophic level htl taxa implying that given a management measure aimed at reducing the impact of fishing on htl stocks the subsequent rebuilding of these stocks would be slower than expected our approach to categorizing and exploring cumulative effects can be applied to evaluate other community properties and provide guidance for fisheries management keywords marine ecosystem fishing combined effect meta analysis synergism multiple drivers 1 introduction extensive studies have been conducted using empirical data from marine ecosystems to investigate individual effects of various stressors particularly of fishing and environmental change e g fu et al 2015 shackell et al 2012 yet research into the cumulative and interactive impacts of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems is more limited moreover most studies analyzing the cumulative and interactive effects of stressors on marine ecosystems focus on impacts at the single species level crain et al 2008 however impacts of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems depend not only on species level responses to stressors but also on species interactions species diversity and redundancy and ecosystem structure vinebrooke et al 2004 crain et al 2008 planque et al 2010 this highlights the need to understand community level and whole ecosystem responses to multiple stressors breitburg et al 1998 empirical studies exploring the effects of fishing and environmental change often assume that the combined effects of these two stressors are additive e g halpern et al 2007 2008 link et al 2010 miller et al 2011 i e that they are equal to the sum of the individual stressor impacts however crain et al 2008 found after reviewing 171 studies mostly experimental ones and manipulating two or more stressors in marine and coastal systems that the combined effects of stressors varied across studies manifesting as additive 26 of the studies synergistic 36 or antagonistic effects 38 synergism is used to define a combined effect of multiple stressors that is greater than the addition of effects produced by the stressors acting in isolation antagonism is a cumulative effect with a lower magnitude than the sum of isolated effects folt et al 1999 darling and côté 2008 however antagonism specifically designates situations where the pressures act effectively in opposition or where the combined effect is opposite to the additive effect in conservation science it is commonly believed that ecological synergies are associated with deleterious consequences for ecological systems paine et al 1998 sala et al 2000 harley et al 2006 halpern et al 2008 brook et al 2008 and that they have the potential to either reduce ecosystem resilience or push ecosystems into alternative states that would not have been reached with individual stressors acting in isolation mcclanahan et al 2002 folke et al 2004 however in the applied context of fisheries management synergistic or antagonistic combined effects may have different implications depending on the response direction positive or negative of the combined effects these management implications were not addressed in the afore mentioned studies understanding that a conceptually robust definition and systematic classification of synergism and antagonism is a prerequisite for improving the ability to predict and manage the interactive effects of multiple stressors piggott et al 2015 re conceptualized synergism and antagonism by combining both the magnitude and response direction of combined effects and illustrated how the traditional direction independent classification of these terms may prove problematic travers trolet et al 2014 introduced dampened effect as a third category of combined effects in addition to synergism and antagonism referring to less negative or to less positive impacts on a given ecosystem component in this study we further categorized the three types of combined effects synergism dampened effect and antagonism according to their direction positive or negative and ecological consequence risk being defined as combined effect resulting in lower fish biomass than expected under additive effects see section 2 5 for detailed definitions of the different categories of combined effects empirically it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the frequency with which synergistic antagonistic and additive effects may be expected in the presence of multiple stressors given the diversity of stressor combinations that can potentially co occur across a broad range of marine ecosystems crain et al 2008 darling and côté 2008 halpern et al 2008 costello et al 2010 ecosystem simulation models such as ecopath with ecosim ewe christensen and walters 2004 mackinson et al 2009 osmose shin and cury 2004 travers et al 2009 travers trolet et al 2014 and atlantis fulton et al 2004 griffith et al 2011 2012 are increasingly being used worldwide to investigate impacts of fishing and environmental change on marine ecosystems they are useful for the study of potential synergistic or antagonistic effects of stressors in marine ecosystems since they can be employed as virtual laboratories where stressors can be controlled and dynamics can be tracked at different aggregation levels i e at the species community and ecosystem levels e g griffith et al 2012 travers trolet et al 2014 using an atlantis model of the southeastern australian marine ecosystem griffith et al 2012 found that the different trophic levels of a marine community responded differently to combined changes in fishing and environment with benthic invertebrates responding antagonistically to the combination of ocean warming ocean acidification and fishing pressure while both top predator and planktonic groups responded synergistically practically this would mean that pelagic and demersal fisheries should be managed differently under environmental change travers trolet et al 2014 also suggested differential types of response depending on the trophic level considered using an osmose model of the southern benguela ecosystem they suggested that small pelagic species were more prone to detrimental combined effects of fishing and environmental change than other trophic levels heymans and tomczak 2016 using an ewe model of the northern benguela ecosystem found that while the main driver of demersal species was fishing for pelagic species it was fishing and climate which caused changes in network structure simulating interaction effects of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems is at its infancy there is ample scope to improve broaden and generalize the outcome of these recent modelling studies by developing more realistic end to end models e g travers et al 2007 rose et al 2010 addressing uncertainty by comparing simulations across ecosystems and models or refining the scenarios in this study we explored two stressors fishing and changes in primary productivity with the latter representing one aspect of environmental change across nine marine ecosystems using ecosystem models that differ in their structure and assumptions we specifically investigated the combined effects of these two stressors on fish biomasses at different trophic levels given recent empirical studies showing that the response of ecosystem indicators to individual stressors was dependent on the fishing strategy and history shannon et al 2014 it is critical to explore different fishing strategy scenarios when investigating the combined impacts of fishing and environment on ecosystems therefore ecosystem simulations in this study were carried out using different fishing strategies where either all trophic level all high trophic level htl or low trophic level ltl taxa i e species or groups were subjected to various levels of fishing mortality abiding by our new categorization of combined effects we specifically explored negative synergism and positively dampened effects and contrasted relative risks of these two effects between htl and ltl taxa in a meta analysis context koricheva et al 2013 these analyses aimed at enhancing our understanding of the combined effects of fishing and primary productivity and providing guidance for fisheries managers 2 materials and methods 2 1 ecosystem models nine ecosystems are represented using one of four different ecosystem modelling approaches fig 1 ecopath with ecosim ewe christensen and walters 2004 osmose shin and cury 2004 atlantis fulton et al 2004 and a size spectrum model blanchard et al 2014 five ecosystems were modelled with ewe the black sea akoglu 2013 the southern benguela shannon et al 2004 2008 smith et al 2011 the southern catalan sea coll et al 2006 coll et al 2013 the western scotian shelf araújo and bundy 2011 2012 and western scotland alexander et al 2015 osmose was used to model two ecosystems west coast canada fu et al 2013 and the west florida shelf grüss et al 2016 the southeastern australian ecosystem was modelled with atlantis fulton et al 2014 and the north sea was modelled with a size spectrum model blanchard et al 2014 all models used in the present study have been published and validated against observations of abundance biomass and or catch data 2 2 fishing strategies prior to simulation runs fishing mortality corresponding to the maximum sustainable yield fmsy was estimated in each ecosystem for each exploited taxon by reconstructing the yield to fishing mortality curve catch as a function of fishing mortality rate while holding the fishing mortality of all other taxa in the ecosystem constant at their respective current fishing mortality rates fcurr for each ecosystem we separated all taxa into two categories i e focus and non focus taxa with a focus taxon i being fished at f i λ f m s y i year 1 and a non focus taxon j being fished at its respective f c u r r j by varying the multiplier λ we implemented different levels of fishing mortality on focus taxa within each ecosystem we investigated three different fishing strategies an all trophic level f all strategy a high trophic level f htl strategy and a low trophic level f ltl strategy while the f all strategy represents broad scale exploitation where the focus taxa are all taxa retained in commercial or subsistence fisheries the f htl strategy focuses on predatory taxa which include large demersal and large pelagic taxa the f ltl strategy focuses on all forage taxa retained in commercial or subsistence fisheries here forage taxa are defined as pelagic taxa which as adults mainly feed on plankton phyto zoo or ichthyoplankton any pre recruit stages that are represented in the models are excluded from the fishing scenarios as are air breathing animals i e marine mammals marine turtles and seabirds for each fishing strategy we experimented with a range of multipliers λ 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 1 5 covering a representative range of the yield fishing mortality curve the multiplier approach allows comparability across ecosystems 2 3 primary productivity because physical drivers were not explicit in all ecosystem models we forced changes in phytoplankton biomass to represent changes in primary productivity one of the few aspects of environmental change that are comparable across all ecosystem models in ewe and osmose we forced phytoplankton biomass directly in the size spectrum model the plankton carrying capacity parameter was adjusted because plankton biomass emerges in this model rather than being set directly in atlantis nutrient inputs from point sources and upwelling were forced so that the resulting change in phytoplankton matched what would have occurred if the primary production had been forced directly we represented directional primary productivity change by simply applying a multiplier γ 0 85 0 9 0 95 1 1 05 1 1 directly to modelled phytoplankton biomass this range of variability encompasses the range of changes observed in the last decade in the ecosystems studied here boyce et al 2014 2 4 response variables in parallel to the trophic grouping used for the fishing strategies the response variables used here are the aggregated biomass of all htl or ltl taxa averaged over the last ten years of simulation after a spin up time that is specific to each model for each trophic taxa and each fishing strategy in an ecosystem we analyzed 36 scenarios 6 fmsy multipliers 6 multipliers of phytoplankton biomass the control scenario has both the fmsy and phytoplankton biomassmultipliers set to 1 with resultant biomass bc within each scenario k the relative change in biomass is calculated as δ b k c o m b k b c b c for the combined effects with both fishing and phytoplankton biomass varying simultaneously the relative biomass change for additive effects δ b k s e p is the sum of relative biomass change with each of the two factors varying independently while the other remains at its control level 2 5 types of combined effects and risk to characterize the types of effects resulting from the combination of fishing and phytoplankton biomass change we adopted the following definitions of the different types of combined effects with risk zones defined where combined effects result in lower fish biomass than expected under the assumption of additive effects the 1 1 line in fig 2 aside from additive effects 1 1 line the combined effects are as follows i when both δ b k c o m and δ b k s e p are positive in quadrant i if δ b k c o m δ b k s e p the combined effects are considered positive synergistic otherwise positive dampened while positive synergism results in higher fish biomass than expected under the assumption of additive effects positive dampened effect results in lower biomass thus constituting a risk ii when both δ b k c o m and δ b k s e p are negative in quadrant iii if δ b k c o m δ b k s e p the combined effects are considered negative synergistic otherwise negative dampened negative synergism exacerbates the reduction of fish biomass compared with the additive effects so it is considered a risk a negative dampened effect results in higher biomass than expected under additive effects iii in this study effects on fish biomass are categorized as antagonistic when the combined effects and the sum of separate effects have opposite directions of change in this sense the definition of antagonism is more specific than that used in other studies e g crain et al 2008 in the case where δ b k c o m 0 and δ b k s e p 0 in quadrant ii the combined effects are positive antagonistic otherwise negative antagonistic in quadrant iv since positive antagonism results in higher fish biomass than expected under additive effects there is no risk associated with it on the contrary negative antagonism falls within the risk area based on the types of combined effects defined above we assigned each scenario to one of the six categories positive synergism positive dampened positive antagonism negative synergism negative dampened and negative antagonism to report the frequency based on occurrence and intensity of each effect the intensity of an effect is represented by the absolute difference between δ b k c o m and δ b k s e p in order to reflect both occurrence and intensity of the combined effects weighted frequency i e frequency intensity is used for the following analyses 2 6 meta analysis while we appreciate that using statistics on model data breaks the fundamental assumption that the underlying model is unknown it is often still a useful approach for summarizing ecosystem model results moreover in this case a statistical approach is particularly appropriate as calculating the true underlying model across the entire ensemble of models is extremely difficult to compare combined effects of fishing and phytoplankton biomass change across ecosystems fishing strategies and trophic groups we adopt a meta analytic approach while traditional statistical reports include information on significance such as p value such values do not tell the size of a difference between two measures nor can it easily be compared across studies in contrast in any meta analysis the relevant results of each study are expressed in terms of an outcome measure putting the results on a common scale this common outcome measure is called the effect size and it is the magnitude of the effect size that is compared and combined across studies in this study the relative risk rr is used as the effect size we specifically aimed at comparing the rr between the ltl and htl groups to determine if these two trophic groups respond differently to the fishing and phytoplankton biomass changes explored and if they have different levels of ecological risk thereby requiring separate consideration treatment and advice in fisheries management we compared the nine ecosystems under the three fishing strategies the rr value is computed as rr p 1 p 2 for the first type of ecological risk negative synergism for instance p 1 is the proportion of negative synergism for the ltl group p 2 is the proportion for the htl group following the standard practice the statistical analysis was performed on the logarithms of the ratios since ln rr is nearly normal and the standard error of ln rr is estimated as s e 1 p 1 n 1 p 1 1 p 2 n 2 p 2 1 2 fleiss and berlin 2009 to summarize results from the nine ecosystems quantitatively we used a random effects model a full model without discriminating fishing strategies to determine the level of heterogeneity among the ecosystems that could be introduced by the different ecosystem structures and or different modelling approaches in addition a likelihood ratio test between the full model and a reduced model that included fishing strategy as a moderator was conducted to indicate if fishing strategy mattered to the results according to koricheva et al 2013 the random effects model can be written as θi ln rr ui where θi is the estimated effect size of the true effect size ln rr for ecosystem i and u i n 0 τ i 2 with τ 2 representing the amount of heterogeneity among the true effects if τ 2 0 then there is no heterogeneity among true effects i e θ 1 θ 2 θk θ so that ln rr θ denotes the true effect following raudenbush 2009 the best estimate of ln rr noted ln r ˆ r is the average of θi weighted by precision i e the reciprocals of the variance τ i 2 i e ln r ˆ r i 1 k θ i τ i 2 i 1 k 1 τ i 2 where i 1 k 1 τ i 2 1 is the variance the null hypothesis of homogeneity is tested using cochran s q test q i 1 k θ i ln r ˆ r 2 τ i 2 if the null hypothesis is rejected based on a given p value the extent of heterogeneity among the true effects is represented by the simple ratio h q k 1 under the null hypothesis of homogeneity h has an expected value of unity an h value of 2 implies that the variation in the estimated effect size θi is twice what would be expected under the null hypothesis the meta analysis was conducted using the metafor package viechtbauer 2010 3 results the combined effects of fishing and phytoplankton biomass change on fish biomass varied among the different trophic groups ltl htl and all within each ecosystem fig 3 in particular the most frequently occurring effect differed between htl and ltl groups in each ecosystem with only three exceptions the black sea where dampened effects occurred more frequently for both htl and ltl groups the southern catalan sea and the southern benguela where synergistic effects occurred more often across all the ecosystems the htl group was most likely subjected to dampened effects the ltl group on the other hand was more prone to synergistic effects the intensity of synergistic effects was generally larger than that of dampened effects fig 4 antagonistic effects particularly positive antagonism were the least frequent in our simulation experiments however the intensity of this effect tended to be larger than those from the synergistic and dampened effects fig 4 implying that when antagonism happens the resulting response of the fish community could be much larger than what would be expected under other types of combined effects because the different directions of the synergistic dampened and antagonistic effects have different ecological risks presenting different implications for fisheries management we organized the combined effects based on their risk or non risk feature with two exceptions west coast canada and western scotland all ecosystems either had more or less risky combined effects for both htl and ltl groups fig 5 the non risky combined effects i e positive synergism negatively dampened effects and positive antagonism were predominant for both htl and ltl groups in several ecosystems e g the north sea the southeastern australian ecosystem and the west florida shelf in contrast the risky combined effects i e negative synergism positively dampened effects and negative antagonism played important roles in some other ecosystems e g the black sea the southern catalan sea and the southern benguela in order to differentiate the different types of risky combined effects we contrasted the ltl and htl groups to determine how prone they were to each of the ecological risks within each ecosystem and under each fishing strategy most r ˆ r values of negative synergistic effects were at or above 1 fig 6 the r ˆ r value averaged over all ecosystems and fishing strategies was significantly greater than 1 with p 0 021 table 1 this suggested that the risk of a negative synergistic interaction between fishing and phytoplankton biomass change was significantly higher for the ltl group than for the htl group the p value for the likelihood ratio test between the full model shown in fig 6 and the reduced model was 0 939 indicating the conclusion drawn here was irrespective of fishing strategy the ratio of total heterogeneity to total variability was 53 table 1 indicating more than half of the variability was due to heterogeneity across the ecosystem simulation models the h value of 2 279 table 1 implied that the variation in r ˆ r was more than double of what would be expected under the null hypothesis of homogeneity in contrast most r ˆ r values of positive dampened effect were at or below 1 fig 7 the r ˆ r value averaged over all the ecosystems and fishing strategies was significantly less than 1 i e 0 752 with p 0 006 table 1 this suggested that the risk of positive dampened effects was lower for the ltl group than for the htl group the likelihood ratio test p 0 476 between the full model shown in fig 7 and the reduced model indicated that fishing strategy was not a factor affecting the conclusion drawn here the amount of heterogeneity was high 74 compared to the total variability again indicating significant heterogeneity across the ecosystem simulation models when we explored the risk of relative biomass change falling below the additive 1 1 line i e negative synergistic positive dampened and negative antagonistic effects the r ˆ r value averaged over all ecosystems and fishing strategies was 0 903 not significantly different from 1 at p value of 0 05 table 1 because the relative risk of negative synergism and that of positive dampened was opposite the combination of these two types of risk would not be significantly different between the htl and ltl groups in addition the fact that the r ˆ r value was slightly less than 1 could be solely a result of the southeastern australia ecosystem where the r ˆ r values were significantly less than 1 under all three fishing strategies fig 8 meaning for this ecosystem the risk of having detrimental combined effects for htl species was globally higher than for ltl species 4 discussion with the growing need to apply ecosystem based approaches to marine resource management research on cumulative impacts from multiple stressors has become a focal topic in marine science rosenberg and mcleod 2005 leslie and mcleod 2007 particularly under the current situation where both climate change and overfishing are affecting the productivity and structure of marine ecosystems at unprecedented rates kirby et al 2009 while interactions between fishery exploitation and environmental change may result from combinations of various environmental variables that operate through different pathways as an initial step we investigated variation in primary productivity as representing one aspect of environmental change our research employed a multi model ecosystem simulation approach to explore the combined effects of fishing and primary productivity on different components of the food web while combined effects of fishing and environmental change on fish communities have been investigated within a single ecosystem using a single ecosystem model griffith et al 2011 2012 travers trolet et al 2014 this research is the first to investigate the combined effects across a diverse series of marine ecosystems and models following the traditional classification of combined effects without considering the direction of change triggered we found that the htl group was most likely subjected to dampened effect and the ltl group to synergistic effect across all the ecosystems the least frequent combined effect was antagonism suggesting that whether adverse or positive effects of fishing and phytoplankton biomass change rarely cancel one another out since we classified as antagonistic effects only those cases where the combined effects and the separate effects occurred in opposite directions the result derived here concerning the frequency of antagonism is not comparable with previous studies e g crain et al 2008 rosenblatt and schmitz 2014 the infrequent occurrence of antagonism accompanied with its significantly larger intensity absolute difference between δ b k c o m and δ b k s e p could be related to ecological surprises reported in natural systems lindenmayer et al 2010 or particularly in marine ecosystems and fisheries management when the response of target populations to specific management measures such as rebuilding measures are contrary to predictions and counter intuitive pine et al 2009 our results suggest we could better understand ecological surprises if essential drivers are explicitly taken into account and the appropriate scenarios are tested with models incorporating those drivers managers are often bound to assess the consequences of ecological surprises a posteriori their capacity to be prepared for such events would increase if our capacity to predict those rare events is improved such efforts can forewarn managers about potential future states and rare events so managers can trigger appropriate management responses that are robust to such conditions across ecosystems and fishing strategies dampened effects were rather common although all previous research with the exception of travers trolet et al 2014 had classified this effect as antagonism because directional change had not been considered in earlier studies one example of such a dampening process is when the food web is under organizational control of key ltl taxa known as wasp waist control cury et al 2000 bakun 2006 in this case the availability of the ltl taxa may absorb the stressors and typically determines the fate of the predatory fish stocks in conjunction with the effects of fishing pressure upon them therefore any bottom up or top down cascading impact is likely to be dampened in the food web this is true even though the ltl taxa tend to be under heavy fisheries exploitation only when the impact of a driver is so strong that it undermines the resilience of the trophic groups do the combined effects appear to act synergistically on the ecosystem as evidenced by the infamous mnemiopsis anchovy shift in the black sea in 1989 akoglu et al 2014 or the shift from anchovy sardine to goby jellyfish in the northern benguela ecosystem heymans and tomczak 2016 in contrast to previous studies we explicitly considered the direction of the combined effects and specifically associated each direction dependent combined effect with ecological risk while the frequencies of the traditionally defined synergism dampened effects and antagonism in an ecosystem often display irregular patterns fig 3 the frequencies of risky and non risky combined effects tend to have similar patterns between the htl and ltl groups fig 5 implying if risky combined effects dominate for the htl group so do for the ltl group this indicates that it is useful to classify the combined effects according to the risk and non risk categories because this classification reveals an ecosystem s vulnerability to risks irrespective of the trophic groups examined therefore this classification boosts confidence in determining the risky business related to combined effects through specifically contrasting the ltl and htl groups in relation to a specific risky combined effect we obtained findings that have important implications for fisheries management first the risk of negative synergism is significantly higher for the ltl group than for the htl group whatever the fishing strategy considered this implies that following an increase of fishing pressure on a given ltl stock the subsequent decrease of biomass under low phytoplankton biomass will be higher than that expected if only the fishing driver is taken into account in the assessment second the risk of positive dampened effect is significantly higher for the htl group than for the ltl group whatever the fishing strategy considered this means that given a management measure for reducing the impact of fishing on htl stocks the subsequent rebuilding of these stocks will be slower than expected under an assessment taking into account the fishing driver only third the overall risk of relative biomass change falling below that expected under additive effects is not significantly different between the htl and ltl groups due to the fact that the relative risk of negative synergism and that of positively dampened effect cancel one another out this indicates the importance of differentiating the different types of risk when exploring the combined effects of multiple stressors in fisheries management in order to better understand triggers causing the risky combined effects i e negative synergism positively dampened effects and negative antagonism we further explored the occurrences of these risky combined effects over the multiplier spaces of fishing mortality and phytoplankton biomass under different fishing strategies see appendix b for more details as expected risky combined effects generally occur at low phytoplankton biomass and high fishing mortality however under fishing strategy f htl the all and ltl groups are more likely subject to negative synergism and positively dampened effects at low fishing mortality and low phytoplankton biomass this is likely due to the fact that lower fishing mortality on the htl group results in higher htl biomass and thus higher predation mortality on the ltl group such findings have been made possible by employing the ecosystem models that detail the dynamics of different trophic groups and fishing strategies at different trophic levels future research on the development and application of more scenarios of ecosystem dynamics and services using these ecosystem models across broad spatial scales will be beneficial for moving toward ecosystem based approaches to marine resource management aside from the general patterns across the ecosystems related to the combined effects understanding how the characteristics of the different ecosystems are related to combined effects is also beneficial we attempted to functionally link the obtained simulated patterns to features of ecosystem structure see appendix c for more details further research is warranted in order to achieve more definite conclusions overall meta analysis has allowed us to compare combined effects across different ecosystems through comparable simulation experiments with differences existing in both the ecosystem structure and model structure such comparison provides us with good opportunities to explore commonalities and divergences among various ecosystems both of which will lead to greater understanding of the combined effects however due to the small number of simulation scenarios the confidence intervals of the estimated relative risk figs 6 8 were rather wide future simulations and comparisons can be improved by implementing significantly more scenarios of interactions between fishing mortality and phytoplankton biomass change and by including a range of feasible parameterizations per model to capture ecological uncertainty around individual system function and responses the finding that more than half of the variability was due to heterogeneity across the ecosystem simulation models indicates that a broader scale of comparison is warranted in order to verify the conclusions drawn from this study future comparisons can be done within a single ecosystem but employing a variety of ecosystem models or across different ecosystems but using the same ecosystem model in order to address uncertainties in either ecosystem structure or model structure nevertheless the current study has taken a positive step forward by convening research scientists across different continents to carry out unified simulation experiments using existing modelling capacities future research will benefit from comparative modelling approaches running common scenarios and methods

25362,in conservation planning the data related to size growth and diffusion of populations is sparse hard to collect and unreliable at best if and when the data is readily available it is not of sufficient quantity to construct a probability distribution in such a scenario applying deterministic or stochastic approaches to the problems in conservation planning either ignores the uncertainty completely or assumes a distribution that does not accurately describe the nature of uncertainty to overcome these drawbacks we propose a robust optimization approach to problems in conservation planning that considers the uncertainty in data without making any assumption about its probability distribution we explore two of the basic formulations in conservation planning related to reserve selection and invasive species control to show the value of the proposed robust optimization several novel techniques are developed to compare the results produced by the proposed robust optimization approach and the existing deterministic approach for the case when the robust optimization approach fails to find a feasible solution a novel bi objective optimization technique is developed to handle infeasibility by modifying the level of uncertainty some numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in finding more applicable conservation planning strategies keywords conservation planning robust optimization invasion control reserve selection bi objective mixed integer linear programming 1 introduction conservation planning concerns itself with the issues related to maintaining and increasing biodiversity preserving biodiversity is crucial to human societies and the future of planet earth hence its slow erosion constitutes a threat as consequential as that posed by the climate change billionnet 2013 according the international union for conservation of nature 2017 about 24 000 species out of the 91 000 listed are threatened with extinction two of the key issues among others resulting in the loss of biodiversity as identified by the convention on biological diversity cbd are land fragmentation and invasive predators the alteration and loss of the habitats for many species is caused by rampant deforestation overpopulation agriculture and other economically beneficial land use alternatives polasky et al 2008 there is an abundant body of knowledge prescribing the creation of land reserves geographic regions designated for the preservation of biodiversity as a way to slow the process of habitat destruction and to protect threatened species from the processes that threaten their existence rodrigues et al 2004 due to limited monetary and land resources available for conservation and the difficulty of reversing land use decisions in the long term it is imperative that the reserve selection decision to be based on sound scientific evidence there is a long history of using optimization methods for reserve selection in assistance to the process of reserve selection haight et al 2000 polasky et al 2000 cabeza and moilanen 2001 revelle et al 2002 arthur et al 2002 costello and polasky 2004 more recently there has been a growing interest in solving problems of reserve design i e reserve selection with constraints on size shape connectivity compactness and species complementarity jafari et al 2017 beyer et al 2016 haight and snyder 2009 williams et al 2005 margules and pressey 2000 a brief review of the reserve selection literature and the issues therein is presented in section 3 another major threat to biodiversity and other ecosystem services is the introduction of invasive species pejchar and mooney 2009 for example doherty et al 2016 estimated that the invasions of mammalian species such as feral cats rodents and pigs were responsible for massive extinctions 738 vertebrate species and may have contributed to 58 of the cases of contemporary extinctions of birds mammals and reptiles once established it is very difficult and costly to fully eliminate an invasive species many mathematical optimization formulations have been presented to manage and control the spread of invasive species we present a brief review of these formulations in section 3 conservation planning also encompasses other problems besides the two we have mentioned above other authors have discussed the use of mathematical optimization to solve a variety of conservation problems billionnet 2013 however one crucial aspect that has not been sufficiently considered is the issue of noisy information for example due to imperfect detection of species during surveys williams et al 2005 in their seminal work on systematic conservation planning margules and pressey 2000 point out that conservation planning is riddled with uncertainty uncertainty pervades the use of biodiversity surrogates the setting of conservation targets decisions about which kinds of land tenure can be expected to contribute to targets and for which features and decisions about how best to locate design implement and manage new conservation areas in the face of limited resources competition for other uses and incursions from surrounding areas new developments in all the planning stages will progressively reduce but never eliminate these uncertainties they recommend that planners rather than proceeding as if certain must learn to deal explicitly with uncertainty in ways that minimize the chances of serious mistakes many problems in conservation planning require information about state variables e g species abundance occupancy rates that pertain to the dynamic of ecological systems e g population growth rate movement rate or conservation value of land parcels among other variables williams et al 2005 ignoring these potential sources of uncertainties may lead to bad decisions many studies have addressed these uncertainties with probabilistic and stochastic approaches these approaches although a big step up on the deterministic models do not handle the uncertainty sufficiently this is due to the fact that there are always certain inhibiting assumptions regarding the nature of the uncertainty in these methods more precisely due to sparsity of the data available it is overly optimistic to try and over fit this data into certain probability distributions to deal with the issue of uncertainty and the lack of sufficient probabilistic information there has long been a discussion of using robust optimization see for instance beyer et al 2016 but we were not able to find any study that exploits this technique in this paper we propose to use robust optimization for conservation planning and optimal control of invasive species since robust optimization bertsimas and sim 2004 ben tal et al 2009 accounts for the worst case scenarios it ensures that the problem is tractable and near optimal in the face of large uncertainty when using the robust approach the decision maker will know the quantum of parametric uncertainty they are protected against when they deploy the decisions and policies recommended by the robust counterpart of a formulation in this paper we also show another crucial value of the robust optimization for some conservation problems if the uncertainty is very large it may be infeasible to find a solution that meets a budget constraint a crucial question then arises if we are unable to address all the uncertainty using the current resources where can we best expend these resources for improving our data gathering efforts in order to reduce the quantum of uncertainty as much as possible we have developed a bi objective optimization approach that addresses this question our approach gives managers the possibility to visualize how much uncertainty can be addressed for a given budget and provides a prescriptive set of recommendations about where to focus their data gathering efforts as we show in section 5 this knowledge can have profound policy implications we come up with a novel bi objective optimization formulation to model this approach and develop it further this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the robust optimization approach that we have used in section 3 we review existing basic optimization formulations developed for two fundamental problems in conservation planning in sections 4 and 5 we introduce a robust optimization approach for the invasive control problem and the reserve selection problem respectively and present some numerical experiments finally in section 6 we state our concluding remarks 2 preliminaries robust optimization robust optimization is a principal method to address data uncertainty in mathematical programming formulations this method has been successfully applied to solve many problems under uncertainty when the exact distribution for the data is unknown or difficult to determine or otherwise using stochastic optimization techniques is computationally impractical in general robust optimization is a conservative approach that seeks to protect the decision maker against the worst realizations of outcomes the focus of this study is the robust optimization technique developed by bertsimas and sim 2004 since it allows for controlling the degree of conservatism of the solution let c be an n vector a be an m n matrix and b be an m vector the deterministic optimization formulations in this study are in the form of mixed integer linear programs i e min c x s t a x b x 0 x i ℤ for i 1 n 1 where x is the vector of variables containing n 1 number of integer variables and n 2 number of continuous variables note that n n 1 n 2 also all coefficients are rational i e a ℚ m n b ℚ m and c ℚ n in all proposed formulations in this study the data uncertainty affects only the elements of the matrix a to avoid any unnecessary confusion we next explain a customized version of the robust optimization technique developed by bertsimas and sim 2004 that works on this specific class of optimization problems we do not make any assumption about the exact distribution of each entry a ij of the matrix a however it is assumed that reasonable estimates for the mean value of the coefficient a ij and its range a ˆ ij are available in other words we assume that each entry a ij takes value in a ij a ˆ ij a ij a ˆ ij note that a ˆ ij can be equal to 0 for each row i 1 m of the matrix a we introduce a number γ i defined by users to adjust the the required level of conservatism in the proposed robust optimization formulation this number simply imposes an upper bound on the number of entries of row i of the matrix a that can reach their worst case values given that ax b and all variables are non negative the worst case value for the entry a ij of the matrix a is a ij a ˆ ij so higher the value of γ i higher the degree of conservatism the parameter γ i can only take values in the interval 0 j i where j i j a ˆ ij 0 we assume that if γ i ℤ then at most γ i number of entries of row i of the matrix a can reach their worst case values i e a ij a ˆ ij one other entry r i can reach the value of a ij γ i γ i a ˆ ij in simpler terms if there are one hundred entries in a row i of matrix a and the corresponding γ i value is 50 7 then 50 entries of row i of matrix a can reach their worst case values of a ij a ˆ ij and one other entry will reach the value of a ij 0 7 a ˆ ij the robust optimization formulation that seeks to conduct the optimization against the worst case scenario under these stated assumptions can be presented as follows min c x s t j 1 n a ij x j max s i r i s i j i s i γ i r i j i s i j s i a ˆ ij x j γ i γ i a ˆ ir i x r i b i for i 1 m x 0 x i ℤ for i 1 n 1 it can be shown that this formulation has the following equivalent mixed integer linear programming formulation bertsimas and sim 2004 min c x s t j 1 n a ij x j z i γ i j j i p ij b i for i 1 m z i p ij a ˆ ij x j for i 1 m and j j i p ij 0 for i 1 m and j j i z i 0 for i 1 m x 0 x i ℤ for i 1 n 1 in this study we call this formulation the robust counterpart formulation 3 optimization models in conservation planning as mentioned in the introduction optimization methods have been used in conservation problems including reserve selection reserve design landscape fragmentation forest management control of invasive species protection of genetic diversity and wildfire control billionnet 2013 we illustrate the benefits of robust optimization methods for conservation with the two types of problems that we introduced earlier reserve selection and control of invasive species 3 1 control of invasive species spatial and temporal control of invasive species is an important problem in conservation planning the simplest deterministic formulation for containing the spread of an alien invader was presented by hof 1998 they divide the land under consideration into m identical square parcels the invading species grows by a constant rate g every time period once a control action is implemented in a parcel i the invader is supposed to be completely eliminated there is also some diffusion or spread of the species to parcel i from parcel j table 1 shows the mathematical notation used in this basic deterministic formulation the formulation presented by hof 1998 can be represented as follows 1 d 1 min i 1 m t 1 t v it 2 i 1 m x it u for i 1 t 3 v i 0 a i for i 1 m 4 v it b it t 1 t x ik j 1 m p ji 1 g v jt 1 for i 1 m and t 1 t 5 v it 0 for i 1 m and t 1 t 6 x it 0 1 for i 1 m and t 1 t the objective function minimizes the population size of the invasive species on all parcels during a planning horizon with t time steps constraint 2 guarantees that the number of parcels treated in each time period is not greater than the imposed upper bound i e u constraint 3 gives us the initial species population at each parcel at the beginning of first period finally constraint 4 simply captures the population size of invasive species in each parcel at the beginning of each time period given the previous period s population v jt 1 in all parcels the growth rate g and the inter parcel diffusion rates p ji the next period s population for a particular parcel i will be v it when no control action is taken x it 0 however if a control action is taken x it 1 then for a sufficiently large b it v it becomes zero we assume that b it is sufficiently large i e regardless of the value of v jt 1 j we must have that b it j 1 m p ji 1 g v jt 1 therefore the value of b it can be computed recursively by using b it j 1 m p ji 1 g b jt 1 and b i0 a i in light of this observation the objective function and constraint 4 together imply that v it 0 if parcel i is treated in or before time period t and v it j 1 m p ji 1 g v jt 1 otherwise hence implicitly treating a parcel more than once is unnecessary in this formulation in practice it is computationally advantageous to add the following valid inequalities to the formulation 7 t 1 t x it 1 for i 1 m note that these valid inequalities are not part of the original formulation introduced by hof 1998 however we decide to use them since in practice we have observed that they can reduce the solution time by a factor of around two next we briefly review some of the more advanced formulations the formulation we presented thus far is one of the oldest and most basic formulations while we briefly describe some more sophisticated models here it is important to note that robust optimization techniques presented in this paper can be applied to any deterministic formulation in order to incorporate uncertainty our choice of the most basic formulation does not imply an acceptance of all simplifying assumptions therein others have since come up with more realistic models of invasion control that consider a different set of assumptions on growth diffusion and control of an invasive species büyüktahtakın et al 2011 büyüktahtakın et al 2014 büyüktahtakın et al 2015 are examples of a series of more incrementally sophisticated models as their objective they attempt to reduce the damage to multiple resources in a single and multi objective setting they also consider logistic growth as opposed to linear growth hof 1998 has considered their formulation also considers different kill rates depending on the critical population density in a parcel as opposed to 100 kill rate assumed by hof 1998 in one of the models they consider an age structured approach to take into account the biological dynamics of the population according to the authors the large size of the dynamic problem and the nonlinearity make the application of direct optimization methods impossible instead they analyze and compare the most frequently suggested strategies and their consequences epanchin niell and wilen 2012 present a temporally and spatially explicit formulation of the spread of invasive species their mixed integer linear programming milp formulation considers binary decisions related to clearing of patches and controlling the spread of species across patch boundaries they minimize the present value of the sum of control costs and invasion damages across space and time another simple linear programming based approach to invasion control is proposed by hastings et al 2006 they consider a linear age or stage structured population of the invader at different stages age the invader has different growth survival rates and fecundity the issue of uncertainty has also been considered in many recent studies in summary the formulations with uncertainty fall into two categories models that consider stochasticity in some parameters and formulations that consider lack of information about some parameters the point of introduction growth diffusion response to control and the harmful impacts of an invasion can all be stochastic processes the data on these process for a new invader can be sparse and hence it is often difficult to construct representative probability distributions although some recent work has been done in this area guisan et al 2013 elith 2015 uden et al 2015 the optimization formulations also contain parameters whose values for a particular application are simply not known and their estimation remains difficult especially before or early in an invasion even during the invasion accurate detection and measurement of invasions is difficult these multiple uncertainties are an impediment to devising optimal control policies or evaluating their impacts the approaches that have been tried so far include stochastic dynamic programming kotani et al 2011 information gap theory carrasco et al 2010 learning models eiswerth and van kooten 2007 partially observable markov decision processes haight and polasky 2010 rout et al 2014 and bayesian analysis cook et al 2007 for an exhaustive review of the work that considers uncertainty in invasion control we refer the readers to the review paper by epanchin niell and hastings 2010 3 2 reserve selection problem the reserve selection problem is another well studied problem in conservation planning literature the problem consists in selecting a proportion of a given geographic area for the purposes of conserving a given species or a set of species it is oftentimes prohibitive to earmark a very large geographic area for species conservation because of opportunity costs associated with alternative high economic value land use multiple variations on the basic reserve selection problem have been presented over the years for a more exhaustive review of the science of reserve selection readers can refer to williams et al 2005 haight and snyder 2009 billionnet 2013 beyer et al 2016 in our paper we use the basic reserve selection formulation presented in beyer et al 2016 there is a cost associated with the selection of each reserve and each reserve contributes to the conservation of species of interest the optimization procedure selects parcels of land so as to minimize the cost while achieving some explicit target conservation values for each species table 2 details the mathematical notation used in the basic deterministic reserve selection formulation we divided the land under consideration into m parcels if the conservation targets for species k 1 k were achieved the parcels were assumed to be conserved the formulation presented by beyer et al 2016 can be represented as follows 8 d 2 min i 1 m c i x i 9 i 1 m w ik x i w k for k 1 k 10 x i 0 1 for i 1 m the objective function minimizes the total cost of conservation constraint 9 ensures that the target conservation value for each species is achieved next we explain some fundamental features of the reserve selection problem and the existing formulations for this problem in the literature in all existing formulations the area under consideration is divided into parcels of land one or more species can be considered for conservation the decision of reserve selection can be single period or a multi period dynamic decision costello and polasky 2004 snyder et al 2005 tóth et al 2011 strange et al 2006 in the basic deterministic version of the problem there is a cost of selecting a parcel of land more elaborate approaches to determine cost consider sophisticated economic models to get a more complete picture of these costs polasky et al 2008 tóth et al 2011 besides the cost or the number of reserves other objectives like species or genetic diversity can also be considered cabeza and moilanen 2001 some researchers have used multiobjective optimization to handle more than one objective functions together memtsas 2003 snyder et al 2004 all existing formulations contain parameters related to the target value of conservation to be achieved for each species under consideration and the contribution of each parcel to the species conservation in the more basic formulations contribution was modeled through binary parameters representing presence absence of the species for each parcel and the target was to make sure that each species is represented in the optimal choice of parcels revelle et al 2002 other more advanced formulations use some geographical ecological or biological surrogates and or some survey or sightings data alongside statistical modeling margules and pressey 2000 austin 2002 to come up with estimates of spatial species distribution almost all formulations consider constraints to ensure some sort of spatial arrangement of parcels this is done to achieve connectivity contiguity compactness shape size or certain boundary or buffer zone requirements for the reserve williams et al 2005 westphal et al 2007 jafari and hearne 2013 wang and önal 2015 beyer et al 2016 many existing formulations consider uncertainty related to one or more of the parameters described above probabilistic reserve selection formulations assign probabilities to species presence rather than using a binary variable for presence 1 and absence 0 these formulations either maximize the expected coverage expected coverage approach polasky et al 2000 or the number of species covered where a species is considered covered if its cumulative presence probability exceeds a predetermined threshold threshold approach there are no formulations however that consider the parametric uncertainty related to value of each parcel to each species or the cost of acquiring a parcel of land in the formulation we have presented haight et al 2000 arthur et al 2002 some recent review papers for instance billionnet 2013 and beyer et al 2016 emphasize the necessity of dealing with uncertainty related to these parameters they recommend robust optimization approaches to account for this parametric uncertainty despite its great potential robust optimization has been under utilized to address problems of conservation and natural resource management 4 a robust optimization approach for the invasion control problem in this section we consider the basic deterministic formulation by hof 1998 i e d1 and incorporate uncertainty in some parameters through the robust optimization approach presented in section 2 more precisely we assume that all parameters of d1 are known with certainty except the diffusion rate p ji we assume that p ji p ji p ˆ ji p ji p ˆ ji and p ˆ ji 0 i e we consider a range uncertainty in diffusion rates where the size of uncertainty is determined by p ˆ ji we denote the robust counterpart formulation of d1 with r1 this formulation can be easily constructed using the techniques developed in section 2 interested readers can find r1 in appendix a 4 1 numerical experiments to compare the performance of d1 and r1 a random instance is generated by setting m 40 t 5 u 2 and r 0 05 in this section we randomly chose a geographical region in central florida and divide it into m equal parcels the value of a i for each i 1 m is generated randomly from 25 25 we set negative values to zero the value of diffusion rate p ji is considered to be inversely proportional to the square of euclidean distance between the parcels j and i i e p ji 1 d ji 2 let α β 0 be two user defined parameters we assume that p ˆ ji β p ji and γ i t α m thus α and β control the level of uncertainty to be considered by modifying the range of uncertainty or the number of uncertain parameters it is worth mentioning that to compare r1 and d1 we assume that p ji p ji in d1 i e the half value p ˆ ji is zero next we conduct a set of experiments on the generated instance by choosing different values for α and β it is recognized that the robust counterparts of the original deterministic formulations retain the benefit of lp linear programming and milp mixed integer linear programming frameworks and are known to be computationally tractable and scalable if the original problem is also tractable and scalable however it is important to note that any robust milp model is only as good as the original deterministic milp formulation that it originated from the deterministic invasion control problem by hof 1998 presented here is dynamic in time and contains a large number parameter b it as a big m in a formulation to prevent infeasibility the value of b it needs to be iteratively determined as a result the original formulation is very difficult to scale and has a huge room for improvement we have added a valid inequality in 7 and also defined a method of determining b it values iteratively in proposition 1 to prevent infeasibility the basic deterministic model d1 and the robust model r1 take a large amount of time to solve to optimality as the size of the problem increases in table 3 we report the time it takes to solve the problem instances of different sizes for d1 and r1 all the numerical experiments were done on a machine with 3 60 ghz cpu clock speed 16 gb ram and 64 bit windows 8 operating system the models d1 and r1 were solved using the java api of cplex v12 4 optimality gap was set at 2 5 we first note that solving d1 and r1 usually results in markedly different solutions and objective values the objective function for both formulations is the total presence of the invasive species over all parcels of land and all time periods however the robust counterpart formulation r1 cannot possibly achieve an objective value less than that of the deterministic formulation d1 due to increased diffusion rates caused by considering uncertainty observe that the main decision variables of the problem are x it for i 1 m and t 1 t and they indicate whether a parcel i is selected for treatment in a time period t or not we can easily plot the optimal values of these variables produced by d1 and r1 an illustration of this observation when α 0 3 and β 0 05 can be found in fig 1 in which each cell represents x it and it is hatched filled only if x it 1 as expected the recommended values generated by d1 and r1 are different since optimal solutions of r1 and d1 may differ significantly and since their respective objective function values cannot be fairly compared due to increased diffusion rates in r1 we introduce a few techniques to be able to compare the solutions and show the value of robust optimization since the main decision variables of the problem are x it let x d and x r be the optimal value vectors of these decision variables produced by solving d1 and r1 respectively furthermore for a given x we define d x as the optimal objective value of d1 when we set x it x it in d1 similarly for a given x we define r x as the optimal objective value of r1 when we set x it x it in r1 using these definitions four values can be computed d x d this is the objective value that is reached when we implement the deterministic decision x d made on assumptions of zero uncertainty to a deterministic setting if our assumption about zero uncertainty was indeed correct then implementing the deterministic decision represents the best case scenario for the decision maker d x r this is the objective value that is reached if we implement x r i e the robust decision made on assumptions of worst case scenario to a deterministic setting we may incur some extra cost in the process for being over prepared and making wrong assumptions about uncertainty r x r this is the objective value we get if we choose to implement x r the robust decision made on assumptions of worst case scenario to a non deterministic or uncertain setting in this case we are well equipped to handle this uncertainty since we prepared for it beforehand r x d this is the objective value we achieve if we use x d i e the deterministic decision to a non deterministic or uncertain setting this situation represents the worst case scenario for the decision maker since they get penalized for being unprepared and making wrong assumptions about uncertainty it can be easily shown that d x d d x r r x r r x d in other words using x r results in less fluctuations in the objective value if realizations of data different than those anticipated arise in practice to illustrate this observation we assume that β 0 5 1 2 and α 0 25 0 5 0 75 and run a small set of nine experiments by applying different combinations for values of α and β larger values of α and β represent larger quantum of uncertainty by varying these coefficients we are simply varying the quantum of uncertainty we consider experiments 1 2 9 are defined to be precisely β 0 5 α 0 25 β 0 5 α 0 5 β 2 α 0 75 the scaled results are reported in fig 2 in which the vertical axis shows the ratio i e d x d r x d d x r r x d r x r r x d and r x d r x d and the horizontal axis shows the experiment number observe that d x d r x d d x r r x d in fact d x d r x d is slightly better smaller than d x r r x d in all experiments this implies that x r is almost optimal for d1 so if we prepare for uncertainty by implementing the robust decision x r but the worse case scenario as defined by the robust optimization formulation does not arise in reality we almost lose nothing also observe that r x r r x d is up to 14 better smaller than r x d r x d this implies that if the worse case scenario as defined by the robust optimization formulation arises then we are up to 14 better off by using x r simply put we are better able to handle uncertainty if we have prepared for it beforehand these two observations clearly illustrate the value of the proposed robust optimization and the fact that x r is a better choice in practice of course these experiments can be repeated with similar results for any size of the problem and any set of parameters α and β finally as enunciated earlier the assumption of uncertainty and the robust formulation used to handle it also impacts the gist of managerial decision making by prescribing to treat different parcels of land in different time periods i e choosing different x it variables to be 1 as compared with those suggested by the deterministic formulation 5 a robust optimization approach for the reserve selection problem in this section the robust counterpart formulation of the basic reserve selection problem beyer et al 2016 explained in section 5 is developed we assume that the cost coefficients for parcels i e c i for i 1 m and the target values for species w k for k 1 k are known with certainty note that this assumption may often be reasonable because the cost can be approximated using a range of values from alternative economic models and the species conservation target can be elicited from stakeholders the parameters w ik represent the contribution of parcel i to species k and are considered to be uncertain these values often depend on a number of biological factors and therefore need thorough examination of the ecological characteristics of a certain parcel of land the estimates for these biological factors are prone to estimation errors and changes over time more specifically we assume that w ik w ik w ˆ ik w ik w ˆ ik and w ˆ ik 0 i e we consider a range uncertainty in contribution values where the size of uncertainty is determined by w ˆ ik we denote the robust counterpart formulation of d2 with r2 this formulation can be easily constructed using the techniques developed in section 2 interested readers can find r2 in appendix b 5 1 numerical experiments the goal of this section is to compare the performance of d2 and r2 we evaluated the performance of d2 and r2 with simulated data the simulated data are generated by setting m 40 and k 5 also c i for i 1 m are randomly generated by using the discrete uniform distribution in the interval 100 1000 furthermore w ik values are randomly drawn from the normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 5 values less than zero are truncated to zero this implies that on average 50 of the parcels do not contribute to the conservation of a particular species we also set w k 0 5 i 1 m w ik let α β 0 be two user defined parameters we assume that w ˆ ik β w ik and γ k αm it is worth mentioning that to compare r2 and d2 we assume that w ik w ik in d2 next we conduct some experiments on the simulated data by choosing different values for α and β all the numerical experiments were done on a machine with 3 60ghz cpu clock speed 16 gb ram and 64 bit windows 8 operating system the models d2 r2 and r3 were solved using the java api of cplex v12 4 optimality gap was set at 2 5 although we present the results for 40 parcels for reader s convenience and consistency across the paper we ran a series of experiments with larger number of parcels to see how the deterministic and the robust models scale with the problem size we ran our models with number of parcels equal to 100 500 1000 5000 and 10 000 and reported and compared the run times for the deterministic and robust models d2 and r2 respectively we also ran r3 with larger size of instances we ran a set of experiments with number of parcels equal to 50 100 and 200 as the model r3 contains linearization constraints to replace the bilinear terms and also involves finding the full non dominated frontier consisting of hundreds of points we were unable to solve the problem with number of parcels larger than 200 in a reasonable amount of time we report these run time results in tables 4 and 5 in rest of this section we assume that d2 is always feasible but we make no such assumption about r2 we first note that to compare d2 and r2 we cannot use the same technique developed in section 4 1 because this problem has only one type of decision variables and so the solution corresponding to d2 is unlikely to be feasible for r2 this implies that using the solution of the deterministic formulation would be a poor choice because under the worst case scenario as defined by the robust optimization formulation the deterministic solution fails to satisfy the target values for species of interest based on this observation one may be tempted to make the determination to always use the robust optimization formulation r2 because it is always feasible however as we subsequently explain that is not necessarily the case in general the structure of r2 is such that it is quite possible to increase the degree of uncertainty in r2 to such an extent so as to render the problem infeasible although using the optimal solution obtained by d2 does not seem to be a good choice at the same time however employing r2 as currently defined may not be a good option either as the issue of possible infeasibility persists consequently we need to revise r2 in order to ensure that the revised formulation is always feasible if d2 is feasible we revised r2 by adding a second objective to the problem in addition to the total conservation cost to measure the total infeasibility of the robust formulation it is worth mentioning that the total infeasibility can be interpreted as the amount of decrease in the uncertainty ranges in order to make the robust counterpart formulation feasible we denote the revised formulation by r3 it is worth mentioning that r3 can be easily written as a bi objective mixed integer linear program bomilp by using a few linearization techniques in bi objective optimization the goal is to compute the nondominated frontier or simply the set of all nondominated points these points are the projection image of pareto optimal solutions in the objective space interested readers can find r3 and its linearization process in appendix c we use the ϵ constraint method to solve the bomilp corresponding to r3 for β 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 8 1 6 and α 0 25 0 5 figs 3 and 4 show the exact nondominated frontier of the problem for different values of β when α 0 25 and α 0 5 respectively we next make a few observations about these figures intuitively it can be seen that the upper left and lower right endpoints of each nondominated frontier provide information about d2 and r2 respectively more specifically the upper left point shows the infeasibility of the optimal solution obtained with d2 under the worst case scenario for this solution all the uncertainty is unaddressed and total infeasibility is maximum possible it also shows the optimal cost of conservation by allowing r3 to handle this amount of infeasibility when the worst case scenario arises similarly the lower right endpoint shows the total infeasibility of r2 and the optimal cost of conservation by allowing r3 to handle this amount of infeasibility for a fixed α and β the decision maker s can visualize the nondominated frontier and choose a desirable point obviously choosing a point closer to the lower right corner indicates that the decision makers adopt a more conservative or risk averse approach since the lower right point represents the total infeasibility of r2 for a fixed α the nondominated frontier shifts upward i e the value of infeasibility increases as β increases and it converges towards a plateau this is not surprising because as β increases the uncertainty goes up indeed increasing β adds more uncertainty to the problem we observe that it is possible that the nondominated frontier becomes so flat that eventually reduces to a single point see for instance β 1 6 and α 0 5 note that this is also true for the other extreme case representing very small or no uncertainty if the uncertainty is very small then it is expected that the nondominated frontier would become so steep that it would eventually reduce to a single point these observations imply that for the formulation of the reserve selection problem explored in this study the decision makers would not gain much by trying to handle a large amount of uncertainty using the proposed robust optimization technique at higher values of assumed uncertainty the nondominated frontier may become so flat that to improve the infeasibility by small amount we need to increase the conservation cost significantly similarly if the assumed uncertainty is very small the robust optimization technique is almost equivalent to the deterministic formulation even in this extreme case using the robust optimization approach is not particularly helpful nevertheless for a reasonable amount of uncertainty using the proposed robust optimization approach seems to be quite helpful for instance the nondominated frontiers of the problem when β 0 2 β 0 4 or β 0 8 and when α 0 25 or α 0 5 in figs 3 and 4 seem very promising since the lower right endpoint of these nondominated frontiers has the total infeasibility value of zero but the upper left point has a significant total infeasibility value also observe that since these curves are generally steeper i e we have significant gains on infeasibility without losing much on the conservation cost the decision maker can genuinely achieve a trade off between his competing objectives by choosing a suitable point on these nondominated frontiers another crucial information that r3 can provide us is the optimal values of variables ϵ ik these values represent the portion of w ˆ ik that remained unaddressed these values can indicate to a decision maker where to concentrate their data gathering efforts in order to minimize the unaddressed uncertainty as defined by the second objective function in r3 especially in a situation when the budget for such efforts is limited 6 conclusion many conservation problems involve a lot of uncertainty which may not always be captured with probability distributions in this study we explored the idea of applying robust optimization techniques for solving conservation problems while accounting for high levels of uncertainty to the best of our knowledge this is the first study in applying a robust optimization approach in conservation planning problems we illustrated our proposed approach with two types of problems the invasion control problem and the reserve selection problem more importantly we developed novel techniques to compare the results obtained by the proposed robust optimization approach and the corresponding deterministic formulation we hope that the applicability versatility and performance of our approach encourages practitioners and researchers to implement it to address important issues in natural resource management and conservation acknowledgement the authors are grateful to nahid jafari for stimulating conversations about the use of robust optimization for conservation planning the authors are also thankful to julien martin from u s geological survey for helpful discussions the views and opinions expressed in this manuscript however are solely those of the authors appendix a robust formulation of d1 based on our discussion in section 2 it is easy to show that the robust counterpart formulation of d1 can be stated as 11 r 1 min i 1 m t 1 t v it 12 i 1 m x it u for i 1 t 13 v i 0 a i for i 1 m 14 v it b it t 1 t x ik j 1 m p ji 1 g v jt 1 z it γ i t j 1 m q jit for i 1 m and t 1 t 15 z it q

i 1 m and t 1 t is a user defined parameter showing the level of conservatism in constraint 14 note that we assume that b it is sufficiently large i e regardless of the value of v jt 1 z it and q ijt for j 1 m j 1 m and t 1 t we must have that b it j 1 m p ji 1 g v jt 1 z it γ i t j 1 m q jit therefore the value of b it should be computed differently in r1 this can be done using the following proposition proposition 1 let u i t 1 u i t 1 1 u i t 1 2 u i t 1 m such that u i t 1 j p ˆ ji 1 g b j t 1 for i 1 m and t 1 t also let u i t 1 j be the j th largest component of ui t 1 for each i 1 m and t 1 t b it can be computed recursively by using b it j 1 m p ji 1 g b jt 1 j 1 γ i t u it 1 j γ i t γ i t u i t 1 γ i t and b i0 a i proof we first note that based on the discussion given in section 2 r1 is equivalent to 20 min i 1 m t 1 t v it 21 i 1 m x it u for i 1 t 22 v i 0 a i for i 1 m 23 v it b it t 1 t x ik j 1 m p ji 1 g v jt 1 max s i t r it s i t j i t s i t γ i t r it j i t s

is sufficiently large if regardless of the value of v jt 1 for j 1 m we have that b it j 1 m p ji 1 g v jt 1 max s i t r it s i t j i t s i t γ i t r it j i t s i t j s i t p ˆ ji 1 g v jt 1 γ i t γ i

i t 1 γ i t for i 1 m and t 1 t so the result follows appendix b robust formulation of d2 based on our discussion in section 2 it is easy to show that the robust counterpart formulation of d2 can be stated as 26 r 2 min i 1 m c i x i 27 i 1 m w ik x i z k γ k i 1 m q ik w k for k 1 k 28 z k q ik w ˆ ik x i for i 1 m and k 1 k 29 q ik 0 for i 1 m and k 1 k 30 z k 0 for k 1 k 31 x i 0 1 for i 1 m where γ k for k 1 k is a user defined parameter showing the level of conservatism in constraint 27 appendix c revised robust formulation of d2 it is evident from constraint 27 that the term z k γ k i 1 m q ik cannot take a positive value and so it can force more x i to take the value of 1 in comparison to d2 however this in itself can force the value of z k γ k i 1 m q ik to become even more negative due to constraint 28 thus it is possible for r2 to be infeasible the higher the degree of uncertainty in r2 i e larger the values of w ˆ ik and γ k for i 1 m and k 1 k larger the probability of this outcome arising so to deal with infeasibility of r2 we propose a revised formulation as follows 32 r 3 min i 1 m c i x i 33 min i 1 m k 1 k ϵ ik 34 i 1 m w ik x i z k γ k i 1 m q ik w k for k 1 k 35 z k q ik w ˆ ik ϵ ik x i for i 1 m and k 1 k 36 0 ϵ ik w ˆ ik for i 1 m and k 1 k 37 q ik 0 for i 1 m and k 1 k 38 z k 0 for k 1 k 39 x i 0 1 for i 1 m where ϵ ik is a new continuous variable that is introduced in order to revise reduce the value of w ˆ ik for i 1 m and k 1 k this can be observed from constraints 35 and 36 in consequence the new objective function i 1 m k 1 k ϵ ik simply measures the infeasibility of r2 with respect to the value of w ˆ ik for i 1 m and k 1 k to understand the formulation better we now explore two extreme cases in the first case we suppose that ϵ ik 0 for i 1 m and k 1 k in such a scenario r3 is precisely equivalent to r2 now in the second case let us suppose that ϵ ik w ik for i 1 m and k 1 k in this case the optimal solution of d2 is also optimal for r3 because we now have the option to set z k 0 and q ik 0 for i 1 m and k 1 k so this formulation captures the essence of both d2 and r2 and it is guaranteed to be feasible since we assume that d2 is feasible note that solving this bi objective optimization problem returns the trade off between the total cost of conservation i e the first objective function and the total infeasibility i e the second objective function however the proposed formulation is not linear in order to linearize it a new non negative variable ϵ ˆ ik can be introduced to capture the value of the bilinear term ϵ ik x j for i 1 m and k 1 k and then constraint 35 can be replaced by the following constraints 40 z k q ik w ˆ ik x i ϵ ˆ ik for i 1 m and k 1 k 41 ϵ ˆ ik ϵ ik for i 1 m and k 1 k 42 ϵ ˆ ik w ˆ ik x i for i 1 m and k 1 k 43 ϵ ˆ ik ϵ ik w ˆ ik x i w ˆ ik for i 1 m and k 1 k 44 ϵ ˆ ik 0 for i 1 m and k 1 k this linearization is valid since if x i 1 then ϵ ˆ ik ϵ ik and if x i 0 then ϵ ˆ ik 0 for i 1 m and k 1 k 
25362,in conservation planning the data related to size growth and diffusion of populations is sparse hard to collect and unreliable at best if and when the data is readily available it is not of sufficient quantity to construct a probability distribution in such a scenario applying deterministic or stochastic approaches to the problems in conservation planning either ignores the uncertainty completely or assumes a distribution that does not accurately describe the nature of uncertainty to overcome these drawbacks we propose a robust optimization approach to problems in conservation planning that considers the uncertainty in data without making any assumption about its probability distribution we explore two of the basic formulations in conservation planning related to reserve selection and invasive species control to show the value of the proposed robust optimization several novel techniques are developed to compare the results produced by the proposed robust optimization approach and the existing deterministic approach for the case when the robust optimization approach fails to find a feasible solution a novel bi objective optimization technique is developed to handle infeasibility by modifying the level of uncertainty some numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in finding more applicable conservation planning strategies keywords conservation planning robust optimization invasion control reserve selection bi objective mixed integer linear programming 1 introduction conservation planning concerns itself with the issues related to maintaining and increasing biodiversity preserving biodiversity is crucial to human societies and the future of planet earth hence its slow erosion constitutes a threat as consequential as that posed by the climate change billionnet 2013 according the international union for conservation of nature 2017 about 24 000 species out of the 91 000 listed are threatened with extinction two of the key issues among others resulting in the loss of biodiversity as identified by the convention on biological diversity cbd are land fragmentation and invasive predators the alteration and loss of the habitats for many species is caused by rampant deforestation overpopulation agriculture and other economically beneficial land use alternatives polasky et al 2008 there is an abundant body of knowledge prescribing the creation of land reserves geographic regions designated for the preservation of biodiversity as a way to slow the process of habitat destruction and to protect threatened species from the processes that threaten their existence rodrigues et al 2004 due to limited monetary and land resources available for conservation and the difficulty of reversing land use decisions in the long term it is imperative that the reserve selection decision to be based on sound scientific evidence there is a long history of using optimization methods for reserve selection in assistance to the process of reserve selection haight et al 2000 polasky et al 2000 cabeza and moilanen 2001 revelle et al 2002 arthur et al 2002 costello and polasky 2004 more recently there has been a growing interest in solving problems of reserve design i e reserve selection with constraints on size shape connectivity compactness and species complementarity jafari et al 2017 beyer et al 2016 haight and snyder 2009 williams et al 2005 margules and pressey 2000 a brief review of the reserve selection literature and the issues therein is presented in section 3 another major threat to biodiversity and other ecosystem services is the introduction of invasive species pejchar and mooney 2009 for example doherty et al 2016 estimated that the invasions of mammalian species such as feral cats rodents and pigs were responsible for massive extinctions 738 vertebrate species and may have contributed to 58 of the cases of contemporary extinctions of birds mammals and reptiles once established it is very difficult and costly to fully eliminate an invasive species many mathematical optimization formulations have been presented to manage and control the spread of invasive species we present a brief review of these formulations in section 3 conservation planning also encompasses other problems besides the two we have mentioned above other authors have discussed the use of mathematical optimization to solve a variety of conservation problems billionnet 2013 however one crucial aspect that has not been sufficiently considered is the issue of noisy information for example due to imperfect detection of species during surveys williams et al 2005 in their seminal work on systematic conservation planning margules and pressey 2000 point out that conservation planning is riddled with uncertainty uncertainty pervades the use of biodiversity surrogates the setting of conservation targets decisions about which kinds of land tenure can be expected to contribute to targets and for which features and decisions about how best to locate design implement and manage new conservation areas in the face of limited resources competition for other uses and incursions from surrounding areas new developments in all the planning stages will progressively reduce but never eliminate these uncertainties they recommend that planners rather than proceeding as if certain must learn to deal explicitly with uncertainty in ways that minimize the chances of serious mistakes many problems in conservation planning require information about state variables e g species abundance occupancy rates that pertain to the dynamic of ecological systems e g population growth rate movement rate or conservation value of land parcels among other variables williams et al 2005 ignoring these potential sources of uncertainties may lead to bad decisions many studies have addressed these uncertainties with probabilistic and stochastic approaches these approaches although a big step up on the deterministic models do not handle the uncertainty sufficiently this is due to the fact that there are always certain inhibiting assumptions regarding the nature of the uncertainty in these methods more precisely due to sparsity of the data available it is overly optimistic to try and over fit this data into certain probability distributions to deal with the issue of uncertainty and the lack of sufficient probabilistic information there has long been a discussion of using robust optimization see for instance beyer et al 2016 but we were not able to find any study that exploits this technique in this paper we propose to use robust optimization for conservation planning and optimal control of invasive species since robust optimization bertsimas and sim 2004 ben tal et al 2009 accounts for the worst case scenarios it ensures that the problem is tractable and near optimal in the face of large uncertainty when using the robust approach the decision maker will know the quantum of parametric uncertainty they are protected against when they deploy the decisions and policies recommended by the robust counterpart of a formulation in this paper we also show another crucial value of the robust optimization for some conservation problems if the uncertainty is very large it may be infeasible to find a solution that meets a budget constraint a crucial question then arises if we are unable to address all the uncertainty using the current resources where can we best expend these resources for improving our data gathering efforts in order to reduce the quantum of uncertainty as much as possible we have developed a bi objective optimization approach that addresses this question our approach gives managers the possibility to visualize how much uncertainty can be addressed for a given budget and provides a prescriptive set of recommendations about where to focus their data gathering efforts as we show in section 5 this knowledge can have profound policy implications we come up with a novel bi objective optimization formulation to model this approach and develop it further this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the robust optimization approach that we have used in section 3 we review existing basic optimization formulations developed for two fundamental problems in conservation planning in sections 4 and 5 we introduce a robust optimization approach for the invasive control problem and the reserve selection problem respectively and present some numerical experiments finally in section 6 we state our concluding remarks 2 preliminaries robust optimization robust optimization is a principal method to address data uncertainty in mathematical programming formulations this method has been successfully applied to solve many problems under uncertainty when the exact distribution for the data is unknown or difficult to determine or otherwise using stochastic optimization techniques is computationally impractical in general robust optimization is a conservative approach that seeks to protect the decision maker against the worst realizations of outcomes the focus of this study is the robust optimization technique developed by bertsimas and sim 2004 since it allows for controlling the degree of conservatism of the solution let c be an n vector a be an m n matrix and b be an m vector the deterministic optimization formulations in this study are in the form of mixed integer linear programs i e min c x s t a x b x 0 x i ℤ for i 1 n 1 where x is the vector of variables containing n 1 number of integer variables and n 2 number of continuous variables note that n n 1 n 2 also all coefficients are rational i e a ℚ m n b ℚ m and c ℚ n in all proposed formulations in this study the data uncertainty affects only the elements of the matrix a to avoid any unnecessary confusion we next explain a customized version of the robust optimization technique developed by bertsimas and sim 2004 that works on this specific class of optimization problems we do not make any assumption about the exact distribution of each entry a ij of the matrix a however it is assumed that reasonable estimates for the mean value of the coefficient a ij and its range a ˆ ij are available in other words we assume that each entry a ij takes value in a ij a ˆ ij a ij a ˆ ij note that a ˆ ij can be equal to 0 for each row i 1 m of the matrix a we introduce a number γ i defined by users to adjust the the required level of conservatism in the proposed robust optimization formulation this number simply imposes an upper bound on the number of entries of row i of the matrix a that can reach their worst case values given that ax b and all variables are non negative the worst case value for the entry a ij of the matrix a is a ij a ˆ ij so higher the value of γ i higher the degree of conservatism the parameter γ i can only take values in the interval 0 j i where j i j a ˆ ij 0 we assume that if γ i ℤ then at most γ i number of entries of row i of the matrix a can reach their worst case values i e a ij a ˆ ij one other entry r i can reach the value of a ij γ i γ i a ˆ ij in simpler terms if there are one hundred entries in a row i of matrix a and the corresponding γ i value is 50 7 then 50 entries of row i of matrix a can reach their worst case values of a ij a ˆ ij and one other entry will reach the value of a ij 0 7 a ˆ ij the robust optimization formulation that seeks to conduct the optimization against the worst case scenario under these stated assumptions can be presented as follows min c x s t j 1 n a ij x j max s i r i s i j i s i γ i r i j i s i j s i a ˆ ij x j γ i γ i a ˆ ir i x r i b i for i 1 m x 0 x i ℤ for i 1 n 1 it can be shown that this formulation has the following equivalent mixed integer linear programming formulation bertsimas and sim 2004 min c x s t j 1 n a ij x j z i γ i j j i p ij b i for i 1 m z i p ij a ˆ ij x j for i 1 m and j j i p ij 0 for i 1 m and j j i z i 0 for i 1 m x 0 x i ℤ for i 1 n 1 in this study we call this formulation the robust counterpart formulation 3 optimization models in conservation planning as mentioned in the introduction optimization methods have been used in conservation problems including reserve selection reserve design landscape fragmentation forest management control of invasive species protection of genetic diversity and wildfire control billionnet 2013 we illustrate the benefits of robust optimization methods for conservation with the two types of problems that we introduced earlier reserve selection and control of invasive species 3 1 control of invasive species spatial and temporal control of invasive species is an important problem in conservation planning the simplest deterministic formulation for containing the spread of an alien invader was presented by hof 1998 they divide the land under consideration into m identical square parcels the invading species grows by a constant rate g every time period once a control action is implemented in a parcel i the invader is supposed to be completely eliminated there is also some diffusion or spread of the species to parcel i from parcel j table 1 shows the mathematical notation used in this basic deterministic formulation the formulation presented by hof 1998 can be represented as follows 1 d 1 min i 1 m t 1 t v it 2 i 1 m x it u for i 1 t 3 v i 0 a i for i 1 m 4 v it b it t 1 t x ik j 1 m p ji 1 g v jt 1 for i 1 m and t 1 t 5 v it 0 for i 1 m and t 1 t 6 x it 0 1 for i 1 m and t 1 t the objective function minimizes the population size of the invasive species on all parcels during a planning horizon with t time steps constraint 2 guarantees that the number of parcels treated in each time period is not greater than the imposed upper bound i e u constraint 3 gives us the initial species population at each parcel at the beginning of first period finally constraint 4 simply captures the population size of invasive species in each parcel at the beginning of each time period given the previous period s population v jt 1 in all parcels the growth rate g and the inter parcel diffusion rates p ji the next period s population for a particular parcel i will be v it when no control action is taken x it 0 however if a control action is taken x it 1 then for a sufficiently large b it v it becomes zero we assume that b it is sufficiently large i e regardless of the value of v jt 1 j we must have that b it j 1 m p ji 1 g v jt 1 therefore the value of b it can be computed recursively by using b it j 1 m p ji 1 g b jt 1 and b i0 a i in light of this observation the objective function and constraint 4 together imply that v it 0 if parcel i is treated in or before time period t and v it j 1 m p ji 1 g v jt 1 otherwise hence implicitly treating a parcel more than once is unnecessary in this formulation in practice it is computationally advantageous to add the following valid inequalities to the formulation 7 t 1 t x it 1 for i 1 m note that these valid inequalities are not part of the original formulation introduced by hof 1998 however we decide to use them since in practice we have observed that they can reduce the solution time by a factor of around two next we briefly review some of the more advanced formulations the formulation we presented thus far is one of the oldest and most basic formulations while we briefly describe some more sophisticated models here it is important to note that robust optimization techniques presented in this paper can be applied to any deterministic formulation in order to incorporate uncertainty our choice of the most basic formulation does not imply an acceptance of all simplifying assumptions therein others have since come up with more realistic models of invasion control that consider a different set of assumptions on growth diffusion and control of an invasive species büyüktahtakın et al 2011 büyüktahtakın et al 2014 büyüktahtakın et al 2015 are examples of a series of more incrementally sophisticated models as their objective they attempt to reduce the damage to multiple resources in a single and multi objective setting they also consider logistic growth as opposed to linear growth hof 1998 has considered their formulation also considers different kill rates depending on the critical population density in a parcel as opposed to 100 kill rate assumed by hof 1998 in one of the models they consider an age structured approach to take into account the biological dynamics of the population according to the authors the large size of the dynamic problem and the nonlinearity make the application of direct optimization methods impossible instead they analyze and compare the most frequently suggested strategies and their consequences epanchin niell and wilen 2012 present a temporally and spatially explicit formulation of the spread of invasive species their mixed integer linear programming milp formulation considers binary decisions related to clearing of patches and controlling the spread of species across patch boundaries they minimize the present value of the sum of control costs and invasion damages across space and time another simple linear programming based approach to invasion control is proposed by hastings et al 2006 they consider a linear age or stage structured population of the invader at different stages age the invader has different growth survival rates and fecundity the issue of uncertainty has also been considered in many recent studies in summary the formulations with uncertainty fall into two categories models that consider stochasticity in some parameters and formulations that consider lack of information about some parameters the point of introduction growth diffusion response to control and the harmful impacts of an invasion can all be stochastic processes the data on these process for a new invader can be sparse and hence it is often difficult to construct representative probability distributions although some recent work has been done in this area guisan et al 2013 elith 2015 uden et al 2015 the optimization formulations also contain parameters whose values for a particular application are simply not known and their estimation remains difficult especially before or early in an invasion even during the invasion accurate detection and measurement of invasions is difficult these multiple uncertainties are an impediment to devising optimal control policies or evaluating their impacts the approaches that have been tried so far include stochastic dynamic programming kotani et al 2011 information gap theory carrasco et al 2010 learning models eiswerth and van kooten 2007 partially observable markov decision processes haight and polasky 2010 rout et al 2014 and bayesian analysis cook et al 2007 for an exhaustive review of the work that considers uncertainty in invasion control we refer the readers to the review paper by epanchin niell and hastings 2010 3 2 reserve selection problem the reserve selection problem is another well studied problem in conservation planning literature the problem consists in selecting a proportion of a given geographic area for the purposes of conserving a given species or a set of species it is oftentimes prohibitive to earmark a very large geographic area for species conservation because of opportunity costs associated with alternative high economic value land use multiple variations on the basic reserve selection problem have been presented over the years for a more exhaustive review of the science of reserve selection readers can refer to williams et al 2005 haight and snyder 2009 billionnet 2013 beyer et al 2016 in our paper we use the basic reserve selection formulation presented in beyer et al 2016 there is a cost associated with the selection of each reserve and each reserve contributes to the conservation of species of interest the optimization procedure selects parcels of land so as to minimize the cost while achieving some explicit target conservation values for each species table 2 details the mathematical notation used in the basic deterministic reserve selection formulation we divided the land under consideration into m parcels if the conservation targets for species k 1 k were achieved the parcels were assumed to be conserved the formulation presented by beyer et al 2016 can be represented as follows 8 d 2 min i 1 m c i x i 9 i 1 m w ik x i w k for k 1 k 10 x i 0 1 for i 1 m the objective function minimizes the total cost of conservation constraint 9 ensures that the target conservation value for each species is achieved next we explain some fundamental features of the reserve selection problem and the existing formulations for this problem in the literature in all existing formulations the area under consideration is divided into parcels of land one or more species can be considered for conservation the decision of reserve selection can be single period or a multi period dynamic decision costello and polasky 2004 snyder et al 2005 tóth et al 2011 strange et al 2006 in the basic deterministic version of the problem there is a cost of selecting a parcel of land more elaborate approaches to determine cost consider sophisticated economic models to get a more complete picture of these costs polasky et al 2008 tóth et al 2011 besides the cost or the number of reserves other objectives like species or genetic diversity can also be considered cabeza and moilanen 2001 some researchers have used multiobjective optimization to handle more than one objective functions together memtsas 2003 snyder et al 2004 all existing formulations contain parameters related to the target value of conservation to be achieved for each species under consideration and the contribution of each parcel to the species conservation in the more basic formulations contribution was modeled through binary parameters representing presence absence of the species for each parcel and the target was to make sure that each species is represented in the optimal choice of parcels revelle et al 2002 other more advanced formulations use some geographical ecological or biological surrogates and or some survey or sightings data alongside statistical modeling margules and pressey 2000 austin 2002 to come up with estimates of spatial species distribution almost all formulations consider constraints to ensure some sort of spatial arrangement of parcels this is done to achieve connectivity contiguity compactness shape size or certain boundary or buffer zone requirements for the reserve williams et al 2005 westphal et al 2007 jafari and hearne 2013 wang and önal 2015 beyer et al 2016 many existing formulations consider uncertainty related to one or more of the parameters described above probabilistic reserve selection formulations assign probabilities to species presence rather than using a binary variable for presence 1 and absence 0 these formulations either maximize the expected coverage expected coverage approach polasky et al 2000 or the number of species covered where a species is considered covered if its cumulative presence probability exceeds a predetermined threshold threshold approach there are no formulations however that consider the parametric uncertainty related to value of each parcel to each species or the cost of acquiring a parcel of land in the formulation we have presented haight et al 2000 arthur et al 2002 some recent review papers for instance billionnet 2013 and beyer et al 2016 emphasize the necessity of dealing with uncertainty related to these parameters they recommend robust optimization approaches to account for this parametric uncertainty despite its great potential robust optimization has been under utilized to address problems of conservation and natural resource management 4 a robust optimization approach for the invasion control problem in this section we consider the basic deterministic formulation by hof 1998 i e d1 and incorporate uncertainty in some parameters through the robust optimization approach presented in section 2 more precisely we assume that all parameters of d1 are known with certainty except the diffusion rate p ji we assume that p ji p ji p ˆ ji p ji p ˆ ji and p ˆ ji 0 i e we consider a range uncertainty in diffusion rates where the size of uncertainty is determined by p ˆ ji we denote the robust counterpart formulation of d1 with r1 this formulation can be easily constructed using the techniques developed in section 2 interested readers can find r1 in appendix a 4 1 numerical experiments to compare the performance of d1 and r1 a random instance is generated by setting m 40 t 5 u 2 and r 0 05 in this section we randomly chose a geographical region in central florida and divide it into m equal parcels the value of a i for each i 1 m is generated randomly from 25 25 we set negative values to zero the value of diffusion rate p ji is considered to be inversely proportional to the square of euclidean distance between the parcels j and i i e p ji 1 d ji 2 let α β 0 be two user defined parameters we assume that p ˆ ji β p ji and γ i t α m thus α and β control the level of uncertainty to be considered by modifying the range of uncertainty or the number of uncertain parameters it is worth mentioning that to compare r1 and d1 we assume that p ji p ji in d1 i e the half value p ˆ ji is zero next we conduct a set of experiments on the generated instance by choosing different values for α and β it is recognized that the robust counterparts of the original deterministic formulations retain the benefit of lp linear programming and milp mixed integer linear programming frameworks and are known to be computationally tractable and scalable if the original problem is also tractable and scalable however it is important to note that any robust milp model is only as good as the original deterministic milp formulation that it originated from the deterministic invasion control problem by hof 1998 presented here is dynamic in time and contains a large number parameter b it as a big m in a formulation to prevent infeasibility the value of b it needs to be iteratively determined as a result the original formulation is very difficult to scale and has a huge room for improvement we have added a valid inequality in 7 and also defined a method of determining b it values iteratively in proposition 1 to prevent infeasibility the basic deterministic model d1 and the robust model r1 take a large amount of time to solve to optimality as the size of the problem increases in table 3 we report the time it takes to solve the problem instances of different sizes for d1 and r1 all the numerical experiments were done on a machine with 3 60 ghz cpu clock speed 16 gb ram and 64 bit windows 8 operating system the models d1 and r1 were solved using the java api of cplex v12 4 optimality gap was set at 2 5 we first note that solving d1 and r1 usually results in markedly different solutions and objective values the objective function for both formulations is the total presence of the invasive species over all parcels of land and all time periods however the robust counterpart formulation r1 cannot possibly achieve an objective value less than that of the deterministic formulation d1 due to increased diffusion rates caused by considering uncertainty observe that the main decision variables of the problem are x it for i 1 m and t 1 t and they indicate whether a parcel i is selected for treatment in a time period t or not we can easily plot the optimal values of these variables produced by d1 and r1 an illustration of this observation when α 0 3 and β 0 05 can be found in fig 1 in which each cell represents x it and it is hatched filled only if x it 1 as expected the recommended values generated by d1 and r1 are different since optimal solutions of r1 and d1 may differ significantly and since their respective objective function values cannot be fairly compared due to increased diffusion rates in r1 we introduce a few techniques to be able to compare the solutions and show the value of robust optimization since the main decision variables of the problem are x it let x d and x r be the optimal value vectors of these decision variables produced by solving d1 and r1 respectively furthermore for a given x we define d x as the optimal objective value of d1 when we set x it x it in d1 similarly for a given x we define r x as the optimal objective value of r1 when we set x it x it in r1 using these definitions four values can be computed d x d this is the objective value that is reached when we implement the deterministic decision x d made on assumptions of zero uncertainty to a deterministic setting if our assumption about zero uncertainty was indeed correct then implementing the deterministic decision represents the best case scenario for the decision maker d x r this is the objective value that is reached if we implement x r i e the robust decision made on assumptions of worst case scenario to a deterministic setting we may incur some extra cost in the process for being over prepared and making wrong assumptions about uncertainty r x r this is the objective value we get if we choose to implement x r the robust decision made on assumptions of worst case scenario to a non deterministic or uncertain setting in this case we are well equipped to handle this uncertainty since we prepared for it beforehand r x d this is the objective value we achieve if we use x d i e the deterministic decision to a non deterministic or uncertain setting this situation represents the worst case scenario for the decision maker since they get penalized for being unprepared and making wrong assumptions about uncertainty it can be easily shown that d x d d x r r x r r x d in other words using x r results in less fluctuations in the objective value if realizations of data different than those anticipated arise in practice to illustrate this observation we assume that β 0 5 1 2 and α 0 25 0 5 0 75 and run a small set of nine experiments by applying different combinations for values of α and β larger values of α and β represent larger quantum of uncertainty by varying these coefficients we are simply varying the quantum of uncertainty we consider experiments 1 2 9 are defined to be precisely β 0 5 α 0 25 β 0 5 α 0 5 β 2 α 0 75 the scaled results are reported in fig 2 in which the vertical axis shows the ratio i e d x d r x d d x r r x d r x r r x d and r x d r x d and the horizontal axis shows the experiment number observe that d x d r x d d x r r x d in fact d x d r x d is slightly better smaller than d x r r x d in all experiments this implies that x r is almost optimal for d1 so if we prepare for uncertainty by implementing the robust decision x r but the worse case scenario as defined by the robust optimization formulation does not arise in reality we almost lose nothing also observe that r x r r x d is up to 14 better smaller than r x d r x d this implies that if the worse case scenario as defined by the robust optimization formulation arises then we are up to 14 better off by using x r simply put we are better able to handle uncertainty if we have prepared for it beforehand these two observations clearly illustrate the value of the proposed robust optimization and the fact that x r is a better choice in practice of course these experiments can be repeated with similar results for any size of the problem and any set of parameters α and β finally as enunciated earlier the assumption of uncertainty and the robust formulation used to handle it also impacts the gist of managerial decision making by prescribing to treat different parcels of land in different time periods i e choosing different x it variables to be 1 as compared with those suggested by the deterministic formulation 5 a robust optimization approach for the reserve selection problem in this section the robust counterpart formulation of the basic reserve selection problem beyer et al 2016 explained in section 5 is developed we assume that the cost coefficients for parcels i e c i for i 1 m and the target values for species w k for k 1 k are known with certainty note that this assumption may often be reasonable because the cost can be approximated using a range of values from alternative economic models and the species conservation target can be elicited from stakeholders the parameters w ik represent the contribution of parcel i to species k and are considered to be uncertain these values often depend on a number of biological factors and therefore need thorough examination of the ecological characteristics of a certain parcel of land the estimates for these biological factors are prone to estimation errors and changes over time more specifically we assume that w ik w ik w ˆ ik w ik w ˆ ik and w ˆ ik 0 i e we consider a range uncertainty in contribution values where the size of uncertainty is determined by w ˆ ik we denote the robust counterpart formulation of d2 with r2 this formulation can be easily constructed using the techniques developed in section 2 interested readers can find r2 in appendix b 5 1 numerical experiments the goal of this section is to compare the performance of d2 and r2 we evaluated the performance of d2 and r2 with simulated data the simulated data are generated by setting m 40 and k 5 also c i for i 1 m are randomly generated by using the discrete uniform distribution in the interval 100 1000 furthermore w ik values are randomly drawn from the normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 5 values less than zero are truncated to zero this implies that on average 50 of the parcels do not contribute to the conservation of a particular species we also set w k 0 5 i 1 m w ik let α β 0 be two user defined parameters we assume that w ˆ ik β w ik and γ k αm it is worth mentioning that to compare r2 and d2 we assume that w ik w ik in d2 next we conduct some experiments on the simulated data by choosing different values for α and β all the numerical experiments were done on a machine with 3 60ghz cpu clock speed 16 gb ram and 64 bit windows 8 operating system the models d2 r2 and r3 were solved using the java api of cplex v12 4 optimality gap was set at 2 5 although we present the results for 40 parcels for reader s convenience and consistency across the paper we ran a series of experiments with larger number of parcels to see how the deterministic and the robust models scale with the problem size we ran our models with number of parcels equal to 100 500 1000 5000 and 10 000 and reported and compared the run times for the deterministic and robust models d2 and r2 respectively we also ran r3 with larger size of instances we ran a set of experiments with number of parcels equal to 50 100 and 200 as the model r3 contains linearization constraints to replace the bilinear terms and also involves finding the full non dominated frontier consisting of hundreds of points we were unable to solve the problem with number of parcels larger than 200 in a reasonable amount of time we report these run time results in tables 4 and 5 in rest of this section we assume that d2 is always feasible but we make no such assumption about r2 we first note that to compare d2 and r2 we cannot use the same technique developed in section 4 1 because this problem has only one type of decision variables and so the solution corresponding to d2 is unlikely to be feasible for r2 this implies that using the solution of the deterministic formulation would be a poor choice because under the worst case scenario as defined by the robust optimization formulation the deterministic solution fails to satisfy the target values for species of interest based on this observation one may be tempted to make the determination to always use the robust optimization formulation r2 because it is always feasible however as we subsequently explain that is not necessarily the case in general the structure of r2 is such that it is quite possible to increase the degree of uncertainty in r2 to such an extent so as to render the problem infeasible although using the optimal solution obtained by d2 does not seem to be a good choice at the same time however employing r2 as currently defined may not be a good option either as the issue of possible infeasibility persists consequently we need to revise r2 in order to ensure that the revised formulation is always feasible if d2 is feasible we revised r2 by adding a second objective to the problem in addition to the total conservation cost to measure the total infeasibility of the robust formulation it is worth mentioning that the total infeasibility can be interpreted as the amount of decrease in the uncertainty ranges in order to make the robust counterpart formulation feasible we denote the revised formulation by r3 it is worth mentioning that r3 can be easily written as a bi objective mixed integer linear program bomilp by using a few linearization techniques in bi objective optimization the goal is to compute the nondominated frontier or simply the set of all nondominated points these points are the projection image of pareto optimal solutions in the objective space interested readers can find r3 and its linearization process in appendix c we use the ϵ constraint method to solve the bomilp corresponding to r3 for β 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 8 1 6 and α 0 25 0 5 figs 3 and 4 show the exact nondominated frontier of the problem for different values of β when α 0 25 and α 0 5 respectively we next make a few observations about these figures intuitively it can be seen that the upper left and lower right endpoints of each nondominated frontier provide information about d2 and r2 respectively more specifically the upper left point shows the infeasibility of the optimal solution obtained with d2 under the worst case scenario for this solution all the uncertainty is unaddressed and total infeasibility is maximum possible it also shows the optimal cost of conservation by allowing r3 to handle this amount of infeasibility when the worst case scenario arises similarly the lower right endpoint shows the total infeasibility of r2 and the optimal cost of conservation by allowing r3 to handle this amount of infeasibility for a fixed α and β the decision maker s can visualize the nondominated frontier and choose a desirable point obviously choosing a point closer to the lower right corner indicates that the decision makers adopt a more conservative or risk averse approach since the lower right point represents the total infeasibility of r2 for a fixed α the nondominated frontier shifts upward i e the value of infeasibility increases as β increases and it converges towards a plateau this is not surprising because as β increases the uncertainty goes up indeed increasing β adds more uncertainty to the problem we observe that it is possible that the nondominated frontier becomes so flat that eventually reduces to a single point see for instance β 1 6 and α 0 5 note that this is also true for the other extreme case representing very small or no uncertainty if the uncertainty is very small then it is expected that the nondominated frontier would become so steep that it would eventually reduce to a single point these observations imply that for the formulation of the reserve selection problem explored in this study the decision makers would not gain much by trying to handle a large amount of uncertainty using the proposed robust optimization technique at higher values of assumed uncertainty the nondominated frontier may become so flat that to improve the infeasibility by small amount we need to increase the conservation cost significantly similarly if the assumed uncertainty is very small the robust optimization technique is almost equivalent to the deterministic formulation even in this extreme case using the robust optimization approach is not particularly helpful nevertheless for a reasonable amount of uncertainty using the proposed robust optimization approach seems to be quite helpful for instance the nondominated frontiers of the problem when β 0 2 β 0 4 or β 0 8 and when α 0 25 or α 0 5 in figs 3 and 4 seem very promising since the lower right endpoint of these nondominated frontiers has the total infeasibility value of zero but the upper left point has a significant total infeasibility value also observe that since these curves are generally steeper i e we have significant gains on infeasibility without losing much on the conservation cost the decision maker can genuinely achieve a trade off between his competing objectives by choosing a suitable point on these nondominated frontiers another crucial information that r3 can provide us is the optimal values of variables ϵ ik these values represent the portion of w ˆ ik that remained unaddressed these values can indicate to a decision maker where to concentrate their data gathering efforts in order to minimize the unaddressed uncertainty as defined by the second objective function in r3 especially in a situation when the budget for such efforts is limited 6 conclusion many conservation problems involve a lot of uncertainty which may not always be captured with probability distributions in this study we explored the idea of applying robust optimization techniques for solving conservation problems while accounting for high levels of uncertainty to the best of our knowledge this is the first study in applying a robust optimization approach in conservation planning problems we illustrated our proposed approach with two types of problems the invasion control problem and the reserve selection problem more importantly we developed novel techniques to compare the results obtained by the proposed robust optimization approach and the corresponding deterministic formulation we hope that the applicability versatility and performance of our approach encourages practitioners and researchers to implement it to address important issues in natural resource management and conservation acknowledgement the authors are grateful to nahid jafari for stimulating conversations about the use of robust optimization for conservation planning the authors are also thankful to julien martin from u s geological survey for helpful discussions the views and opinions expressed in this manuscript however are solely those of the authors appendix a robust formulation of d1 based on our discussion in section 2 it is easy to show that the robust counterpart formulation of d1 can be stated as 11 r 1 min i 1 m t 1 t v it 12 i 1 m x it u for i 1 t 13 v i 0 a i for i 1 m 14 v it b it t 1 t x ik j 1 m p ji 1 g v jt 1 z it γ i t j 1 m q jit for i 1 m and t 1 t 15 z it q

i 1 m and t 1 t is a user defined parameter showing the level of conservatism in constraint 14 note that we assume that b it is sufficiently large i e regardless of the value of v jt 1 z it and q ijt for j 1 m j 1 m and t 1 t we must have that b it j 1 m p ji 1 g v jt 1 z it γ i t j 1 m q jit therefore the value of b it should be computed differently in r1 this can be done using the following proposition proposition 1 let u i t 1 u i t 1 1 u i t 1 2 u i t 1 m such that u i t 1 j p ˆ ji 1 g b j t 1 for i 1 m and t 1 t also let u i t 1 j be the j th largest component of ui t 1 for each i 1 m and t 1 t b it can be computed recursively by using b it j 1 m p ji 1 g b jt 1 j 1 γ i t u it 1 j γ i t γ i t u i t 1 γ i t and b i0 a i proof we first note that based on the discussion given in section 2 r1 is equivalent to 20 min i 1 m t 1 t v it 21 i 1 m x it u for i 1 t 22 v i 0 a i for i 1 m 23 v it b it t 1 t x ik j 1 m p ji 1 g v jt 1 max s i t r it s i t j i t s i t γ i t r it j i t s

is sufficiently large if regardless of the value of v jt 1 for j 1 m we have that b it j 1 m p ji 1 g v jt 1 max s i t r it s i t j i t s i t γ i t r it j i t s i t j s i t p ˆ ji 1 g v jt 1 γ i t γ i

i t 1 γ i t for i 1 m and t 1 t so the result follows appendix b robust formulation of d2 based on our discussion in section 2 it is easy to show that the robust counterpart formulation of d2 can be stated as 26 r 2 min i 1 m c i x i 27 i 1 m w ik x i z k γ k i 1 m q ik w k for k 1 k 28 z k q ik w ˆ ik x i for i 1 m and k 1 k 29 q ik 0 for i 1 m and k 1 k 30 z k 0 for k 1 k 31 x i 0 1 for i 1 m where γ k for k 1 k is a user defined parameter showing the level of conservatism in constraint 27 appendix c revised robust formulation of d2 it is evident from constraint 27 that the term z k γ k i 1 m q ik cannot take a positive value and so it can force more x i to take the value of 1 in comparison to d2 however this in itself can force the value of z k γ k i 1 m q ik to become even more negative due to constraint 28 thus it is possible for r2 to be infeasible the higher the degree of uncertainty in r2 i e larger the values of w ˆ ik and γ k for i 1 m and k 1 k larger the probability of this outcome arising so to deal with infeasibility of r2 we propose a revised formulation as follows 32 r 3 min i 1 m c i x i 33 min i 1 m k 1 k ϵ ik 34 i 1 m w ik x i z k γ k i 1 m q ik w k for k 1 k 35 z k q ik w ˆ ik ϵ ik x i for i 1 m and k 1 k 36 0 ϵ ik w ˆ ik for i 1 m and k 1 k 37 q ik 0 for i 1 m and k 1 k 38 z k 0 for k 1 k 39 x i 0 1 for i 1 m where ϵ ik is a new continuous variable that is introduced in order to revise reduce the value of w ˆ ik for i 1 m and k 1 k this can be observed from constraints 35 and 36 in consequence the new objective function i 1 m k 1 k ϵ ik simply measures the infeasibility of r2 with respect to the value of w ˆ ik for i 1 m and k 1 k to understand the formulation better we now explore two extreme cases in the first case we suppose that ϵ ik 0 for i 1 m and k 1 k in such a scenario r3 is precisely equivalent to r2 now in the second case let us suppose that ϵ ik w ik for i 1 m and k 1 k in this case the optimal solution of d2 is also optimal for r3 because we now have the option to set z k 0 and q ik 0 for i 1 m and k 1 k so this formulation captures the essence of both d2 and r2 and it is guaranteed to be feasible since we assume that d2 is feasible note that solving this bi objective optimization problem returns the trade off between the total cost of conservation i e the first objective function and the total infeasibility i e the second objective function however the proposed formulation is not linear in order to linearize it a new non negative variable ϵ ˆ ik can be introduced to capture the value of the bilinear term ϵ ik x j for i 1 m and k 1 k and then constraint 35 can be replaced by the following constraints 40 z k q ik w ˆ ik x i ϵ ˆ ik for i 1 m and k 1 k 41 ϵ ˆ ik ϵ ik for i 1 m and k 1 k 42 ϵ ˆ ik w ˆ ik x i for i 1 m and k 1 k 43 ϵ ˆ ik ϵ ik w ˆ ik x i w ˆ ik for i 1 m and k 1 k 44 ϵ ˆ ik 0 for i 1 m and k 1 k this linearization is valid since if x i 1 then ϵ ˆ ik ϵ ik and if x i 0 then ϵ ˆ ik 0 for i 1 m and k 1 k 
25363,the endangered population of roseate terns sterna dougallii in the northwestern atlantic ocean consists of a network of large and small breeding colonies on islands this type of fragmented population poses an exceptional opportunity to investigate dispersal a mechanism that is fundamental in population dynamics and is crucial to understand the spatio temporal and genetic structure of animal populations dispersal is difficult to study because it requires concurrent data compilation at multiple sites models of population dynamics in birds that focus on dispersal and include a large number of breeding sites are rare in literature in this work we propose a stochastic simulation model that captures the dispersal dynamics of this population of roseate terns the colonization and decolonization abandonment of breeding colonies are modeled as discrete events that follow different dynamics than dispersal we show that our model reproduces the properties of this population that have been observed in field data we also analyzed the sensitivity of our model to alterations in different variables and study the impact of these alterations in the model dynamics our results suggest that large colony population size exhibits a threshold sensitivity to adult survival and that regional persistence is maintained by the larger populations keywords roseate terns metapopulation source

estimates of the missing demographic parameters that aims to reproduce the observed statistical behavior of the actual metapopulation our model is based on assumptions about the spatio temporal dynamics that describe the allocation of dispersing individuals adults that do not return to the same site in successive years and juveniles that do not return to their natal site when they recruit to the breeding population among the breeding colonies within the system our goal was to construct a model that conforms to the following observed properties of the metapopulation 1 total numbers remain within the range of 3000 8000 pairs over long periods of time 50 years 2 about 90 of the total numbers breed in 2 4 large colonies 500 2000 pairs which remain large for periods of 20 50 years 3 small colonies 10 pairs are occupied and abandoned intermittently and the majority of them do not reach medium nor large size 4 the frequency of formation of a new large colony is about once every 30 years 5 at about the same frequency one new medium sized colony becomes established and persists for a long period 30 years a model that reproduces these features of the wild population could be used realistically for population viability analyses and for assessing potential effects of perturbations e g climate change predator introductions and management actions 2 methods to capture the dynamics of this system we propose a population model consisting of a set of finite difference equations fdes our model reproduces the fecundity survival and dispersal of a population distributed among m sites over t years in this discrete time model each time step t 1 t t represents a year in the system and each site is denoted by an index i 1 i m the number of breeding pairs in site i and year t is represented as n i t before describing the model equations the following definitions are introduced definition 1 we define the annual proportion a i t of birds at site i at year t 1 i m 1 t t as the fraction of the total population in year t that breed at site i in that year a i t n i t j 1 m n j t we consider that adults that bred at site i in year t and juveniles that were raised at the same site in year t 4 are attached to site i the time lag for returning juveniles is driven by the species biology where hatch year birds migrate stay in the non breeding grounds for 1 5 years visit breeding sites at age 2 years and breed for the first time at ages 3 or 4 years lebreton et al 2003 nisbet 2014 our model ignores birds that breed at age 3 because these usually breed late in the season and raise few young nisbet 2014 we also assume that unattached birds defined as those that emigrated from other breeding sites are attracted to site i in proportion to the number of breeding pairs at site i relative to proportions at other sites definition 2 we define the intrinsic quality q i of site i as the average annual proportion of the population found at this site over all years intrinsic quality is calculated as q i t k 1 k t max a i k t j 1 m l k 1 k t max a j k l where k 1 k t max k 1 k t max is the population size across the range of years for which historical data on the number of pairs on each site are available in our case this range spans from 1988 to 2015 i e k 1 1988 and k t max 2015 definition 3 we define a small site as one for which the maximum number of pairs found in the historical data is 10 see supplementary material appendix s1 we define that a small site i in year t is in colonization mode col i t 1 if it can receive immigrants from other sites in year t 1 and its productivity in the following year t 1 h i t 1 see below can be greater than 0 likewise we define that a small site is in decolonization mode decol i t 1 if it is not in colonization mode and cannot enter colonization mode in year t 1 it is important to note that a site cannot be simultaneously in colonization and decolonization modes i e it is not possible that col i t 1 decol i t 1 for any i t 1 i m 1 t t however it is possible that a site can be simultaneously in neither of these modes as an example a site may not receive immigrants nor produce juveniles at a given year t but may be eligible for colonization in year t 1 large sites are always considered to be in colonization mode both annual proportion and quality values were calculated from a dataset of nest counts at each site from 1988 to 2015 see supplementary material table 2 we consider that col i 1 0and decol i 1 0 1 i m for small sites in other words in the initial state of the model all small colonies are not in colonization mode but are susceptible to enter this mode from year 2 and on the model equations are defined as follows if no colonization or decolonization event occurs on site i and year t then n i t 1 round as i t js i t i i t 1 where round is the standard round function for real numbers i e rounding to the nearest integer the terms in this equation are defined as follows as i t for adults staying represents the number of adult pairs that breed at site i in year t and return to breed at the same site in year t 1 as i t is calculated as as i t ω i t ϕ i t n i t where ω i t is the proportion of adult birds that survive between consecutive years and ϕ i t is the site fidelity ratio that is the proportion of pairs that breed at site i in year t and return to the same site in year t 1 conditional to survival in year t ω i t was estimated using a log linear regression model ω i t 1 1 exp ω 0 ω 1 q i ω 2 a i t ϵ ω i t where ϵ ω i t is the model error for site i and year t the ground truth values for ω i t are shown in table 6 the model coefficients are ω 0 1 53 ω 1 9 368 10 5 and ω 2 3 161 10 1 values for ϕ i t are estimated using the log linear regression model ϕ i t 1 1 exp ϕ 0 ϕ 1 q i ϕ 2 a i t ϵ ϕ i t the ground truth values for ϕ i t were obtained from the frequencies of same site transitions shown in fig 2 in spendelow et al 2016 and the model coefficients are ϕ 0 0 931 ϕ 1 3 818 and ϕ 2 0 741 js i t for juveniles staying represents the number of juvenile birds counted as pairs raised to fledging at site i in year t 3 that survive to enter the breeding population and breed in site i in year t 1 we assume that all surviving juveniles enter the breeding population at age 4 see caption to table 8 js i t is calculated as js i t col i t h i t 3 γ i t 3 ρ i t n i t 3 2 where h i t 3 represents the productivity as the mean number of chicks reared to fledging per pair at site i in year t 3 we used the log linear regression model h i t maxh 1 exp h 0 h 1 n i t h 2 q i ϵ h i t to estimate productivity values the ground truth values for h i t were derived from a dataset on average productivity at most sites in years 1998 to 2015 table 3 maxh 1 82 is the maximum productivity value from this dataset and is a scaling factor for the log linear model based on empirical data and using log linear regression the model coefficients were estimated to be h 0 0 214 h 1 0 and h 2 0 006 γ i t 3 represents the survival rate of juveniles raised at site i in year t 3 to year t 1 γ i t 3 was estimated using a log linear regression model γ i t 3 γ w ω i t 2 1 exp γ 0 γ 1 q i ϵ γ i t the ground truth values for γ i t are shown in table 7 and the model coefficients were adjusted as γ 0 0 510 and γ 1 2 56 this estimated value was multiplied by ω i t 2 to yield survival to age 4 this value is multiplied by a scaling factor γ w empirically adjusted to 1 218 that minimizes the difference between the number of pairs in large sites at the end of the model simulation and in the historical data table 2 ρ i t represents juvenile philopatry that is the proportion of birds that were reared at site i in year t 3 and first bred at site i in year t 1 conditional on survival to age 4 ρ i t is calculated as ρ i t ϕ i t η i where η i represents the ratio of juvenile fidelity divided by adult fidelity in site i and year t we estimated these values using the log linear regression model η i 1 1 exp η 0 η 1 n i t ϵ η i the ground truth values for η i were obtained by dividing the values in the diagonals of tables 9 and 10 and the model coefficients were adjusted as η 0 0 444 and η 1 0 002 the equations describing js i t and jl i t see below include a factor of 1 2 to convert from individual juveniles h i t 3 to pairs of adults this was done for calculational convenience al i t for adults leaving represents the number of pairs of adult birds that bred at site i in year t survived to year t 1 but did not breed at site i in year t 1 al i t is calculated as al i t 1 ϕ i t ω i t n i t jl i t for juveniles leaving represents the number of pairs of juvenile birds that were raised to fledging at site i in year t 3 survived to breed

year t 1 that did not breed at site i in year t i i t is calculated as follows first a pool with the total number of pairs leaving their site and available for immigration into all sites is calculated as pool t j 1 m al j t jl j t settlers t desettlers t the terms settlers t and desettlers t refer to the sum of all pairs that colonize and decolonize any site in year t and they are explained below we define a model rid i t for the relative distribution of this pool across the sites in year t as a weighted sum of a deterministic component id i t and a stochastic component is i t the deterministic component is a log linear regression model id i t 1 1 exp id 0 id 1 q i id 2 a i t ϵ i t id the ground truth values for id i t were calculated as j 1 j i m p j i t n j t j 1 j i m k 1 k j m p j k t n j t where values p j i t are the proportion of birds that leave site j in year t and breed in site i in year t 1 these values are taken for transitions for adults between large sites from table 4 in spendelow et al 2016 table 8 we assume that transition values for adults and juveniles are quantitatively similar the model coefficients were adjusted as id 0 0 485 id 1 6 025 and id 2 2 117 the stochastic component is i t is drawn from a normal distribution is i t n μ σ 2 with mean μ 0 241 and standard deviation σ 0 176 derived from the ground truth values for id i t the stochasticity of the model rn is calculated as the average squared standard error of id i t we calculate this error as rn j 1 m l k 1 k t max epsilon j l id 2 m t max where j 1 j m and k 1 k t max represent the sites and years for which transition data across sites is available in our case large sites from 1988 through 2008 the relative immigration distribution rid i t is defined as rid i t 1 rn id i t rn is i t j 1 m d i j n i t where d i j 1 i j m is the distance in kilometers between sites i and j the component j 1 m d i j n i t introduces a penalizing factor for sites with neighboring attractive breeding sites this distribution is normalized i e rid i t norm rid i t j 1 m rid j t finally i i t is calculated as i i t col i t rid i t norm pool t al i t jl i t non large sites are subjected to colonization and decolonization events the probabilities for colonization p col i 1 and decolonization p decol i 1 are site specific and are modeled as the probability for each site i to transit from having 0 pairs in year t n i t 0 to 1 or more pairs in year t 1 n i t 1 0 and the probability to transit from n i t 0 to n i t 0 respectively these are estimated as sample probabilities

abandoned site this value has been estimated to 4 as the median from historical data table 4 when a small or medium sized site enters decolonization mode a number of pairs leave the site this number is drawn from a binomial distribution n i t 1 b maxdec pdec where maxdec is the maximum number of pairs that have ever been observed in the historical data u s fish and wildlife service 2010 to leave

site has entered decolonization mode it will remain in this mode until n i t 0 when decol i t 0 the model was implemented in r language core team 2016 log linear models were calculated using function glm from package stats and the truncated normal distribution was simulated using package truncnorm trautmann et al 2014 colonization and decolonization events override the dynamics defined by equation n i t 1 round as i t js i t i i t 1 in the sites in colonization and decolonization mode moreover the pairs that colonize any site the same year that it enters colonization mode i e the settlers are subtracted from the immigration pool in year t pool t as the term settlers t likewise the pairs that decolonize any site the same year that it enters decolonization mode i e the de settlers are added to the immigration pool in year t pool t as the term desettlers t these terms are calculated as settlers t i n i t 1 and desettlers t j n j t for each site i and j that enters colonization and decolonization mode respectively in year t 3 results we ran 1000 simulations of our model each run was simulated for 50 years we analyzed the following metrics from the simulations output a the number of colonizations and decolonizations per year b the number of pairs that colonize each site i e breed at a site the year that it enters colonization mode c the number of pairs that decolonize each site i e abandon a site the year that it enters decolonization mode d the proportion of birds that breed at large sites at the end of each simulation e the minimum and maximum number of pairs that breed in large sites in each simulation across all simulated years f the length of occupation i e the number of years that small and medium colonies remain colonized i e with at least 1 pair until their abandonment and g the number of initially small colonies that become large or medium during the simulated years and maintain this size until the end of the simulation we also simulated one type of disaster by eliminating the breeders in a large colony the simulation results suggest that the percentage of years in which a single site was colonized is about 32 around 16 000 from the total of 1000 50 50 000 years simulated years where 2 colonizations occur are more infrequent and this tendency continues as the number of colonizations grows this trend is mirrored by the distribution of decolonizations that occur in each year fig 2 the results also show that the majority of the colonizations and decolonizations involve a small number of pairs 1 10 fig 3 nevertheless a small proportion of colonizations involve a larger number of pairs in the range 50 100 pairs these rare colonizations involving large numbers of pairs have been observed in historical data table 4 however a few decolonizations involving 27 37 pairs table 5 were not captured by our model the model also predicts that the duration of occupation for small and medium size colonies is short in the majority of cases the median and mode are 10 and 4 years respectively fig 4 this result is consistent with the observed fact that most small and medium sites are intermittently occupied i e they become colonized and then are abandoned a few years later table 2 the simulations also predict that the proportion of pairs that breed in large colonies in the last year of the simulation falls in the range 0 65 1 00 fig 5 this is a broader range than the proportion observed in the period 1988 2015 0 85 0 99 table 2 but proportions as low as 0 7 were recorded in historical data prior to 1988 nisbet 1980 the model predicts that the total number of pairs that breed in large colonies is usually in the range 2700 4000 fig 6 due to the unstable occupation dynamics of small and medium size sites we decided to use this metric instead of using the total number of pairs across all sites this metric is also consistent with historical data table 2 the number of initially small colonies that become medium or large and maintain this size until the last year of the 50 year simulation is about 1 2 and 1 respectively this conforms to the historical data which indicate that the frequencies of formation of persistently large and persistently medium colonies are both on the order of 0 03y 1 see supplementary material we also simulated an alternative scenario where one large colony bird island is not present in the system this could emulate the effect of a sudden catastrophe in the population with the exception of the pairs that were provided by this colony and are now absent the metrics analyzed do not differ substantially from those from the original scenario this could be an indicator of the high resilience of the studied system in order to assess the sensitivity of our model to changes in parameters we simulated different variations of it particularly we analyzed the effect of changes in juvenile and adult fidelity on the proportion of birds that breed in large colonies in the last simulated year fig 7 in these variations a common adult or juvenile fidelity value was set for all colonies overriding the derived values from the regression models for ϕ i t and ρ i t defined in section 2 the results show small fluctuations in the proportion of pairs breeding in large colonies at the end of the simulation however we did not observe any clear tendency linking juvenile and adult fidelity with this proportion we also analyzed the effect of varying productivity juvenile and adult survival on the maximum number of pairs in large colonies across all simulated years fig 8 the results show that the system collapses for values lower than a threshold for instance for adult survival this threshold is found around 0 8 after this threshold is reached the results show an exponential relationship between each one of these parameters and this number of pairs the steepness of this relationship depends on the altered parameter 4 discussion and conclusions seabird populations are often considered to function as metapopulations e g breton et al 2014 ponchon et al 2015 sanz aguilar et al 2016 this tendency is driven in part by the naturally fragmented nature of the populations this is insufficient however for concluding a metapopulation exists rather than a suite of isolated populations or a single large population smith and green 2005 one needs evidence of somewhat isolated local dynamics as well as extinction recolonization dynamics colonial seabirds can exhibit a type of metapopulation dynamics referred to as mainland island metapopulation dynamics whereby one or a few very large colonies exhibit long term persistence with ephemeral smaller patches that are colonized by birds emigrating from the larger patches dolman 2012 looking at the map fig 1 three large colonies lie on an axis of about 140 km running from wsw to ene and almost all of the small and medium colonies lie either to the west or east of them this is probably a quirk of geomorphology there are very few suitable islands along this axis except for the three occupied by large colonies historically penikese island was also very large but that conforms to the same pattern thus the mainland island configuration of our metapopulation is also a central peripheral pattern the biggest difficulty in understanding metapopulation dynamics for seabirds can be documenting quantifying and modeling colonization and decolonization events payo payo et al 2017 sherley et al 2017 southwell et al 2017 this can be problematic when colonization events are rare munilla et al 2016 which can occur when most colonies are large and in species where social dynamics affect colonization ponchon et al 2015 reed and levine 2005 schippers et al 2011 the difficulty of understanding colonization decolonization dynamics is exacerbated in species with delayed breeding by the difficulty of tracking juvenile and long distance movements bicknell et al 2014 yannic et al 2016 we used data from a long term study to quantify the long term dynamics of site occupancy of roseate terns in the north atlantic spendelow et al 2016 and we used the model to make inferences about the dynamics governing the system in our system productivity increases strongly with site quality q i which is destabilizing in the sense that it would increase the concentration of the population into a few large colonies with high q i any additional dependence on n i t would be additionally destabilizing in the sense that it could lead to a runaway increase in the total population feeding into this cycle might be conspecific attraction of dispersers which is often exhibited by colonial species reed and dobson 1993 counteracting this destabilizing tendency we included an inverse relationship between juvenile survival and site quality where quality was defined as average population size so at our larger sites we modeled and find field evidence of density dependence acting in the large colonies there is some evidence of density dependent colonization dynamics reported in other seabird metapopulations lisnizer et al 2015 matthiopoulos et al 2005 pozzi et al 2015 as well as source sink dynamics lisnizer et al 2015 ponchon et al 2015 sanz aguilar et al 2016 as might be expected in a mainland island metapopulation we found different local dynamics in small and medium colonies in our system these exhibited dynamics that were more stochastic and density independent than those of the large colonies resulting in local decolonizations and recolonizations we found that we had to model colonization and decolonization events separately from our general model of emigration from sites and allocation of the pool of immigrants when we did not model colonization and decolonization as special cases our model predicted that these events usually involve large numbers of pairs spearheading the colonization and abandonment of sites although colonizations and decolonizations involving large numbers of pairs exist in the historical data they are rare and the vast majority of colonizations and decolonizations involve small numbers of pairs therefore we had to adapt the model so that it reflects this property of the system the difference in local dynamics between small and medium sites and large sites reinforces our view that small and medium sites were qualitatively different from large sites consequently the processes governing their dynamics were modeled differently in our model productivity adult survival and juvenile survival appear to be the fundamental aspects that make the model consistent with the observations in other words minor changes in these aspects have profound effects on the dynamics of the model and slight deviations in the parameter values obtained from our data rapidly lead the model dynamics either to population collapse or to uncontrolled growth in the numbers of pairs resulting in levels of population significantly larger than in the observed data we also found that expected population size of large colonies exhibits a threshold sensitivity to adult survival that is over a very small range of values populations went from large to non existent this type of threshold vulnerability to changes in adult survival has been reported before mortensen and reed 2016 but it is not often investigated traditional vital rate sensitivity analyses sometimes report adult survival rate to be the most sensitive vital rate for population growth rate in species with low reproductive rates breininger et al 1999 but there is little consistency in this result across analytical methods fefferman and reed 2006 mortensen and reed 2016 wisdom et al 2000 conversely variations in fidelity do not seem to have a significant impact on the dynamics of the model the model simulations reflect a strong dichotomic distribution with large colonies on one side and small and medium colonies on the other the vast majority of the pairs about 80 90 breed in large colonies during the last year of each simulation changes in the parameters associated with fidelity cause minor oscillations on these percentages but do not reflect a clear monotonic trend linking fidelity and proportion of pairs that breed in large colonies interestingly we found a small but unexpected oscillatory relationship between juvenile and adult fidelity and the proportion of pairs in large colonies in the last year of each simulation this relationship is especially clear for juvenile fidelity we were unable to give an explanation for this phenomenon and we appreciate any hypotheses from readers that would shed light on it the inverse correlation between juvenile survival and site quality acts as a stabilizing factor of the population and counterbalances the destabilizing effect of the positive correlation between productivity and site quality this latter positive correlation tends to destabilize the system because it creates a positive feedback between site quality and productivity that causes the population to grow unrestrained our model treats dispersal as a two step process emigration from colony site i is treated as an intrinsic property of site i and is independent of the destination colonies of the emigrating pairs pairs that emigrate from all sites enter a common pool and are re distributed with the condition that they do not breed in the same colony from which they emigrated in the same year the proportion of pairs that immigrate into colony site j i is modeled as a function of q j and is independent of the colonies of origin of the immigrating pairs we found it unnecessary to explicitly consider pairwise co dependences to model migration between each pair of sites we also found that colonization and decolonization needed to be modeled as separate events from the rest of the migration dynamics this was because the colonization and decolonization dynamics of small and medium colonies and large colonies are different in fact colonization and decolonization dynamics of small and medium colonies are stochastic events that frequently involve large numbers of pairs and apparently do not occur in large colonies our model successfully reproduces several distinctive features of the northwest atlantic metapopulation of roseate terns the metapopulation includes 2 4 large colonies which hold 85 95 of the total numbers and remain similarly large for long periods in our model this results from our assumptions that each colony site is characterized by a single constant intrinsic quality that adult and juvenile fidelity rates are directly correlated with quality and that birds that leave their origin sites are allocated among possible destination sites in proportion to the relative quality of these destination sites generating a source sink dynamics we estimated the quality of each site from the average number of pairs over the 28 year observation period the metapopulation also includes about 30 sites with low or medium values of intrinsic quality most of which are occupied intermittently colonizations and decolonizations are fairly frequent and sometimes involve much larger numbers of birds than what the intrinsic quality of the site would indicate in our model we found it necessary to model colonizations and decolonizations as stochastic events separately from our model of dispersal among sites already occupied which predicted only small numbers of birds entering or leaving low quality sites the numbers of breeding pairs in each of the large colonies and the total number of pairs in the metapopulation remain within moderately narrow bounds over periods of decades in spite of positive correlations between colony size and breeding productivity adult fidelity and juvenile fidelity all of which would be expected to be destabilizing in our model both colony and total numbers are stabilized by introducing an inverse relationship between juvenile survival and colony size we did not find it necessary to include other negatively density dependent factors either at the level of the colony or the metapopulation in addition to colonizations and decolonizations numbers of pairs at the large and medium colonies fluctuate from year to year and several of the demographic parameters that have been measured juvenile survival adult and juvenile dispersal rates also vary among years our model was able to reproduce the observed fluctuations in numbers by incorporating stochastic variation in the same demographic parameters being the amplitude of this variation adjusted to approximate the observed range in the variations of the model where common values for adult survival juvenile survival and productivity rates were used for all years and sites there exists a tipping point for the value of adult survival rate around 0 835 over which the population in the system becomes unstable in the long term fig 8 this is consistent with the data from field observations table 6 the tipping point for productivity in our model approximately 1 1 is also consistent with field data table 3 the sensitivity of our model to changes in the value of these parameters may help explain the observed

25363,the endangered population of roseate terns sterna dougallii in the northwestern atlantic ocean consists of a network of large and small breeding colonies on islands this type of fragmented population poses an exceptional opportunity to investigate dispersal a mechanism that is fundamental in population dynamics and is crucial to understand the spatio temporal and genetic structure of animal populations dispersal is difficult to study because it requires concurrent data compilation at multiple sites models of population dynamics in birds that focus on dispersal and include a large number of breeding sites are rare in literature in this work we propose a stochastic simulation model that captures the dispersal dynamics of this population of roseate terns the colonization and decolonization abandonment of breeding colonies are modeled as discrete events that follow different dynamics than dispersal we show that our model reproduces the properties of this population that have been observed in field data we also analyzed the sensitivity of our model to alterations in different variables and study the impact of these alterations in the model dynamics our results suggest that large colony population size exhibits a threshold sensitivity to adult survival and that regional persistence is maintained by the larger populations keywords roseate terns metapopulation source sink population persistence islands 1 introduction understanding the dynamics of populations is central to assessments of extinction risk invasion and community dynamics as well as other topics rhodes et al 1996 dispersal is an important mechanism in population dynamics and is fundamental to understanding metapopulation structure source sink dynamics population synchrony gene flow and genetic structure as well as colonization range shifts and species conservation e g hanski 2001 saura et al 2014 whitlock 2001 however dispersal is a difficult demographic parameter to study especially in continuous habitats because it requires detecting individuals at multiple locations e g jønsson et al 2016 koenig et al 1996 dispersal can be somewhat easier to study in discontinuous populations such as those formed by colonial seabirds nesting on islands but it still requires data collection at multiple sites and large samples at each site may be required to estimate rates and dynamics of dispersal if these are small crespin et al 2006 dolman 2012 opdam 1991 serrano et al 2005 comprehensive models of populations in fragmented landscapes are uncommon for bird populations particularly those distributed among a large number of breeding sites here we present a population dynamics model for the population of roseate terns sterna dougallii aves laridae that breeds on islands distributed along about 300 km of the atlantic coast of the usa south and west of cape cod massachusetts although roseate terns have nested on 32 islands in recent decades only 5 10 have been occupied in any one year see fig 1 tables 1 and 2 a few of the islands are occupied every year by large populations while other islands contain small populations that persist for a while disappear and are later recolonized tables 1 and 2 this fits dolman s categorization of a mainland island metapopulation where the mainland in this case is the set of islands with large populations and of a fragmented population having regional population effects dolman 2012 for convenience we will refer to our system as being a metapopulation harrison and taylor 1997 stith et al 1996 this metapopulation of terns has been studied intensively since 1988 e g nisbet et al 2016 spendelow et al 2016 with some historical information dating back to 1870 see supplementary material it is thought to be demographically isolated from other metapopulations of the species in the north atlantic region with negligible rates of interchange of individuals u s fish and wildlife service 2010 one of the challenging aspects of modeling its demography is that there exists a time lag of 3 4 years between the time chicks hatch and the time they start breeding lebreton et al 2003 monitoring and capture mark recapture cmr studies have yielded estimates of numbers of breeding pairs breeding productivity adult and juvenile survival and dispersal rates and ages at first breeding for all the large colonies and most of the

medium sized colonies and for all the small colonies the small colonies have been occupied transitorily with frequent colonizations and decolonizations we developed a model based on stochastic estimates of the missing demographic parameters that aims to reproduce the observed statistical behavior of the actual metapopulation our model is based on assumptions about the spatio temporal dynamics that describe the allocation of dispersing individuals adults that do not return to the same site in successive years and juveniles that do not return to their natal site when they recruit to the breeding population among the breeding colonies within the system our goal was to construct a model that conforms to the following observed properties of the metapopulation 1 total numbers remain within the range of 3000 8000 pairs over long periods of time 50 years 2 about 90 of the total numbers breed in 2 4 large colonies 500 2000 pairs which remain large for periods of 20 50 years 3 small colonies 10 pairs are occupied and abandoned intermittently and the majority of them do not reach medium nor large size 4 the frequency of formation of a new large colony is about once every 30 years 5 at about the same frequency one new medium sized colony becomes established and persists for a long period 30 years a model that reproduces these features of the wild population could be used realistically for population viability analyses and for assessing potential effects of perturbations e g climate change predator introductions and management actions 2 methods to capture the dynamics of this system we propose a population model consisting of a set of finite difference equations fdes our model reproduces the fecundity survival and dispersal of a population distributed among m sites over t years in this discrete time model each time step t 1 t t represents a year in the system and each site is denoted by an index i 1 i m the number of breeding pairs in site i and year t is represented as n i t before describing the model equations the following definitions are introduced definition 1 we define the annual proportion a i t of birds at site i at year t 1 i m 1 t t as the fraction of the total population in year t that breed at site i in that year a i t n i t j 1 m n j t we consider that adults that bred at site i in year t and juveniles that were raised at the same site in year t 4 are attached to site i the time lag for returning juveniles is driven by the species biology where hatch year birds migrate stay in the non breeding grounds for 1 5 years visit breeding sites at age 2 years and breed for the first time at ages 3 or 4 years lebreton et al 2003 nisbet 2014 our model ignores birds that breed at age 3 because these usually breed late in the season and raise few young nisbet 2014 we also assume that unattached birds defined as those that emigrated from other breeding sites are attracted to site i in proportion to the number of breeding pairs at site i relative to proportions at other sites definition 2 we define the intrinsic quality q i of site i as the average annual proportion of the population found at this site over all years intrinsic quality is calculated as q i t k 1 k t max a i k t j 1 m l k 1 k t max a j k l where k 1 k t max k 1 k t max is the population size across the range of years for which historical data on the number of pairs on each site are available in our case this range spans from 1988 to 2015 i e k 1 1988 and k t max 2015 definition 3 we define a small site as one for which the maximum number of pairs found in the historical data is 10 see supplementary material appendix s1 we define that a small site i in year t is in colonization mode col i t 1 if it can receive immigrants from other sites in year t 1 and its productivity in the following year t 1 h i t 1 see below can be greater than 0 likewise we define that a small site is in decolonization mode decol i t 1 if it is not in colonization mode and cannot enter colonization mode in year t 1 it is important to note that a site cannot be simultaneously in colonization and decolonization modes i e it is not possible that col i t 1 decol i t 1 for any i t 1 i m 1 t t however it is possible that a site can be simultaneously in neither of these modes as an example a site may not receive immigrants nor produce juveniles at a given year t but may be eligible for colonization in year t 1 large sites are always considered to be in colonization mode both annual proportion and quality values were calculated from a dataset of nest counts at each site from 1988 to 2015 see supplementary material table 2 we consider that col i 1 0and decol i 1 0 1 i m for small sites in other words in the initial state of the model all small colonies are not in colonization mode but are susceptible to enter this mode from year 2 and on the model equations are defined as follows if no colonization or decolonization event occurs on site i and year t then n i t 1 round as i t js i t i i t 1 where round is the standard round function for real numbers i e rounding to the nearest integer the terms in this equation are defined as follows as i t for adults staying represents the number of adult pairs that breed at site i in year t and return to breed at the same site in year t 1 as i t is calculated as as i t ω i t ϕ i t n i t where ω i t is the proportion of adult birds that survive between consecutive years and ϕ i t is the site fidelity ratio that is the proportion of pairs that breed at site i in year t and return to the same site in year t 1 conditional to survival in year t ω i t was estimated using a log linear regression model ω i t 1 1 exp ω 0 ω 1 q i ω 2 a i t ϵ ω i t where ϵ ω i t is the model error for site i and year t the ground truth values for ω i t are shown in table 6 the model coefficients are ω 0 1 53 ω 1 9 368 10 5 and ω 2 3 161 10 1 values for ϕ i t are estimated using the log linear regression model ϕ i t 1 1 exp ϕ 0 ϕ 1 q i ϕ 2 a i t ϵ ϕ i t the ground truth values for ϕ i t were obtained from the frequencies of same site transitions shown in fig 2 in spendelow et al 2016 and the model coefficients are ϕ 0 0 931 ϕ 1 3 818 and ϕ 2 0 741 js i t for juveniles staying represents the number of juvenile birds counted as pairs raised to fledging at site i in year t 3 that survive to enter the breeding population and breed in site i in year t 1 we assume that all surviving juveniles enter the breeding population at age 4 see caption to table 8 js i t is calculated as js i t col i t h i t 3 γ i t 3 ρ i t n i t 3 2 where h i t 3 represents the productivity as the mean number of chicks reared to fledging per pair at site i in year t 3 we used the log linear regression model h i t maxh 1 exp h 0 h 1 n i t h 2 q i ϵ h i t to estimate productivity values the ground truth values for h i t were derived from a dataset on average productivity at most sites in years 1998 to 2015 table 3 maxh 1 82 is the maximum productivity value from this dataset and is a scaling factor for the log linear model based on empirical data and using log linear regression the model coefficients were estimated to be h 0 0 214 h 1 0 and h 2 0 006 γ i t 3 represents the survival rate of juveniles raised at site i in year t 3 to year t 1 γ i t 3 was estimated using a log linear regression model γ i t 3 γ w ω i t 2 1 exp γ 0 γ 1 q i ϵ γ i t the ground truth values for γ i t are shown in table 7 and the model coefficients were adjusted as γ 0 0 510 and γ 1 2 56 this estimated value was multiplied by ω i t 2 to yield survival to age 4 this value is multiplied by a scaling factor γ w empirically adjusted to 1 218 that minimizes the difference between the number of pairs in large sites at the end of the model simulation and in the historical data table 2 ρ i t represents juvenile philopatry that is the proportion of birds that were reared at site i in year t 3 and first bred at site i in year t 1 conditional on survival to age 4 ρ i t is calculated as ρ i t ϕ i t η i where η i represents the ratio of juvenile fidelity divided by adult fidelity in site i and year t we estimated these values using the log linear regression model η i 1 1 exp η 0 η 1 n i t ϵ η i the ground truth values for η i were obtained by dividing the values in the diagonals of tables 9 and 10 and the model coefficients were adjusted as η 0 0 444 and η 1 0 002 the equations describing js i t and jl i t see below include a factor of 1 2 to convert from individual juveniles h i t 3 to pairs of adults this was done for calculational convenience al i t for adults leaving represents the number of pairs of adult birds that bred at site i in year t survived to year t 1 but did not breed at site i in year t 1 al i t is calculated as al i t 1 ϕ i t ω i t n i t jl i t for juveniles leaving represents the number of pairs of juvenile birds that were raised to fledging at site i in year t 3 survived to breed

year t 1 that did not breed at site i in year t i i t is calculated as follows first a pool with the total number of pairs leaving their site and available for immigration into all sites is calculated as pool t j 1 m al j t jl j t settlers t desettlers t the terms settlers t and desettlers t refer to the sum of all pairs that colonize and decolonize any site in year t and they are explained below we define a model rid i t for the relative distribution of this pool across the sites in year t as a weighted sum of a deterministic component id i t and a stochastic component is i t the deterministic component is a log linear regression model id i t 1 1 exp id 0 id 1 q i id 2 a i t ϵ i t id the ground truth values for id i t were calculated as j 1 j i m p j i t n j t j 1 j i m k 1 k j m p j k t n j t where values p j i t are the proportion of birds that leave site j in year t and breed in site i in year t 1 these values are taken for transitions for adults between large sites from table 4 in spendelow et al 2016 table 8 we assume that transition values for adults and juveniles are quantitatively similar the model coefficients were adjusted as id 0 0 485 id 1 6 025 and id 2 2 117 the stochastic component is i t is drawn from a normal distribution is i t n μ σ 2 with mean μ 0 241 and standard deviation σ 0 176 derived from the ground truth values for id i t the stochasticity of the model rn is calculated as the average squared standard error of id i t we calculate this error as rn j 1 m l k 1 k t max epsilon j l id 2 m t max where j 1 j m and k 1 k t max represent the sites and years for which transition data across sites is available in our case large sites from 1988 through 2008 the relative immigration distribution rid i t is defined as rid i t 1 rn id i t rn is i t j 1 m d i j n i t where d i j 1 i j m is the distance in kilometers between sites i and j the component j 1 m d i j n i t introduces a penalizing factor for sites with neighboring attractive breeding sites this distribution is normalized i e rid i t norm rid i t j 1 m rid j t finally i i t is calculated as i i t col i t rid i t norm pool t al i t jl i t non large sites are subjected to colonization and decolonization events the probabilities for colonization p col i 1 and decolonization p decol i 1 are site specific and are modeled as the probability for each site i to transit from having 0 pairs in year t n i t 0 to 1 or more pairs in year t 1 n i t 1 0 and the probability to transit from n i t 0 to n i t 0 respectively these are estimated as sample probabilities

for the first time into the site this number of pairs is drawn from a poisson distribution n i t 1 p λ expsettlers where expsettlers is the expected number of pairs that colonize a previously abandoned site this value has been estimated to 4 as the median from historical data table 4 when a small or medium sized site enters decolonization mode a number of pairs leave the site this number is drawn from a binomial distribution n i t 1 b maxdec pdec where maxdec is the maximum number of pairs that have ever been observed in the historical data u s fish and wildlife service 2010 to leave

site has entered decolonization mode it will remain in this mode until n i t 0 when decol i t 0 the model was implemented in r language core team 2016 log linear models were calculated using function glm from package stats and the truncated normal distribution was simulated using package truncnorm trautmann et al 2014 colonization and decolonization events override the dynamics defined by equation n i t 1 round as i t js i t i i t 1 in the sites in colonization and decolonization mode moreover the pairs that colonize any site the same year that it enters colonization mode i e the settlers are subtracted from the immigration pool in year t pool t as the term settlers t likewise the pairs that decolonize any site the same year that it enters decolonization mode i e the de settlers are added to the immigration pool in year t pool t as the term desettlers t these terms are calculated as settlers t i n i t 1 and desettlers t j n j t for each site i and j that enters colonization and decolonization mode respectively in year t 3 results we ran 1000 simulations of our model each run was simulated for 50 years we analyzed the following metrics from the simulations output a the number of colonizations and decolonizations per year b the number of pairs that colonize each site i e breed at a site the year that it enters colonization mode c the number of pairs that decolonize each site i e abandon a site the year that it enters decolonization mode d the proportion of birds that breed at large sites at the end of each simulation e the minimum and maximum number of pairs that breed in large sites in each simulation across all simulated years f the length of occupation i e the number of years that small and medium colonies remain colonized i e with at least 1 pair until their abandonment and g the number of initially small colonies that become large or medium during the simulated years and maintain this size until the end of the simulation we also simulated one type of disaster by eliminating the breeders in a large colony the simulation results suggest that the percentage of years in which a single site was colonized is about 32 around 16 000 from the total of 1000 50 50 000 years simulated years where 2 colonizations occur are more infrequent and this tendency continues as the number of colonizations grows this trend is mirrored by the distribution of decolonizations that occur in each year fig 2 the results also show that the majority of the colonizations and decolonizations involve a small number of pairs 1 10 fig 3 nevertheless a small proportion of colonizations involve a larger number of pairs in the range 50 100 pairs these rare colonizations involving large numbers of pairs have been observed in historical data table 4 however a few decolonizations involving 27 37 pairs table 5 were not captured by our model the model also predicts that the duration of occupation for small and medium size colonies is short in the majority of cases the median and mode are 10 and 4 years respectively fig 4 this result is consistent with the observed fact that most small and medium sites are intermittently occupied i e they become colonized and then are abandoned a few years later table 2 the simulations also predict that the proportion of pairs that breed in large colonies in the last year of the simulation falls in the range 0 65 1 00 fig 5 this is a broader range than the proportion observed in the period 1988 2015 0 85 0 99 table 2 but proportions as low as 0 7 were recorded in historical data prior to 1988 nisbet 1980 the model predicts that the total number of pairs that breed in large colonies is usually in the range 2700 4000 fig 6 due to the unstable occupation dynamics of small and medium size sites we decided to use this metric instead of using the total number of pairs across all sites this metric is also consistent with historical data table 2 the number of initially small colonies that become medium or large and maintain this size until the last year of the 50 year simulation is about 1 2 and 1 respectively this conforms to the historical data which indicate that the frequencies of formation of persistently large and persistently medium colonies are both on the order of 0 03y 1 see supplementary material we also simulated an alternative scenario where one large colony bird island is not present in the system this could emulate the effect of a sudden catastrophe in the population with the exception of the pairs that were provided by this colony and are now absent the metrics analyzed do not differ substantially from those from the original scenario this could be an indicator of the high resilience of the studied system in order to assess the sensitivity of our model to changes in parameters we simulated different variations of it particularly we analyzed the effect of changes in juvenile and adult fidelity on the proportion of birds that breed in large colonies in the last simulated year fig 7 in these variations a common adult or juvenile fidelity value was set for all colonies overriding the derived values from the regression models for ϕ i t and ρ i t defined in section 2 the results show small fluctuations in the proportion of pairs breeding in large colonies at the end of the simulation however we did not observe any clear tendency linking juvenile and adult fidelity with this proportion we also analyzed the effect of varying productivity juvenile and adult survival on the maximum number of pairs in large colonies across all simulated years fig 8 the results show that the system collapses for values lower than a threshold for instance for adult survival this threshold is found around 0 8 after this threshold is reached the results show an exponential relationship between each one of these parameters and this number of pairs the steepness of this relationship depends on the altered parameter 4 discussion and conclusions seabird populations are often considered to function as metapopulations e g breton et al 2014 ponchon et al 2015 sanz aguilar et al 2016 this tendency is driven in part by the naturally fragmented nature of the populations this is insufficient however for concluding a metapopulation exists rather than a suite of isolated populations or a single large population smith and green 2005 one needs evidence of somewhat isolated local dynamics as well as extinction recolonization dynamics colonial seabirds can exhibit a type of metapopulation dynamics referred to as mainland island metapopulation dynamics whereby one or a few very large colonies exhibit long term persistence with ephemeral smaller patches that are colonized by birds emigrating from the larger patches dolman 2012 looking at the map fig 1 three large colonies lie on an axis of about 140 km running from wsw to ene and almost all of the small and medium colonies lie either to the west or east of them this is probably a quirk of geomorphology there are very few suitable islands along this axis except for the three occupied by large colonies historically penikese island was also very large but that conforms to the same pattern thus the mainland island configuration of our metapopulation is also a central peripheral pattern the biggest difficulty in understanding metapopulation dynamics for seabirds can be documenting quantifying and modeling colonization and decolonization events payo payo et al 2017 sherley et al 2017 southwell et al 2017 this can be problematic when colonization events are rare munilla et al 2016 which can occur when most colonies are large and in species where social dynamics affect colonization ponchon et al 2015 reed and levine 2005 schippers et al 2011 the difficulty of understanding colonization decolonization dynamics is exacerbated in species with delayed breeding by the difficulty of tracking juvenile and long distance movements bicknell et al 2014 yannic et al 2016 we used data from a long term study to quantify the long term dynamics of site occupancy of roseate terns in the north atlantic spendelow et al 2016 and we used the model to make inferences about the dynamics governing the system in our system productivity increases strongly with site quality q i which is destabilizing in the sense that it would increase the concentration of the population into a few large colonies with high q i any additional dependence on n i t would be additionally destabilizing in the sense that it could lead to a runaway increase in the total population feeding into this cycle might be conspecific attraction of dispersers which is often exhibited by colonial species reed and dobson 1993 counteracting this destabilizing tendency we included an inverse relationship between juvenile survival and site quality where quality was defined as average population size so at our larger sites we modeled and find field evidence of density dependence acting in the large colonies there is some evidence of density dependent colonization dynamics reported in other seabird metapopulations lisnizer et al 2015 matthiopoulos et al 2005 pozzi et al 2015 as well as source sink dynamics lisnizer et al 2015 ponchon et al 2015 sanz aguilar et al 2016 as might be expected in a mainland island metapopulation we found different local dynamics in small and medium colonies in our system these exhibited dynamics that were more stochastic and density independent than those of the large colonies resulting in local decolonizations and recolonizations we found that we had to model colonization and decolonization events separately from our general model of emigration from sites and allocation of the pool of immigrants when we did not model colonization and decolonization as special cases our model predicted that these events usually involve large numbers of pairs spearheading the colonization and abandonment of sites although colonizations and decolonizations involving large numbers of pairs exist in the historical data they are rare and the vast majority of colonizations and decolonizations involve small numbers of pairs therefore we had to adapt the model so that it reflects this property of the system the difference in local dynamics between small and medium sites and large sites reinforces our view that small and medium sites were qualitatively different from large sites consequently the processes governing their dynamics were modeled differently in our model productivity adult survival and juvenile survival appear to be the fundamental aspects that make the model consistent with the observations in other words minor changes in these aspects have profound effects on the dynamics of the model and slight deviations in the parameter values obtained from our data rapidly lead the model dynamics either to population collapse or to uncontrolled growth in the numbers of pairs resulting in levels of population significantly larger than in the observed data we also found that expected population size of large colonies exhibits a threshold sensitivity to adult survival that is over a very small range of values populations went from large to non existent this type of threshold vulnerability to changes in adult survival has been reported before mortensen and reed 2016 but it is not often investigated traditional vital rate sensitivity analyses sometimes report adult survival rate to be the most sensitive vital rate for population growth rate in species with low reproductive rates breininger et al 1999 but there is little consistency in this result across analytical methods fefferman and reed 2006 mortensen and reed 2016 wisdom et al 2000 conversely variations in fidelity do not seem to have a significant impact on the dynamics of the model the model simulations reflect a strong dichotomic distribution with large colonies on one side and small and medium colonies on the other the vast majority of the pairs about 80 90 breed in large colonies during the last year of each simulation changes in the parameters associated with fidelity cause minor oscillations on these percentages but do not reflect a clear monotonic trend linking fidelity and proportion of pairs that breed in large colonies interestingly we found a small but unexpected oscillatory relationship between juvenile and adult fidelity and the proportion of pairs in large colonies in the last year of each simulation this relationship is especially clear for juvenile fidelity we were unable to give an explanation for this phenomenon and we appreciate any hypotheses from readers that would shed light on it the inverse correlation between juvenile survival and site quality acts as a stabilizing factor of the population and counterbalances the destabilizing effect of the positive correlation between productivity and site quality this latter positive correlation tends to destabilize the system because it creates a positive feedback between site quality and productivity that causes the population to grow unrestrained our model treats dispersal as a two step process emigration from colony site i is treated as an intrinsic property of site i and is independent of the destination colonies of the emigrating pairs pairs that emigrate from all sites enter a common pool and are re distributed with the condition that they do not breed in the same colony from which they emigrated in the same year the proportion of pairs that immigrate into colony site j i is modeled as a function of q j and is independent of the colonies of origin of the immigrating pairs we found it unnecessary to explicitly consider pairwise co dependences to model migration between each pair of sites we also found that colonization and decolonization needed to be modeled as separate events from the rest of the migration dynamics this was because the colonization and decolonization dynamics of small and medium colonies and large colonies are different in fact colonization and decolonization dynamics of small and medium colonies are stochastic events that frequently involve large numbers of pairs and apparently do not occur in large colonies our model successfully reproduces several distinctive features of the northwest atlantic metapopulation of roseate terns the metapopulation includes 2 4 large colonies which hold 85 95 of the total numbers and remain similarly large for long periods in our model this results from our assumptions that each colony site is characterized by a single constant intrinsic quality that adult and juvenile fidelity rates are directly correlated with quality and that birds that leave their origin sites are allocated among possible destination sites in proportion to the relative quality of these destination sites generating a source sink dynamics we estimated the quality of each site from the average number of pairs over the 28 year observation period the metapopulation also includes about 30 sites with low or medium values of intrinsic quality most of which are occupied intermittently colonizations and decolonizations are fairly frequent and sometimes involve much larger numbers of birds than what the intrinsic quality of the site would indicate in our model we found it necessary to model colonizations and decolonizations as stochastic events separately from our model of dispersal among sites already occupied which predicted only small numbers of birds entering or leaving low quality sites the numbers of breeding pairs in each of the large colonies and the total number of pairs in the metapopulation remain within moderately narrow bounds over periods of decades in spite of positive correlations between colony size and breeding productivity adult fidelity and juvenile fidelity all of which would be expected to be destabilizing in our model both colony and total numbers are stabilized by introducing an inverse relationship between juvenile survival and colony size we did not find it necessary to include other negatively density dependent factors either at the level of the colony or the metapopulation in addition to colonizations and decolonizations numbers of pairs at the large and medium colonies fluctuate from year to year and several of the demographic parameters that have been measured juvenile survival adult and juvenile dispersal rates also vary among years our model was able to reproduce the observed fluctuations in numbers by incorporating stochastic variation in the same demographic parameters being the amplitude of this variation adjusted to approximate the observed range in the variations of the model where common values for adult survival juvenile survival and productivity rates were used for all years and sites there exists a tipping point for the value of adult survival rate around 0 835 over which the population in the system becomes unstable in the long term fig 8 this is consistent with the data from field observations table 6 the tipping point for productivity in our model approximately 1 1 is also consistent with field data table 3 the sensitivity of our model to changes in the value of these parameters may help explain the observed

25364,movement is a fundamental element of animal behaviour and it is the primary way through which animals respond to environmental changes therefore understanding the drivers of individual movement is essential for species conservation the endangered saimaa ringed seal phoca hispida saimensis lives land locked in lake saimaa and is affected by various anthropogenic factors telemetry studies provide critical information but are insufficient to identify the mechanisms responsible for particular movement patterns to better understand these mechanisms and to predict how changed movement patterns could influence the subspecies spatial ecology we developed an individual based movement model we divided the seals daily routines into foraging and resting and explored how well the model captured observed home ranges and other movement metrics here we present the model its predictions of home ranges and its sensitivity to model assumptions and parameter uncertainty we used movement data from one individual to calibrate the model but this resulted in poor predictions of home range sizes of five seals used for validation this suggests that differences in movement paths not only reflect different landscape configurations but also differences among the individuals state and personalities therefore we separately re calibrated the model to data from five individuals reproducing their home ranges habitat use and movement paths more accurately although ignoring many aspects of seal behaviour the model can be applied as a tool to guide further data collection and analysis study seal ecology and evaluate the efficacy of various conservation measures keywords bycatch mortality conservation home range pattern oriented modelling phoca hispida saimensis saimaa ringed seal spatially explicit individual based model 1 introduction understanding the drivers of animal movement is essential for preserving populations and species movement as with any other behaviour is related to the resulting payoff of that particular action some types of movements such as foraging predator avoidance or finding a mate may produce proximate payoff they are all important considering the ultimate goal of individuals reproducing and passing genes forward nathan et al 2008 even though the ultimate driving forces behind movements are similar across species there is a wide variety in movement patterns movement can be oriented towards or away from certain areas nathan et al 2008 and the scale of the movements may vary from metres to thousands of kilometres depending on the species moreover the individual variation within species is often remarkable e g austin et al 2004 ball et al 2001 schwarzkopf and alford 2002 animal movements can be studied using remote techniques such as telemetry vhf or satellite tags use of tags enables observation of animal movements and habitat selection patterns in addition to the location tags can record environmental conditions or the physiological status of individuals telemetry techniques enable collecting large high resolution datasets therefore the method has been widely applied in studying movements of species in many taxa from insects to large mammals chudzińska et al 2016 hake et al 2001 hart and hyrenbach 2009 hedin and ranius 2002 höjesjö et al 2007 rautio et al 2013 wabakken et al 2007 telemetry data are typically analysed using a statistical approach that enables identification of home range sizes activity patterns variations in movement distances and auto correlation in movement paths e g fleming et al 2014 2015 such correlative studies help identifying relevant movement patterns such as distributions of step lengths and changes in directions or of the time allocated to different movement related behaviours morales et al 2010 van moorter et al 2009 mechanistic models then can take these patterns into account pauli et al 2013 individual based models ibms are particularly suitable for this purpose as they allow us to explicitly represent individual animals and their behavioural decisions ibms can be useful whenever variability among individuals local interactions with other individuals or their abiotic environment or adaptive behaviour are considered essential deangelis and grimm 2014 railsback and grimm 2012 here we combine telemetry data and individual based modelling to develop a model capable of predicting saimaa ringed seal phoca hispida saimensis movement patterns and emergent home range behaviour next generation ecological models are likely to be increasingly based on standardized sub models that use first principles to represent mechanisms and behaviours such as foraging movement and home range behaviour grimm and berger 2016 therefore our model could be used as a tool for seal conservation when integrated within a population model or coupled with other techniques saimaa ringed seal is a subspecies of ringed seal that became isolated in lake saimaa finland after the last ice age about 9500 years ago nyman et al 2014 the subspecies is categorized as endangered liukko et al 2016 and currently there are only about 350 seals kunnasranta et al 2016 the population may have included up to 1300 individuals at the end of the 19th century but hunting and other direct and indirect anthropogenic factors brought the population almost to extinction kokko et al 1999 kokko et al 1998 sipilä 2003 conservation measures have been applied to tackle the problems and the population size is slowly increasing the main threats are currently bycatch in gillnet fishing small population size poor snow conditions for breeding and human disturbances in the breeding period auttila 2015 liukkonen et al 2017 niemi 2013 valtonen et al 2014 conservation measures are widely based on scientific studies providing new information in particular several years of telemetry studies hyvärinen et al 1995 koskela et al 2002 kunnasranta et al 2002 niemi et al 2013a niemi et al 2012 2013b provide detailed information about saimaa ringed seal behavioural ecology and movements our model builds on the observation that seal movements consist of cycles of foraging in deep water areas 15 m and resting on haul out sites next to small islands vincent et al 2017 movements are based on both correlated random walks and unidirectional movements towards foraging areas and haul out sites correlated random walk has been widely used in movement modelling fagan and calabrese 2014 but it results in animals that gradually move away from their initial position nabe nielsen et al 2013 to enable simulated seals to return to previously used haul out and foraging areas we implemented a spatial memory component nabe nielsen et al 2013 this addition of memory enables the formation of home ranges ibms have been used to model movements of many species arrignon et al 2007 bennett and tang 2006 linard et al 2009 nabe nielsen et al 2013 railsback et al 1999 reuter and breckling 1999 and have also been applied to conservation and management eisinger and thulke 2008 eisinger et al 2005 liu et al 2013 lópez alfaro et al 2012 nabe nielsen et al 2010 thulke and eisinger 2008 the ability to include highly detailed information about the environment and species make ibms ideal for modelling endangered or economically important species deangelis and grimm 2014 the proximate purpose of our model is to simulate typical movement patterns of adult individuals to characterize the home range formation and spatial ecology of the species but the model could ultimately be extended to study seal population dynamics under changing environmental conditions and different conservation measure scenarios as with models for conservation biology in general where we usually have too little data to develop models that deliver accurate predictions our model is designed to be realistic enough for relative predictions which allows us to rank different management options here we present the model and compare its results with telemetry data we started model development with the assumption that landscape complexity would explain the observed variation in home range sizes and therefore parameterized the model for a single individual for which the richest data were available after realizing that the resulting parameters did not explain the movement of other seals we reverted to considering the distribution of the parameters of all observed individuals we will discuss how this pragmatic and simplified approach relates to the unresolved problem of extracting movement parameters from tracking data of individuals with different personalities moving in complex environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 biological background here we provide the background information that guided model design ringed seal ecology is relatively well known but much of the knowledge does not apply to the saimaa ringed seal which lives in a freshwater environment that differs considerably from the oceanic environment inhabited by other subspecies adult saimaa ringed seals have home ranges of around 90 km2 on average niemi et al 2012 which is remarkably smaller than home ranges reported in marine ringed seals e g born et al 2004 oksanen et al 2015 for example home ranges of individual baltic ringed seals may cover an area of over 12 000 km2 oksanen et al 2015 which is almost three times larger than the total surface area of lake saimaa in addition to compact home ranges seals sedentary behaviour is apparent from strong haul out site and breeding site fidelity koivuniemi et al 2016 valtonen et al 2012 saimaa ringed seals reach sexual maturity at the age of 4 6 years auttila et al 2016 and give birth in subnivean snow lair during period from mid february to mid march after 11 month gestation period sipilä 2003 after the breeding mother pup pairs stay in close vicinity to the lair site until the pup is weaned at the age of approximately 3 months hyvärinen et al 1995 kunnasranta 2001 niemi et al 2013a males and females that are not breeding also use snow lairs for moulting and resting in the winter time helle et al 1984 when weather gets warmer in the spring lairs collapse and seals start to haul out first on the ice and later on terrestrial platforms these are typically rocks located on the shoreline of small islands but not in the vicinity of the mainland according to telemetry studies saimaa ringed seal individuals use an average of 13 haul out sites during the open water season niemi et al 2013a haul out takes over half of seals time during the moulting period from late april to early june with activity peaking in the afternoon when the temperature is highest which is reported to be beneficial for moulting boily 1995 paterson et al 2012 outside of the moulting season haul out takes no more than 20 of total time and is mainly nocturnal studies suggest that night time haul may be an adaptation to prey fish behaviour and disturbance which is more frequent during the day hyvärinen et al 1995 kunnasranta 2001 kunnasranta et al 2002 niemi et al 2013a haul out is affected by many environmental factors i e amount of solar radiation wind temperature and cloud cover physiological status and possible disturbance carlens et al 2006 moulton et al 2005 moulton et al 2002 niemi et al 2013a especially in the case of the saimaa ringed seal disturbance by humans is an important factor affecting haul out as the lake is a popular place for recreational activities niemi et al 2013a in addition to terrestrial sites resting can also take place in water seals have been observed to make consecutive long duration dives that are suggested to be associated with resting hyvärinen et al 1995 kunnasranta et al 2002 sleeping dives usually take place next to haul out sites and are more likely to occur when the weather is not optimal for haul out e g when it is raining still even though resting is possible in water haul out remains an important part of a seal s daily activities throughout the year with a peak centred around the breeding and moulting seasons kunnasranta et al 2002 there is seasonal variation in saimaa ringed seal feeding patterns seals feeding activity is reduced during spring due to the breeding nursing and moulting seasons in late summer seals need to forage actively to gain weight for the upcoming winter as blubber is needed to provide protection from harsh thermal conditions seals are generalists that feed mainly on small schooling fish species such as perch perca fluviatilis roach rutilus rutilus vendace coregonus albula smelt osmerus eperlanus and ruff gymnocephalus cernuus auttila et al 2015 kunnasranta et al 1999 and use same water regions for feeding throughout the year auttila et al 2015 adult seals prefer deep water 15 m foraging areas where vendace and smelt that are rich in fat content are found outside spawning season kunnasranta et al 1999 other prey species are abundant in shallow areas throughout the year and therefore seal foraging is not only limited to deep water areas the quantity of prey fishes is classified as medium to very high for perch and smelt in northern parts of the lake valkeajärvi et al 2010 and food is not considered to be a limited resource auvinen et al 2005 saimaa ringed seals have not been considered to be threatened by predators however recent findings have shown medium sized carnivores red fox vulpes vulpes and raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides to be interested in ringed seal lairs auttila et al 2014 and some pups are shown to be killed by a red fox auttila 2015 adult individuals are likely able to escape from predators more efficiently than pups which are more prone to predation nevertheless predation forms presumably only a minor part of saimaa ringed seal mortality and it is focused only on pups during winters with poor breeding conditions e g inadequate snow cover 2 2 study area lake saimaa surface area 4400 km2 mean depth 12 m consists of several basins connected via narrow straits kuusisto 1999 we focused on two water basins namely haukivesi and joutenvesi fig 1 together forming one of the most important breeding areas and it is inhabited by approximately 100 seals metsähallitus 2016 comprising almost one third of the estimated population 2 3 telemetry data data used in model development were obtained by equipping six seals with gps gsm tags sea mammal research unit st andrews university uk seals were tagged in the haukivesi basin between years 2007 2011 during the annual moulting season in spring neither of the two tagged females were pregnant or nursing offspring during the study season to our knowledge tags were set to record dive data depth duration and to determine the location every 20 min if the seal was in the water and every 60 min if it was hauled out a seal was considered to be hauled out if the wet dry sensor on the tag had been dry for 10 min the haul out was considered to have ended when the sensor had been wet for 40 s in the first phase of pattern oriented model development and parameterization gps telemetry data from one adult male er11 3822 relocations tracking duration 125 days mean swimming speed during the open water season 424 10 m 20 min from the study area were used to develop and calibrate the model this individual had the highest resolution data in the database saimaa ringed seal telemetry database university of eastern finland 2015 in the second phase additional data from five adult individuals he07 3003 relocations 191 d 367 15 m 20 min kj07 4475 relocations 218 d 518 94 m 20 min ol10 2155 180 d 302 27 m 20 min to09 3254 relocations 194 d 505 44 m 20 min and vi09 4618 relocations 199 d 281 88 m 20 min were used for model validation and final calibration of one parameter see section 2 5 all data were limited to the open water season and constrained to the same temporal resolution as the shortest tracking period except for the initial calibration individual er11 whose data were fully used adehabitatlt package calenge 2011 in r r development core and team 2011 was used for calibration additionally datasets of 18 seals were used to develop probability distribution for the speed parameter see section 4 3 model sensitivity appendix e in supplementary material these datasets were not used in model calibration 2 4 the model the model description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2006 grimm et al 2010 its implementation in netlogo 5 2 0 wilensky 1999 is available in the supplementary material in addition in the supplementary material appendix a in supplementary material we provide a trace document transparent and comprehensive model evaludation augusiak et al 2014 grimm et al 2014 schmolke et al 2010 containing evidence that our model was thoughtfully designed correctly implemented thoroughly tested well understood and appropriately used for its intended purpose 2 4 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to simulate seal movement patterns based on assumptions regarding resting and foraging behaviour 2 4 2 entities state variables and scales the area represented in the model haukivesi and joutenvesi basins is 762 km2 the model world consists of a grid of 1000 1000 cells or patches each patch represents an area of 0 00297 km2 54 5 m 54 5 m model entities are habitat patches seal and rock agents habitat patches are either land or water patches land true false some of the land patches were further characterized as island patches island true false land areas larger than 0 01 km2 and less than 2 98 km2 are considered islands in the model the minimum size of an island preferred for haul out is reported to be 0 0002 km2 niemi et al 2013a but was increased to 0 01 km2 in the model to keep the habitat as realistic as possible while taking into account the limited resolution of the map water patches are divided into three categories deep water 15 m shallow water 15 m deep true false and water suitable for haul out sites stone place true false these are water patches next to islands where rocks are created as such areas are regarded as suitable haul out sites the number of potential haul out sites in nature is unknown and was thus estimated from haul out data and home range sizes observed average number of 13 haul out sites per seal per average home range size was extrapolated to the study area consequently a total of 121 haul out sites were randomly created at initialization this number is in accordance with an earlier telemetry study where it was observed that eight gps gsm tracked individuals used in total 104 different haul out sites in the same area niemi et al 2013a the sites used as starting points for seal agent were characterized only by their coordinates init site x 0 1000 y 0 1000 a seal is characterized by its age age in months 48 months exhaustion level exhaustion 0 1 0 999 movement variables including distance travelled in the time step step length randomly set from a normal distribution in metres and direction of movement turning angle 0 360 and memory variables including spatial memory of haul out sites and deep water areas stone cors 0 100 sites deep cors 0 100 sites and the memory value of each visited haul out site memory stones list 0 1 7 0 99 please note that due to memory decay model seals rarely remembered more than 5 sites only one seal is simulated at a time the time step is 20 min when the seal is swimming and 60 min when it is hauled out this matches the resolution of data recorded with gps gsm tags the ice covered season january march is omitted as seal is moving in a smaller area within its home range kelly et al 2010 the simulation starts at the beginning of april and is first run for 12 5 months during the last 0 5 months of this period the seal has its initial site as the only target for haul out this warm up period enables the seal to have some haul out sites and deep water areas in its memory before the actual data collection begins in the middle of consecutive april when the warm up period of 12 5 months have passed results were then recorded after this warm up period for duration of 4 17 months for individual er11 and 5 96 months for the rest of the individuals 2 4 3 process overview and scheduling the processes described below are executed in the same order in each time step fig 2 here only summary descriptions of the processes are provided see section 2 4 7 submodels for details submodel names are given in italics 1 update time step length of time step is updated depending on the seal s activity 2 update age the seal s age in months is updated ice covered season january march is skipped by adding 3 months to the seal s age 3 list coordinates coordinates of the seal s location are added to a list for home range calculations 4 decay memory memory values of the visited haul out sites are updated as memory decays over time 5 remember haul outs if the seal is currently hauled out the site is added to memory 6 rest if the seal s exhaustion is above the moving threshold see section 2 4 7 submodels table 1 or there is a suitable haul out site near by it rests the seal starts moving again when exhaustion decreases below the moving threshold movement mode is set to 1 sets a deep water target patch if there are deep water patches in the seal s memory and to mode 2 correlated random walk if that is not the case 7 move there are three different movement modes movement to a previously visited deep water patch mode 1 correlated random walk mode 2 and movement towards a haul out site mode 3 8 write results update plots output files are written and plots are updated 2 4 4 design concepts the design concepts interaction and collectives do not apply to this model adaptation objectives and prediction are represented implicitly in the imposed haul out behaviour 2 4 4 1 basic principles seal movements consist of cycles of foraging in deep water areas and resting on haul out sites the seal remembers visited haul out sites and foraging areas to some extent which has influence on the space use in addition we implicitly represent bioenergetics as exhaustion which requires haul out and increases with foraging time 2 4 4 2 emergence movement patterns as characterized by the size of animal home ranges and time spent either moving or hauled out emerge partly from animal personalities hence in the model different personalities appear as different speed parameter values for individual seals furthermore the capacity and permanence of the seal s memory of visited haul out sites and foraging areas plays a role in the emergence of movement patterns in addition the location and number of potential haul out sites in the area affect the seal s movements in the model 2 4 4 3 learning the seal learns about its habitat by remembering visited haul out sites and deep water grid cells 2 4 4 4 sensing the seal senses and avoids land in its moving direction it also senses if it is in a deep water area or if there is a haul out site nearby and it knows the distance to visited haul out rocks 2 4 4 5 stochasticity step length in all movement modes and moving direction in movement mode 2 correlated random walk are drawn from truncated normal distributions in addition the positions of haul out sites are randomly assigned at initialization furthermore haul out sites and deep water foraging areas that seal uses may differ among replicates this introduces another factor creating stochasticity 2 4 4 6 observation position distance from home km movement duration h and duration of haul outs h are measured every time step home refers to the location where the seal is initialized 2 4 5 initialization the world is created by importing gis shape files for water deep water 15 m and land areas a total of 121 haul out rocks see section 2 4 2 entities state variables and scales for estimation of number of haul out sites implemented are randomly created near islands one seal is created and positioned on a user defined haul out site set to resting mode and given an empty memory except for the current haul out site an exhaustion of 0 998 maximum exhaustion 0 999 and an age of three months 2 4 6 input data the model does not include input of data representing time varying environmental drivers 2 4 7 submodels model parameters are listed in table 1 2 4 7 1 update time step age and time the time step is set to 20 min if the seal is moving and to 60 min if it is hauled out age and current time are updated accordingly 2 4 7 2 list coordinates coordinates of the seal s location are stored in a list for home range estimations because the time step is three times longer 60 min when hauled out every pair of haul out site coordinates are listed three times to avoid bias in the results by emphasizing relocations when moving in addition only 25 of movement coordinates are listed to match the resolution of telemetry data gps gsm tags fail to connect to the satellites occasionally and therefore the locations may not be obtained every 20 min as programmed 2 4 7 3 decay memory the seal remembers visited haul out sites however memory decays over time i e seal forgets the last haul out site on the list will be removed if there are already 100 sites in the memory or if the memory value for a site is 10 8 memory decay is represented according to nabe nielsen et al 2013 m c t 1 m c t m r m c t 1 m c t where t is time in units of time steps m c is the memory of a location c unitless and m r is the reference memory decay rate 1 h 2 4 7 4 remembering haul outs if the seal is hauled out the site is added to its memory and given a memory value of 0 99 in cases where the site is already in the seal s memory the entry representing the earlier visit is removed 2 4 7 5 rest if the seal is hauled out or sleeping in water exhaustion decreases following e c t 1 e c t r r e c t 1 e c t e c m a x where t is time e c is the exhaustion level e c max is the maximum of exhaustion level and r r is the exhaustion recovery rate if exhaustion falls below the moving threshold the exhaustion level is set to 0 1 and either movement mode 1 or 2 is selected see below for definition of movement modes 2 4 7 6 move 2 4 7 6 1 movement modes there are three movement modes that the seal can perform after hauling out during which movement mode is false the seal heads to a deep water patch to forage mode 1 having reached the target deep water grid cell it starts moving by correlated random walk mode 2 after foraging the seal selects haul out site based on distance and memory factors and goes there to rest mode 3 the choice between these three movement modes is based on the state variable exhaustion when the seal is hauled out its level of exhaustion decreases once it decreases below the moving threshold either movement mode 1 or 2 is selected the seal heads to an earlier visited deep water patch mode 1 if it knows any or starts moving by correlated random walk mode 2 if it has not visited any deep water areas yet e g at the initialization of the model once a deep water area is reached movement mode 2 is set provided that the seal was not in mode 2 already when exhaustion reaches the level of parameter exhaustion threshold movement mode 3 is selected and the seal goes to a haul out site to rest and the movement mode is set to false alternatively the seal can also rest when there is a suitable haul out site within distance of the parameter ho distance this heuristic assumption of allowing the seal to haul out on near by haul out sites even if not fully exhausted seems appropriate as it allows the seal to save energy if exhaustion exceeds its maximum value before reaching a haul out site the seal sleeps in water until exhaustion decreases low enough and it starts moving again the sleep in water procedure is not possible in deep water the following processes are common to all movement modes and are performed before moving in the order listed 1 adjust step length step length is drawn from a normal distribution with its mean set to the parameter mean speed adults and its standard deviation to sd speed adults minimum step length is set to 0 1 to avoid seals moving backwards 2 adjust turning angle turning angle is drawn from a normal distribution with its mean set to the parameter mean turning and its standard deviation to sd turning 3 set exhaustion rate exhaustion rate is set to the value of parameter exhaustion rate adults 4 update exhaustion level exhaustion level increases in every movement step according to e c t 1 e c t e x h r e c t 1 e c t e c m a x where exhr is the exhaustion rate and e c is the exhaustion level unitless 5 remember deep if the seal is in a deep water patch the patch is added to the seal s memory earlier visits to that patch are removed from memory if a target deep water patch is within the step length or a shorter distance the seal moves there 2 4 7 6 2 targeted vs non targeted movements earlier described movement modes can be further divided into targeted and non targeted moving in non targeted moving the seal moves by correlated random walk mode 2 the turning angle is updated every time step land is avoided if necessary and a step is taken forward in targeted moving movement is directed either towards a deep water foraging area mode 1 or a haul out site mode 3 if the seal is moving towards a deep water area one deep water grid cell is randomly selected from the seal s memory and set as a target the selection of the target haul out site is based on the distance from the seal s position and time when the seal last visited that site as described below calculate haul out site attraction value target haul out site is chosen by calculating the attraction values of previously visited haul out sites as follows a c t 1 m c t d c t where a c is the attraction value of the site m c is the memory value of the site see submodel decay memory and d c is the distance of visited haul out sites to the seal the haul out site with the smallest value is chosen as a target 2 4 7 6 3 avoid land the design of the land avoidance procedure used the approach described by dalleau 2013 a flow diagram of the procedure is presented in fig 3 this submodel consists of four different procedures 1 see if there is land ahead the seal checks if there is land ahead within one step length or less distances smaller than one step length are needed to avoid the seal jumping over narrow land areas 2 avoid land decision land avoidance direction selection i e left or right is based on two steps first the seal turns 45 left and right and calculates which turning direction has less land within an angle of 90 and a radius defined by the parameter land distance if there is an equal amount of land in both directions the moving direction is chosen randomly 3 avoid land right first the seal checks if there is land ahead in its moving direction see if land ahead if not the seal turns counter clockwise in steps of 10 until it detects land in its moving direction then the seal chooses the previous turning direction and takes a step forward this makes the seal follow the shoreline of an island if the avoid land decision was set to right at the beginning of this procedure the seal will avoid it from the right side of the detected land it turns clockwise in steps of 10 until there is no land ahead and then takes a step forward if the seal has already turned 360 and has not encountered land it takes a step towards the set target sometimes the step length is long enough to make the seal encounter land in every direction in such case step length is reduced by 50 and the land avoidance procedure is repeated this reduction is repeated until the seal can move when the angle between seal s current heading and its target is small 45 land is most likely avoided if there is no land ahead and the angle between heading and target is 45 land avoidance mode is turned off 4 avoid land left this procedure is identical to avoid land right except that the seal turns clockwise if there is no land in its moving direction and counter clockwise if there is this makes the seal avoid land from the left side 2 4 7 7 write results update plots the output variables distance from home and moving duration and additionally coordinates of seal movements for home range estimations are written into an output file plots of the seal s distance from home moving duration and haul out duration are updated every time step 2 5 parameterization the model was developed parameterized and tested following the pattern oriented framework grimm and railsback 2012 grimm et al 2005 in two distinct phases nine parameters were inversely determined grimm and railsback 2012 wiegand et al 2003 via calibration of two movement patterns obtained from one tracked male er11 see section 2 3 the patterns used were moving duration and distance from home and these were measured from both simulated and telemetry tagged seals home represents the location where the seal was captured for telemetry data but in the model it refers to the initial position of the seal distance from home was recorded at each time step and moving duration was measured when the seal reached haul out site after a foraging bout parameter estimation was performed in two rounds first parameters were varied over a large range exhaustion rate adults 0 1 00 mean speed adults 0 600 00 sd speed adults 0 200 00 mean turning 10 00 10 00 sd turning 0 180 00 ref mem decay rate 0 1 00 land distance 1 00 10 00 second they were fine tuned by being varied over a narrower range around the optimal values identified in the first round exhaustion rate adults 0 05 0 09 mean speed adults 100 00 300 00 sd speed adults 100 00 200 00 mean turning 5 00 5 00 sd turning 10 00 60 00 ref mem decay rate 0 0 35 land distance 3 00 10 00 in both cases a latin hypercube sampling design iványi et al 1979 was used by means of the tgp r package gramacy 2007 gramacy and taddy 2010 to draw 800 parameter sets from the entire parameter space defined by the nine parameters selected for calibration for each parameter set the model was run ten times means of the output variables medians were calculated and compared to telemetry data to assess model performance deviation from telemetry data was calculated according to d e v i a t i o n o b s s i m o b s where obs is the observed median for the two variables calculated from the telemetry data while sim is the mean of the model runs medians of the given output variables based on the first round of simulations and following a filtering approach wiegand et al 2004 the parameter sets having a deviation for the moving duration variable below 15 were selected among the sets passing this first filter only the parameter sets presenting a total combined deviation for both patterns below 500 were retained to determine the range for the second round of simulations in this stage the parameter set producing the lowest total deviation from telemetry data was chosen since the duration of haul out events is influenced only by exhaustion recovery rate we calibrated this parameter alone via a sensitivity experiment parameter range 0 1 00 steps 0 01 exhaustion recovery rate was calibrated to allow seals to haul out for the time observed by niemi et al 2013a haul out does not include any stochastic elements among runs therefore one run per parameter value was performed the variation within runs arises from the state of an individual entering haul out i e exhaustion level the parameter value producing the lowest deviation in comparison to telemetry data was chosen in order to enable seal haul out not only when it is exhausted but also when there is a suitable haul out site nearby parameters ho distance and exhaustion ho limit were added see table 1 for parameter description and calibrated ho distance values tested 0 1 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 exhaustion ho limit values tested 0 10 0 15 0 20 0 25 0 30 ho distances determines the distance from which a seal can observe a haul out site and exhaustion ho limit sets the minimum value of exhaustion at which haul out can be initialised to avoid a seal starting to haul out right after a previous haul out event parameters were calibrated to match the observed pattern of calibration individual and the parameter values resulting in the highest number of replicates that did not statistically differ from the observed datasets one way anova p 0 05 were selected the model was not able to reproduce the distance from home pattern of the five individuals used for validation see results section 3 2 since the global sensitivity analysis see results section 3 3 indicated that the mean speed adults parameter had the strongest effect on this model output we calibrated this parameter separately for the five individuals used for model validation tested ranges er11 60 210 m 20 min he07 250 400 m 20 min kj07 250 400 m 20 min ol10 10 160 m 20 min to09 110 300 m 20 min vi09 20 250 m 20 min simulations were replicated ten times the parameter values resulting in the highest number of replicates that did not statistically differ from the observed datasets one way anova p 0 05 were selected 2 6 sensitivity analyses we conducted a global sensitivity analysis to identify the model parameters with the strongest influence on model outputs we applied the variance decomposition technique of sobol 1993 to decompose the model outputs variance into variances attributable to each input parameter while also evaluating the interaction between parameters sobol first order sensitivity indices si measure the effect of varying a focus parameter alone but averaged over variations in other input parameters thus providing information on the average reduction of output variance when the parameter is fixed the total effect indices sti measure the contribution to the output variance of the focus parameter including all variance caused by its interactions of any order with any other input parameters we used the sensitivity r package pujol et al 2016 which implements the monte carlo estimation of the sobol s indices using the improved formulas of jansen 1999 and saltelli et al 2010 the number of tested settings was given by m p 2 where m is the size of the monte carlo sample matrix and p is the number of parameters to analyse we selected seven parameters that varied over the following ranges exh adult exhaustion rate adults 0 01 0 25 sl adult mean speed adults 10 600 slsdadult sd speed adults 10 600 ta adult mean turning 10 to 10 tasdadult sd turning 10 100 m r ref mem decay rate 0 1 and vis land distance 1 10 we chose a sample matrix of size 400 and sobol first order and total effect indices were computed for each parameter from a total number of runs of 400 7 2 3600 the sensitivity analysis examined two model outputs moving duration and distance from home because the locations of haul out sites most likely influence the patterns we simulated each of the parameter combinations keeping the same haul out site positions through all runs the simulations were performed for 4 066 months as long as the movements of the calibration individual were monitored in 2011 model runs were replicated 2 times to study the effects of the number and location of haul out sites we ran simulations initialising the model with 120 240 480 960 and 1920 rocks haul out sites were either kept in the same locations between replicates or randomly distributed at the beginning of each replicate in both scenarios simulations were replicated five times at each haul out site density simulations were initialised from the location where the individual used in model parameterization er11 was captured in the field survey and the model was run for 4 17 months furthermore we examined the extent to which the initial selection of haul out sites and deep water areas during the warm up period influenced model outputs to do this the seal was initialised having five fixed haul out sites and deep water patches in its memory the obtained results were compared to simulations run using the normal settings i e empty memory simulations were replicated 15 times and the model was run for 4 17 months in each replicate 3 results 3 1 calibration results of the 10 replicates with the optimal parameter set table 1 indicated that the model reproduced the range of values of the two tested patterns reasonably well regarding the distance from home variable 2 out of 10 replicates did not statistically differ from the field data mean of the model replicates means 2 15 km range 0 90 5 20 km and in the case of moving duration pattern 5 out of 10 replicates did not differ from the calibration dataset mean of the model replicates means 11 68 h range 9 11 15 33 h fig 4 see also appendix b in supplementary material 3 2 validation after calibration we tested the model performance on five independent datasets there were large differences between the recorded datasets and the model was not able to reproduce all the patterns observed in nature fig 5 see also appendix b in supplementary material furthermore large variation among replicated simulations decreased model fits the simulated distance moved from home and time between consecutive hauls were generally close to the average values observed in nature and although there was a large variation in movement patterns among the satellite tracked animals the range of values produced by the model were within the range of values observed for most satellite tracked animals still in the case of the distance from home pattern there were statistically significant differences one way anova p 0 05 in all replicates compared to field datasets the moving duration pattern was well reproduced for individuals he07 and kj07 the number of replicates that did not statistically differ were 9 and 8 out of 10 respectively 3 3 sensitivity analysis the global sensitivity analysis showed that variations in moving duration were driven only by the exhaustion rate of adults while the mean swimming speed of adults had the strongest effects on the variable distance from home interactions between parameters were more important in the latter variable fig 6 the number of haul out sites had a significant effect on both output variables full factorial two way anova distance from home p 0 001 moving duration p 0 001 the distribution of haul out sites random distribution at the initialisation of each replicate or same locations in all replicates had a significant effect on distance from home pattern p 0 001 there was no effect on moving duration p 0 104 furthermore the interaction between the number and distribution of haul out sites had significant effects on both patterns distance from home p 0 001 moving duration p 0 001 see also appendix c in supplementary material in addition the stochastic selection of haul out sites and deep water foraging areas during the warm up period increased variability between replicates the standard deviation of the mean was higher for both output variables when selection of haul out sites and deep water foraging areas were based on memory and distance factors distance from home 0 32 km moving duration 1 29 h compared to simulations in which sites were predetermined distance from home 0 16 km moving duration 1 01 h the coefficient of variation of distance from home and moving duration was 65 75 and 29 97 respectively when the sites were selected based on memory and distance factors and 64 84 and 32 77 respectively when sites were predetermined see also appendix d in supplementary material 3 4 re calibration and evaluation of model performance a high degree of variation among satellite tracked animals resulted in deviations from the simulated tracks we introduced individual variation and re calibrated the mean swimming speed parameter for each dataset separately to improve the model fit on observed distance from home patterns as we observed that the swimming speed parameter had the strongest effect on this pattern in the global sensitivity analysis re calibrated mean speed values were he07 250 m 20 min kj07 350 m 20 min ol10 100 m 20 min to09 190 m 20 min and vi09 100 m 20 min after re calibrating this parameter the fit for both output variables improved regarding the distance from home variable all five tested individuals had a reasonably good fit in the case of moving duration variable the model reproduced patterns relatively well for three out of five tested datasets fig 5 see also appendix b in supplementary material for visualization purposes we plotted the movement paths of individuals er11 and vi09 compared to their corresponding simulations fig 7 4 discussion we analysed existing telemetry datasets of six saimaa ringed seals and used them to develop an individual based movement model for adult seals we based the model on assumptions regarding seal resting and foraging behaviour and their ability to memorise these sites our aim was to design and implement a seal movement model that could be further developed into a population model and used for evaluating efficiency of conservation measures we analysed the model to test whether it could reproduce observed patterns of independent datasets that had not been used in model calibration furthermore we tested its sensitivity to model assumptions and parameter uncertainty 4 1 model structure innovations and limitations the model is based on correlated random walk a classical approach for modelling animal movements however correlated random walks cause animals to gradually move away from their starting position therefore it is not optimal for modelling compact home ranges to enable the formation of home ranges similar to those observed in saimaa ringed seal telemetry studies we added spatial memory in the model nabe nielsen et al 2013 applied the concept of spatial memory van moorter et al 2009 on the model of harbour porpoises phocoena phocoena to allow them memorise high quality feeding grounds and previously visited areas we used the approach to have seal memorise foraging areas and haul out sites it used the seal remembers not only the locations of visited haul out sites but also the time since the last visit the seal prefers haul out sites that are nearby and recently visited leading to the emergence of home ranges vincent et al 2017 nabe nielsen et al 2013 applied their model in a fairly homogenous landscape which is in accordance with many of the existing movement models in contrast to earlier memory based movement models we represented the environment in more detail spatial explicitness is especially important in models intended for management purposes deangelis and yurek 2017 lake saimaa is a highly complex and labyrinthine environment 13 000 islands kuusisto 1999 and at the same time a large variation in home range sizes have been previously reported for the saimaa ringed seal niemi et al 2012 therefore we hypothesized that the complex nature of the landscape may explain some of the individual differences in home rage size and shape we developed and implemented a novel land avoidance procedure that is a key feature of our model dalleau 2013 land avoidance enables seal to bypass any land area it encounters while foraging bioenergetics is an important feature of animal movement models and has been incorporated in detail in many ibms e g bennett and tang 2006 hölker and breckling 2005 morales et al 2005 reuter and breckling 1999 we use exhaustion to model seal bioenergetics the parameters were calibrated to match the movement patterns of one individual as no ringed seal bioenergetics data is available implementing seal bioenergetics in more detail would likely result in more realistic presentation of the real system first step for this could be addition of the existing dive data as diving behaviour unarguably has effect on the overall distance seal travels in the current model version we model only two dimensional space use some adult saimaa ringed seal individuals stay within relatively small range while others take trips of tens of kilometres niemi et al 2012 because of this variation capturing all these factors in a single value of parameters is a challenging task sex age body mass or other physical attributes were not considered in either model development or validation as it is not clear how these factors affect movement parameters of adult saimaa ringed seals furthermore it is not known to what extent the individuals knowledge and experience of the environment affects their movement patterns older and more experienced individuals are likely to have more knowledge about the environment since saimaa ringed seal are known to exhibit high site fidelity which can affect their spatial behaviour all data used in this study were obtained from individuals that were classified as adults based on their size even though sex related variation have not been clearly reported in telemetry studies genetic data show a sevenfold male to female gene flow ratio indicating a larger scale of movement in males in the long term valtonen et al 2014 furthermore sex and body mass related variations in movements are observed in grey seals halichoerus grypus and ringed seals austin et al 2004 beck et al 2003 but no clear patterns are reported for saimaa ringed seals in general body mass correlates positively with the extent of movements in mammals harestad and bunnel 1979 lindstedt et al 1986 swihart et al 1988 nevertheless saimaa ringed seal movement patterns vary among individuals depending on their state but such variations are not included in this model adding such variations might help explaining the difference in the movement patterns between satellite tracked and simulated seals in addition to biological factors uncertainty and lack of environmental variables in the model may have impaired the performance location and number of haul out sites in lake saimaa may vary from one year to another due to water level fluctuations therefore our estimates on haul out site number and location are not necessarily accurate which might have affected the model performance nevertheless the number of haul out sites implemented in the model is in accordance with niemi et al 2013a who observed eight gps gsm tagged seal to occupy 104 haul out sites in total in same study region in addition to the uncertainty related to haul out sites it is likely that e g disturbance quality of surrounding environment in terms of foraging areas lair sites and mating partners affect the space use of the seals in the real environment in order to improve the model fit data on environmental factors possibly affecting seal movement patterns should be collected and implemented in the model schick et al 2008 as such data is non existent currently likewise the selection and change of haul out sites can be affected by anthropogenic disturbances e g boat passing by data on the frequency of such disturbances could increase the fit of our model to movement data 4 2 model parameterization and validation we used pattern oriented calibration to find the best parameterization of the model however simulations run with the optimal parameter set yielded a poor fit to the independent telemetry datasets used for validation the model was not able to reproduce the distance from home patterns recorded in the field which were highly variable between tracked seals the saimaa ringed seal shows large intraspecific variability in movement patterns and spatial ecology niemi et al 2012 particularly our field datasets revealed strong variations across individuals in their swimming performance which has a strong effect on the movement distances simulated by our model to implement the intraspecific variability in swimming performance observed in nature in our model we re calibrated the mean swimming speed parameter on an individual basis using data from the five individuals that we initially used for validation which led to a significant improvement in model performance furthermore we observed large variability in exhaustion rates between seals therefore calibration of the exhaustion rate parameter on an individual basis would likely result in a better fit for the moving duration pattern as this parameter was observed to have the strongest effect on the pattern the large variability in the mean swimming speed of adult seals cannot be captured with a single fixed value in consequence for the future evolution of this movement model into a population model targeted at predicting seal population dynamics a probability distribution for the mean speed adults parameter may be implemented we thus developed the probability distribution based on re calibration results and observed field data to account for such individual variability see appendix e in supplementary material morales et al 2004 suggested a similar approach for their elk cervus elaphus movement model which was also developed with a small data set ultimately the probability distribution of seal movement speed should be obtained from as many individuals as possible to improve model fit and to overcome the issue caused by large intraspecific variation in addition identification of the factors influencing seal spatial behaviour would be beneficial seals are highly cognitive mammals and their behaviour is likely affected by many processes that we cannot identify using telemetry data alone using simple movement data for calibrating a model of such cognitively competent animals living in highly heterogeneous environment is challenging morales et al 2004 observed that simple correlated random walk based movement model is too simple for predicting elk movements better match to observed datasets was achieved with a model that included multiple movement states i e multiple correlated random walks that each have different parameter distributions our model would benefit if more information on seal behaviour could be connected to observed individual characteristics or environmental factors for the future development of our saimaa ringed seal model it would be beneficial to identify these seal behavioural states which could be then implemented in the model thus improving the fit identifying individual movement patterns and the motivation behind them would also benefit movement ecology study in general as this aspect is neglected in many cases holyoak et al 2008 4 3 model sensitivity the mean swimming speed had the strongest influence on the distance moved by adult seal from the initial position and thus on the size of its home range on the other hand exhaustion rate was the main and basically the only driver of the time passed between haul outs the quicker the seal gets exhausted the less time it spends foraging before needing to rest on a haul out site in addition to seal related parameters we estimated the sensitivity of movement patterns to environmental factors the higher number of haul out sites we implement in the model the greater is the simulated distance from home and the shorter are the time periods that seals move between consecutive haul out events site selection is partly based on distance to the visited sites which explains the effect of the number of haul out sites on movement patterns to some extent furthermore increasing the availability of haul out sites increases the probability that the seal has a rest even if it is not exhausted consequently the time spent foraging between consecutive haul out events shortens moreover the selection of haul out sites and foraging areas used during the warm up period increases variation between model replicates the model is run for 12 5 months before collecting the results so the seal develops a memory of certain foraging areas and resting sites that are selected in a random way thus introducing variability among model runs 4 4 model application and outlook this paper describes a model predicting saimaa ringed seal movement behaviour we started with a simple hypothesis where we assumed the complexity of the landscape would explain the variation in home range size among the individuals however the differences in the landscape were not sufficient to explain the observed movement patterns therefore the model would benefit from further variables adding some more biological and environmental aspects that affect seal behaviour more studies are needed to find the underlying mechanisms of the observed movement patterns however the current model version forms a sound basis for further development ultimate implementation of seals full life cycle and interactions between individuals in the model would enable the analysis of population dynamics under changing environmental conditions and conservation and management scenarios one of the major factors causing mortality in saimaa ringed seals is bycatch in gillnet fishing kovacs et al 2012 therefore fishing restrictions have been applied in the most important breeding areas despite these restrictions bycatch mortality has remained relatively high auttila 2015 kunnasranta et al 2016 and therefore there is a demand to extend the restrictions both temporally and spatially although the current model version has to be considered preliminary and several improvements could be considered an application of the model could be used to study the effects of different fishing restriction scenarios which would provide much needed information on the effectiveness of mitigation methods acknowledgements we thank lauri mehtätalo anssi vainikka and two anonymous reviewers for their

25364,movement is a fundamental element of animal behaviour and it is the primary way through which animals respond to environmental changes therefore understanding the drivers of individual movement is essential for species conservation the endangered saimaa ringed seal phoca hispida saimensis lives land locked in lake saimaa and is affected by various anthropogenic factors telemetry studies provide critical information but are insufficient to identify the mechanisms responsible for particular movement patterns to better understand these mechanisms and to predict how changed movement patterns could influence the subspecies spatial ecology we developed an individual based movement model we divided the seals daily routines into foraging and resting and explored how well the model captured observed home ranges and other movement metrics here we present the model its predictions of home ranges and its sensitivity to model assumptions and parameter uncertainty we used movement data from one individual to calibrate the model but this resulted in poor predictions of home range sizes of five seals used for validation this suggests that differences in movement paths not only reflect different landscape configurations but also differences among the individuals state and personalities therefore we separately re calibrated the model to data from five individuals reproducing their home ranges habitat use and movement paths more accurately although ignoring many aspects of seal behaviour the model can be applied as a tool to guide further data collection and analysis study seal ecology and evaluate the efficacy of various conservation measures keywords bycatch mortality conservation home range pattern oriented modelling phoca hispida saimensis saimaa ringed seal spatially explicit individual based model 1 introduction understanding the drivers of animal movement is essential for preserving populations and species movement as with any other behaviour is related to the resulting payoff of that particular action some types of movements such as foraging predator avoidance or finding a mate may produce proximate payoff they are all important considering the ultimate goal of individuals reproducing and passing genes forward nathan et al 2008 even though the ultimate driving forces behind movements are similar across species there is a wide variety in movement patterns movement can be oriented towards or away from certain areas nathan et al 2008 and the scale of the movements may vary from metres to thousands of kilometres depending on the species moreover the individual variation within species is often remarkable e g austin et al 2004 ball et al 2001 schwarzkopf and alford 2002 animal movements can be studied using remote techniques such as telemetry vhf or satellite tags use of tags enables observation of animal movements and habitat selection patterns in addition to the location tags can record environmental conditions or the physiological status of individuals telemetry techniques enable collecting large high resolution datasets therefore the method has been widely applied in studying movements of species in many taxa from insects to large mammals chudzińska et al 2016 hake et al 2001 hart and hyrenbach 2009 hedin and ranius 2002 höjesjö et al 2007 rautio et al 2013 wabakken et al 2007 telemetry data are typically analysed using a statistical approach that enables identification of home range sizes activity patterns variations in movement distances and auto correlation in movement paths e g fleming et al 2014 2015 such correlative studies help identifying relevant movement patterns such as distributions of step lengths and changes in directions or of the time allocated to different movement related behaviours morales et al 2010 van moorter et al 2009 mechanistic models then can take these patterns into account pauli et al 2013 individual based models ibms are particularly suitable for this purpose as they allow us to explicitly represent individual animals and their behavioural decisions ibms can be useful whenever variability among individuals local interactions with other individuals or their abiotic environment or adaptive behaviour are considered essential deangelis and grimm 2014 railsback and grimm 2012 here we combine telemetry data and individual based modelling to develop a model capable of predicting saimaa ringed seal phoca hispida saimensis movement patterns and emergent home range behaviour next generation ecological models are likely to be increasingly based on standardized sub models that use first principles to represent mechanisms and behaviours such as foraging movement and home range behaviour grimm and berger 2016 therefore our model could be used as a tool for seal conservation when integrated within a population model or coupled with other techniques saimaa ringed seal is a subspecies of ringed seal that became isolated in lake saimaa finland after the last ice age about 9500 years ago nyman et al 2014 the subspecies is categorized as endangered liukko et al 2016 and currently there are only about 350 seals kunnasranta et al 2016 the population may have included up to 1300 individuals at the end of the 19th century but hunting and other direct and indirect anthropogenic factors brought the population almost to extinction kokko et al 1999 kokko et al 1998 sipilä 2003 conservation measures have been applied to tackle the problems and the population size is slowly increasing the main threats are currently bycatch in gillnet fishing small population size poor snow conditions for breeding and human disturbances in the breeding period auttila 2015 liukkonen et al 2017 niemi 2013 valtonen et al 2014 conservation measures are widely based on scientific studies providing new information in particular several years of telemetry studies hyvärinen et al 1995 koskela et al 2002 kunnasranta et al 2002 niemi et al 2013a niemi et al 2012 2013b provide detailed information about saimaa ringed seal behavioural ecology and movements our model builds on the observation that seal movements consist of cycles of foraging in deep water areas 15 m and resting on haul out sites next to small islands vincent et al 2017 movements are based on both correlated random walks and unidirectional movements towards foraging areas and haul out sites correlated random walk has been widely used in movement modelling fagan and calabrese 2014 but it results in animals that gradually move away from their initial position nabe nielsen et al 2013 to enable simulated seals to return to previously used haul out and foraging areas we implemented a spatial memory component nabe nielsen et al 2013 this addition of memory enables the formation of home ranges ibms have been used to model movements of many species arrignon et al 2007 bennett and tang 2006 linard et al 2009 nabe nielsen et al 2013 railsback et al 1999 reuter and breckling 1999 and have also been applied to conservation and management eisinger and thulke 2008 eisinger et al 2005 liu et al 2013 lópez alfaro et al 2012 nabe nielsen et al 2010 thulke and eisinger 2008 the ability to include highly detailed information about the environment and species make ibms ideal for modelling endangered or economically important species deangelis and grimm 2014 the proximate purpose of our model is to simulate typical movement patterns of adult individuals to characterize the home range formation and spatial ecology of the species but the model could ultimately be extended to study seal population dynamics under changing environmental conditions and different conservation measure scenarios as with models for conservation biology in general where we usually have too little data to develop models that deliver accurate predictions our model is designed to be realistic enough for relative predictions which allows us to rank different management options here we present the model and compare its results with telemetry data we started model development with the assumption that landscape complexity would explain the observed variation in home range sizes and therefore parameterized the model for a single individual for which the richest data were available after realizing that the resulting parameters did not explain the movement of other seals we reverted to considering the distribution of the parameters of all observed individuals we will discuss how this pragmatic and simplified approach relates to the unresolved problem of extracting movement parameters from tracking data of individuals with different personalities moving in complex environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 biological background here we provide the background information that guided model design ringed seal ecology is relatively well known but much of the knowledge does not apply to the saimaa ringed seal which lives in a freshwater environment that differs considerably from the oceanic environment inhabited by other subspecies adult saimaa ringed seals have home ranges of around 90 km2 on average niemi et al 2012 which is remarkably smaller than home ranges reported in marine ringed seals e g born et al 2004 oksanen et al 2015 for example home ranges of individual baltic ringed seals may cover an area of over 12 000 km2 oksanen et al 2015 which is almost three times larger than the total surface area of lake saimaa in addition to compact home ranges seals sedentary behaviour is apparent from strong haul out site and breeding site fidelity koivuniemi et al 2016 valtonen et al 2012 saimaa ringed seals reach sexual maturity at the age of 4 6 years auttila et al 2016 and give birth in subnivean snow lair during period from mid february to mid march after 11 month gestation period sipilä 2003 after the breeding mother pup pairs stay in close vicinity to the lair site until the pup is weaned at the age of approximately 3 months hyvärinen et al 1995 kunnasranta 2001 niemi et al 2013a males and females that are not breeding also use snow lairs for moulting and resting in the winter time helle et al 1984 when weather gets warmer in the spring lairs collapse and seals start to haul out first on the ice and later on terrestrial platforms these are typically rocks located on the shoreline of small islands but not in the vicinity of the mainland according to telemetry studies saimaa ringed seal individuals use an average of 13 haul out sites during the open water season niemi et al 2013a haul out takes over half of seals time during the moulting period from late april to early june with activity peaking in the afternoon when the temperature is highest which is reported to be beneficial for moulting boily 1995 paterson et al 2012 outside of the moulting season haul out takes no more than 20 of total time and is mainly nocturnal studies suggest that night time haul may be an adaptation to prey fish behaviour and disturbance which is more frequent during the day hyvärinen et al 1995 kunnasranta 2001 kunnasranta et al 2002 niemi et al 2013a haul out is affected by many environmental factors i e amount of solar radiation wind temperature and cloud cover physiological status and possible disturbance carlens et al 2006 moulton et al 2005 moulton et al 2002 niemi et al 2013a especially in the case of the saimaa ringed seal disturbance by humans is an important factor affecting haul out as the lake is a popular place for recreational activities niemi et al 2013a in addition to terrestrial sites resting can also take place in water seals have been observed to make consecutive long duration dives that are suggested to be associated with resting hyvärinen et al 1995 kunnasranta et al 2002 sleeping dives usually take place next to haul out sites and are more likely to occur when the weather is not optimal for haul out e g when it is raining still even though resting is possible in water haul out remains an important part of a seal s daily activities throughout the year with a peak centred around the breeding and moulting seasons kunnasranta et al 2002 there is seasonal variation in saimaa ringed seal feeding patterns seals feeding activity is reduced during spring due to the breeding nursing and moulting seasons in late summer seals need to forage actively to gain weight for the upcoming winter as blubber is needed to provide protection from harsh thermal conditions seals are generalists that feed mainly on small schooling fish species such as perch perca fluviatilis roach rutilus rutilus vendace coregonus albula smelt osmerus eperlanus and ruff gymnocephalus cernuus auttila et al 2015 kunnasranta et al 1999 and use same water regions for feeding throughout the year auttila et al 2015 adult seals prefer deep water 15 m foraging areas where vendace and smelt that are rich in fat content are found outside spawning season kunnasranta et al 1999 other prey species are abundant in shallow areas throughout the year and therefore seal foraging is not only limited to deep water areas the quantity of prey fishes is classified as medium to very high for perch and smelt in northern parts of the lake valkeajärvi et al 2010 and food is not considered to be a limited resource auvinen et al 2005 saimaa ringed seals have not been considered to be threatened by predators however recent findings have shown medium sized carnivores red fox vulpes vulpes and raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides to be interested in ringed seal lairs auttila et al 2014 and some pups are shown to be killed by a red fox auttila 2015 adult individuals are likely able to escape from predators more efficiently than pups which are more prone to predation nevertheless predation forms presumably only a minor part of saimaa ringed seal mortality and it is focused only on pups during winters with poor breeding conditions e g inadequate snow cover 2 2 study area lake saimaa surface area 4400 km2 mean depth 12 m consists of several basins connected via narrow straits kuusisto 1999 we focused on two water basins namely haukivesi and joutenvesi fig 1 together forming one of the most important breeding areas and it is inhabited by approximately 100 seals metsähallitus 2016 comprising almost one third of the estimated population 2 3 telemetry data data used in model development were obtained by equipping six seals with gps gsm tags sea mammal research unit st andrews university uk seals were tagged in the haukivesi basin between years 2007 2011 during the annual moulting season in spring neither of the two tagged females were pregnant or nursing offspring during the study season to our knowledge tags were set to record dive data depth duration and to determine the location every 20 min if the seal was in the water and every 60 min if it was hauled out a seal was considered to be hauled out if the wet dry sensor on the tag had been dry for 10 min the haul out was considered to have ended when the sensor had been wet for 40 s in the first phase of pattern oriented model development and parameterization gps telemetry data from one adult male er11 3822 relocations tracking duration 125 days mean swimming speed during the open water season 424 10 m 20 min from the study area were used to develop and calibrate the model this individual had

min were used for model validation and final calibration of one parameter see section 2 5 all data were limited to the open water season and constrained to the same temporal resolution as the shortest tracking period except for the initial calibration individual er11 whose data were fully used adehabitatlt package calenge 2011 in r r development core and team 2011 was used for calibration additionally datasets of 18 seals were used to develop probability distribution for the speed parameter see section 4 3 model sensitivity appendix e in supplementary material these datasets were not used in model calibration 2 4 the model the model description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2006 grimm et al 2010 its implementation in netlogo 5 2 0 wilensky

evaludation augusiak et al 2014 grimm et al 2014 schmolke et al 2010 containing evidence that our model was thoughtfully designed correctly implemented thoroughly tested well understood and appropriately used for its intended purpose 2 4 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to simulate seal movement patterns based on assumptions regarding resting and foraging behaviour 2 4 2 entities state variables and scales the area represented in the model haukivesi and joutenvesi basins is 762 km2 the model world consists of a grid of 1000 1000 cells or patches each patch represents an area of 0 00297 km2 54 5 m 54 5 m model entities are habitat patches seal and rock agents habitat patches are either land or water patches land true false some of the land patches were further characterized as island patches island true false land areas larger than 0 01 km2 and less than 2 98 km2 are considered islands in the model the minimum size of an island preferred for haul out is reported to be 0 0002 km2 niemi et al 2013a but was increased to 0 01 km2 in the model to keep the habitat as realistic as possible while taking into account the limited resolution of the map water patches are divided into three categories deep water 15 m shallow water 15 m deep true false and water suitable for haul out sites stone place true false these are water patches next to islands where rocks are created as such areas are regarded as suitable haul out sites the number of potential haul out sites in nature is unknown and was thus estimated from haul out data and home range sizes observed average number of 13 haul out sites per seal per average home range size was extrapolated to the study area consequently a total of 121 haul out sites were randomly created at initialization this number is in accordance with an earlier telemetry study where it was observed that eight gps gsm tracked individuals used in total 104 different haul out sites in the same area niemi et al 2013a

simulation starts at the beginning of april and is first run for 12 5 months during the last 0 5 months of this period the seal has its initial site as the only target for haul out this warm up period enables the seal to have some haul out sites and deep water areas in its memory before the actual data collection begins in the middle of consecutive april when the warm up period of 12 5 months have passed results were then recorded after this warm up period for duration of 4 17 months for individual er11 and 5 96 months for the rest of the individuals 2 4 3 process overview and scheduling the

given in italics 1 update time step length of time step is updated depending on the seal s activity 2 update age the seal s age in months is updated ice covered season january march is skipped by adding 3 months to the seal s age 3 list coordinates coordinates of the seal s location are added to a list for home range calculations 4 decay memory memory values of the visited haul out sites are updated as memory decays over time 5 remember haul outs if the seal is currently hauled out the site is added to memory 6 rest if the seal s exhaustion is above the moving threshold see section 2 4 7 submodels table 1 or there is a suitable haul out site near by it rests the seal starts moving again when exhaustion decreases below the moving threshold movement mode is set to 1 sets a deep water target patch if there are deep water patches in the seal s memory and to mode 2 correlated random walk if that is not the case 7 move there are three different movement modes movement to a previously visited deep water patch mode 1 correlated random walk mode 2 and movement towards a haul out site mode 3 8 write results update plots output files are written and plots are updated 2 4 4 design concepts the design concepts interaction and collectives do not apply to this model adaptation objectives and prediction are represented implicitly in the imposed haul out behaviour 2 4 4 1 basic principles seal movements consist of cycles of foraging in deep water areas and resting on haul out sites the seal remembers visited haul out sites and foraging areas to some extent which has influence on the space use in addition we implicitly represent bioenergetics as exhaustion which requires haul out and increases with foraging time 2 4 4 2 emergence movement patterns as characterized by the size of animal home ranges and time spent either moving or hauled out emerge partly from animal personalities hence in the model different personalities appear as different speed parameter values for individual seals furthermore the capacity and permanence of the seal s memory of visited haul out sites and foraging areas plays a role in the emergence of movement patterns in addition the location and number of potential haul out sites in the area affect the seal s movements in the model 2 4 4 3 learning the seal learns about its habitat by remembering visited haul out sites and deep water grid cells 2 4 4 4 sensing the seal senses and avoids land in its moving direction it also senses if it is in a deep water area or if there is a haul out site nearby and it knows the distance to visited haul out rocks 2 4 4 5 stochasticity step length in all movement modes and moving direction in movement mode 2 correlated random walk are drawn from truncated normal distributions in addition the positions of haul out sites are randomly assigned at initialization furthermore haul out sites and deep water foraging areas that seal uses may differ among replicates this introduces another factor creating stochasticity 2 4 4 6 observation position distance from home km movement duration h and duration of haul outs h are measured every time step home refers to the location where the seal is initialized 2 4 5 initialization the world is created by importing gis shape files for water deep water 15 m and land areas a total of 121 haul out rocks see section 2 4 2 entities state variables and scales for estimation of number of haul out sites implemented are randomly created near islands one seal is created and positioned on a user defined haul out site set to resting mode and given an empty memory except for the current haul out site an exhaustion of 0 998 maximum exhaustion 0 999 and an age of three months 2 4 6 input data the model does not include input of data representing time varying environmental drivers 2 4 7 submodels model parameters are listed in table 1 2 4 7 1 update time step age and time the time step is set to 20 min if the seal is moving and to 60 min if it is hauled out age and current time are updated accordingly 2 4 7 2 list coordinates coordinates of the seal s location are stored in a list for home range estimations because the time step is three times longer 60 min when hauled out every pair of haul out site coordinates are listed three times to avoid bias in the results by emphasizing relocations when moving in addition only 25 of movement coordinates are listed to match the resolution of telemetry data gps gsm tags fail to connect to the satellites occasionally and therefore the locations may not be obtained every 20 min as programmed 2 4 7 3 decay memory the seal remembers visited haul out sites however memory decays over time i e seal forgets the last haul out site on the list will be removed if there are already 100 sites in the memory or if the memory value for a site is 10 8 memory decay is represented according to nabe nielsen et al 2013 m c t 1 m c t m r m c t 1 m c t where t is time in units of time steps m c is the memory of a location c unitless and m r is the reference memory decay rate 1 h 2 4 7 4 remembering haul outs if the seal is hauled out the site is added to its memory and given a memory value of 0 99 in cases where the site is already in the seal s memory the entry representing the earlier visit is removed 2 4 7 5 rest if the seal is hauled out or sleeping in water exhaustion decreases following e c t 1 e c t r r e c t 1 e c t e c m a x where t is time e c is the exhaustion level e c max is the maximum of exhaustion level and r r is the exhaustion recovery rate if exhaustion falls below the moving threshold the exhaustion level is set to 0 1 and either movement mode 1 or 2 is selected see below for definition of movement modes 2 4 7 6 move 2 4 7 6 1 movement modes there are three movement modes that the seal can perform after hauling out during which movement mode is false the seal heads to a deep water patch to forage mode 1 having reached the target deep water grid cell it starts moving by correlated random walk mode 2 after foraging the seal selects haul out site based on distance and memory factors and goes there to rest mode 3 the choice between these three movement modes is based on the state variable exhaustion when the seal is hauled out its level of exhaustion decreases once it decreases below the moving threshold either movement mode 1 or 2 is selected the seal heads to an earlier visited deep water patch mode 1 if it knows any or starts moving by correlated random walk mode 2 if it has not visited any deep water areas yet e g at the initialization of the model once a deep water area is reached movement mode 2 is set provided that the seal was not in mode 2 already when exhaustion reaches the level of parameter exhaustion threshold movement mode 3 is selected and the seal goes to a haul out site to rest and the movement mode is set to false alternatively the seal can also rest when there is a suitable haul out site within distance of the parameter ho distance this heuristic assumption of allowing the seal to haul out on near by haul out sites even if not fully exhausted seems appropriate as it allows the seal to save energy if exhaustion exceeds its maximum value before reaching a haul out site the seal sleeps in water until exhaustion decreases low enough and it starts moving again the sleep in water procedure is not possible in deep water the following processes are common to all movement modes and are performed before moving in the order listed 1 adjust step length step length is drawn from a normal distribution with its mean set to the parameter mean speed adults and its standard deviation to sd speed adults minimum step length is set to 0 1 to avoid seals moving backwards 2 adjust turning angle turning angle is drawn from a normal distribution with its mean set to the parameter mean turning and its standard deviation to sd turning 3 set exhaustion rate exhaustion rate is set to the value of parameter exhaustion rate adults 4 update exhaustion level exhaustion level increases in every movement step according to e c t 1 e c t e x h r e c t 1 e c t e c m a x where exhr is the exhaustion rate and e c is the exhaustion level unitless 5 remember deep if the seal is in a deep water patch the patch is added to the seal s memory earlier visits to that patch are removed from memory if a target deep water patch is within the step length or a shorter distance the seal moves there 2 4 7 6 2 targeted vs non targeted movements earlier described movement modes can be further divided into targeted and non targeted moving in non targeted moving the seal moves by correlated random walk mode 2 the turning angle is updated every time step land is avoided if necessary and a step is taken forward in targeted moving movement is directed either towards a deep water foraging area mode 1 or a haul out site mode 3 if the seal is moving towards a deep water area one deep water grid cell is randomly selected from the seal s memory and set as a target the selection of the target haul out site is based on the distance from the seal s position and time when the seal last visited that site as described below calculate haul out site attraction value target haul out site is chosen by calculating the attraction values of previously visited haul out sites as follows a c t 1 m c t d c t where a c is the attraction value of the site m c is the memory value of the site see submodel decay memory and d c is the distance of visited haul out sites to the seal the haul out site with the smallest value is chosen as a target 2 4 7 6 3 avoid land the design of the land avoidance procedure used the approach described by dalleau 2013 a flow diagram of the procedure is presented in fig 3 this submodel consists of four different procedures 1 see if there is land ahead the seal checks if there is land ahead within one step length or less distances smaller than one step length are needed to avoid the seal jumping over narrow land areas 2 avoid land decision land avoidance direction selection i e left or right is based on two steps first the seal turns 45 left and right and calculates which turning direction has less land within an angle of 90 and a radius defined by the parameter land distance if there is an equal amount of land in both directions the moving direction is chosen randomly 3 avoid land right first the seal checks if there is land ahead in its moving direction see if land ahead if not the seal turns counter clockwise in steps of 10 until it detects land in its moving direction then the seal chooses the previous turning direction and takes a step forward this makes the seal follow the shoreline of an island if the avoid land decision was set to right at the beginning of this procedure the seal will avoid it from the right side of the detected land it turns clockwise in steps of 10 until there is no land ahead and then takes a step forward if the seal has already turned 360 and has not encountered land it takes a step towards the set target sometimes the step length is long enough to make the seal encounter land in every direction in such case step length is reduced by 50 and the land avoidance procedure is repeated this reduction is repeated until the seal can move when the angle between seal s current heading and its target is small 45 land is most likely avoided if there is no land ahead and the angle between heading and target is 45 land avoidance mode is turned off 4 avoid land left this procedure is identical to avoid land right except that the seal turns clockwise if there is no land in its moving direction and counter clockwise if there is this makes the seal avoid land from the left side 2 4 7 7 write results update plots the output variables distance from home and moving duration and additionally coordinates of seal movements for home range estimations are written into an output file plots of the seal s distance from home moving duration and haul out duration are updated every time step 2 5 parameterization the model was developed parameterized and tested following the pattern oriented framework grimm and railsback 2012 grimm et al 2005 in two distinct phases nine parameters were inversely determined grimm and railsback 2012 wiegand et al 2003 via calibration of two movement patterns obtained from one tracked male er11 see section 2 3 the patterns used were moving duration and distance from home and these were measured from both simulated and telemetry tagged seals home represents the location where the seal was captured for telemetry data but in the model it refers to the initial position of the seal distance from home was recorded at each time step and moving duration was measured when the seal reached haul out site after a foraging bout parameter estimation was performed in two rounds first parameters were varied over a large range exhaustion rate adults 0 1 00 mean speed adults 0 600 00 sd speed adults 0 200 00 mean turning 10 00 10 00 sd turning 0 180 00 ref mem decay rate 0 1 00 land distance 1 00 10 00 second they were fine tuned by being varied over a narrower range around the optimal values identified in the first round exhaustion rate adults 0 05 0 09 mean speed adults 100 00 300 00 sd speed adults 100 00 200 00 mean turning 5 00 5 00 sd turning 10 00 60 00 ref mem decay rate 0 0 35 land distance 3 00 10 00 in both cases a latin hypercube sampling design iványi et al 1979 was used by means of the tgp r package gramacy 2007 gramacy and taddy 2010 to draw 800 parameter sets from the entire parameter space defined by the nine parameters selected for calibration for each parameter set the model was run ten times means of the output variables medians were calculated and compared to telemetry data to assess model performance deviation from telemetry data was calculated according to d e v i a t i o n o b s s i m o b s where obs is the observed median for the two variables calculated from the telemetry data while sim is the mean of the model runs medians of the given output variables based on the first round of simulations and following a filtering approach wiegand et al 2004 the parameter sets having a deviation for the moving duration variable below 15 were selected among the sets passing this first filter only the parameter sets presenting a total combined deviation for both patterns below 500 were retained to determine the range for the second round of simulations in this stage the parameter set producing the lowest total deviation from telemetry data was chosen since the duration of haul out events is influenced only by exhaustion recovery rate we calibrated this parameter alone via a sensitivity experiment parameter range 0 1 00 steps 0 01 exhaustion recovery rate was calibrated to allow seals to haul out for the time observed by niemi et al 2013a haul out does not include any stochastic elements among runs therefore one run per parameter value was performed the variation within runs arises from the state of an individual entering haul out i e exhaustion level the parameter value producing the lowest deviation in comparison to telemetry data was chosen in order to enable seal haul out not only when it is exhausted but also when there is a suitable haul out site nearby parameters ho distance and exhaustion ho limit were added see table 1 for parameter description and calibrated ho distance values tested 0 1 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 exhaustion ho limit values tested 0 10 0 15 0 20 0 25 0 30 ho distances determines the distance from which a seal can observe a haul out site and exhaustion ho limit sets the minimum value of exhaustion at which haul out can be initialised to avoid a seal starting to haul out right after a previous haul out event parameters were calibrated to match the observed pattern of calibration individual and the parameter values resulting in the highest number of replicates that did not statistically differ from the observed datasets one way anova p 0 05 were selected the model was not able to reproduce the distance from home pattern of the five individuals used for validation see results section 3 2 since the global sensitivity analysis see results section 3 3 indicated that the mean speed adults parameter had the strongest effect on this model output we calibrated this parameter separately for the five individuals used for model validation tested ranges er11 60 210 m 20 min he07 250 400 m 20 min kj07 250 400 m 20 min ol10 10 160 m 20 min to09 110 300 m 20 min vi09 20 250 m 20 min simulations were replicated ten times the parameter values resulting in the highest number of replicates that did not statistically differ from the observed datasets one way anova p 0 05 were selected 2 6 sensitivity analyses we conducted a global sensitivity analysis to identify the model parameters with the strongest influence on model outputs we applied the variance decomposition technique of sobol 1993 to decompose the model outputs variance into variances attributable to each input parameter while also evaluating the interaction between parameters sobol first order sensitivity indices si measure the effect of varying a focus parameter alone but averaged over variations in other input parameters thus providing information on the average reduction of output variance when the parameter is fixed the total effect indices sti measure the contribution to the output variance of the focus parameter including all variance caused by its interactions of any order with any other input parameters we used the sensitivity r package pujol et al 2016 which implements the monte carlo estimation of the sobol s indices using the improved formulas of jansen 1999 and saltelli et al 2010 the number of tested settings was given by m p 2 where m is the size of the monte carlo sample matrix and p is the number of parameters to analyse we selected seven parameters that varied over the following ranges exh adult exhaustion rate adults 0 01 0 25 sl adult mean speed adults 10 600 slsdadult sd speed adults 10 600 ta adult mean turning 10 to 10 tasdadult sd turning 10 100 m r ref mem decay rate 0 1 and vis land distance 1 10 we chose a sample matrix of size 400 and sobol first order and total effect indices were computed for each parameter from a total number of runs of 400 7 2 3600 the sensitivity analysis examined two model outputs moving duration and distance from home because the locations of haul out sites most likely influence the patterns we simulated each of the parameter combinations keeping the same haul out site positions through all runs the simulations were performed for 4 066 months as long as the movements of the calibration individual were monitored in 2011 model runs were replicated 2 times to study the effects of the number and location of haul out sites we ran simulations initialising the model with 120 240 480 960 and 1920 rocks haul out sites were either kept in the same locations between replicates or randomly distributed at the beginning of each replicate in both scenarios simulations were replicated five times at each haul out site density simulations were initialised from the location where the individual used in model parameterization er11 was captured in the field survey and the model was run for 4 17 months furthermore we examined the extent to which the initial selection of haul out sites and deep water areas during the warm up period influenced model outputs to do this the seal was initialised having five fixed haul out sites and deep water patches in its memory the obtained results were compared to simulations run using the normal settings i e empty memory simulations were replicated 15 times and the model was run for 4 17 months in each replicate 3 results 3 1 calibration results of the 10 replicates with the optimal parameter set table 1 indicated that the model reproduced the range of values of the two tested patterns reasonably well regarding the distance from home variable 2 out of 10 replicates did not statistically differ from the field data mean of the model replicates means 2 15 km range 0 90 5 20 km and in the case of moving duration pattern 5 out of 10 replicates did not differ from the calibration dataset mean of the model replicates means 11 68 h range 9 11 15 33 h fig 4 see also appendix b in supplementary material 3 2 validation after calibration we tested the model performance on five independent datasets there were large differences between the recorded datasets and the model was not able to reproduce all the patterns observed in nature fig 5 see also appendix b in supplementary material furthermore large variation among replicated simulations decreased model fits the simulated distance moved from home and time between consecutive hauls were generally close to the average values observed in nature and although there was a large variation in movement patterns among the satellite tracked animals the range of values produced by the model were within the range of values observed for most satellite tracked animals still in the case of the distance from home pattern there were statistically significant differences one way anova p 0 05 in all replicates compared to field datasets the moving duration pattern was well reproduced for individuals he07 and kj07 the number of replicates that did not statistically differ were 9 and 8 out of 10 respectively 3 3 sensitivity analysis the global sensitivity analysis showed that variations in moving duration were driven only by the exhaustion rate of adults while the mean swimming speed of adults had the strongest effects on the variable distance from home interactions between parameters were more important in the latter variable fig 6 the number of haul out sites had a significant effect on both output variables full factorial two way anova distance from home p 0 001 moving duration p 0 001 the distribution of haul out sites random distribution at the initialisation of each replicate or same locations in all replicates had a significant effect on distance from home pattern p 0 001 there was no effect on moving duration p 0 104 furthermore the interaction between the number and distribution of haul out sites had significant effects on both patterns distance from home p 0 001 moving duration p 0 001 see also appendix c in supplementary material in addition the stochastic selection of haul out sites and deep water foraging areas during the warm up period increased variability between replicates the standard deviation of the mean was higher for both output variables when selection of haul out sites and deep water foraging areas were based on memory and distance factors distance from home 0 32 km moving duration 1 29 h compared to simulations in which sites were predetermined distance from home 0 16 km moving duration 1 01 h the coefficient of variation of distance from home and moving duration was 65 75 and 29 97 respectively when the sites were selected based on memory and distance factors and 64 84 and 32 77 respectively when sites were predetermined see also appendix d in supplementary material 3 4 re calibration and evaluation of model performance a high degree of variation among satellite tracked animals resulted in deviations from the simulated tracks we introduced individual variation and re calibrated the mean swimming speed parameter for each dataset separately to improve the model fit on observed distance from home patterns as we observed that the swimming speed parameter had the strongest effect on this pattern in the global sensitivity analysis re calibrated mean speed values were he07 250 m 20 min kj07 350 m 20 min ol10 100 m 20 min to09 190 m 20 min and vi09 100 m 20 min after re calibrating this parameter the fit for both output variables improved regarding the distance from home variable all five tested individuals had a reasonably good fit in the case of moving duration variable the model reproduced patterns relatively well for three out of five tested datasets fig 5 see also appendix b in supplementary material for visualization purposes we plotted the movement paths of individuals er11 and vi09 compared to their corresponding simulations fig 7 4 discussion we analysed existing telemetry datasets of six saimaa ringed seals and used them to develop an individual based movement model for adult seals we based the model on assumptions regarding seal resting and foraging behaviour and their ability to memorise these sites our aim was to design and implement a seal movement model that could be further developed into a population model and used for evaluating efficiency of conservation measures we analysed the model to test whether it could reproduce observed patterns of independent datasets that had not been used in model calibration furthermore we tested its sensitivity to model assumptions and parameter uncertainty 4 1 model structure innovations and limitations the model is based on correlated random walk a classical approach for modelling animal movements however correlated random walks cause animals to gradually move away from their starting position therefore it is not optimal for modelling compact home ranges to enable the formation of home ranges similar to those observed in saimaa ringed seal telemetry studies we added spatial memory in the model nabe nielsen et al 2013 applied the concept of spatial memory van moorter et al 2009 on the model of harbour porpoises phocoena phocoena to allow them memorise high quality feeding grounds and previously visited areas we used the approach to have seal memorise foraging areas and haul out sites it used the seal remembers not only the locations of visited haul out sites but also the time since the last visit the seal prefers haul out sites that are nearby and recently visited leading to the emergence of home ranges vincent et al 2017 nabe nielsen et al 2013 applied their model in a fairly homogenous landscape which is in accordance with many of the existing movement models in contrast to earlier memory based movement models we represented the environment in more detail spatial explicitness is especially important in models intended for management purposes deangelis and yurek 2017 lake saimaa is a highly complex and labyrinthine environment 13 000 islands kuusisto 1999 and at the same time a large variation in home range sizes have been previously reported for the saimaa ringed seal niemi et al 2012 therefore we hypothesized that the complex nature of the landscape may explain some of the individual differences in home rage size and shape we developed and implemented a novel land avoidance procedure that is a key feature of our model dalleau 2013 land avoidance enables seal to bypass any land area it encounters while foraging bioenergetics is an important feature of animal movement models and has been incorporated in detail in many ibms e g bennett and tang 2006 hölker and breckling 2005 morales et al 2005 reuter and breckling 1999 we use exhaustion to model seal bioenergetics the parameters were calibrated to match the movement patterns of one individual as no ringed seal bioenergetics data is available implementing seal bioenergetics in more detail would likely result in more realistic presentation of the real system first step for this could be addition of the existing dive data as diving behaviour unarguably has effect on the overall distance seal travels in the current model version we model only two dimensional space use some adult saimaa ringed seal individuals stay within relatively small range while others take trips of tens of kilometres niemi et al 2012 because of this variation capturing all these factors in a single value of parameters is a challenging task sex age body mass or other physical attributes were not considered in either model development or validation as it is not clear how these factors affect movement parameters of adult saimaa ringed seals furthermore it is not known to what extent the individuals knowledge and experience of the environment affects their movement patterns older and more experienced individuals are likely to have more knowledge about the environment since saimaa ringed seal are known to exhibit high site fidelity which can affect their spatial behaviour all data used in this study were obtained from individuals that were classified as adults based on their size even though sex related variation have not been clearly reported in telemetry studies genetic data show a sevenfold male to female gene flow ratio indicating a larger scale of movement in males in the long term valtonen et al 2014 furthermore sex and body mass related variations in movements are observed in grey seals halichoerus grypus and ringed seals austin et al 2004 beck et al 2003 but no clear patterns are reported for saimaa ringed seals in general body mass correlates positively with the extent of movements in mammals harestad and bunnel 1979 lindstedt et al 1986 swihart et al 1988 nevertheless saimaa ringed seal movement patterns vary among individuals depending on their state but such variations are not included in this model adding such variations might help explaining the difference in the movement patterns between satellite tracked and simulated seals in addition to biological factors uncertainty and lack of environmental variables in the model may have impaired the performance location and number of haul out sites in lake saimaa may vary from one year to another due to water level fluctuations therefore our estimates on haul out site number and location are not necessarily accurate which might have affected the model performance nevertheless the number of haul out sites implemented in the model is in accordance with niemi et al 2013a who observed eight gps gsm tagged seal to occupy 104 haul out sites in total in same study region in addition to the uncertainty related to haul out sites it is likely that e g disturbance quality of surrounding environment in terms of foraging areas lair sites and mating partners affect the space use of the seals in the real environment in order to improve the model fit data on environmental factors possibly affecting seal movement patterns should be collected and implemented in the model schick et al 2008 as such data is non existent currently likewise the selection and change of haul out sites can be affected by anthropogenic disturbances e g boat passing by data on the frequency of such disturbances could increase the fit of our model to movement data 4 2 model parameterization and validation we used pattern oriented calibration to find the best parameterization of the model however simulations run with the optimal parameter set yielded a poor fit to the independent telemetry datasets used for validation the model was not able to reproduce the distance from home patterns recorded in the field which were highly variable between tracked seals the saimaa ringed seal shows large intraspecific variability in movement patterns and spatial ecology niemi et al 2012 particularly our field datasets revealed strong variations across individuals in their swimming performance which has a strong effect on the movement distances simulated by our model to implement the intraspecific variability in swimming performance observed in nature in our model we re calibrated the mean swimming speed parameter on an individual basis using data from the five individuals that we initially used for validation which led to a significant improvement in model performance furthermore we observed large variability in exhaustion rates between seals therefore calibration of the exhaustion rate parameter on an individual basis would likely result in a better fit for the moving duration pattern as this parameter was observed to have the strongest effect on the pattern the large variability in the mean swimming speed of adult seals cannot be captured with a single fixed value in consequence for the future evolution of this movement model into a population model targeted at predicting seal population dynamics a probability distribution for the mean speed adults parameter may be implemented we thus developed the probability distribution based on re calibration results and observed field data to account for such individual variability see appendix e in supplementary material morales et al 2004 suggested a similar approach for their elk cervus elaphus movement model which was also developed with a small data set ultimately the probability distribution of seal movement speed should be obtained from as many individuals as possible to improve model fit and to overcome the issue caused by large intraspecific variation in addition identification of the factors influencing seal spatial behaviour would be beneficial seals are highly cognitive mammals and their behaviour is likely affected by many processes that we cannot identify using telemetry data alone using simple movement data for calibrating a model of such cognitively competent animals living in highly heterogeneous environment is challenging morales et al 2004 observed that simple correlated random walk based movement model is too simple for predicting elk movements better match to observed datasets was achieved with a model that included multiple movement states i e multiple correlated random walks that each have different parameter distributions our model would benefit if more information on seal behaviour could be connected to observed individual characteristics or environmental factors for the future development of our saimaa ringed seal model it would be beneficial to identify these seal behavioural states which could be then implemented in the model thus improving the fit identifying individual movement patterns and the motivation behind them would also benefit movement ecology study in general as this aspect is neglected in many cases holyoak et al 2008 4 3 model sensitivity the mean swimming speed had the strongest influence on the distance moved by adult seal from the initial position and thus on the size of its home range on the other hand exhaustion rate was the main and basically the only driver of the time passed between haul outs the quicker the seal gets exhausted the less time it spends foraging before needing to rest on a haul out site in addition to seal related parameters we estimated the sensitivity of movement patterns to environmental factors the higher number of haul out sites we implement in the model the greater is the simulated distance from home and the shorter are the time periods that seals move between consecutive haul out events site selection is partly based on distance to the visited sites which explains the effect of the number of haul out sites on movement patterns to some extent furthermore increasing the availability of haul out sites increases the probability that the seal has a rest even if it is not exhausted consequently the time spent foraging between consecutive haul out events shortens moreover the selection of haul out sites and foraging areas used during the warm up period increases variation between model replicates the model is run for 12 5 months before collecting the results so the seal develops a memory of certain foraging areas and resting sites that are selected in a random way thus introducing variability among model runs 4 4 model application and outlook this paper describes a model predicting saimaa ringed seal movement behaviour we started with a simple hypothesis where we assumed the complexity of the landscape would explain the variation in home range size among the individuals however the differences in the landscape were not sufficient to explain the observed movement patterns therefore the model would benefit from further variables adding some more biological and environmental aspects that affect seal behaviour more studies are needed to find the underlying mechanisms of the observed movement patterns however the current model version forms a sound basis for further development ultimate implementation of seals full life cycle and interactions between individuals in the model would enable the analysis of population dynamics under changing environmental conditions and conservation and management scenarios one of the major factors causing mortality in saimaa ringed seals is bycatch in gillnet fishing kovacs et al 2012 therefore fishing restrictions have been applied in the most important breeding areas despite these restrictions bycatch mortality has remained relatively high auttila 2015 kunnasranta et al 2016 and therefore there is a demand to extend the restrictions both temporally and spatially although the current model version has to be considered preliminary and several improvements could be considered an application of the model could be used to study the effects of different fishing restriction scenarios which would provide much needed information on the effectiveness of mitigation methods acknowledgements we thank lauri mehtätalo anssi vainikka and two anonymous reviewers for their
