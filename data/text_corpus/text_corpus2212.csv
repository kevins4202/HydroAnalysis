table 3 the dry matter accumulation of the hybrids decreased to varying degrees in response to the duration of waterlogging imposed at different growth stages the effect of waterlogging stress on the dry matter accumulation of both maize varieties was greatest at the v3 stage followed by v6 and vt based on the samples collected at r6 stage waterlogging for 9 d and subsurface waterlogging for 15 d at the v3 stage had the most significant effect p 0 05 on the dry matter accumulation of the two maize varieties compared with the control the total dry weight of dmy1 decreased by 28 81 and 28 27 and that of ky16 decreased by 29 19 and 28 73 respectively but there was no significant effect on the total dry weight of the two maize hybrids at the vt stage moreover with respect to the control the dry weight of the stem leaf and ear of two hybrids decreased significantly p 0 05 under waterlogging for 9 d and subsurface waterlogging for 15 d at the v3 and v6 stages but ky16 was more sensitive than dmy1 however there was no significant difference in the dry weight of these organs between ky16 and dmy1 under waterlogging stress at the vt stage table 3 in addition there were no significant v s v d and v s d treatments interaction effects on the dry weight of these organs at the r6 stage 3 2 chlorophyll content index compared with the control treatment the chlorophyll content index of the two maize hybrids decreased with the duration of waterlogging at different growth periods fig 2 the greatest reduction in the chlorophyll content index occurred under waterlogging stress imposed for 9 d and subsurface waterlogging imposed for 15 d at the v3 v6 and vt stages waterlogging at the v3 stage resulted in the most significant effect on the chlorophyll content index of the functional leaves followed by v6 and vt waterlogging during 3 6 and 9 days and subsurface waterlogging during 5 10 15 days at the v3 stage produced the following results the chlorophyll content index of ky16 were 10 26 22 29 38 12 11 14 20 82 and 35 48 lower than that of the control treatment and those of dmy1 decreased by 5 52 16 86 29 94 6 98 16 28 and 33 43 in addition the impact of waterlogging on ky16 was greater than that on dmy1 the highest chlorophyll content index was measured at the vt stage and waterlogging for 9 d and subsurface waterlogging for 15 d resulted in significant effects p 0 05 with respect to the control treatment 3 3 gas exchange parameters the adverse effects of waterlogging on the gas exchange parameters of the functional leaves of the two maize hybrids varied with the duration of waterlogging and the growth stage the most significant effects were observed at v3 followed by v6 and vt stage fig 3 the pn tr gs and ci of the leaves decreased gradually with an increase in the duration of waterlogging the effects of waterlogging stress were significant at the v3 and v6 stages but not at the vt stage the greatest decrease occurred in response to v3 9 and v3 s15 compared with the control treatment the pn decreased by 20 40 and 17 65 the tr by 14 04 and 14 20 the gs by 25 31 and 22 99 and the ci by 16 67 and 17 47 respectively for dmy1 the corresponding pn tr gs and ci values of ky16 decreased by 22 77 and 21 91 19 58 and 19 13 34 99 and 34 86 and 19 59 and 19 55 compared to those of ck 3 4 photosynthetic enzymes the rubp carboxylase and pep carboxylase activities of the functional leaves of the two maize hybrids were significantly impacted by waterlogging stress during different growth stages compared with the control fig 4 the most significant effects occurred at v3 followed by v6 and vt the photosynthetic enzyme activities decreased significantly with an increase in the duration of waterlogging for example the respective rubp carboxylase activities of ky16 and dmy1 were reduced by 54 07 and 49 83 after waterlogging for 9 d and by 52 92 and 51 06 after subsurface waterlogging for 15 d at v3 compared to the control treatment after waterlogging for 9 d at v3 the pep carboxylase activity of ky16 and dmy1 was 54 19 and 41 21 lower respectively than that of ck in addition after subsurface waterlogging for 15 d at v3 the pep carboxylase activities of ky16 and dmy1 was 53 28 and 42 28 lower respectively than that of ck these results showed that the waterlogging resistance of dmy1 was superior to that of ky16 under the same waterlogging conditions the ratio of rubpcase to pepcase can reflect the relative strength of key enzyme activities in c4 pathway wei et al 2003 in the v6 stage of ky16 and the v3 and v6 stage of dmy1 the ratio of rubpcase to pepcase increased gradually with the extension of waterlogging duration the decrease of rubpcase activity was greater than that of pepcase activity fig 4 indicating that pep carboxylase activity of maize leaves in waterlogging condition may have a relatively greater role in the c4 pathway of photosynthesis in the vt stage the ratio of rubpcase to pepcase in leaves of both maize hybrids increased with the prolongation of waterlogging duration and the decline of pepcase was greater than that of rubpcase but the waterlogging treatments and ck treatment did not reach significant level p 0 05 showing that two photosynthetic key enzymes jointly regulated photosynthesis for material accumulation and distribution 3 5 grain yield there were no significant variety stage treatment interaction effects on maize yield table 4 the ear number 100 grain weight number of grains per ear and the yield of two maize hybrids exhibited a gradual decreasing trend in response to an increase in the duration of waterlogging and subsurface waterlogging stress imposed at various growth stages compared to the ck treatment the greatest reduction in the yield of dmy1 and ky16 approximately 64 8 and 80 2 respectively occurred in response to the v3 9 treatment and the yield of dmy1 and ky16 in the v3 s15 treatment decreased by 61 5 and 71 9 respectively the change trends of the ear number 100 grain weight and number of grains per ear were consistent with that of the yield of dmy1 and ky16 waterlogging and subsurface waterlogging stress at the vt stage had the lowest impact on the ear number 100 grain weight number of grains per ear and yield of two maize hybrids 3 6 ear traits waterlogging stress significantly impacted the ear traits by decreasing the ear length and width and increasing the bald tip length table 5 compared to the control treatment the greatest reduction in the ear length of dmy1 and ky16 approximately 33 9 and 42 8 respectively occurred in response to the v3 9 treatment and the ear length of dmy1 and ky16 decreased by 28 3 and 37 1 respectively in the v3 s15 treatment the change trends of the ear width and bald tip length were consistent with that of the ear length of dmy1 and ky16 waterlogging stress at the vt stage had the lowest impact on the ear length ear width and bald tip length of two maize hybrids 4 discussion photosynthesis is the most basic life activity of plants and it is one of the most sensitive physiological processes to water stress ramachandra et al 2004 previous studies showed that waterlogging stress damages chlorophyll and decreases the chlorophyll content the subsequent decline in the photosynthetic enzyme activity and the reduction in the photosynthetic rate inhibit plant growth and biomass accumulation ultimately resulting in a decline in crop yield smethurst et al 2005 ren et al 2014 our results showed that waterlogging significantly reduced the chlorophyll content index of spring maize especially with an increase in the duration of the stress which accelerated senescence our study results are similar to those of ren et al 2016b who examined summer maize and showed that waterlogging stress impacted the chlorophyll content and decreased photosynthesis in our experiment waterlogging stress obviously caused the decrease of the rubp carboxylase and pep carboxylase activities especially with an increase in the duration of the stress rubp carboxylase and pep carboxylase are key enzymes in photosynthesis their contents directly affect the assimilation of co2 and the photosynthetic rate dias and bruggemann 2007 our results showed that waterlogging stress reduced the pn as well as gs ci and tr a similar decline in pn and gs was observed for cichorium intybus by vandoorne et al 2014 who showed that flooding stress was responsible for the decline in these gas exchange parameters after 21 weeks the authors reported that waterlogging led to the closing of stomata consequently co2 could not be absorbed and although intercellular co2 was continuously taken up the plants could not fully absorb and transform the co2 thus the photosynthetic rate decreased our results showed that waterlogging stress had the greatest effect on the chlorophyll content index photosynthetic enzyme activity and gas exchange parameters at the v3 stage followed by the v6 and vt stages these adverse effects were not significant at the vt stage which suggests that spring maize has some level of resistance to waterlogging during the reproductive stage similar results were reported by shao et al 2013 photosynthesis is the process through which plants accumulate dry matter ren et al 2016c previous studies indicated that waterlogging stress inhibited the growth and development of plants and consequently dry matter accumulation khan et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 in our experiment an obvious decline in the total dry matter stem leaf and ear of spring maize was observed in response to waterlogging stress this decline was associated with reductions in the chlorophyll content index and the photosynthetic rate table 3 fig 2 3 and the total dry matter weight of spring maize was lowest in the v3 9 and v3 s15 treatments the stem leaf and especially the ear of spring maize declined significantly ultimately causing a considerable decrease in the yield our results are similar to previous findings i e that waterlogging stress damaged soybean and wheat by decreasing the shoot dry weight youn et al 2008 robertson et al 2009 the adverse impacts changed with the duration of waterlogging and the growth stage for example the most obvious impact of waterlogging on dry matter accumulation occurred at the v3 stage followed by the v6 and vt stages according to wu et al 2015 the tillering stage of winter wheat was the most sensitive to waterlogging stress followed by the jointing booting and grain filling stages in the present work the grain yield and yield components decreased significantly with an increase in the duration of waterlogging compared with the control treatment the most obvious decrease in grain yield occurred after waterlogging for 9 days at the v3 stage the grain yield of dmy1 and ky16 decreased by 64 8 and 80 2 and after subsurface waterlogging for 15 days at the v3 stage decreases of 61 5 and 71 9 respectively these results are in agreement with ren et al 2016a our results also showed that the decrease in grain yield corresponded to the decrease in the 100 grain weight and the number of grains per ear table 4 the number of grains per ear was the most vital characteristic that was impacted by waterlogging stress this response was related mainly to the reduction in ear length and width and the increase in the bald tip length table 5 we believe that grain yield is directly associated with photosynthesis the main source of most of the photosynthate used to increase grain weight is the accumulation of carbohydrates in the stem and their transport to the kernels serrago et al 2011 waterlogging stress imposed at different growth stages decreased the grain yield of spring maize and the extent of this decrease depended not only on the duration of the waterlogging stress but also on the growth stage during which this stress was imposed several reports have indicated that the reproductive stage is more negatively impacted than the vegetative stages under waterlogging conditions waterlogging stress during earlier stages of the life cycle allows plants to recover through different physiological mechanisms setter and waters 2003 de san celedonio et al 2014 in our experiment the highest grain yield reduction occurred under waterlogging stress at the v3 stage 80 2 decline for ky16 followed by v6 whereas waterlogging and subsurface waterlogging stress at the vt stage had the lowest impact on spring maize yield our result was inconsistent with previous studies the reason may be due to differences between materials and waterlogging stage based on the diversity and complexity of the effects of waterlogging stress on growth and development of maize in our study it is necessary to propose some recommendations about irrigation water management to reduce the damage of waterlogging when maize is waterlogged we should rush to drain water and remove the sullage especially in the early growth stage which has a significant impact on the growth and yield of maize the waterlogging tolerance of maize increased gradually in the later growth stage the grain yield of maize can be increased by proper irrigation for several days during vt stage in addition the construction of irrigation and drainage facilities in farmland should be strengthened to improve the ability of drought resistance and waterlogging prevention in our paper the waterlogging tolerance of dmy1 was better than ky16 therefore maize hybrids with high waterlogging tolerance should be selected in areas where waterlogging occurs frequently such as low lying areas 5 conclusion the main conclusion from this study is that waterlogging stress caused a decline in photosynthesis which reduced the rubp carboxylase and pep carboxylase activities and pn gs tr and ci resulting in a decrease in dry matter accumulation and eventually a significant reduction in the grain yield of spring maize spring maize was most sensitive to waterlogging stress imposed at the v3 stage followed by the v6 and vt stages in addition the adverse effects increased with an increase in the duration of the waterlogging stress acknowledgements

table 3 the dry matter accumulation of the hybrids decreased to varying degrees in response to the duration of waterlogging imposed at different growth stages the effect of waterlogging stress on the dry matter accumulation of both maize varieties was greatest at the v3 stage followed by v6 and vt based on the samples collected at r6 stage waterlogging for 9 d and subsurface waterlogging for 15 d at the v3 stage had the most significant effect p 0 05 on the dry matter accumulation of the two maize varieties compared with the control the total dry weight of dmy1 decreased by 28 81 and 28 27 and that of ky16 decreased by 29 19 and 28 73 respectively but there was no significant effect on the total dry weight of the two maize hybrids at the vt stage moreover with respect to the control the dry weight of the stem leaf and ear of two hybrids decreased significantly p 0 05 under waterlogging for 9 d and subsurface waterlogging for 15 d at the v3 and v6 stages but ky16 was more sensitive than dmy1 however there was no significant difference in the dry weight of these organs between ky16 and dmy1 under waterlogging stress at the vt stage table 3 in addition there were no significant v s v d and v s d treatments interaction effects on the dry weight of these organs at the r6 stage 3 2 chlorophyll content index compared with the control treatment the chlorophyll content index of the two maize hybrids decreased with the duration of waterlogging at different growth periods fig 2 the greatest reduction in the chlorophyll content index occurred under waterlogging stress imposed for 9 d and subsurface waterlogging imposed for 15 d at the v3 v6 and vt stages waterlogging at the v3 stage resulted in the most significant effect on the chlorophyll content index of the functional leaves followed by v6 and vt waterlogging during 3 6 and 9 days and subsurface waterlogging during 5 10 15 days at the v3 stage produced the following results the chlorophyll content index of ky16 were 10 26 22 29 38 12 11 14 20 82 and 35 48 lower than that of the control treatment and those of dmy1 decreased by 5 52 16 86 29 94 6 98 16 28 and 33 43 in addition the impact of waterlogging on ky16 was greater than that on dmy1 the highest chlorophyll content index was measured at the vt stage and waterlogging for 9 d and subsurface waterlogging for 15 d resulted in significant effects p 0 05 with respect to the control treatment 3 3 gas exchange parameters the adverse effects of waterlogging on the gas exchange parameters of the functional leaves of the two maize hybrids varied with the duration of waterlogging and the growth stage the most significant effects were observed at v3 followed by v6 and vt stage fig 3 the pn tr gs and ci of the leaves decreased gradually with an increase in the duration of waterlogging the effects of waterlogging stress were significant at the v3 and v6 stages but not at the vt stage the greatest decrease occurred in response to v3 9 and v3 s15 compared with the control treatment the pn decreased by 20 40 and 17 65 the tr by 14 04 and 14 20 the gs by 25 31 and 22 99 and the ci by 16 67 and 17 47 respectively for dmy1 the corresponding pn tr gs and ci values of ky16 decreased by 22 77 and 21 91 19 58 and 19 13 34 99 and 34 86 and 19 59 and 19 55 compared to those of ck 3 4 photosynthetic enzymes the rubp carboxylase and pep carboxylase activities of the functional leaves of the two maize hybrids were significantly impacted by waterlogging stress during different growth stages compared with the control fig 4 the most significant effects occurred at v3 followed by v6 and vt the photosynthetic enzyme activities decreased significantly with an increase in the duration of waterlogging for example the respective rubp carboxylase activities of ky16 and dmy1 were reduced by 54 07 and 49 83 after waterlogging for 9 d and by 52 92 and 51 06 after subsurface waterlogging for 15 d at v3 compared to the control treatment after waterlogging for 9 d at v3 the pep carboxylase activity of ky16 and dmy1 was 54 19 and 41 21 lower respectively than that of ck in addition after subsurface waterlogging for 15 d at v3 the pep carboxylase activities of ky16 and dmy1 was 53 28 and 42 28 lower respectively than that of ck these results showed that the waterlogging resistance of dmy1 was superior to that of ky16 under the same waterlogging conditions the ratio of rubpcase to pepcase can reflect the relative strength of key enzyme activities in c4 pathway wei et al 2003 in the v6 stage of ky16 and the v3 and v6 stage of dmy1 the ratio of rubpcase to pepcase increased gradually with the extension of waterlogging duration the decrease of rubpcase activity was greater than that of pepcase activity fig 4 indicating that pep carboxylase activity of maize leaves in waterlogging condition may have a relatively greater role in the c4 pathway of photosynthesis in the vt stage the ratio of rubpcase to pepcase in leaves of both maize hybrids increased with the prolongation of waterlogging duration and the decline of pepcase was greater than that of rubpcase but the waterlogging treatments and ck treatment did not reach significant level p 0 05 showing that two photosynthetic key enzymes jointly regulated photosynthesis for material accumulation and distribution 3 5 grain yield there were no significant variety stage treatment interaction effects on maize yield table 4 the ear number 100 grain weight number of grains per ear and the yield of two maize hybrids exhibited a gradual decreasing trend in response to an increase in the duration of waterlogging and subsurface waterlogging stress imposed at various growth stages compared to the ck treatment the greatest reduction in the yield of dmy1 and ky16 approximately 64 8 and 80 2 respectively occurred in response to the v3 9 treatment and the yield of dmy1 and ky16 in the v3 s15 treatment decreased by 61 5 and 71 9 respectively the change trends of the ear number 100 grain weight and number of grains per ear were consistent with that of the yield of dmy1 and ky16 waterlogging and subsurface waterlogging stress at the vt stage had the lowest impact on the ear number 100 grain weight number of grains per ear and yield of two maize hybrids 3 6 ear traits waterlogging stress significantly impacted the ear traits by decreasing the ear length and width and increasing the bald tip length table 5 compared to the control treatment the greatest reduction in the ear length of dmy1 and ky16 approximately 33 9 and 42 8 respectively occurred in response to the v3 9 treatment and the ear length of dmy1 and ky16 decreased by 28 3 and 37 1 respectively in the v3 s15 treatment the change trends of the ear width and bald tip length were consistent with that of the ear length of dmy1 and ky16 waterlogging stress at the vt stage had the lowest impact on the ear length ear width and bald tip length of two maize hybrids 4 discussion photosynthesis is the most basic life activity of plants and it is one of the most sensitive physiological processes to water stress ramachandra et al 2004 previous studies showed that waterlogging stress damages chlorophyll and decreases the chlorophyll content the subsequent decline in the photosynthetic enzyme activity and the reduction in the photosynthetic rate inhibit plant growth and biomass accumulation ultimately resulting in a decline in crop yield smethurst et al 2005 ren et al 2014 our results showed that waterlogging significantly reduced the chlorophyll content index of spring maize especially with an increase in the duration of the stress which accelerated senescence our study results are similar to those of ren et al 2016b who examined summer maize and showed that waterlogging stress impacted the chlorophyll content and decreased photosynthesis in our experiment waterlogging stress obviously caused the decrease of the rubp carboxylase and pep carboxylase activities especially with an increase in the duration of the stress rubp carboxylase and pep carboxylase are key enzymes in photosynthesis their contents directly affect the assimilation of co2 and the photosynthetic rate dias and bruggemann 2007 our results showed that waterlogging stress reduced the pn as well as gs ci and tr a similar decline in pn and gs was observed for cichorium intybus by vandoorne et al 2014 who showed that flooding stress was responsible for the decline in these gas exchange parameters after 21 weeks the authors reported that waterlogging led to the closing of stomata consequently co2 could not be absorbed and although intercellular co2 was continuously taken up the plants could not fully absorb and transform the co2 thus the photosynthetic rate decreased our results showed that waterlogging stress had the greatest effect on the chlorophyll content index photosynthetic enzyme activity and gas exchange parameters at the v3 stage followed by the v6 and vt stages these adverse effects were not significant at the vt stage which suggests that spring maize has some level of resistance to waterlogging during the reproductive stage similar results were reported by shao et al 2013 photosynthesis is the process through which plants accumulate dry matter ren et al 2016c previous studies indicated that waterlogging stress inhibited the growth and development of plants and consequently dry matter accumulation khan et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 in our experiment an obvious decline in the total dry matter stem leaf and ear of spring maize was observed in response to waterlogging stress this decline was associated with reductions in the chlorophyll content index and the photosynthetic rate table 3 fig 2 3 and the total dry matter weight of spring maize was lowest in the v3 9 and v3 s15 treatments the stem leaf and especially the ear of spring maize declined significantly ultimately causing a considerable decrease in the yield our results are similar to previous findings i e that waterlogging stress damaged soybean and wheat by decreasing the shoot dry weight youn et al 2008 robertson et al 2009 the adverse impacts changed with the duration of waterlogging and the growth stage for example the most obvious impact of waterlogging on dry matter accumulation occurred at the v3 stage followed by the v6 and vt stages according to wu et al 2015 the tillering stage of winter wheat was the most sensitive to waterlogging stress followed by the jointing booting and grain filling stages in the present work the grain yield and yield components decreased significantly with an increase in the duration of waterlogging compared with the control treatment the most obvious decrease in grain yield occurred after waterlogging for 9 days at the v3 stage the grain yield of dmy1 and ky16 decreased by 64 8 and 80 2 and after subsurface waterlogging for 15 days at the v3 stage decreases of 61 5 and 71 9 respectively these results are in agreement with ren et al 2016a our results also showed that the decrease in grain yield corresponded to the decrease in the 100 grain weight and the number of grains per ear table 4 the number of grains per ear was the most vital characteristic that was impacted by waterlogging stress this response was related mainly to the reduction in ear length and width and the increase in the bald tip length table 5 we believe that grain yield is directly associated with photosynthesis the main source of most of the photosynthate used to increase grain weight is the accumulation of carbohydrates in the stem and their transport to the kernels serrago et al 2011 waterlogging stress imposed at different growth stages decreased the grain yield of spring maize and the extent of this decrease depended not only on the duration of the waterlogging stress but also on the growth stage during which this stress was imposed several reports have indicated that the reproductive stage is more negatively impacted than the vegetative stages under waterlogging conditions waterlogging stress during earlier stages of the life cycle allows plants to recover through different physiological mechanisms setter and waters 2003 de san celedonio et al 2014 in our experiment the highest grain yield reduction occurred under waterlogging stress at the v3 stage 80 2 decline for ky16 followed by v6 whereas waterlogging and subsurface waterlogging stress at the vt stage had the lowest impact on spring maize yield our result was inconsistent with previous studies the reason may be due to differences between materials and waterlogging stage based on the diversity and complexity of the effects of waterlogging stress on growth and development of maize in our study it is necessary to propose some recommendations about irrigation water management to reduce the damage of waterlogging when maize is waterlogged we should rush to drain water and remove the sullage especially in the early growth stage which has a significant impact on the growth and yield of maize the waterlogging tolerance of maize increased gradually in the later growth stage the grain yield of maize can be increased by proper irrigation for several days during vt stage in addition the construction of irrigation and drainage facilities in farmland should be strengthened to improve the ability of drought resistance and waterlogging prevention in our paper the waterlogging tolerance of dmy1 was better than ky16 therefore maize hybrids with high waterlogging tolerance should be selected in areas where waterlogging occurs frequently such as low lying areas 5 conclusion the main conclusion from this study is that waterlogging stress caused a decline in photosynthesis which reduced the rubp carboxylase and pep carboxylase activities and pn gs tr and ci resulting in a decrease in dry matter accumulation and eventually a significant reduction in the grain yield of spring maize spring maize was most sensitive to waterlogging stress imposed at the v3 stage followed by the v6 and vt stages in addition the adverse effects increased with an increase in the duration of the waterlogging stress acknowledgements

11061,we use an 82 year record of water table data from the high plains aquifer to introduce a new application of segmented regression to hydrogeology and evaluate the effects of droughts crop prices and local groundwater management on groundwater level trajectories across the high plains we find discernable regional cycles of faster and slower water table declines a parsimonious classification and regression tree cart analysis details correlations between select explanatory variables and changes in water table trajectories quantified as changes in slope of well hydrographs drying relative to prior year conditions is associated with negative changes in slope in the absence of drying conditions steep declines in commodity price are associated with positive changes in hydrograph slopes establishment of a groundwater management area is not a strong predictor for change in water table trajectories but more wells tend to have negative changes in around the time of management areas are formation suggesting that drought conditions are associated with both negative deflections in water table trajectory and enactment of management areas segmented regression is a promising tool for groundwater managers to evaluate change thresholds and the effectiveness of management strategies on groundwater storage and decline using readily available water table data keywords segmented regression irrigation drawdown sustainability ogallala cart 1 introduction and background 1 1 groundwater depletion and management groundwater in major areas of the high plains aquifer is being rapidly depleted mcguire 2012 for the past few decades attention has focused on the likely pathways and timescales to aquifer depletion e g scanlon et al 2012 steward and allen 2016 haacker et al 2016 over allocation of surface water resources shifting demands on water supplies changing climate and variable precipitation technological advances and growing awareness of the ecological needs of stream systems are increasing farmers reliance on groundwater systems as a steady source of water meanwhile agricultural intensification and increased demand for crops as feed and fuel are placing greater stress on existing water supplies despite the critical role that groundwater plays in providing water for irrigation groundwater management in the united states and elsewhere is underdeveloped relative to surface water management megdal et al 2015 for example in california formal statewide management of groundwater began in 2014 with the sustainable groundwater management act babbit et al 2018 despite the state s long history of conflict among users of surface water reisner 1986 groundwater laws in the united states have primarily been enacted at the state level kirchhoff and dilling 2016 despite most states having policies in place the elevation of the water table continues to decline in most semi arid areas with groundwater irrigation smidt et al 2016 many states have established smaller localized groundwater management areas to distribute control of resources based on unique local conditions including water level declines these groundwater management areas were frequently created to serve the needs of local irrigators to extract water without interference from conservation interests green 1973 however some groundwater management areas have evolved in function over time in response to changing local priorities and governance megdal et al 2015 found that the main concerns for groundwater governance at the state level include groundwater contamination user conflicts and water level declines despite the physical nature of these concerns the success of groundwater management areas has generally been evaluated based on social metrics rather than environmental change kirchhoff and dilling 2016 sanderson and frey 2015 about two decades after local groundwater management areas were established in the high plains a survey in colorado and kansas found that two thirds of irrigators felt that their local groundwater management areas should work to reduce groundwater depletion white and kromm 1995 only half felt that their groundwater management areas should attempt to maintain the resource over a specific time horizon although this may be changing where declines have become more severe lauer et al 2018 the physical effects of groundwater management areas have generally not been included in studies that estimate the lifespan of aquifers such as the high plains aquifer in the central united states previous statistical models of aquifer lifespan have assumed monotonic decline that is linear haacker et al 2016 scanlon et al 2012 or logistic steward and allen 2016 in contrast discussions of sustainability are predicated on the notion that aquifer storage decline is reversible leading to a disconnect between what is desirable and what is assumed will occur it is vitally important to recognize that the lifespan of the aquifer can be extended by slowing or reversing declines on the other hand an acceleration of decline suggests a failure of management to work toward groundwater sustainability this analysis attempts to define and explore the thresholds for changes in water table elevation trends in order to inform predictions of the pattern of decline and recovery the motivation for this study was to identify any changes in groundwater level trajectory that occur when a localized groundwater management area is established on the high plains here we demonstrate that cycles of faster and slower decline have occurred throughout the high plains aquifer and are associated with variable climate temperature and precipitation conditions and commodity prices we quantify timing of changes in trajectory breakpoints of groundwater levels and compare the net number of annual breaks in slope with the establishment of groundwater management areas we employ a method rarely used in water resources studies segmented regression muggeo 2008 shao and campbell 2002 we demonstrate its utility for assessing changes in the trajectory of water levels in a heavily utilized aquifer 1 2 study site the high plains aquifer is the source for nearly one third of all groundwater used for irrigation in the united states 98 of water extracted from the high plains aquifer is used for irrigation dennehy et al 2002 two features make this aquifer a particularly important resource it is very large and much the overlying arable land receives insufficient precipitation for reliable rainfed agriculture the high plains aquifer stored approximately 3500 km3 of water in 2016 distributed very unevenly across 450 000 km2 of land area spread over eight states fig 1 much of the high plains region has a saturated thickness that is barely sufficient for irrigation haacker et al 2016 depending on the hydraulic conductivity and other factors hecox et al 2002 however the saturated thickness varies widely from effectively zero in much of new mexico to hundreds of meters in the nebraska sand hills much more water is withdrawn than returns to the aquifer each year scanlon et al 2012 water from the high plains aquifer contributes significantly to state economies from 1996 2005 kansas farmers annually withdrew about 110 million usd worth of groundwater fenichel et al 2016 the combination of hydrogeologic and economic factors make groundwater management from the high plains region both imperative and difficult the aquifer is commonly divided into three subregions northern central and southern stanton et al 2011 fig 1 mean annual temperatures are higher to the south and precipitation roughly doubles from west to east fig 2 a and b the northern high plains which has the lowest average evaporative demand has greater mean saturated aquifer thickness and recharge than the central or southern high plains across most of the central and southern high plains pumping for irrigation has caused large declines in groundwater levels fig 2c although many early irrigators in texas believed that their groundwater was an inexhaustible resource green 1973 the problem of aquifer depletion was recognized as early as the 1930s theis 1937 white et al 1946 increased understanding and awareness has not forestalled the intensive growth of regional farm economies over the past eight decades economies that rely on unsustainable groundwater resources fig 2d sanderson and frey 2015 1 3 groundwater management areas nebraska colorado kansas and texas together cover about 80 of the area overlying the high plains aquifer these four states have comparable groundwater management areas fig 3 key features of these groundwater management areas are that they retain some jurisdiction over local natural resources including groundwater and can raise funds and create rules and obligations for irrigators within their boundaries the 41 groundwater management areas in this study are predominantly within the boundaries of the high plains aquifer fig 3 and were typically instituted a few decades after extensive local aquifer development beyond these commonalities groundwater management areas are diverse in their operation and functions nebraska s natural resources districts which are primarily funded through property taxes were created by the state legislature in the early 1970 s to manage natural resources at a semiautonomous local level groundwater management areas in colorado and texas on the other hand were organized largely to support the needs of local irrigators and maintain profits white and kromm 1995 in texas the comparable groundwater management areas structures are underground water conservation districts not to be confused with state designated groundwater management areas which play a very different top down governance role the first underground water districts in texas conservation was not initially part of their name were created to thwart the adoption of state level groundwater use restrictions green 1973 kansas has taken an intermediate approach between nebraska and texas to create management districts ensuring a conservation agenda for groundwater districts that are established and yet mandating that districts be created only at the request of irrigators bossert 1993 despite their roles in supporting regional irrigation some groundwater management areas in colorado texas and kansas have increasingly adopted the role of conservation entities a prime example is the creation of the sheridan 6 local enhanced management area in kansas groundwater management district 4 the local enhanced management areas are not specifically examined in this paper because the original sheridan 6 district covers a small area six sections of land 256 km2 about one third the size of the smallest groundwater management area considered in this study 750 km2 and entirely within an existing groundwater management area regulations within groundwater management areas generally include guidelines for well spacing monitoring and capping of abandoned wells white and kromm 1995 these may be binding or voluntary and may come with subsidies or penalties the institution of pumping restrictions is much more recent and highly variable across the aquifer this paper focuses on the initiation of management since this event is comparable across all management areas and thus yields the largest dataset for statistical analysis and the potential for regulation has been hypothesized as a driver for increased groundwater withdrawals bian et al 2016 following the establishment of groundwater management areas positive inflections in water levels as declines slow or even reverse might indicate conservation of water resources the mechanisms of conservation within groundwater management areas can take numerous forms including taxation education regulation new social norms and increased monitoring 1 4 factors affecting irrigation demand within the limitations of water rights and physical constraints irrigation demand is determined by input costs and expected profit ideally actual water use data would be available or could be calculated based on crop extent and water requirements there are several challenges to that approach most importantly irrigation extent has not been estimated for the high plains before the 1980s and remote sensing methods do not distinguish groundwater from surface water sources deines et al 2017 county level crop acreage is collected every five years but measurement of irrigated acreage is sporadic irrigation wells were rarely monitored for flow before the 2000s and it remains difficult to obtain water use data in states other than kansas other methods for estimating groundwater demand rely on change in measured water levels nieswiadomy 1985 which is the response variable used in this study net water level change is also partially determined by recharge and return flows which are difficult to estimate highly variable in space and time and dependent on irrigation technology aside from factors under the control of groundwater management areas a host of conditions can affect the demand for irrigation water in the high plains changes in agricultural technology and management may be driven by broad market and non conservation policy factors such as shifts in crop prices changes in crop genetics or interstate river basin compacts there are regulatory legal and policy actions that may affect water use at scales greater than groundwater management areas i e state interstate or federal the high plains region is very susceptible to drought and groundwater depletion isolating every factor that may have influenced past water level trajectories is beyond the scope of this paper rather we seek to control for the most important market based and physical forces that might have affected water use and for which data are available across the entire area for the decades since aquifer development climate and crop prices are two such factors groundwater serves as a reservoir in times of drought and as an additional supplement to attain higher yields when commodity prices are high agricultural drought occurs at a regional scale whereas crop prices are national both of these patterns stand in contrast to other important determinants of water demand such as extreme climatic events and local economic conditions therefore these factors reflect overarching conditions for irrigators which are applicable throughout and beyond the scale of individual management areas 2 methods 2 1 analysis objectives and procedure our analysis takes two parts fig 4 1 algorithmically identify timing of breaks in slope breakpoints in well hydrographs i e time series datasets of water table elevation in meters above sea level for individual wells in the high plains region and 2 use the direction of change in slope as a response variable in a classification and regression tree cart analysis with covariates including year to year changes in commodity price change in drought index and years before or after establishment of a groundwater management area scripts for this analysis are available online haacker 2019 2 2 well hydrographs segmented regressions were performed on each time series of water table elevations in meters above sea level also referred to as a well hydrographs the united states geological survey usgs compiles depth to water data for the nation including the high plains region usgs 2017 qi 2010 prior to analysis of the depth to water data we performed a series of quality control procedures wells with a depth to water measurement of zero were omitted along with well measurements that were flagged in the usgs database to indicate that levels were affected by nearby pumping measurements taken during the growing season may to september inclusive were excluded to minimize seasonal effects from irrigation pumping water level measurements for each well were then averaged over the october 1 to september 30 water year for example measurements used for the 1980 water year were taken between october 1 1979 and april 30 1980 thereby excluding the irrigation season water table elevations were calculated by subtracting the depth to water from the ground surface elevation determined at the well location from the 1 3 elevation grid from the usgs 3d elevation program usgs 2016 to analyze changes in water table trajectories we restricted the dataset to wells that had measurements for ten or more not necessarily consecutive water years most wells had gaps in their record with no measurements for one or more water years specifically many wells are measured every other year often wells are measured irregularly sometimes with decades between measurements thus ten unique years of measurements for a given well may be spread out over a much longer timespan here we excluded wells with gaps between measurements exceeding two years this restriction was imposed for a number of reasons first the breakpoint analysis required estimates of data for missing years which we chose to do via linear interpolation between adjacent years this interpolation reduces the natural noise in annual well measurements artificially inflating the goodness of fit of linear regressions on the entire dataset second if an underlying change in trend occurs during a measurement gap interpolation of the data series reduces the chance that the breakpoint will be successfully identified third if a breakpoint is identified it is likely to be more statistically significant at the point when measurements were paused or when they began again since the water table trend is constant between those points thus 5074 wells with at least ten unique years of data but with any single measurement gap greater than two consecutive years were excluded the average percentage of years with missing data was 34 for the excluded wells in contrast to 5 7 for the remaining wells with no large measurement gap following these quality control steps an initial dataset of 106 716 individual wells with at least one valid measurement was reduced to a database of 12 441 well hydrographs serially complete no missing observations within the observation period for each well valid wells for breakpoint analysis have records as early as 1929 with the maximum of 2132 records taken in 1970 2 3 spatial and temporal datasets three additional datasets were collected for consideration as explanatory variables for change in well hydrograph slope including extent and establishment dates of groundwater management areas climate information and crop commodity prices these variables were included as covariates in a classification and regression tree cart analysis a shapefile of groundwater management area boundaries was compiled for texas kansas nebraska and colorado which included the year of formation of each groundwater management area fig 3 texas has both the earliest 1951 and latest formed 1998 groundwater management areas included in this study most groundwater management areas were formed in the late 1960s to mid 1970s other explanatory variables used were the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 noaa 2017 and yearly corn price nass 2017 annual pdsi data were available noaa 2017 at low resolution 2 square of latitude and longitude which is 250 000 square kilometers and roughly the scale of the southern high plains pdsi incorporates precipitation and temperature to derive a more holistic measure of agricultural drought than precipitation alone negative pdsi numbers indicate drought while positive numbers signify unusually moist conditions the pdsi magnitude indicates the severity of the deviation from the regional mean climate the pdsi incorporates both precipitation and temperature and can thus provide a more holistic representation of plant stress than precipitation alone national prices for corn sorghum and cotton were obtained from the national agricultural statistics service usda 2017 records used for this analysis were for the commodity total price received for the crop year adjusted to 2016 dollars deines et al 2017 found that higher crop prices are correlated with greater water use which is consistent with previous findings that water use for irrigation is less elastic for higher priced commodities scheierling et al 2006 crop prices can affect irrigation demand within a season because farmers generally market their grain prior to the height of the irrigation season and irrigators have significant latitude in the amount of water they put on crops burr et al 2018 deines et al 2017 over longer timescales commodity prices help drive other factors in water demand such as acreage planted and investment in irrigation equipment prices for corn sorghum and cotton are strongly correlated with one another correlation coefficient 0 95 we use corn price to represent commodity prices since corn is grown widely on the high plains is typically irrigated throughout the region and tracks closely with the price of other commodities such as soybeans and sorghum additionally saturated thickness of the aquifer was calculated for each well by subtracting the aquifer base elevation from the water table elevation since the aquifer base elevation is constant the slope of saturated thickness over time is the same as the slope of the water table over time for each year a single average saturated thickness value was calculated for all wells either with or without a change in slope in the three northern central and southern high plains regions an estimate of aquifer base elevation was needed to calculate saturated thickness the aquifer base elevation data was amalgamated from four sources the texas groundwater availability model for texas new mexico and oklahoma deeds and jigmond 2015 a contour map provided by the kansas geological survey kgs ku edu for the kansas high plains borehole estimates from usgs data series 777 houston et al 2011 in the northern high plains and an earlier contour map from the usgs cederstrand and becker 1998 for parts of colorado that were not covered by other datasets point scale datasets and contour maps were converted from feet to meters and interpolated to create continuous rasters of aquifer base elevation and these rasters were combined using a raster catalog function in arcgis 2 4 breakpoint analysis the first part of our analysis used segmented regression shao and campbell 2002 muggeo 2008 a broken line fitting technique to identify occurrence of statistically significant changes in slope or breakpoints in water table elevation over time well hydrographs fig 5 segmented regression estimates slopes of linear regressions but also identifies changes in slope and statistical significance of these changes this technique is more sophisticated and explicit than traditional unit root tests which are designed to test time series stationarity leybourne et al 1998 other unit root methods such as zivot andrews zivot and andrews 1992 or clemente montañés reyes clemente et al 1998 unit root tests designed to identify stationarity with one and two breaks in trend respectively would also be appropriate though neither have been widely applied in the hydrologic sciences each of the 12 441 well hydrographs was analyzed using the r package segmented muggeo 2008 which uses a modified linear regression to algorithmically identify a slope break or breaks in a data series illustrated in fig 5 with the segmented package we fit a linear model to each well water level time series allowing for one possible breakpoint defined as the decimal year at which a break in slope occurs allowing for only a single change in slope does simplify the often complex drawdown history of each well but importantly this restriction avoids overfitting which increases confidence in the physical and statistical significance of the identified change in slope after breakpoints were determined we calculated the significance of each breakpoint using the score test muggeo 2016 if the score test calculated p value was less than 0 05 the breakpoint for that well was considered significant and was included in further analysis since the initial breakpoint estimate is initialized using a random seed rather than being a user input variable the segmented regression was run 100 times for each well hydrograph and the mode of the resulting breakpoint estimates was used for further analysis the mode breakpoint year differed from the mean in less than 2 of well hydrographs suggesting low sensitivity to the initial breakpoint estimate 12 022 wells 97 of all well hydrographs analyzed had a significant break in slope in at least one run 94 of all well hydrographs had a change in slope identified in at least 90 percent of the runs for wells with a significant break in slope in all runs we quantified the slope change across the break as either a positive or a negative deflection a positive deflection across the breakpoint indicates slowing decline recovery of the water table e g fig 5a or accelerating increases in the water table in 4 of positive changes in slope likewise negative deflections indicate the start of water table decline acceleration of decline e g fig 5c or slowing of water table increase in 3 of negative slope changes we then defined an aggregate measure of breakpoint behavior within the northern central and southern high plains the net annual break fraction r r p n n where p and n represent the total count of positive and negative changes in slope in a given year and n is the total count of well records for the year the number of breaks was divided by the number of measurements n to reduce the effects of years with only a small number of wells particularly toward the beginning of the time series 2 5 classification and regression tree analysis the segmented regression analysis yielded a dataset of 10 663 wells with statistically significant breakpoints identified in 90 or more runs out of 100 each of these wells was given an identifier positive or negative corresponding to the direction of the change in slope at the breakpoint this deflection identifier was then used as a response variable in a further analysis using classification and regression tree cart modeling a decision tree method that permits use of both continuous and discrete variables cart does not impose linear relationships between explanatory and response variables breiman et al 1984 unlike other methods such as multiple linear regression modeling another advantage of cart is the avoidance of stepwise regression which can lead to spurious results smith 2018 cart analysis was carried out using the r package rpart therneau and atkinson 2018 the cart method splits the response variables into subgroups based on the commonalities in their explanatory variables the splits in the decision trees are designed to maximize the similarity within groups and to maximize the difference between groups once the tree is grown i e the observations of the response variable are split into subgroups based on the explanatory variables the tree is then pruned to avoid overfitting by removing splits that do not sufficiently improve model fit this process results in fewer subgroups than the original decision tree but a more robust model cart is widely used in environmental applications that involve both discrete and continuous explanatory variables e g martin et al 2011 juntakut et al 2019 we applied cart on a parsimonious set of explanatory variables not to best predict the factors governing changes in water level trajectories but rather to understand how known key local regional and national drivers might be correlated to changes in those trajectories here we included just five explanatory variables change in pdsi change in corn price years before or after groundwater management district establishment hpa subregion and state the climate variable input was the difference in five year average pdsi for the region northern southern or central before and after the identified change in slope the difference in corn price was also calculated using five year averages before and after each well s breakpoint 433 wells within five years of the beginning and end of the data period were excluded 12 wells with breakpoints before 1937 421 wells with breakpoints after 2011 leaving 10 663 wells for categorization in cart 8873 wells were within a groundwater management district and the number of years between the breakpoint and the establishment of the groundwater district was included for those wells 3 results and discussion 3 1 regional patterns the northern central and southern high plains each have distinct cycles of positive and negative deflections in water table trajectory over time fig 6 in general during years when many wells experience significant changes in slope few if any nearby wells experience opposite changes in slope this was unexpected considering the variation in well design and management strategies that might otherwise lead to random patterns of annual break fractions despite this regional consistency strong positive or negative signals seen in one region are frequently muted or absent in other regions for example in the 1990s the southern high plains experienced a significant acceleration in aquifer depletion evidenced by dominantly negative changes in slope while the central high plains witnessed some slowing of declines for the period of analysis the earliest breakpoint cycles in the northern high plains are mostly positive indicating slower declines or shifts from decline to recovery these positive change in slope cycles may be influenced by irrigation from the platte river representing increased recharge from surface flows a large positive break occurs in the 1950s with more muted signals in later years followed by a high occurrence of negative changes in slope peaking in the year 2000 this general pattern also holds true for the central high plains but the later period corresponds to relative recovery in the southern high plains a large negative deflection occurred in the central high plains in 2010 when nearly 10 of measured wells experienced a negative change in slope this signal may reflect the onset of the drought that became severe in 2012 during which all regions of the high plains aquifer experienced negative changes in slope despite a simultaneous reduction of irrigated area deines et al 2017 patterns in the southern high plains are unique in exhibiting several cycles of positive changes in slope in the 1960s and 70 s without large numbers of negative deflections this suggests that positive changes in slope represent different areas that begin recovery perhaps due to decreased pumping or aquifer depletion at different points in time rather than the cycles of decline and recovery that are seen elsewhere the spatial distribution of breakpoints confirms this interpretation 3 2 effects of groundwater management areas we examined breakpoints relative to establishment of groundwater management areas in three states nebraska natural resources districts kansas groundwater management districts and texas underground water conservation districts colorado which has comparable irrigation districts lacked sufficient data for independent spatial analysis but is included in regional assessment of the northern and central high plains below in nebraska the establishment of natural resources districts was followed mostly by positive changes in slope for the first 3 10 years fig 7 the cycle of negative and positive changes in slope continued after about fifteen years of well recovery natural resources districts in the western part of the state are more difficult to assess since fewer long term water table records are available within the natural resources districts there are distinct areas with larger or smaller changes in slope which may be useful to identify for targeted management programs the deflection cycles in the kansas high plains are readily identifiable fig 8 but there is more spatial variation in slope deflections than in the other two regions this may indicate more heterogeneity within the central high plains than in the northern and southern high plains in kansas the establishment of groundwater management districts was associated with a strong signal of negative change in slope in the west although the central kansas groundwater management districts 2 and 5 showed less change in slope during this period this may indicate that the groundwater management districts were formed as a response to strong declines in water levels which is supported by the recent history of local enhanced management areas golden and guerrero 2017 drysdale and hendricks 2018 deines et al 2019 rather than steep declines occurring because of the establishment of management districts in western kansas the imposition of management districts was followed by a long period of slowing declines however the three western groundwater management districts have a few wells with faster declines even in years with overall recovery western kansas also has many wells with large changes in slope at their breakpoints particularly groundwater management district 3 central kansas groundwater management districts 2 and 5 are slightly more volatile with a shorter cycle of decline and recovery higher peak annual break fractions and very few wells with slope deflections that are opposite the regional trend for that year overall central and western kansas tend to behave independently in terms of their deflection cycles likely reflecting differences in geology central kansas has younger less compact sediments facilitating recharge groundwater management districts 1 3 and 4 in western kansas are also in the driest part of the state the underground water conservation districts of texas show a strong regional signal fig 9 unlike the nebraska natural resources districts and the kansas groundwater management districts the texas districts were established over several decades fig 9 indicates that the periods of rapid decline and recovery in texas tend to be similar in areas with and without a conservation district although the creation of management districts is generally followed by a period of recovery within ten to fifteen years changes in slope tend to be largest in magnitude in the southern high plains across the hpa wells were more likely to have negative changes in slope around the time that management districts were established fig 10 this figure shifts the time basis for all wells within management districts such that year 0 is the date of local district formation negative values indicate years prior to formation and positive values years after formation overall negative changes in slope peaked one year after management districts were established and positive changes in slope followed 3 10 years after management district establishment 3 3 saturated thickness wells must have positive changes in slope when they or nearby wells are no longer yielding enough water for efficient irrigation and pumping stops the effect of well yield decline could not be assessed directly using this statistical design the operative factor for well yield decline is saturated thickness which is the water table elevation minus the constant aquifer base elevation thus the annual time series of saturated thickness is statistically equivalent to the annual water table elevation saturated thickness was assessed indirectly by comparing the annual average saturated thickness in a region to the average saturated thickness in wells with breakpoints in that year positive changes in slope tend to occur in wells whose saturated thickness is less than the regional average while wells that have a negative change in slope faster decline tend to have greater than average saturated thickness fig 11 on average wells with negative changes in slope have 9 5 4 8 and 4 8 m greater than average saturated thickness in the year of their breakpoint in the northern central and southern high plains respectively for positive changes in slope the average differences for the northern central and southern high plains are 5 9 m 2 4 m and 2 5 m respectively saturated thickness is not a perfect proxy for water yield at any particular well despite being informative at a regional scale many wells are not screened to the aquifer base particularly older wells and those in the northern high plains perrone and jasechko 2017 and well yield depends on other factors such as the well diameter and pump location hecox et al 2002 foster et al 2017 thus this does not indicate a pumping efficiency threshold for saturated thickness but is a qualitative finding consistent with the hypothesis that parts of the aquifer are no longer being pumped because there is insufficient saturated thickness 3 4 classification and regression tree results the classification and regression tree cart analysis was performed to identify potential causes for wells with positive or negative changes in slope across the high plains the cart model for slope deflections in the high plains is shown in fig 12 wells with negative deflections tended to have drying conditions marked by a change in pdsi of 3 7 among wells in locations that experienced less drying or wetter conditions a large drop in corn price 2 47 bushel was associated with positive changes in hydrograph slope for wells experiencing neither large drying signals nor large drops in corn price change in pdsi was once again the most significant factor according to the cart model wells in locations that experienced much wetter conditions change in pdsi 6 8 associated with a change in slope were more likely to have a positive deflection in the well hydrograph wells without strong climate and price signals were more likely to experience negative changes in slope if the breakpoint was prior to management district establishment or less than 6 5 years after the establishment of a management area but this split was not statistically significant overall this parsimonious cart model accounted for 18 of the variation in the direction of change in slope in well hydrographs this relatively low model performance indicates that while these five selected factors are correlated to well breakpoints other more local factors likely determine much of the individual trajectory in each well an additional cause for low model performance is likely the heterogeneous sampling periods for each well breakpoints are necessarily constrained to lie within the period of sampling thus the identified breakpoints in a particular well may not be the most significant actual change in water level trajectory at that location rather the most significant such change observed during the available period of record 4 conclusions previous attempts to characterize water level declines have assumed that changes in water level were linear e g haacker et al 2016 or logistic steward and allen 2016 our analysis demonstrates that nearly all wells have significant breakpoints in water table trajectory driven by national regional and local factors rates of change have significant variations with time and space due to climate crop prices and other factors that determine the range of management options available to irrigators thus steady short term trends in water level elevation cannot be reasonably extrapolated to the end of the aquifer lifespan despite the many factors that complicate interpretation of breakpoints and multiple management strategies used by farmers coherent cycles of rapid decline and relative recovery occur at the regional level this is good news because if the water table did decline monotonically it would suggest that depletion is inevitable and that extending the life of the aquifer would be difficult or impossible fluctuations in the rate of water table decline suggests that there are opportunities to enhance the lifespan of the resource through improved management segmented regression of well hydrographs provides a new method to evaluate groundwater resources over time breakpoint analysis is particularly appropriate when there is an expectation that a specific change should lead directly to a recovery of the water table or at least a decrease in the rate of decline breakpoint analysis could provide a rubric for groundwater managers as an alternative to saturated thickness targets rather than striving to limit water table declines for example a groundwater management area could adopt a goal of reducing the rate of water table decline well hydrographs are relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain compared with water use data and changes in the water table incorporate the effects of all management and surface processes including changes in pumping and recharge managers may also be interested in examining differences in farming practices between wells with and without breakpoints in a given cycle locally mandated reductions in pumping are being voluntarily adopted in some areas of the high plains in kansas local enhanced management areas are being adopted across much of the high plains in the western portion of the state initial results are very promising with farmers improving irrigation efficiency and decreasing overall withdrawals drysdale and hendricks 2018 deines et al 2019 process based modeling would be necessary to fully interrogate the causative relationships in the system and the sensitivity of hydrograph slopes to various conditions despite the difficulty in establishing causal relationships climate and crop prices both appear to influence rates of groundwater decline machine learning models e g sahoo et al 2017 have strong potential for statistical prediction of water tables particularly for taking account of nonlinear relationships between water use climate and economic factors additionally it is possible to incorporate covariates directly into segmented regression muggeo et al 2014 making this method very promising for future research and application in sustainability and tipping point studies cart analysis showed that factors beyond farmers control climate and crop prices help to drive water demand future work should focus on implications of management strategies wells tend to have negative slope deflections around the time of establishment of management areas but this was not a strong predictor for positive or negative changes in slope years to establishment of a groundwater management area was only important in wells with breakpoints that were not associated with a large wetting or drying signal or a large drop in corn price this suggests that management areas and negative deflections in hydrographs may share a common cause drought with the exception of the nebraska natural resources districts most groundwater management areas are formed by irrigators to facilitate groundwater use rather than limit it white and kromm 1995 they invariably perform useful services such as capping wells and may enforce existing regulations such as water rights priority for senior users and spacing between wells which may have a small effect on water level declines however only a few areas to date have seen large mandated and enforced decreases in withdrawals in the future it is possible that breakpoint analysis could help evaluate the effectiveness of programs such as the sheridan 6 local enhanced management area in kansas in which irrigators voluntarily imposed pumping limits declarations of interest none

11061,we use an 82 year record of water table data from the high plains aquifer to introduce a new application of segmented regression to hydrogeology and evaluate the effects of droughts crop prices and local groundwater management on groundwater level trajectories across the high plains we find discernable regional cycles of faster and slower water table declines a parsimonious classification and regression tree cart analysis details correlations between select explanatory variables and changes in water table trajectories quantified as changes in slope of well hydrographs drying relative to prior year conditions is associated with negative changes in slope in the absence of drying conditions steep declines in commodity price are associated with positive changes in hydrograph slopes establishment of a groundwater management area is not a strong predictor for change in water table trajectories but more wells tend to have negative changes in around the time of management areas are formation suggesting that drought conditions are associated with both negative deflections in water table trajectory and enactment of management areas segmented regression is a promising tool for groundwater managers to evaluate change thresholds and the effectiveness of management strategies on groundwater storage and decline using readily available water table data keywords segmented regression irrigation drawdown sustainability ogallala cart 1 introduction and background 1 1 groundwater depletion and management groundwater in major areas of the high plains aquifer is being rapidly depleted mcguire 2012 for the past few decades attention has focused on the likely pathways and timescales to aquifer depletion e g scanlon et al 2012 steward and allen 2016 haacker et al 2016 over allocation of surface water resources shifting demands on water supplies changing climate and variable precipitation technological advances and growing awareness of the ecological needs of stream systems are increasing farmers reliance on groundwater systems as a steady source of water meanwhile agricultural intensification and increased demand for crops as feed and fuel are placing greater stress on existing water supplies despite the critical role that groundwater plays in providing water for irrigation groundwater management in the united states and elsewhere is underdeveloped relative to surface water management megdal et al 2015 for example in california formal statewide management of groundwater began in 2014 with the sustainable groundwater management act babbit et al 2018 despite the state s long history of conflict among users of surface water reisner 1986 groundwater laws in the united states have primarily been enacted at the state level kirchhoff and dilling 2016 despite most states having policies in place the elevation of the water table continues to decline in most semi arid areas with groundwater irrigation smidt et al 2016 many states have established smaller localized groundwater management areas to distribute control of resources based on unique local conditions including water level declines these groundwater management areas were frequently created to serve the needs of local irrigators to extract water without interference from conservation interests green 1973 however some groundwater management areas have evolved in function over time in response to changing local priorities and governance megdal et al 2015 found that the main concerns for groundwater governance at the state level include groundwater contamination user conflicts and water level declines despite the physical nature of these concerns the success of groundwater management areas has generally been evaluated based on social metrics rather than environmental change kirchhoff and dilling 2016 sanderson and frey 2015 about two decades after local groundwater management areas were established in the high plains a survey in colorado and kansas found that two thirds of irrigators felt that their local groundwater management areas should work to reduce groundwater depletion white and kromm 1995 only half felt that their groundwater management areas should attempt to maintain the resource over a specific time horizon although this may be changing where declines have become more severe lauer et al 2018 the physical effects of groundwater management areas have generally not been included in studies that estimate the lifespan of aquifers such as the high plains aquifer in the central united states previous statistical models of aquifer lifespan have assumed monotonic decline that is linear haacker et al 2016 scanlon et al 2012 or logistic steward and allen 2016 in contrast discussions of sustainability are predicated on the notion that aquifer storage decline is reversible leading to a disconnect between what is desirable and what is assumed will occur it is vitally important to recognize that the lifespan of the aquifer can be extended by slowing or reversing declines on the other hand an acceleration of decline suggests a failure of management to work toward groundwater sustainability this analysis attempts to define and explore the thresholds for changes in water table elevation trends in order to inform predictions of the pattern of decline and recovery the motivation for this study was to identify any changes in groundwater level trajectory that occur when a localized groundwater management area is established on the high plains here we demonstrate that cycles of faster and slower decline have occurred throughout the high plains aquifer and are associated with variable climate temperature and precipitation conditions and commodity prices we quantify timing of changes in trajectory breakpoints of groundwater levels and compare the net number of annual breaks in slope with the establishment of groundwater management areas we employ a method rarely used in water resources studies segmented regression muggeo 2008 shao and campbell 2002 we demonstrate its utility for assessing changes in the trajectory of water levels in a heavily utilized aquifer 1 2 study site the high plains aquifer is the source for nearly one third of all groundwater used for irrigation in the united states 98 of water extracted from the high plains aquifer is used for irrigation dennehy et al 2002 two features make this aquifer a particularly important resource it is very large and much the overlying arable land receives insufficient precipitation for reliable rainfed agriculture the high plains aquifer stored approximately 3500 km3 of water in 2016 distributed very unevenly across 450 000 km2 of land area spread over eight states fig 1 much of the high plains region has a saturated thickness that is barely sufficient for irrigation haacker et al 2016 depending on the hydraulic conductivity and other factors hecox et al 2002 however the saturated thickness varies widely from effectively zero in much of new mexico to hundreds of meters in the nebraska sand hills much more water is withdrawn than returns to the aquifer each year scanlon et al 2012 water from the high plains aquifer contributes significantly to state economies from 1996 2005 kansas farmers annually withdrew about 110 million usd worth of groundwater fenichel et al 2016 the combination of hydrogeologic and economic factors make groundwater management from the high plains region both imperative and difficult the aquifer is commonly divided into three subregions northern central and southern stanton et al 2011 fig 1 mean annual temperatures are higher to the south and precipitation roughly doubles from west to east fig 2 a and b the northern high plains which has the lowest average evaporative demand has greater mean saturated aquifer thickness and recharge than the central or southern high plains across most of the central and southern high plains pumping for irrigation has caused large declines in groundwater levels fig 2c although many early irrigators in texas believed that their groundwater was an inexhaustible resource green 1973 the problem of aquifer depletion was recognized as early as the 1930s theis 1937 white et al 1946 increased understanding and awareness has not forestalled the intensive growth of regional farm economies over the past eight decades economies that rely on unsustainable groundwater resources fig 2d sanderson and frey 2015 1 3 groundwater management areas nebraska colorado kansas and texas together cover about 80 of the area overlying the high plains aquifer these four states have comparable groundwater management areas fig 3 key features of these groundwater management areas are that they retain some jurisdiction over local natural resources including groundwater and can raise funds and create rules and obligations for irrigators within their boundaries the 41 groundwater management areas in this study are predominantly within the boundaries of the high plains aquifer fig 3 and were typically instituted a few decades after extensive local aquifer development beyond these commonalities groundwater management areas are diverse in their operation and functions nebraska s natural resources districts which are primarily funded through property taxes were created by the state legislature in the early 1970 s to manage natural resources at a semiautonomous local level groundwater management areas in colorado and texas on the other hand were organized largely to support the needs of local irrigators and maintain profits white and kromm 1995 in texas the comparable groundwater management areas structures are underground water conservation districts not to be confused with state designated groundwater management areas which play a very different top down governance role the first underground water districts in texas conservation was not initially part of their name were created to thwart the adoption of state level groundwater use restrictions green 1973 kansas has taken an intermediate approach between nebraska and texas to create management districts ensuring a conservation agenda for groundwater districts that are established and yet mandating that districts be created only at the request of irrigators bossert 1993 despite their roles in supporting regional irrigation some groundwater management areas in colorado texas and kansas have increasingly adopted the role of conservation entities a prime example is the creation of the sheridan 6 local enhanced management area in kansas groundwater management district 4 the local enhanced management areas are not specifically examined in this paper because the original sheridan 6 district covers a small area six sections of land 256 km2 about one third the size of the smallest groundwater management area considered in this study 750 km2 and entirely within an existing groundwater management area regulations within groundwater management areas generally include guidelines for well spacing monitoring and capping of abandoned wells white and kromm 1995 these may be binding or voluntary and may come with subsidies or penalties the institution of pumping restrictions is much more recent and highly variable across the aquifer this paper focuses on the initiation of management since this event is comparable across all management areas and thus yields the largest dataset for statistical analysis and the potential for regulation has been hypothesized as a driver for increased groundwater withdrawals bian et al 2016 following the establishment of groundwater management areas positive inflections in water levels as declines slow or even reverse might indicate conservation of water resources the mechanisms of conservation within groundwater management areas can take numerous forms including taxation education regulation new social norms and increased monitoring 1 4 factors affecting irrigation demand within the limitations of water rights and physical constraints irrigation demand is determined by input costs and expected profit ideally actual water use data would be available or could be calculated based on crop extent and water requirements there are several challenges to that approach most importantly irrigation extent has not been estimated for the high plains before the 1980s and remote sensing methods do not distinguish groundwater from surface water sources deines et al 2017 county level crop acreage is collected every five years but measurement of irrigated acreage is sporadic irrigation wells were rarely monitored for flow before the 2000s and it remains difficult to obtain water use data in states other than kansas other methods for estimating groundwater demand rely on change in measured water levels nieswiadomy 1985 which is the response variable used in this study net water level change is also partially determined by recharge and return flows which are difficult to estimate highly variable in space and time and dependent on irrigation technology aside from factors under the control of groundwater management areas a host of conditions can affect the demand for irrigation water in the high plains changes in agricultural technology and management may be driven by broad market and non conservation policy factors such as shifts in crop prices changes in crop genetics or interstate river basin compacts there are regulatory legal and policy actions that may affect water use at scales greater than groundwater management areas i e state interstate or federal the high plains region is very susceptible to drought and groundwater depletion isolating every factor that may have influenced past water level trajectories is beyond the scope of this paper rather we seek to control for the most important market based and physical forces that might have affected water use and for which data are available across the entire area for the decades since aquifer development climate and crop prices are two such factors groundwater serves as a reservoir in times of drought and as an additional supplement to attain higher yields when commodity prices are high agricultural drought occurs at a regional scale whereas crop prices are national both of these patterns stand in contrast to other important determinants of water demand such as extreme climatic events and local economic conditions therefore these factors reflect overarching conditions for irrigators which are applicable throughout and beyond the scale of individual management areas 2 methods 2 1 analysis objectives and procedure our analysis takes two parts fig 4 1 algorithmically identify timing of breaks in slope breakpoints in well hydrographs i e time series datasets of water table elevation in meters above sea level for individual wells in the high plains region and 2 use the direction of change in slope as a response variable in a classification and regression tree cart analysis with covariates including year to year changes in commodity price change in drought index and years before or after establishment of a groundwater management area scripts for this analysis are available online haacker 2019 2 2 well hydrographs segmented regressions were performed on each time series of water table elevations in meters above sea level also referred to as a well hydrographs the united states geological survey usgs compiles depth to water data for the nation including the high plains region usgs 2017 qi 2010 prior to analysis of the depth to water data we performed a series of quality control procedures wells with a depth to water measurement of zero were omitted along with well measurements that were flagged in the usgs database to indicate that levels were affected by nearby pumping measurements taken during the growing season may to september inclusive were excluded to minimize seasonal effects from irrigation pumping water level measurements for each well were then averaged over the october 1 to september 30 water year for example measurements used for the 1980 water year were taken between october 1 1979 and april 30 1980 thereby excluding the irrigation season water table elevations were calculated by subtracting the depth to water from the ground surface elevation determined at the well location from the 1 3 elevation grid from the usgs 3d elevation program usgs 2016 to analyze changes in water table trajectories we restricted the dataset to wells that had measurements for ten or more not necessarily consecutive water years most wells had gaps in their record with no measurements for one or more water years specifically many wells are measured every other year often wells are measured irregularly sometimes with decades between measurements thus ten unique years of measurements for a given well may be spread out over a much longer timespan here we excluded wells with gaps between measurements exceeding two years this restriction was imposed for a number of reasons first the breakpoint analysis required estimates of data for missing years which we chose to do via linear interpolation between adjacent years this interpolation reduces the natural noise in annual well measurements artificially inflating the goodness of fit of linear regressions on the entire dataset second if an underlying change in trend occurs during a measurement gap interpolation of the data series reduces the chance that the breakpoint will be successfully identified third if a breakpoint is identified it is likely to be more statistically significant at the point when measurements were paused or when they began again since the water table trend is constant between those points thus 5074 wells with at least ten unique years of data but with any single measurement gap greater than two consecutive years were excluded the average percentage of years with missing data was 34 for the excluded wells in contrast to 5 7 for the remaining wells with no large measurement gap following these quality control steps an initial dataset of 106 716 individual wells with at least one valid measurement was reduced to a database of 12 441 well hydrographs serially complete no missing observations within the observation period for each well valid wells for breakpoint analysis have records as early as 1929 with the maximum of 2132 records taken in 1970 2 3 spatial and temporal datasets three additional datasets were collected for consideration as explanatory variables for change in well hydrograph slope including extent and establishment dates of groundwater management areas climate information and crop commodity prices these variables were included as covariates in a classification and regression tree cart analysis a shapefile of groundwater management area boundaries was compiled for texas kansas nebraska and colorado which included the year of formation of each groundwater management area fig 3 texas has both the earliest 1951 and latest formed 1998 groundwater management areas included in this study most groundwater management areas were formed in the late 1960s to mid 1970s other explanatory variables used were the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 noaa 2017 and yearly corn price nass 2017 annual pdsi data were available noaa 2017 at low resolution 2 square of latitude and longitude which is 250 000 square kilometers and roughly the scale of the southern high plains pdsi incorporates precipitation and temperature to derive a more holistic measure of agricultural drought than precipitation alone negative pdsi numbers indicate drought while positive numbers signify unusually moist conditions the pdsi magnitude indicates the severity of the deviation from the regional mean climate the pdsi incorporates both precipitation and temperature and can thus provide a more holistic representation of plant stress than precipitation alone national prices for corn sorghum and cotton were obtained from the national agricultural statistics service usda 2017 records used for this analysis were for the commodity total price received for the crop year adjusted to 2016 dollars deines et al 2017 found that higher crop prices are correlated with greater water use which is consistent with previous findings that water use for irrigation is less elastic for higher priced commodities scheierling et al 2006 crop prices can affect irrigation demand within a season because farmers generally market their grain prior to the height of the irrigation season and irrigators have significant latitude in the amount of water they put on crops burr et al 2018 deines et al 2017 over longer timescales commodity prices help drive other factors in water demand such as acreage planted and investment in irrigation equipment prices for corn sorghum and cotton are strongly correlated with one another correlation coefficient 0 95 we use corn price to represent commodity prices since corn is grown widely on the high plains is typically irrigated throughout the region and tracks closely with the price of other commodities such as soybeans and sorghum additionally saturated thickness of the aquifer was calculated for each well by subtracting the aquifer base elevation from the water table elevation since the aquifer base elevation is constant the slope of saturated thickness over time is the same as the slope of the water table over time for each year a single average saturated thickness value was calculated for all wells either with or without a change in slope in the three northern central and southern high plains regions an estimate of aquifer base elevation was needed to calculate saturated thickness the aquifer base elevation data was amalgamated from four sources the texas groundwater availability model for texas new mexico and oklahoma deeds and jigmond 2015 a contour map provided by the kansas geological survey kgs ku edu for the kansas high plains borehole estimates from usgs data series 777 houston et al 2011 in the northern high plains and an earlier contour map from the usgs cederstrand and becker 1998 for parts of colorado that were not covered by other datasets point scale datasets and contour maps were converted from feet to meters and interpolated to create continuous rasters of aquifer base elevation and these rasters were combined using a raster catalog function in arcgis 2 4 breakpoint analysis the first part of our analysis used segmented regression shao and campbell 2002 muggeo 2008 a broken line fitting technique to identify occurrence of statistically significant changes in slope or breakpoints in water table elevation over time well hydrographs fig 5 segmented regression estimates slopes of linear regressions but also identifies changes in slope and statistical significance of these changes this technique is more sophisticated and explicit than traditional unit root tests which are designed to test time series stationarity leybourne et al 1998 other unit root methods such as zivot andrews zivot and andrews 1992 or clemente montañés reyes clemente et al 1998 unit root tests designed to identify stationarity with one and two breaks in trend respectively would also be appropriate though neither have been widely applied in the hydrologic sciences each of the 12 441 well hydrographs was analyzed using the r package segmented muggeo 2008 which uses a modified linear regression to algorithmically identify a slope break or breaks in a data series illustrated in fig 5 with the segmented package we fit a linear model to each well water level time series allowing for one possible breakpoint defined as the decimal year at which a break in slope occurs allowing for only a single change in slope does simplify the often complex drawdown history of each well but importantly this restriction avoids overfitting which increases confidence in the physical and statistical significance of the identified change in slope after breakpoints were determined we calculated the significance of each breakpoint using the score test muggeo 2016 if the score test calculated p value was less than 0 05 the breakpoint for that well was considered significant and was included in further analysis since the initial breakpoint estimate is initialized using a random seed rather than being a user input variable the segmented regression was run 100 times for each well hydrograph and the mode of the resulting breakpoint estimates was used for further analysis the mode breakpoint year differed from the mean in less than 2 of well hydrographs suggesting low sensitivity to the initial breakpoint estimate 12 022 wells 97 of all well hydrographs analyzed had a significant break in slope in at least one run 94 of all well hydrographs had a change in slope identified in at least 90 percent of the runs for wells with a significant break in slope in all runs we quantified the slope change across the break as either a positive or a negative deflection a positive deflection across the breakpoint indicates slowing decline recovery of the water table e g fig 5a or accelerating increases in the water table in 4 of positive changes in slope likewise negative deflections indicate the start of water table decline acceleration of decline e g fig 5c or slowing of water table increase in 3 of negative slope changes we then defined an aggregate measure of breakpoint behavior within the northern central and southern high plains the net annual break fraction r r p n n where p and n represent the total count of positive and negative changes in slope in a given year and n is the total count of well records for the year the number of breaks was divided by the number of measurements n to reduce the effects of years with only a small number of wells particularly toward the beginning of the time series 2 5 classification and regression tree analysis the segmented regression analysis yielded a dataset of 10 663 wells with statistically significant breakpoints identified in 90 or more runs out of 100 each of these wells was given an identifier positive or negative corresponding to the direction of the change in slope at the breakpoint this deflection identifier was then used as a response variable in a further analysis using classification and regression tree cart modeling a decision tree method that permits use of both continuous and discrete variables cart does not impose linear relationships between explanatory and response variables breiman et al 1984 unlike other methods such as multiple linear regression modeling another advantage of cart is the avoidance of stepwise regression which can lead to spurious results smith 2018 cart analysis was carried out using the r package rpart therneau and atkinson 2018 the cart method splits the response variables into subgroups based on the commonalities in their explanatory variables the splits in the decision trees are designed to maximize the similarity within groups and to maximize the difference between groups once the tree is grown i e the observations of the response variable are split into subgroups based on the explanatory variables the tree is then pruned to avoid overfitting by removing splits that do not sufficiently improve model fit this process results in fewer subgroups than the original decision tree but a more robust model cart is widely used in environmental applications that involve both discrete and continuous explanatory variables e g martin et al 2011 juntakut et al 2019 we applied cart on a parsimonious set of explanatory variables not to best predict the factors governing changes in water level trajectories but rather to understand how known key local regional and national drivers might be correlated to changes in those trajectories here we included just five explanatory variables change in pdsi change in corn price years before or after groundwater management district establishment hpa subregion and state the climate variable input was the difference in five year average pdsi for the region northern southern or central before and after the identified change in slope the difference in corn price was also calculated using five year averages before and after each well s breakpoint 433 wells within five years of the beginning and end of the data period were excluded 12 wells with breakpoints before 1937 421 wells with breakpoints after 2011 leaving 10 663 wells for categorization in cart 8873 wells were within a groundwater management district and the number of years between the breakpoint and the establishment of the groundwater district was included for those wells 3 results and discussion 3 1 regional patterns the northern central and southern high plains each have distinct cycles of positive and negative deflections in water table trajectory over time fig 6 in general during years when many wells experience significant changes in slope few if any nearby wells experience opposite changes in slope this was unexpected considering the variation in well design and management strategies that might otherwise lead to random patterns of annual break fractions despite this regional consistency strong positive or negative signals seen in one region are frequently muted or absent in other regions for example in the 1990s the southern high plains experienced a significant acceleration in aquifer depletion evidenced by dominantly negative changes in slope while the central high plains witnessed some slowing of declines for the period of analysis the earliest breakpoint cycles in the northern high plains are mostly positive indicating slower declines or shifts from decline to recovery these positive change in slope cycles may be influenced by irrigation from the platte river representing increased recharge from surface flows a large positive break occurs in the 1950s with more muted signals in later years followed by a high occurrence of negative changes in slope peaking in the year 2000 this general pattern also holds true for the central high plains but the later period corresponds to relative recovery in the southern high plains a large negative deflection occurred in the central high plains in 2010 when nearly 10 of measured wells experienced a negative change in slope this signal may reflect the onset of the drought that became severe in 2012 during which all regions of the high plains aquifer experienced negative changes in slope despite a simultaneous reduction of irrigated area deines et al 2017 patterns in the southern high plains are unique in exhibiting several cycles of positive changes in slope in the 1960s and 70 s without large numbers of negative deflections this suggests that positive changes in slope represent different areas that begin recovery perhaps due to decreased pumping or aquifer depletion at different points in time rather than the cycles of decline and recovery that are seen elsewhere the spatial distribution of breakpoints confirms this interpretation 3 2 effects of groundwater management areas we examined breakpoints relative to establishment of groundwater management areas in three states nebraska natural resources districts kansas groundwater management districts and texas underground water conservation districts colorado which has comparable irrigation districts lacked sufficient data for independent spatial analysis but is included in regional assessment of the northern and central high plains below in nebraska the establishment of natural resources districts was followed mostly by positive changes in slope for the first 3 10 years fig 7 the cycle of negative and positive changes in slope continued after about fifteen years of well recovery natural resources districts in the western part of the state are more difficult to assess since fewer long term water table records are available within the natural resources districts there are distinct areas with larger or smaller changes in slope which may be useful to identify for targeted management programs the deflection cycles in the kansas high plains are readily identifiable fig 8 but there is more spatial variation in slope deflections than in the other two regions this may indicate more heterogeneity within the central high plains than in the northern and southern high plains in kansas the establishment of groundwater management districts was associated with a strong signal of negative change in slope in the west although the central kansas groundwater management districts 2 and 5 showed less change in slope during this period this may indicate that the groundwater management districts were formed as a response to strong declines in water levels which is supported by the recent history of local enhanced management areas golden and guerrero 2017 drysdale and hendricks 2018 deines et al 2019 rather than steep declines occurring because of the establishment of management districts in western kansas the imposition of management districts was followed by a long period of slowing declines however the three western groundwater management districts have a few wells with faster declines even in years with overall recovery western kansas also has many wells with large changes in slope at their breakpoints particularly groundwater management district 3 central kansas groundwater management districts 2 and 5 are slightly more volatile with a shorter cycle of decline and recovery higher peak annual break fractions and very few wells with slope deflections that are opposite the regional trend for that year overall central and western kansas tend to behave independently in terms of their deflection cycles likely reflecting differences in geology central kansas has younger less compact sediments facilitating recharge groundwater management districts 1 3 and 4 in western kansas are also in the driest part of the state the underground water conservation districts of texas show a strong regional signal fig 9 unlike the nebraska natural resources districts and the kansas groundwater management districts the texas districts were established over several decades fig 9 indicates that the periods of rapid decline and recovery in texas tend to be similar in areas with and without a conservation district although the creation of management districts is generally followed by a period of recovery within ten to fifteen years changes in slope tend to be largest in magnitude in the southern high plains across the hpa wells were more likely to have negative changes in slope around the time that management districts were established fig 10 this figure shifts the time basis for all wells within management districts such that year 0 is the date of local district formation negative values indicate years prior to formation and positive values years after formation overall negative changes in slope peaked one year after management districts were established and positive changes in slope followed 3 10 years after management district establishment 3 3 saturated thickness wells must have positive changes in slope when they or nearby wells are no longer yielding enough water for efficient irrigation and pumping stops the effect of well yield decline could not be assessed directly using this statistical design the operative factor for well yield decline is saturated thickness which is the water table elevation minus the constant aquifer base elevation thus the annual time series of saturated thickness is statistically equivalent to the annual water table elevation saturated thickness was assessed indirectly by comparing the annual average saturated thickness in a region to the average saturated thickness in wells with breakpoints in that year positive changes in slope tend to occur in wells whose saturated thickness is less than the regional average while wells that have a negative change in slope faster decline tend to have greater than average saturated thickness fig 11 on average wells with negative changes in slope have 9 5 4 8 and 4 8 m greater than average saturated thickness in the year of their breakpoint in the northern central and southern high plains respectively for positive changes in slope the average differences for the northern central and southern high plains are 5 9 m 2 4 m and 2 5 m respectively saturated thickness is not a perfect proxy for water yield at any particular well despite being informative at a regional scale many wells are not screened to the aquifer base particularly older wells and those in the northern high plains perrone and jasechko 2017 and well yield depends on other factors such as the well diameter and pump location hecox et al 2002 foster et al 2017 thus this does not indicate a pumping efficiency threshold for saturated thickness but is a qualitative finding consistent with the hypothesis that parts of the aquifer are no longer being pumped because there is insufficient saturated thickness 3 4 classification and regression tree results the classification and regression tree cart analysis was performed to identify potential causes for wells with positive or negative changes in slope across the high plains the cart model for slope deflections in the high plains is shown in fig 12 wells with negative deflections tended to have drying conditions marked by a change in pdsi of 3 7 among wells in locations that experienced less drying or wetter conditions a large drop in corn price 2 47 bushel was associated with positive changes in hydrograph slope for wells experiencing neither large drying signals nor large drops in corn price change in pdsi was once again the most significant factor according to the cart model wells in locations that experienced much wetter conditions change in pdsi 6 8 associated with a change in slope were more likely to have a positive deflection in the well hydrograph wells without strong climate and price signals were more likely to experience negative changes in slope if the breakpoint was prior to management district establishment or less than 6 5 years after the establishment of a management area but this split was not statistically significant overall this parsimonious cart model accounted for 18 of the variation in the direction of change in slope in well hydrographs this relatively low model performance indicates that while these five selected factors are correlated to well breakpoints other more local factors likely determine much of the individual trajectory in each well an additional cause for low model performance is likely the heterogeneous sampling periods for each well breakpoints are necessarily constrained to lie within the period of sampling thus the identified breakpoints in a particular well may not be the most significant actual change in water level trajectory at that location rather the most significant such change observed during the available period of record 4 conclusions previous attempts to characterize water level declines have assumed that changes in water level were linear e g haacker et al 2016 or logistic steward and allen 2016 our analysis demonstrates that nearly all wells have significant breakpoints in water table trajectory driven by national regional and local factors rates of change have significant variations with time and space due to climate crop prices and other factors that determine the range of management options available to irrigators thus steady short term trends in water level elevation cannot be reasonably extrapolated to the end of the aquifer lifespan despite the many factors that complicate interpretation of breakpoints and multiple management strategies used by farmers coherent cycles of rapid decline and relative recovery occur at the regional level this is good news because if the water table did decline monotonically it would suggest that depletion is inevitable and that extending the life of the aquifer would be difficult or impossible fluctuations in the rate of water table decline suggests that there are opportunities to enhance the lifespan of the resource through improved management segmented regression of well hydrographs provides a new method to evaluate groundwater resources over time breakpoint analysis is particularly appropriate when there is an expectation that a specific change should lead directly to a recovery of the water table or at least a decrease in the rate of decline breakpoint analysis could provide a rubric for groundwater managers as an alternative to saturated thickness targets rather than striving to limit water table declines for example a groundwater management area could adopt a goal of reducing the rate of water table decline well hydrographs are relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain compared with water use data and changes in the water table incorporate the effects of all management and surface processes including changes in pumping and recharge managers may also be interested in examining differences in farming practices between wells with and without breakpoints in a given cycle locally mandated reductions in pumping are being voluntarily adopted in some areas of the high plains in kansas local enhanced management areas are being adopted across much of the high plains in the western portion of the state initial results are very promising with farmers improving irrigation efficiency and decreasing overall withdrawals drysdale and hendricks 2018 deines et al 2019 process based modeling would be necessary to fully interrogate the causative relationships in the system and the sensitivity of hydrograph slopes to various conditions despite the difficulty in establishing causal relationships climate and crop prices both appear to influence rates of groundwater decline machine learning models e g sahoo et al 2017 have strong potential for statistical prediction of water tables particularly for taking account of nonlinear relationships between water use climate and economic factors additionally it is possible to incorporate covariates directly into segmented regression muggeo et al 2014 making this method very promising for future research and application in sustainability and tipping point studies cart analysis showed that factors beyond farmers control climate and crop prices help to drive water demand future work should focus on implications of management strategies wells tend to have negative slope deflections around the time of establishment of management areas but this was not a strong predictor for positive or negative changes in slope years to establishment of a groundwater management area was only important in wells with breakpoints that were not associated with a large wetting or drying signal or a large drop in corn price this suggests that management areas and negative deflections in hydrographs may share a common cause drought with the exception of the nebraska natural resources districts most groundwater management areas are formed by irrigators to facilitate groundwater use rather than limit it white and kromm 1995 they invariably perform useful services such as capping wells and may enforce existing regulations such as water rights priority for senior users and spacing between wells which may have a small effect on water level declines however only a few areas to date have seen large mandated and enforced decreases in withdrawals in the future it is possible that breakpoint analysis could help evaluate the effectiveness of programs such as the sheridan 6 local enhanced management area in kansas in which irrigators voluntarily imposed pumping limits declarations of interest none

11062,film fully mulched ridge furrow fmrf water harvesting film mulched conventional flat planting with one half fmcf and two thirds ftmcf has been widely adopted in northern china however it is unclear whether sustainability are an 8 year corn yield in these three systems was investigated at zhenyuan of east gansu in 2008 to 2015 and a 4 year location study with fmrf and fmcf three corn hybrids and three densities was conducted at pengyang of south ningxia from 2012 to 2015 the results indicated that fmrf with rain harvesting efficiency of 65 7 82 7 makes rainwater infiltrate deep soil and soil moisture double increase in furrow root zone the 8 year average grain yield increased by 22 7 in fmrf and 14 5 in ftmcf compared with fmcf in the 4 year field trail rainfall and its seasonal distribution highly impacted grain yield and water use efficiency wue but order of importance for grain yield and wue increases were density mulching type hybrid grain yield and wue increased by 20 0 and 3 45 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 12 0 and 2 97 kg ha 1 mm 1 from low to medium density and medium to high density et and grain yield and wue increased simultaneously from low to medium density however grain yield and wue improved but et changed slightly from medium to high soil water content of the 0 200 cm layer during growing season was always higher in fmrf than in fmcf and et did not differ fmrf kept more than 50 90 mm soil water in the 0 200 cm during grain filling period neither higher grain yield in the fmrf depleted soil water nor resulted in soil desiccation regardless of the year of precipitation on the contrary the fmrf kept much more water into soil layers at corn harvest and negative effects to soil water balance were not observed thus the package of fmrf combining with close planting and density tolerance hybrids is climate smart technique for coping with droughts and ensuring corn yield in rainfed areas keywords film mulched corn furrow ridge water harvesting

productivity of dryland agriculture stewart and lal 2018 northwest china is a vast semiarid in area with average annual precipitation ranging from 300 to 600 mm fan et al 2005a b about 90 of the cropland in this area receives no irrigation and crop water stress is common however the 60 of the annual precipitation occurs between july and september which does not match with the water demands of crops during their growth periods and only 40 of the precipitation can be used by crops wang et al 2004 sun et al 2016 about 60 of the total precipitation was lost by evaporation from the soil surface wang et al 1999 in addition the annual evaporation in these areas is more than 1500 mm which frequently leads to severe droughts that significantly lowers yields and wue yao and yin 1999 ren et al 2017a b c dryland agriculture production in this region is important for food safety given the current shortage of water resources and continuous increases in the population ren et al 2017a b c corn is one of the most popular grain crops in the semiarid loess plateau region of china and its output accounts for 50 of total grain production in this area however the corn productivity and yield are relatively low in these areas due to water shortages ren et al 2016 it is consent that effective methods to conserve rainwater and increasing wue could be benefit for corn production which could also be meaningful for local food security there are many studies focusing on water use in dryland especially the research about stubble cover no tillage in united states and india as well as water harvesting in israel stanhill 1986 wright and nageswara 1994 boers and ben asher 1982 in recent years there are several mulching techniques to be developed and adopted such as alternating ridges and

spreading in dryland areas of north china areas gan et al 2013 li et al 2013 qin et al 2014 as it is known corn yield in dryland areas is related to both soil water conditions and planting density many researches have been conducted about the relationship among corn planting density yields and wue liu et al 2010 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2009 it is presented that planting density changed the canopy structure of the corn population resulting in the change of canopy lighting environment and increasing the leaf area and transpiration of corn corn yield and wue are expressed as parabolic curve with plant density under irrigation or supplementary irrigation condition sangoi et al 2002 liu 1998 corn population increase usually resulted in soil water depletion and reduced grain yield in dryland areas but did not impact on evapotranspiration et liu 2012 to seek persistent high yield of corn in dryland leads to deep soil water over depletion and soil desiccation hu and chen 2013 dong et al 2000 there is a consensus that great challenges have been suffered from soil water over use by fmrf such as potential risks existing to annual soil water recovery li et al 2003 mo et al 2013 once it is applied improper corn is subjected to premature of aging and then reduce the yield recently the research about fmrf mainly focuses on soil temperature and soil water and

handheld device in 15 20th of april to harvesting by hand in 25 28th of september each year about 3 weeks after seeding plants were annually thinned to one plant per hill later if tillers developed they were removed to avoid competition with the main stem before applying the plastic urea and superphosphate were broadcast applied to supply 250 kg n ha 1 and 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 all treatments completely depended on rainfall and no irrigation was added during the whole corn growth period 2 2 measurements soil water contents were determined at planting and harvest as well as in other growth stages to a depth of 200 cm in 20 cm intervals manually using diameter steel core sampling tube where each sample was replicated three times in fmrf soil was randomly sampled from narrow ridges and wide ridges and in fmcf was taken halfway between planting rows on the film mulched strips the water storage was calculated using equation ren et al 2017a b c w h p b 10 where w is the average water storage mm in the ridges and furrows under fmcf h is the soil layer depth cm p is the soil bulk density g cm 3 in a specific soil layer and b is the percentage of soil moisture by weight the total

sowing and harvest mm under the fmrf system w1 and w2 were averaged in the ridges and furrows c d r are the upward flow into the root zone the downward drainage out of the root zone and the runoff mm respectively which were neglected in this study because the over 100 m groundwater table high water holding capacity and less drainage the water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 of mulched corn was calculated as the ratio of corn yield kg ha 1 to et mm in a crop growing season runoff rainwater from the film ridge furrow planting system was collected from april to june in experiment 1 by installing plastic buckets of 30 cm height with 20 cm diameter between ridge and furrow connection in the fmrf treatment the runoff harvesting area of 1 65 m2 a half area of summing 70 cm ridge and 40

growing season precipitation n1 and n2 cm are the ridge width and furrow width in fig 1 grain yields for experiments 1 and 2 were determined by hand harvesting 10 m2 from each plot respectively grain samples were air dried on concrete threshed oven dried at 70 to a uniform moisture level and weighed 2 3 data analyses in exp 2 analysis of variance anvoa was done to determine main and interactive effects of treatment and year on grain yield and et and wue using proc glm sas inst 1991 there were significant interaction between treatments and years so means separation tests for 4 year corn were not conducted and the data were shown in each year s figures one way anova was therefore made for individual years and mean separation tests among mulching type and density and cultivar were conducted using the least significant difference lsd 0 05 procedure at the 0 05 probability level only when f was significant in expe 1 regression relationship between corn grain yield and wue with planting density was analyzed and estimated potential grain yield and planting density under optimal wue that in turn the reasonable planting density can be confirmed based on observed data contour map of soil water content was graphed by surfer software in order to clearly understand temporal and spatial variation characteristics of water dynamics as well as desiccation in soil profile 3 results 3 1 rain harvesting efficiency comparing with the fmcf collected rainwater in furrow planting zone in fmrf was determined by installing plastic buckets from april to june the results indicated that the rain harvesting efficiency of the fmrf in different rainfall intensity changed greatly which could attribute to dryland corn yield and wue gains and the fmrf make collected rainwater infiltrate deep soil in 1 65 m2 water catchment area of the furrow ridge system collected rainwater amount from the fmrf planting system ranged from 8 11 to 13 32 kg when a 5 10 mm rain fell equal to 80 7 92 7 in rain harvesting efficiency from 1 41 to 6 41 kg in a less 5 mm rain and from 9 43 to 18 95 kg in a 10 15 mm rain the same as 65 7 82 7 and 48 9 78 2 in rain harvesting efficiency respectively table 2 it can deduce that with 70 cm film ridge rainfall harvesting and 40 cm film furrow planting zone if the average rain harvesting efficiency of the fmrf system set at 0 74 in 5 mm rainfall and 0 89 in 10 mm rainfall potential water wp amount collected at crop root zone will be 11 5 mm and 25 5 mm respectively implying soil water value in root zone in the system more than double increases 3 2 grain yield of corn the investigated results showed that film mulching area and mulching type enhanced the spring corn grain yield in exp 1 in a 8 year average grain yields increased by 14 5 and 22 7 when the mulching area to soil surface from 1 2 in fmcf to 2 3 in ftmcf and to 100 in fmrf table 3 statistical analyses of the 4 years of corn grain yield in exp 2 showed that film mulching type and density and hybrid cultivar impacted on grain yields significantly but grain yields were still highly influenced by precipitation and its interaction with treatments represented by the high significant effect of years in the anova table 4 for each year there were significant effects on grain yields of corn due to treatments using lsd data not shown the order of importance for grain yield increase was precipitation plant density mulching type hybrid cultivar from the dry years 2015 and 2014 to the normal year 2012 and the wet year 2013 grain yield increased from 7 72 and 8 79 mg ha 1 to 11 86 mg ha 1 and 11 15 mg ha 1 respectively table 5 grain yield in normal year was 34 92 53 36 higher than that in dry year and was 6 38 higher than that in wet year related to corn lodging due to heavy storm rain in july 2013 whether the year was dry normal or wet grain yield was consistently highest in the high plant density and lowest in the low plant density fig 2 the grain yield improved by 20 62 when the density went from 4 75 104 to 6 0 104 plant ha 1 and by 12 03 from 6 0 104 to 9 0 104 plant ha 1 table 5 the average grain yield increased from 9 16 mg ha 1 in the fmcf to 10 60 mg ha 1 in the fmrf a 15 72 increase in grain yield from low close density cultivar jd4 to medium close density cultivar jx1 the yield increased by 15 46 and from medium close density cultivar to high close density cultivar xy335 the yield improved by 7 79 again these results show the importance of increasing plant density and improving density tolerance of corn varieties even in the dry years because the average yield of 11 27 mg ha 1 from the high density was about 1 35 times higher than that of 8 34 mg ha 1 from the low density 3 3 seasonal et and water use efficiency similar to grain yields the results in exp 2 showed that film mulching type and density and hybrids enhanced the wue significantly p 0 0001 table 4 the wue values increased by 17 35 with 2 25 104 plant ha 1 increase from the low to medium density and 12 73 with the same amount corn plants increase from the medium to high density but the high average wue value 28 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 was obtained in the normal year not in the wet year and the wues were almost same between the wet year of 2013 and the normal year of 2014 in the dry year of 2012 the wue value was the highest the average values were 37 05 kg ha 1 mm 1 in jx1 and 36 45 kg ha 1 mm 1 in xy335 and 33 45 kg ha 1 mm 1 in jd4 when planting density was 9 0 104 plant ha 1 fig 2 when film mulching area to soil surface from 50 in the fmcf to 100 in the fmrf wue increased by 21 09 in addition improving the hybrid density tolerance can raise the wue such as average wue ranged from 20 98 kg ha 1 mm 1 in jd4 23 78 kg ha 1 mm 1 in jx1and to 24 25 kg ha 1 mm 1 in xy335 respectively like grain yields and wues ets were also significantly influenced by precipitation and plant density and hybrids significantly p 0 0001 however not affected by film mulching type p 0 4176 suggesting grain yield and wue will be improved with almost same et amount in the fmrf and fmcf treatments the importance of treatments affecting on et ranked as precipitation hybrid density grain yield and et and wue increased simultaneously when the density changed from low to medium level grain yield and wue increased but ets did not increase with the density increasing from medium to high level table 5 the ets between jx1 and xy335 hybrids were no significant difference due to medium to high density tolerance and same growth periods et in jd4 with low density tolerance and early maturity was statistically significant with that in jx1 and xy335 with medium to high density tolerance jd4 cultivar reduced et by 18 6 23 0 mm compared to jx1 and xy335 cultivars in dryland condition et differences was far less than grain yield and wue changes caused by plant density treatments no matter how precipitation grain yield and wue increased as improvement of hybrids density tolerance interaction between hybrids and density on grain yield and wue was higher in the normal and wet years than in dry years indicating their interactions decreased with precipitation reduction 3 4 soil water changes in 4 consecutive years from april 2012 to october 2015 the results present that the fmrf always improved the soil moisture content in the 0 200 cm soil layer at corn growing period compared with the fmcf fig 3 whether the fmrf or fmcf treatment the soil moisture content was in line with seasonal rainfall when the field trial went to the year of 2014 and 2015 seasonal rainfall during corn growth period decreased significantly and total rainfall in 7 8 months was about 90 mm which roughly accounting for 50 in 2012 and 30 in 2013 compared with the same months whereas average soil moisture content of the 0 200 cm layer for the fmrf was 12 5 on 4 august and 12 37 on 20 august 2014 increased by 2 66 and 1 98 percentage points compared to the fmcf the soil moisture was 15 66 on june 30 and 13 55 on 30 august 2015 with 3 49 and 3 39 percentage points over the fmcf indicating that the fmrf stored more than 50 90 mm soil water in the 0 200 cm layer during corn grain filling periods which playing an important roles in drought resistance and yield increase when corn suffers from severe drought in summer season more importantly soil water distribution of the 0 200 soil layer changed greatly duo to corn grow depletion and rainfall infiltration in the 4 years study periods soil moisture content of the 0 200 cm layer during corn growing season was always higher in the fmrf than in the fmcf treatment fig 4 comparing with the fmcf the pro sowing soil water storage of the 0 200 cm layer in the fmrf increased by 68 7 mm in 2012 56 3 mm in 2013 77 8 mm in 2014 and 63 2 mm in 2015 respectively it is particularly noteworthy that the fmrf can increase the 0 200 cm soil moisture storage at the corn harvest by 47 8 64 5 74 6 and 58 0 mm in 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively related to the fmcf 3 5 soil desiccation during the 4 consecutive study years including one normal year 2012 and one wet year 2013 and two dry years 2014 and 2015 isoline distribution of soil gravimetrical water content graphed by surfer software present a clear contrast of soil moisture between the fmrf and the fmcf fig 5 and soil moisture showed different characteristics not only in the vertical soil profile but also in the study period as mentioned above soil moistures of the 0 200 cm profile during corn growth period were consistently greater in the fmrf than in the fmcf particularly in the fmcf soil moisture in the 0 200 cm profile decreased significantly and fell to 11 1 12 5 in the 80 120 cm layer on 10 september 2012 11 8 12 7 in the 120 140 cm layer on 5 june 2013 7 9 8 7 in the 100 140 cm layer on 10 september 2014 and 6 7 9 5 in the 40 140 cm layer on 10 september 2015 implying in the dry years a desiccated soil layer with soil moisture content less than 8 was formed and its thickness deepened and range extended as times went on however in the fmrf system high grain yield of corn did not exhaust soil water and not result in the desiccated soil layer formation thus negative effects on soil water cycle was not observed consider of the field water balance for the 4 consecutive study years overall et value of 1680 2 mm in the fmrf was 56 9 mm less than that of 1737 1 mm in the fmcf and total precipitation from 20 april 2012 to 30 september 2015 was 1920 mm precipitation use rate expressed as total et divided by total precipitation was 87 5 for the fmrf and 90 5 for the fmcf however the wue values were 25 38 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the fmrf and 20 96 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the fmcf 3 6 grain yield and wue to planting density as stated above grain yield and wue of dryland corn were affected highly by plant density we found that grain yield or wue has a quadratic relationship with the density fig 6 and maximum density for achieving the highest grain yield was 8 28 104 plant ha 1 which was 0 34 104 plant ha 1 higher than that of 7 94 104 plant ha 1 in the highest wue thus a suitable density for film mulched corn production should be determined by the density with highest wue value and not by that with maximum yield 4 discussion available soil water are very important for getting high yields in dryland area li et al 2010 zhou et al 2011 the present study highlighted that the fmrf cropping was very efficient at keeping rainwater into soil in turn increasing grain yield and wue in rainfed farming systems ramakrishna et al 2006 gan et al 2013 ren et al 2010 liu et al 2009a b evidenced by the fact that it increased soil water storage in the 0 200 cm layer and reduced soil water evaporation by mulching on ridge furrow ren et al 2010 liu et al 2009a b it was certainly because the fmrf reduced the area available for evaporation from soil surface decreased ineffective evaporations from the soil and thus obtained a higher wue than other treatments jia et al 2017 in our study with the fmrf the rain harvesting efficiency of 48 9 to 92 7 varied significantly with different rainfall intensities particularly exceeded 80 in a light rainfall and soil water storage in root zone can double increase related to rainfall amount as usually less than 5 mm rainfall is ineffective to crop production the soil moisture was significantly higher in the 0 100 cm layer under the fmrf compared with the fmcf which was mostly because of the following two reasons one is the ridge furrow system could accumulate rainfall to enhance water infiltration and retention and another is film fully mulched on ridge furrow could prevent the soil water exchange between the soil and air to decrease completely the evaporation of soil water ren et al 2017a b c but most soil moisture might have evaporated directly from the bare flat surface in fmcf or ftmcf treatment li et al 2016a our study indicated that corn grain yield increased with the increase of film mulched area in which the much soil water evaporation can be reduced by increasing the mulched area to the soil surface based on the 4 consecutive years and an 8 year field study the fmrf increased 15 2 and 22 7 of corn yield comparing with the fmcf and yield increase was firstly related to precipitation then to planting density and hybrid cultivar no significant difference of et was observed both fmrf and fmcf a similar field study also reported that difference in water loss or accumulation of rainfall in soil was not significant between non mulched and mulched treatments indicating that corn transpired a similar amount of water under no mulch and mulch during over growth season of corn liu et al 2014a b c corn yield et and wue increased with the planting density from 4 5 to 9 0 104 plant ha 1 attributing to corn leaves area and transpiration increase in high density condition liu et al 2010 but et increased slightly relatively it had small change of et in the fmrf when corn density was above 6 75 104 plant ha 1 while wue and grain yield continuously increased the same thing as in the dry years of 2014 and 2015 these results were consistent with findings of no et difference among corn densities zhang et al 2014 although increasing corn density intensify soil water extraction from deep layer and has little influence on soil water consumption in dryland corn production some studies showed that et in corn production was persistent under the certain grain yield level and specific area because et was calculated by evaporation of leaves and stems and the transpiration ratio transpiration to evapotranspiration t et could be changed by agronomic measures wang et al 2013 the fmrf improved the t et ratio by decreasing evaporation to a minimum within a definite amount of water loss and thus increased grain yield and wue without an increase in water consumption compared with no mulch liu et al 2014a b c our study indicated that corn yield and wue increased with the increasing of planting density and then declined following quadratic function supporting by findings from similar climate condition in shanxi province zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2009 the maximum density for achieving highest yield was higher than that in highest wue suggesting a suitable density for mulched corn production should be determined by the density with highest wue value so as to develop and evaluate optimum water management strategies and ensure the most efficient use of water resources many studies have been focused on soil desiccation due to pursuing high yield of corn in dryland area dong et al 2000 especially in the fmrf which might deplete and use up soil water but a sustainability corn production with high density and high yield have been challenged li et al 2003 in north shaanxi china loess plateau significant soil water depletion in deeper 100 cm soil layers was detected at harvest time under plastic mulching compared with no mulching implying that higher yields might not be sustained in the long run zhang et al 2011 however corn yield increased 23 4 in the fmrf with the increasing planting density from 4 5 104 to 6 0 104 plant ha 1 in our 4 consecutive year s study with the increasing density of 1 5 104 plant ha 1 based on 6 0 104 plant ha 1 corn yield continently increased 13 8 again furthermore soil water content was always higher in normal year wet year and dry years in fmrf than that in fmcf in the 0 200 cm layer soil water content was above 12 and dry soil layer in deep was not found which is consistent with the findings from other study bai et al 2015 soil water storage or residues water of the 0 200 cm layer at corn harvest is 47 8 75 9 mm higher in fmrf than in fmcf from 2012 to 2015 and higher corn productivity does not lead to more soil water use total et values during the corn growing season from 2012 to 2015 was about 57 mm higher in the fmrf than in the fmcf these results are similar to those reported by liu et al 2014a b c for no substantial change in soil water storage in fully mulched ridge furrow practice under single cropping system the fmrf could sustain soil water balance if annual precipitation is higher than 273 mm in the semiarid region of china liu et al 2014a b c to be contrast with the fmrf in our study the soil water in the fmcf was lower than wilting point in dry years during corn grain filling period resulting in dry soil layer formation with 8 10 soil water content as usually rainfall concentrated in 7 9 months in dry highland of china loess plateau can infiltrate deep soil layers and soil water deficit by corn plant depletion will be replenished and stored soil water could be preserved with film fully mulched therefore the fmrf was very efficient at conserving rainwater in soil could not overuse soil water and not cause negative soil water balance and would be benefit for ensuring high and stable corn yield by ridge furrow mulching planting with increasing density but a big issue for plastic film mulching is film pollution hazards and residual plastic film detrimental effects on soil structure water and nutrient transport and crop growth which can lead to unsustainable farmland use and thereby affect the agricultural environment liu et al 2014a b c development of biodegradable mulch film will help promote effective control and management of residual mulch pollution 5 conclusion results of this study showed that the fmrf cropping is highly effective use of rain and grain yield increase due to accumulating rainwater into crop root zone and reducing evaporation and increasing the rain harvesting efficiency comparing to the fmcf the corn yield and wue in the fmrf system need to be improved further only with the planting density increase but et changed slightly the high corn yield combining with high planting density in the fmrf does not result in soil water exhausting and soil desiccation in the deeper layers therefore the fmrf as climate smart water management system can support sustainable development of dryland corn production and farmers will get high grain yield if the fmrf is authorized and popularized as the priority technology in the dryland areas of the north china and possibly in other similar region author contributions the manuscript was reviewed and approved for publication by all

11062,film fully mulched ridge furrow fmrf water harvesting film mulched conventional flat planting with one half fmcf and two thirds ftmcf has been widely adopted in northern china however it is unclear whether sustainability are an 8 year corn yield in these three systems was investigated at zhenyuan of east gansu in 2008 to 2015 and a 4 year location study with fmrf and fmcf three corn hybrids and three densities was conducted at pengyang of south ningxia from 2012 to 2015 the results indicated that fmrf with rain harvesting efficiency of 65 7 82 7 makes rainwater infiltrate deep soil and soil moisture double increase in furrow root zone the 8 year average grain yield increased by 22 7 in fmrf and 14 5 in ftmcf compared with fmcf in the 4 year field trail rainfall and its seasonal distribution highly impacted grain yield and water use efficiency wue but order of importance for grain yield and wue increases were density mulching type hybrid grain yield and wue increased by 20 0 and 3 45 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 12 0 and 2 97 kg ha 1 mm 1 from low to medium density and medium to high density et and grain yield and wue increased simultaneously from low to medium density however grain yield and wue improved but et changed slightly from medium to high soil water content of the 0 200 cm layer during growing season was always higher in fmrf than in fmcf and et did not differ fmrf kept more than 50 90 mm soil water in the 0 200 cm during grain filling period neither higher grain yield in the fmrf depleted soil water nor resulted in soil desiccation regardless of the year of precipitation on the contrary the fmrf kept much more water into soil layers at corn harvest and negative effects to soil water balance were not observed thus the package of fmrf combining with close planting and density tolerance hybrids is climate smart technique for coping with droughts and ensuring corn yield in rainfed areas keywords film mulched corn furrow ridge water harvesting

production by the year 2100 by 1 billion mg and meat production by 200 million mg stewart and lal 2018 rather than increasing the area under production an appropriate strategy stewart and lal 2018 is to improve productivity of drylands through adoption of advanced water management systems and techniques based on no till straw incorporation plastic film mulch and integrated agronomic measure management etc evapotranspiration et is highly related with is grain yield gy and the most impact determinant of gy thus conserving water in the root zone is essential to improving agronomic productivity of dryland agriculture stewart and lal 2018 northwest china is a vast semiarid in area with average annual precipitation ranging from 300 to 600 mm fan et al 2005a b about 90 of the cropland in this area receives no irrigation and crop water stress is common however the 60 of the annual precipitation occurs between july and september which does not match with the water demands of crops during their growth periods and only 40 of the precipitation can be used by crops wang et al 2004 sun et al 2016 about 60 of the total precipitation was lost by evaporation from the soil surface wang et al 1999 in addition the annual evaporation in these areas is more than 1500 mm which frequently leads to severe droughts that significantly lowers yields and wue yao and yin 1999 ren et al 2017a b c dryland agriculture production in this region is important for food safety given the current shortage of water resources and continuous increases in the population ren et al 2017a b c corn is one of the most popular grain crops in the semiarid loess plateau region of china and its output accounts for 50 of total grain production in this area however the corn productivity and yield are relatively low in these areas due to water shortages ren et al 2016 it is consent that effective methods to conserve rainwater and increasing wue could be benefit for corn production which could also be meaningful for local food security there are many studies focusing on water use in dryland especially the research about stubble cover no tillage in united states and india as well as water harvesting in israel stanhill 1986 wright and nageswara 1994 boers and ben asher 1982 in recent years there are several mulching techniques to be developed and adopted such as alternating ridges and furrows with only the ridges mulched with plastic film li et al 2016b ren et al 2016 film fully mulched ridge furrow fmrf in situ water harvesting cropping liu et al 2014a li et al 2001 li and gong 2002 gan et al 2013 and flat plots mulched with plastic film li et al 2010 plastic film mulching can greatly increase soil moisture and temperature conditions and substantially enhance crop production li et al 2004 wang 2016 zhou et al 2009 generally plastic film mulching integrated with the ridge furrow which is used for in site water harvesting has been effectively used in the world gan et al 2013 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 lamont 2005 liu et al 2009a b in northwest china comparing with conventional flat planting fmrf increased crop yields by 50 100 30 90 and 10 40 in drought average rainfall and wetter than normal years respectively gan et al 2013 for corn wheat and potato crops wue under fmrf improved 30 0 53 7 and 63 8 respectively li et al 2012 qin et al 2014 li et al 2016a b c therefore the fmrf system has emerged as an important technique that is widely used in rain fed areas a lots of experiments have studied corresponding theories and adaptabilities for the fmrf spreading in dryland areas of north china areas gan et al 2013 li et al 2013 qin et al 2014 as it is known corn yield in dryland areas is related to both soil water conditions and planting density many researches have been conducted about the relationship among corn planting density yields and wue liu et al 2010 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2009 it is presented that planting density changed the canopy structure of the corn population resulting in the change of canopy lighting environment and increasing the leaf area and transpiration of corn corn yield and wue are expressed as parabolic curve with plant density under irrigation or supplementary irrigation condition sangoi et al 2002 liu 1998 corn population increase usually resulted in soil water depletion and reduced grain yield in dryland areas but did not impact on evapotranspiration et liu 2012 to seek persistent high yield of corn in dryland leads to deep soil water over depletion and soil desiccation hu and chen 2013 dong et al 2000 there is a consensus that great challenges have been suffered from soil water over use by fmrf such as potential risks existing to annual soil water recovery li et al 2003 mo et al 2013 once it is applied improper corn is subjected to premature of aging and then reduce the yield recently the research about fmrf mainly focuses on soil temperature and soil water and corn yields zhou et al 2009 ren et al 2010 wang et al 2011 but in situ rainwater harvesting annual soil moisture dynamics and soil water budget are not well documented bai et al 2015 in this fmrf study an 8 year grain yield of dryland corn was investigated and a 4 year location trail with corn planting density and hybrids was conducted to illustrate the mechanism of sustainable water use for dryland corn yield and wue improvement 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and treatments two different field trails were taken into account in china loess plateau the sites are a typical highland plateau which is becoming a grain production belt in china loess plateau the dominate soil is a typic cryoboroll loam with 20 to 25 clay 7 8 ph plant available water capacity for the 0 200 cm soil layer of 247 mm 10 6 g kg 1 soil organic matter and soil bulk density at depths of 0 200 cm ranged from 1 25 to 1 45 g cm 3 fan et al 2005a b experiment 1 was conducted at dryland agriculture station zhenyuan qingyang city of gansu province 35 29 n 107 29 e to test corn grain yield increasing from 2008 to 2015 the latitude is 1297 m with 520 mm annual precipitation and 8 3 average temperature three different types of white plastic mulching with 0 008 mm thick were set up fmcf ck was designed to mulch half area of soil surface consisted of 60 cm film strips alternating with 60 cm bare soil strips referred as film half mulched conventional flat planting and two rows of corn were seeded on the plastic film strips in hills ftmcf was film two thirds mulched area conventional flat planting by 120 cm film strips alternating with 60 cm bare soil strips and corn sowing was the same as the fmcf planting fmrf for mulching soil surface completely on ridge furrow and corn was planted in furrow area as shown in fig 1 narrow ridges 15 cm high 40 cm wide and wide rides 10 cm high 70 cm wide gan et al 2013 zhou et al 2009 2012 after mulching holes about 20 cm apart were made using handheld device through the film in furrows to let rainwater collected from the ridges entering the soil when it was raining the plot area was 21 45 m2 6 5 m length 3 3 m width and all the treatments were repeated 3 times and the planting density was all 6 75 104 plants ha 1 in addition in 2016 we added density treatments of 4 5 104 6 0 104 6 75 104 7 5 104 9 0 104 and 10 5 104 plant ha

pengyang county of ningxia hui autonomous region 35 41 n 106 32 e from 2012 to 2015 the latitude is 1700 m with 460 mm annual precipitation and 7 4 average temperature based on the data about corn growing and precipitation in this area the four consecutive years was considered as normal year in 2012 wet year in 2013 and both dry year in 2014 and 2015 respectively table 1 in this study three factors of mulching type and hybrid cultivar and planting density were considered fmcf and fmrf as in experiment 1 were conducted combining with three hybrid cultivars such as jixiang 1 jx1 of medium density tolerance and late maturity jiudan 4 jd4 of low density tolerance and early maturity and xianyu 335 xy335 of high density tolerance and late maturity planting densities were 4 5 104 d1 6 75 104 d2 and 9 0 104 d3 plant ha 1 the study was a randomized block design with three replications and the plot area was the same as mentioned in exp 1 experiments 1 and 2 were conducted from sowing by handheld device in 15 20th of april to harvesting by hand in 25 28th of september each year about 3 weeks after seeding plants were annually thinned to one plant per hill later if tillers developed they were removed to avoid competition with the main stem before applying the plastic urea and superphosphate were broadcast applied to supply 250 kg n ha 1 and 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 all treatments completely depended on rainfall and no irrigation was added during the whole corn growth period 2 2 measurements soil water contents were determined at planting and harvest as well as in other growth stages to a depth of 200 cm in 20 cm intervals manually using diameter steel core sampling tube where each sample was replicated three times in fmrf soil was randomly sampled from narrow ridges and wide ridges and in fmcf was taken halfway between planting rows on the film mulched strips the water storage was calculated using equation ren et al 2017a b c w h p b 10 where w is the average water storage mm in the ridges and furrows under fmcf h is the soil layer depth cm p is the soil bulk density g cm 3 in a specific soil layer and b is the percentage of soil moisture by weight the total

respectively which were neglected in this study because the over 100 m groundwater table high water holding capacity and less drainage the water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 of mulched corn was calculated as the ratio of corn yield kg ha 1 to et mm in a crop growing season runoff rainwater from the film ridge furrow planting system was collected from april to june in experiment 1 by installing plastic buckets of 30 cm height with 20 cm diameter between ridge and furrow connection in the fmrf treatment the runoff harvesting area of 1 65 m2 a half area of summing 70 cm ridge and 40

samples were air dried on concrete threshed oven dried at 70 to a uniform moisture level and weighed 2 3 data analyses in exp 2 analysis of variance anvoa was done to determine main and interactive effects of treatment and year on grain yield and et and wue using proc glm sas inst 1991 there were significant interaction between treatments and years so means separation tests for 4 year corn were not conducted and the data were shown in each year s figures one way anova was therefore made for individual years and mean separation tests among mulching type and density and cultivar were conducted using the least significant difference lsd 0 05 procedure at the 0 05 probability level only when f was significant in expe 1 regression relationship between corn grain yield and wue with planting density was analyzed and estimated potential grain yield and planting density under optimal wue that in turn the reasonable planting density can be confirmed based on observed data contour map of soil water content was graphed by surfer software in order to clearly understand temporal and spatial variation characteristics of water dynamics as well as desiccation in soil profile 3 results 3 1 rain harvesting efficiency comparing with the fmcf collected rainwater in furrow planting zone in fmrf was determined by installing plastic buckets from april to june the results indicated that the rain harvesting efficiency of the fmrf in different rainfall intensity changed greatly which could attribute to dryland corn yield and wue gains and the fmrf make collected rainwater infiltrate deep soil in 1 65 m2 water catchment area of the furrow ridge system collected rainwater amount from the fmrf planting system ranged from 8 11 to 13 32 kg when a 5 10 mm rain fell equal to 80 7 92 7 in rain harvesting efficiency from 1 41 to 6 41 kg in a less 5 mm rain and from 9 43 to 18 95 kg in a 10 15 mm rain the same as 65 7 82 7 and 48 9 78 2 in rain harvesting efficiency respectively table 2 it can deduce that with 70 cm film ridge rainfall harvesting and 40 cm film furrow planting zone if the average rain harvesting efficiency of the fmrf system set at 0 74 in 5 mm rainfall and 0 89 in 10 mm rainfall potential water wp amount collected at crop root zone will be 11 5 mm and 25 5 mm respectively implying soil water value in root zone in the system more than double increases 3 2 grain yield of corn the investigated results showed that film mulching area and mulching type enhanced the spring corn grain yield in exp 1 in a 8 year average grain yields increased by 14 5 and 22 7 when the mulching area to soil surface from 1 2 in fmcf to 2 3 in ftmcf and to 100 in fmrf table 3 statistical analyses of the 4 years of corn grain yield in exp 2 showed that film mulching type and density and hybrid cultivar impacted on grain yields significantly but grain yields were still highly influenced by precipitation and its interaction with treatments represented by the high significant effect of years in the anova table 4 for each year there were significant effects on grain yields of corn due to treatments using lsd data not shown the order of importance for grain yield increase was precipitation plant density mulching type hybrid cultivar from the dry years 2015 and 2014 to the normal year 2012 and the wet year 2013 grain yield increased from 7 72 and 8 79 mg ha 1 to 11 86 mg ha 1 and 11 15 mg ha 1 respectively table 5 grain yield in normal year was 34 92 53 36 higher than that in dry year and was 6 38 higher than that in wet year related to corn lodging due to heavy storm rain in july 2013 whether the year was dry normal or wet grain yield was consistently highest in the high plant density and lowest in the low plant density fig 2 the grain yield improved by 20 62 when the density went from 4 75 104 to 6 0 104 plant ha 1 and by 12 03 from 6 0 104 to 9 0 104 plant ha 1 table 5 the average grain yield increased from 9 16 mg ha 1 in the fmcf to 10 60 mg ha 1 in the fmrf a 15 72 increase in grain yield from low close density cultivar jd4 to medium close density cultivar jx1 the yield increased by 15 46 and from medium close density cultivar to high close density cultivar xy335 the yield improved by 7 79 again these results show the importance of increasing plant density and improving density tolerance of corn varieties even in the dry years because the average yield of 11 27 mg ha 1 from the high density was about 1 35 times higher than that of 8 34 mg ha 1 from the low density 3 3 seasonal et and water use efficiency similar to grain yields the results in exp 2 showed that film mulching type and density and hybrids enhanced the wue significantly p 0 0001 table 4 the wue values increased by 17 35 with 2 25 104 plant ha 1 increase from the low to medium density and 12 73 with the same amount corn plants increase from the medium to high density but the high average wue value 28 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 was obtained in the normal year not in the wet year and the wues were almost same between the wet year of 2013 and the normal year of 2014 in the dry year of 2012 the wue value was the highest the average values were 37 05 kg ha 1 mm 1 in jx1 and 36 45 kg ha 1 mm 1 in xy335 and 33 45 kg ha 1 mm 1 in jd4 when planting density was 9 0 104 plant ha 1 fig 2 when film mulching area to soil surface from 50 in the fmcf to 100 in the fmrf wue increased by 21 09 in addition improving the hybrid density tolerance can raise the wue such as average wue ranged from 20 98 kg ha 1 mm 1 in jd4 23 78 kg ha 1 mm 1 in jx1and to 24 25 kg ha 1 mm 1 in xy335 respectively like grain yields and wues ets were also significantly influenced by precipitation and plant density and hybrids significantly p 0 0001 however not affected by film mulching type p 0 4176 suggesting grain yield and wue will be improved with almost same et amount in the fmrf and fmcf treatments the importance of treatments affecting on et ranked as precipitation hybrid density grain yield and et and wue increased simultaneously when the density changed from low to medium level grain yield and wue increased but ets did not increase with the density increasing from medium to high level table 5 the ets between jx1 and xy335 hybrids were no significant difference due to medium to high density tolerance and same growth periods et in jd4 with low density tolerance and early maturity was statistically significant with that in jx1 and xy335 with medium to high density tolerance jd4 cultivar reduced et by 18 6 23 0 mm compared to jx1 and xy335 cultivars in dryland condition et differences was far less than grain yield and wue changes caused by plant density treatments no matter how precipitation grain yield and wue increased as improvement of hybrids density tolerance interaction between hybrids and density on grain yield and wue was higher in the normal and wet years than in dry years indicating their interactions decreased with precipitation reduction 3 4 soil water changes in 4 consecutive years from april 2012 to october 2015 the results present that the fmrf always improved the soil moisture content in the 0 200 cm soil layer at corn growing period compared with the fmcf fig 3 whether the fmrf or fmcf treatment the soil moisture content was in line with seasonal rainfall when the field trial went to the year of 2014 and 2015 seasonal rainfall during corn growth period decreased significantly and total rainfall in 7 8 months was about 90 mm which roughly accounting for 50 in 2012 and 30 in 2013 compared with the same months whereas average soil moisture content of the 0 200 cm layer for the fmrf was 12 5 on 4 august and 12 37 on 20 august 2014 increased by 2 66 and 1 98 percentage points compared to the fmcf the soil moisture was 15 66 on june 30 and 13 55 on 30 august 2015 with 3 49 and 3 39 percentage points over the fmcf indicating that the fmrf stored more than 50 90 mm soil water in the 0 200 cm layer during corn grain filling periods which playing an important roles in drought resistance and yield increase when corn suffers from severe drought in summer season more importantly soil water distribution of the 0 200 soil layer changed greatly duo to corn grow depletion and rainfall infiltration in the 4 years study periods soil moisture content of the 0 200 cm layer during corn growing season was always higher in the fmrf than in the fmcf treatment fig 4 comparing with the fmcf the pro sowing soil water storage of the 0 200 cm layer in the fmrf increased by 68 7 mm in 2012 56 3 mm in 2013 77 8 mm in 2014 and 63 2 mm in 2015 respectively it is particularly noteworthy that the fmrf can increase the 0 200 cm soil moisture storage at the corn harvest by 47 8 64 5 74 6 and 58 0 mm in 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively related to the fmcf 3 5 soil desiccation during the 4 consecutive study years including one normal year 2012 and one wet year 2013 and two dry years 2014 and 2015 isoline distribution of soil gravimetrical water content graphed by surfer software present a clear contrast of soil moisture between the fmrf and the fmcf fig 5 and soil moisture showed different characteristics not only in the vertical soil profile but also in the study period as mentioned above soil moistures of the 0 200 cm profile during corn growth period were consistently greater in the fmrf than in the fmcf particularly in the fmcf soil moisture in the 0 200 cm profile decreased significantly and fell to 11 1 12 5 in the 80 120 cm layer on 10 september 2012 11 8 12 7 in the 120 140 cm layer on 5 june 2013 7 9 8 7 in the 100 140 cm layer on 10 september 2014 and 6 7 9 5 in the 40 140 cm layer on 10 september 2015 implying in the dry years a desiccated soil layer with soil moisture content less than 8 was formed and its thickness deepened and range extended as times went on however in the fmrf system high grain yield of corn did not exhaust soil water and not result in the desiccated soil layer formation thus negative effects on soil water cycle was not observed consider of the field water balance for the 4 consecutive study years overall et value of 1680 2 mm in the fmrf was 56 9 mm less than that of 1737 1 mm in the fmcf and total precipitation from 20 april 2012 to 30 september 2015 was 1920 mm precipitation use rate expressed as total et divided by total precipitation was 87 5 for the fmrf and 90 5 for the fmcf however the wue values were 25 38 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the fmrf and 20 96 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the fmcf 3 6 grain yield and wue to planting density as stated above grain yield and wue of dryland corn were affected highly by plant density we found that grain yield or wue has a quadratic relationship with the density fig 6 and maximum density for achieving the highest grain yield was 8 28 104 plant ha 1 which was 0 34 104 plant ha 1 higher than that of 7 94 104 plant ha 1 in the highest wue thus a suitable density for film mulched corn production should be determined by the density with highest wue value and not by that with maximum yield 4 discussion available soil water are very important for getting high yields in dryland area li et al 2010 zhou et al 2011 the present study highlighted that the fmrf cropping was very efficient at keeping rainwater into soil in turn increasing grain yield and wue in rainfed farming systems ramakrishna et al 2006 gan et al 2013 ren et al 2010 liu et al 2009a b evidenced by the fact that it increased soil water storage in the 0 200 cm layer and reduced soil water evaporation by mulching on ridge furrow ren et al 2010 liu et al 2009a b it was certainly because the fmrf reduced the area available for evaporation from soil surface decreased ineffective evaporations from the soil and thus obtained a higher wue than other treatments jia et al 2017 in our study with the fmrf the rain harvesting efficiency of 48 9 to 92 7 varied significantly with different rainfall intensities particularly exceeded 80 in a light rainfall and soil water storage in root zone can double increase related to rainfall amount as usually less than 5 mm rainfall is ineffective to crop production the soil moisture was significantly higher in the 0 100 cm layer under the fmrf compared with the fmcf which was mostly because of the following two reasons one is the ridge furrow system could accumulate rainfall to enhance water infiltration and retention and another is film fully mulched on ridge furrow could prevent the soil water exchange between the soil and air to decrease completely the evaporation of soil water ren et al 2017a b c but most soil moisture might have evaporated directly from the bare flat surface in fmcf or ftmcf treatment li et al 2016a our study indicated that corn grain yield increased with the increase of film mulched area in which the much soil water evaporation can be reduced by increasing the mulched area to the soil surface based on the 4 consecutive years and an 8 year field study the fmrf increased 15 2 and 22 7 of corn yield comparing with the fmcf and yield increase was firstly related to precipitation then to planting density and hybrid cultivar no significant difference of et was observed both fmrf and fmcf a similar field study also reported that difference in water loss or accumulation of rainfall in soil was not significant between non mulched and mulched treatments indicating that corn transpired a similar amount of water under no mulch and mulch during over growth season of corn liu et al 2014a b c corn yield et and wue increased with the planting density from 4 5 to 9 0 104 plant ha 1 attributing to corn leaves area and transpiration increase in high density condition liu et al 2010 but et increased slightly relatively it had small change of et in the fmrf when corn density was above 6 75 104 plant ha 1 while wue and grain yield continuously increased the same thing as in the dry years of 2014 and 2015 these results were consistent with findings of no et difference among corn densities zhang et al 2014 although increasing corn density intensify soil water extraction from deep layer and has little influence on soil water consumption in dryland corn production some studies showed that et in corn production was persistent under the certain grain yield level and specific area because et was calculated by evaporation of leaves and stems and the transpiration ratio transpiration to evapotranspiration t et could be changed by agronomic measures wang et al 2013 the fmrf improved the t et ratio by decreasing evaporation to a minimum within a definite amount of water loss and thus increased grain yield and wue without an increase in water consumption compared with no mulch liu et al 2014a b c our study indicated that corn yield and wue increased with the increasing of planting density and then declined following quadratic function supporting by findings from similar climate condition in shanxi province zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2009 the maximum density for achieving highest yield was higher than that in highest wue suggesting a suitable density for mulched corn production should be determined by the density with highest wue value so as to develop and evaluate optimum water management strategies and ensure the most efficient use of water resources many studies have been focused on soil desiccation due to pursuing high yield of corn in dryland area dong et al 2000 especially in the fmrf which might deplete and use up soil water but a sustainability corn production with high density and high yield have been challenged li et al 2003 in north shaanxi china loess plateau significant soil water depletion in deeper 100 cm soil layers was detected at harvest time under plastic mulching compared with no mulching implying that higher yields might not be sustained in the long run zhang et al 2011 however corn yield increased 23 4 in the fmrf with the increasing planting density from 4 5 104 to 6 0 104 plant ha 1 in our 4 consecutive year s study with the increasing density of 1 5 104 plant ha 1 based on 6 0 104 plant ha 1 corn yield continently increased 13 8 again furthermore soil water content was always higher in normal year wet year and dry years in fmrf than that in fmcf in the 0 200 cm layer soil water content was above 12 and dry soil layer in deep was not found which is consistent with the findings from other study bai et al 2015 soil water storage or residues water of the 0 200 cm layer at corn harvest is 47 8 75 9 mm higher in fmrf than in fmcf from 2012 to 2015 and higher corn productivity does not lead to more soil water use total et values during the corn growing season from 2012 to 2015 was about 57 mm higher in the fmrf than in the fmcf these results are similar to those reported by liu et al 2014a b c for no substantial change in soil water storage in fully mulched ridge furrow practice under single cropping system the fmrf could sustain soil water balance if annual precipitation is higher than 273 mm in the semiarid region of china liu et al 2014a b c to be contrast with the fmrf in our study the soil water in the fmcf was lower than wilting point in dry years during corn grain filling period resulting in dry soil layer formation with 8 10 soil water content as usually rainfall concentrated in 7 9 months in dry highland of china loess plateau can infiltrate deep soil layers and soil water deficit by corn plant depletion will be replenished and stored soil water could be preserved with film fully mulched therefore the fmrf was very efficient at conserving rainwater in soil could not overuse soil water and not cause negative soil water balance and would be benefit for ensuring high and stable corn yield by ridge furrow mulching planting with increasing density but a big issue for plastic film mulching is film pollution hazards and residual plastic film detrimental effects on soil structure water and nutrient transport and crop growth which can lead to unsustainable farmland use and thereby affect the agricultural environment liu et al 2014a b c development of biodegradable mulch film will help promote effective control and management of residual mulch pollution 5 conclusion results of this study showed that the fmrf cropping is highly effective use of rain and grain yield increase due to accumulating rainwater into crop root zone and reducing evaporation and increasing the rain harvesting efficiency comparing to the fmcf the corn yield and wue in the fmrf system need to be improved further only with the planting density increase but et changed slightly the high corn yield combining with high planting density in the fmrf does not result in soil water exhausting and soil desiccation in the deeper layers therefore the fmrf as climate smart water management system can support sustainable development of dryland corn production and farmers will get high grain yield if the fmrf is authorized and popularized as the priority technology in the dryland areas of the north china and possibly in other similar region author contributions the manuscript was reviewed and approved for publication by all

nutrient concentrations nutritional yield and nutritional water productivity the objectives of the study were to i evaluate the effect of vine harvesting on the selected plant parameters and ii assess the effect of irrigation regimes and soil fertilisation on these selected parameters field experiments were conducted at arc vop pretoria south africa during the 2013 14 and 2014 15 seasons treatments included irrigation regimes well watered w1 and supplemental irrigation w2 soil fertilisation well fertilised f1 and no fertiliser application f2 and vine harvesting no vine harvesting h1 and vine

not affect total dry storage root yield and dry marketable storage root yield storage root production our results further revealed that vine harvesting reduced storage root nutrient concentrations 23 for iron 14 for zinc 12 for β carotene nevertheless total nutritional yields increased the highest total nutritional yields for iron zinc and β carotene were found under the water and nutrient input regime w1f1 assessments showed that boiled orange fleshed sweet potato aboveground edible biomass could potentially contribute to the daily recommended nutritional requirement of iron and vitamin a for a family of six people more water was needed to meet the daily recommended nutrient intake iron zinc and vitamin a with ofsp grown as a storage root crop only than when grown as a dual purpose crop our results indicated that there is an opportunity to utilise ofsp as a dual purpose crop for rural resource poor households because total nutritional yields iron zinc and β carotene and total nutritional water productivities iron zinc and β carotene were improved more research is needed to assess the effect of vine harvesting on a range of ofsp varieties and should be conducted on the farm rural resource poor households are encouraged to produce ofsp for their own consumption and the surplus could be sold at the local market keywords micronutrient deficiency nutritional water productivity vitamin a green leafy vegetable water stress 1 introduction in sub saharan africa micronutrient deficiencies known as hidden hunger are a major problem affecting rural resource poor households rrphs the most common deficiencies in some sub saharan africa countries are iron zinc and vitamin a harika et al 2017 harika et al 2017 assessed the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in ethiopia kenya nigeria and south africa their findings revealed that the prevalence of iron deficiency stands at 28 in south africa moreover in south africa vitamin a deficiency is more prevalent 22 than in ethiopia 4 or nigeria 4 this highlights that nutritional food insecurity is pervasive in rural areas of south africa several approaches are being followed in combating micronutrient deficiencies these include supplementation through the distribution of capsules that are rich in micronutrients fortification of staple foods with micronutrients and through changing diets to achieve adequate intake of micronutrient rich foods mitra 2012 in south africa food based approaches are preferred because 34 of rural resource poor households rely on agriculture therefore this is the main vehicle to address nutritional food insecurity nyathi et al 2018b through plant breeding several orange fleshed sweet potato varieties a 15 beauregard bophelo excel jewel resisto and w 119 were developed these varieties are rich in β carotene which the body converts into vitamin a in addition orange fleshed sweet potato varieties contain significant quantities of iron and zinc laurie et al 2012a b 2015 2018 previous studies claessens et al 2008 larbi et al 2007 megersa et al 2012 mussoline and wilkie 2017 evaluated the potential of using sweet potato as a dual purpose crop i e harvesting the aboveground biomass as fodder for livestock feed and harvesting the storage root for human consumption sweet potato is not a staple crop in south africa its estimated overall

micronutrient deficiencies schönfeldt et al 2017 the leaves can be used as a green leafy vegetable during the summer season and could potentially alleviate food shortages sun et al 2014 in the northern parts of south africa and other frost free areas sweet potato can be cultivated throughout the year we presume that if rural resource poor households were to utilize sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop green leafy vegetable and storage root for human consumption in south africa the consumption rate per person per year might increase boiling roasting or baking laurie et al 2018 are some of the methods used to prepare sweet potato for consumption studies by gomes and carr 2001 2003a b and van an et al 2003 showed that increasing the frequency of vine harvesting improved leaf yield but total storage root yield decreased several studies gomes and carr 2001 2003a laurie et al 2012a motsa et al 2015 reported that sweet potato is a drought tolerant crop however water stress reduces canopy growth which causes a reduction in light interception and thus in storage root yield laurie et al 2012a showed that a well watered treatment resulted in a two to four fold increase in total storage root yield compared with a water stressed treatment however the well watered treatment showed a lower β carotene concentration than the water stressed treatment applying fertiliser at 50 of the recommended rate increased total storage root yield two fold whereas fertiliser application at 100 of the recommended rate increased storage root yield three fold relative to no fertiliser application in addition fertiliser application improved the β carotene concentration of the storage root from 134 μg g 1 for the unfertilised treatment to 151 μg g 1 for the treatment receiving fertiliser laurie et al 2012a b this shows that irrigation and fertiliser application are essential for improving orange fleshed sweet potato storage root yield and β carotene concentration studies by laurie et al 2012a b evaluated the effect of water regimes and soil fertility in different environments roodeplaat giyani hazyview and empangeni on water productivity nutrient concentrations iron zinc

first to assess the potential use of orange fleshed sweet potato var bophelo as a dual purpose food crop green leafy vegetable and as a storage root for human consumption in south africa the objectives of the study were 1 to evaluate the effect of vine harvest on selected plant parameters total storage root yield marketable storage root yield nutrient concentrations iron zinc and β

random effects block plot on the vines harvested during growing seasons 4 8 12 and 16 weeks after planting and nutrient concentrations iron zinc β carotene of the ageb checks for normality and homogeneity of variance were carried out using shapiro wilk s and bartlett s tests respectively post hoc mean separation was done using fischer s least significance difference test at a 5 significance

15 season total rainfall was 554 mm the total irrigation amount was 495 mm w1 and 210 mm w2 in the 2013 14 season during the 2014 15 season total irrigation amount was 338 mm w1 and 218 mm w2 fig 1 a the similarity in irrigation of w2 treatments for both seasons resulted from the difference in the duration of the growing period during season 1 orange fleshed sweet potato storage root was harvested 130 days after planting and for season 2 storage root was harvested 180 days after planting 3 2 total storage root yield marketable storage root yield and aboveground edible biomass the four way and three way interactions between irrigation regime soil fertilisation vine harvesting and season were not significant p 0 05 however there was a significant p 0 05 interaction between irrigation regime and season for total storage root yield and marketable storage root yield fig 1b e for the 2013 14 season irrigation regimes did not affect p 0 05 both storage root yields in contrast the 2014 15 results revealed that the well watered regime significantly p 0 05 increased both storage root yield over the supplemental regime for total storage root yield it was higher by 42 whereas for marketable storage root yield it was higher by 44 correspondingly the soil fertilisation by vine harvesting interaction significantly p 0 05 affected total storage root yield and marketable storage root yield fig 1c f without vine harvesting applying fertiliser increased total storage root yield 33 and marketable storage root yield 41 compared to the control no fertiliser application interestingly with vine harvesting soil fertilisation had no effect p 0 05 on total storage root yield and marketable storage root yield with no fertiliser applied both storage root yields were comparable whether vines were harvested or not there was a significant p 0 04 interaction effect between season and soil fertilisation for marketable storage root yield fig 1d in the 2013 14 season soil fertilisation did not affect p 0 05 marketable storage root yield on the contrary the well fertilised treatment improved marketable storage root yield by 44 compared to the control in the 2014 15 season there were no significant effects p 0 05 of irrigation regimes and soil fertilisation for the aboveground edible biomass harvested during the growing seasons yet our results revealed that between 0 9 1 1 t dm dry matter ha 1 2013 14 season and between 1 2 1 5 t dm ha 1 2014 15 season were harvested table a1 3 3 micronutrients β carotene nutritional yield and potential contribution to human nutrition there were no significant p 0 05 interactions for main effects on moisture content this implies that moisture did not compromise differences in mass concentrations reported here and established on a fresh mass basis for the aboveground edible biomass moisture content ranged from 0 78 to 0 80 and for the storage root moisture content ranged from 0 74 to 0 81 fig a1 similarly irrigation regime soil fertilisation and the season had no effect p 0 05 on iron zinc and β carotene mass concentrations in the aboveground edible biomass and storage roots the aboveground edible biomass was superior in micronutrient concentrations grand means 50 mg fe 100 g 1 2 8 mg zn 100g 1 compared to the storage root grand means 4 6 mg fe 100 g 1 1 2 mg zn 100 g 1 however the storage root was rich in β carotene with mean values ranging from 173 to 229 mg β carotene 100 g 1 table 4 in addition the mean results 2013 14 and 2014 15 for micronutrient and β carotene mass concentrations illustrated that without vine harvesting low input management supplemental irrigation regime and no fertiliser application treatments improved storage root concentrations by 79 for iron and 22 for β carotene whereas for zinc it remained the same in comparison to the highest input regime well watered and well fertilised treatments in contrast vine harvesting reduced storage root concentrations by 20 for iron and 2 for zinc whereas for β carotene concentration it was improved by 9 compared to the highest input regime for both seasons 2013 14 and 2014 15 there was no significant p 0 05 interaction effect between soil fertilisation and vine harvesting for iron nutritional yields storage root and total biomass storage root plus the aboveground edible biomass table 5 however the main effects vine harvesting and season were highly significant p 0 001 for total iron nutritional yield our results displayed that vine harvesting 0 73 kg fe ha 1 improved total iron nutritional yield compared to no vine harvesting 0 39 kg fe ha 1 for the 2014 15 season total iron nutritional yield 0 72 kg fe ha 1 was higher than for the 2013 14 season 0 41 kg fe ha 1 zinc nutritional yields storage root and total biomass and β carotene nutritional yields storage root and total biomass were affected p 0 05 by the interaction of soil fertilisation and vine harvesting table 5 our results illustrated that vine harvesting reduced zinc and β carotene nutritional yields for the storage root relative to no vine harvesting generally the reductions were larger under the well fertilised treatment zinc 43 β carotene 43 compared to the control zinc 11 β carotene 19 similarly vine harvesting reduced total nutritional yields storage root plus aboveground edible biomass for zinc and β carotene under the well fertilised treatment without fertiliser vine harvesting improved total β carotene nutritional yield for the same season 2013 14 there was a significant p 0 05 interaction between irrigation regime and soil fertilisation for β carotene nutritional yields mean values ranged from 11 to 18 kg β carotene ha 1 table 5 under well watered conditions total β carotene nutritional yield declined from 18 to 11 kg β carotene ha 1 when fertiliser was withheld whereas under the supplemental irrigation regime soil fertility had no effect on total β carotene nutritional yield during the 2014 15 season only zinc nutritional yields storage root and total biomass were affected p 0 05 by the interaction of soil fertilisation and vine harvesting table 5 however the main effects irrigation regime fertilisation and vine harvesting were significant p 0 05 for β carotene nutritional yields storage root and total biomass the well watered regime improved both β carotene nutritional yields storage root 25 3 kg ha 1 total biomass 25 5 kg ha 1 compared to the supplemental irrigation regime storage root 18 6 kg ha 1 total biomass 18 9 kg ha 1 correspondingly applying fertiliser enhanced both β carotene nutritional yields storage roots 24 4 kg ha 1 total biomass 24 7 kg ha 1 compared to no fertiliser application storage roots 19 5 kg ha 1 total biomass 19 7 kg ha 1 our results further revealed that vine harvesting reduced storage root β carotene nutritional yield from 28 1 to 15 8 kg ha 1 and total biomass β carotene nutritional yield from 28 1 to 16 3 kg ha 1 zinc nutritional yields storage root and total biomass were affected p 0 05 by the interaction between soil fertilisation and vine harvesting mean values ranged from 0 09 to 0 17 kg ha 1 for the storage root and 0 11 to 0 17 kg ha 1 for the total biomass the 2014 15 results for the effects of soil fertilisation and vine harvesting were similar to the 2013 14 results firstly vine harvesting reduced zinc nutritional yields storage roots and total biomass relative to no vine harvesting secondly reductions were larger under well fertilised conditions in the 2014 15 season iron nutritional yield for the storage root and iron nutritional yield for total biomass were not affected p 0 05 by the irrigation regime table 5 in contrast zinc nutritional yield and β carotene nutritional yield were affected p 0 05 by irrigation regime the well watered regime increased zinc nutritional yields storage roots 43 total biomass 38 and β carotene nutritional yields 26 for storage roots and total biomass compared to the supplemental irrigation regime fig a2 presents mean values of the amount of boiled orange fleshed sweet potato var bophelo aboveground edible biomass harvested during the growing season to meet iron zinc and vitamin a daily recommended nutrient intakes assessments showed that orange fleshed sweet potato aboveground edible biomass could potentially contribute to the daily recommended nutrient intake for iron and vitamin a whereas it cannot meet the daily recommended nutrient intake for zinc this is mainly because of the large amounts of orange fleshed sweet potato that are needed to be consumed for example under the highest input regime well watered and well fertilised treatments a family of six people would need to consume 2465 g per day 411 g per day for an individual to meet iron nutritional requirements and 616 g per day 103 g per day for an individual to meet vitamin a requirements for zinc nutritional requirements a family of six would need to consume an impossible 22096 g per day 3682 g per day for an individual of boiled orange fleshed aboveground edible biomass it was interesting to realise that under the low input regime water stressed and no fertiliser application growing conditions daily iron and vitamin a nutritional requirements for a family of six people could still be met 2694 g per day for iron 449 g per day for an individual and 642 g per day for vitamin a 107 g per day for an individual 3 4 evapotranspiration water productivity and nutritional water productivity for the 2013 14 and 2014 15 seasons there was no significant interaction p 0 05 between irrigation regime soil fertilisation and vine harvesting for actual evapotranspiration eta fig 2 however eta values for different treatment combinations box 1 ranged from 427 to 491 mm for the well watered treatment 2013 14 season and from 592 to 658 mm for the 2014 15 season table a1 for the supplemental regime eta of different treatment combinations ranged from 219 to 257 mm 2013 14 season and from 439 to 467 mm for the 2014 15 season there was no significant effect p 0 05 on water productivity of the treatments irrigation regime fertilisation and vine harvesting during both seasons table a1 for the 2013 14 season two main effects irrigation regime and soil fertilisation were significant p 0 05 for water productivity our results showed that supplemental irrigation 35 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 improved water productivity compared to the well watered regime 22 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 correspondingly the well fertilised treatment 31 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 had superior water productivity compared to the control 26 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 for the 2014 15 season all main effects irrigation regime soil fertilisation and vine harvesting were significant p 0 05 for water productivity the results of the study illustrated that water productivity values were similar regardless of the main effect w1 25 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 and w2 21 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 f1 25 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 and f2 21 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 and h1 25 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 and h2 21 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 however water productivity for irrigation regime displayed contradicting results compared to the 2013 14 season the well watered regime indicated water productivity superior to that of the supplemental regime in addition our results displayed that vine harvesting reduced water productivity table 6 presents iron zinc and β carotene nutritional water productivities for both storage root and total biomass storage root plus the aboveground edible biomass 2013 14 and 2014 15 seasons irrigation regime did not affect p 0 05 iron nutritional water productivities storage root and total biomass however zinc and β carotene nutritional water productivities were affected p 0 05 by irrigation regime 2013 14 season our results showed that the supplemental irrigation regime improved storage root nutritional water productivity 50 for zinc and 56 for β carotene and total biomass nutritional water productivity 52 for zinc and 56 for β carotene relative to the well watered regime vine harvesting affected p 0 05 iron and β carotene nutritional water productivities for the storage root and total biomass except for zinc total biomass nutritional water productivity p 0 383 generally vine harvesting reduced nutritional water productivity for both storage root and total biomass except for the huge increase shown by total biomass iron nutritional water productivity 60 compared to no vine harvesting 2013 14 season in the 2014 15 season water regimes affected only zinc nutritional water productivity for the storage root p 0 045 significantly there was no effect p 0 05 for other storage root nutritional water productivities iron and β carotene and total biomass nutritional water productivities iron zinc and β carotene our results showed that storage root zinc nutritional water productivity decreased under the supplemental irrigation regime relative to the well watered regime iron nutritional water productivities storage root and total biomass were not affected p 0 05 by vine harvesting whereas zinc and β carotene nutritional water productivity were affected p 0 05 by vine harvesting the results of this study showed that the vine harvesting treatment reduced both nutritional water productivities for zinc storage roots 63 and total biomass 18 and β carotene storage roots 72 and total biomass 66 relative to the no vine harvesting treatment 4 discussion this study evaluated the potential of utilising orange fleshed sweet potato var bophelo as a dual purpose food crop producing a green leafy vegetable and storage roots for human consumption the well watered orange fleshed sweet potato produced the highest storage root yields total storage root and marketable storage root for both seasons however the 2014 15 season gave a larger storage root yield than the 2013 14 season fig 1b and e this resulted because firstly the 2014 15 season received more and better distributed rain compared to the 2013 14 season fig 1a secondly in the 2013 14 season storage roots were harvested 130 days after planting whereas in 2014 15 the growing season was almost two months longer with harvest 180 days after planting therefore more solar radiation was intercepted during the 2014 15 season than during the 2013 14 season resulting in higher productivity we made a calculation of orange fleshed sweet potato productivity per day for the well managed treatment well watered full fertilisation and no vine harvesting based on the assumption that storage root formation starts at 52 days after planting our findings indicated that orange fleshed sweet potato productivity per day was the same for both seasons at 132 kg dm ha 1 day 1 in 2013 14 and 133 kg dm ha 1 day 1 in 2014 15 during the 2013 14 season storage root yields for the well watered and the supplemental irrigation treatments were similar fig 1b and e perhaps the length 130 days of the growing season caused the similarity in that the duration of water stress was shorter during the 2013 14 season than for the 2014 15 season where there was a clear difference in storage root yield between the two water treatments fig 1b and e vine harvesting reduced storage root yields total storage root and marketable storage root as found in studies by gomes and carr 2001 a and van an et al 2003 this authenticates our hypothesis that vine harvesting of orange fleshed sweet potato reduces storage root yield the 2014 15 results of this study showed that under low input management supplemental rather than full irrigation and no fertiliser application storage root production total storage root and marketable storage root was reduced fig 1b f in addition our results highlighted that when considering orange fleshed sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop trade off considerations have to be made for example utilising orange fleshed sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop is not an ideal practice for market oriented farming the loss of marketable storage root was 50 under well fertilised conditions fig 1f for subsistence oriented farming rural resource poor households using orange fleshed sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop makes more sense as the aboveground edible biomass is available for consumption during the growing season table a1 at the end of the growing season storage roots can then be consumed however the consequence of vine harvesting is a reduction in the total storage root yield fig 1c our results indicated that without fertiliser application total storage root productivity declined from 7 8 to 6 7 t dm ha 1 whereas under full fertilisation the penalty of vine harvesting was higher total storage root yield dropped from 11 6 to 7 1 t dm ha 1 this implies that for subsistence oriented farming soil fertilisation combined with vine harvesting is not an ideal practice because the reduction in total storage root yield is huge the grand mean results of this study further displayed that the vine harvesting treatment reduced iron zinc and β carotene concentrations of the storage root table 4 in line with our hypothesis this has implications for nutritional food security of rural resource poor households the loss in nutrients of harvested storage root caused by vine harvesting was compensated by the availability of highly nutritious green aboveground edible biomass which rural resource poor households can consume as a relish with maize porridge mavengahama et al 2013 in the winter season the storage root becomes available for consumption this spreads food availability over a longer period thereby improving the nutritional food security of rural resource poor households we expected that vine harvesting of orange fleshed sweet potato would reduce storage root nutritional yield our results concurred with our hypothesis however vine harvesting improved total nutritional yields of iron and zinc whereas there was a minimal increase for total β carotene nutritional yield table 5 this is mainly because the aboveground edible biomass of orange fleshed sweet potato contributed the least amount of β carotene to the total nutritional yield irrigation and fertiliser application are considered important inputs that determine nutritional yields of iron zinc and β carotene laurie et al 2012a the results of this study agreed with our expectations that high inputs well fertilised and well watered treatments improve the nutritional yield of selected nutrients this agrees with laurie et al 2012a findings which showed that optimum management is the best for an improved nutritional yield of the storage root table 5 however the consequence of vine harvesting combined with no fertiliser application is a reduction in total nutrients that can be harvested it was reduced by 42 for iron 45 for zinc and 52 for β carotene relative to no vine harvesting and fertiliser application similarly vine harvesting combined with supplemental irrigation resulted in the reduction of nutrients by 47 for iron 38 for zinc and 39 for β carotene relative to no vine harvesting and full irrigation laurie et al 2012a showed that planting one hectare of sweet potato by community members is feasible for boiled orange fleshed sweet potato total storage root assessments showed that the number of people one could feed for a period of 90 days from one hectare for the requirements of iron and zinc is very low under high input iron 7 people and zinc 4 people and low input iron 7 people and zinc 2 people optimization table a2 practically this suggests that people would need to consume huge amounts of boiled orange fleshed sweet potato storage root to meet their daily iron and zinc dietary requirements therefore the storage root cannot be recommended as a food source for iron and zinc however for β carotene one hectare of orange fleshed sweet potato storage root could potentially supply 1570 262 households people with the required amount of vitamin a for a period of 90 days under high input regime the number of households that can be fed for vitamin a requirement were reduced by three fold under the low input regime table a2 our results showed that treatments irrigation regime soil fertilisation and vine harvesting did not affect β carotene potential contribution to the daily recommended nutrient intake for all age groups under the low input management storage roots could still provide more than the daily recommended nutrient requirements by 6 fold table a3 a study conducted by nyathi et al 2018b indicated that boiled aboveground edible biomass of amaranth amaranthus cruentus and spider flower cleome gynandra could potentially meet human nutritional requirements for iron and zinc to consume a balanced diet that can alleviate micronutrients deficiency iron zinc and vitamin a we recommend that rural resource poor households should prepare a side dish made up of orange fleshed sweet potato plant tissues storage root and the aboveground biomass combined with amaranth and spider flower the main aim of the water productivity concept is to produce more crop with limited water use actual evapotranspiration nyathi et al 2018b our results 2013 14 concurred with other studies chimonyo et al 2016 laurie et al 2012a mabhaudhi et al 2013 motsa et al 2015 nyathi et al 2018b that showed superior water productivity for sorghum sorghum bicolor taro colocasia esculenta sweet potato ipomoea batatas and selected leafy vegetables amaranth amaranthus cruentus spider flower cleome gynandra and swiss chard beta vulguris under water stress and well fertilised conditions the results of this study further revealed that there was a variation in water productivity between seasons the 2014 15 results indicated lower water productivity compared to the 2013 14 season table a4 in addition water productivity results for the 2014 15 season exhibited contrary results compared with the 2013 14 season the well watered regime and soil fertilisation improved water productivity we expected consistency in terms of the effect of water stress and soil fertilisation on water productivity for both seasons the difference in water productivity for both seasons might have been caused by different meteorological conditions temperature rain radiation and vapour pressure deficit table 2 and the length of the growing season steduto et al 2007 chibarabada et al 2017 averred that water use in agriculture crop production and nutritional requirements are assessed in isolation this procedure is not ideal because of the three aspects interlink several studies chibarabada et al 2017 mdemu et al 2009 nyathi et al 2018b renault and wallender 2000 have assessed nutritional water productivity nwp an index that combines aspects of water use crop production and human nutrition of selected crops cowpea vigna unguiculata bambara groundnut vigna subterranea dry bean phaseolus vulgaris groundnut arachis hypogaea tomato solanum lycopersicum rice oryza sativa onion allium cepa amaranth amaranthus cruentus spider flower cleome gynandra swiss chard beta vulgaris var fordhook giant as far as can be ascertained our study is the first attempt to assess iron zinc and β carotene nutritional water productivities of orange fleshed sweet potato var bophelo storage root and total edible biomass storage root plus the aboveground edible biomass using datasets storage root yield aboveground edible biomass evapotranspiration and nutrient concentrations iron zinc and β carotene from the same experiment therefore this study serves as a benchmark the mean for both seasons 2013 14 and 2014 15 displayed superior nutritional water productivities storage root and total biomass under the supplemental irrigation regime table 6 interestingly total nutritional water productivity was higher than the storage root nutritional water productivity in addition the mean for both seasons displayed that nutritional water productivity iron zinc and β carotene for the storage root and total edible biomass declined under the practice of vine harvesting table 6 this highlights that some compromises have to be made when considering orange fleshed sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop quite surprisingly utilising orange fleshed sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop can be recommended because selected micronutrients and β carotene nutritional productivities were maximised per unit water used our results illustrated that considering orange fleshed sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop required less water to meet total human nutrition requirements iron 942 litres person 1 day 1 zinc 3915 litres person 1 day 1 β carotene 12 litres person 1 day 1 under low input management fig a3b and c in contrast considering orange fleshed sweet potato as a storage root only fig a3a and c required more water to meet total human nutrition requirements iron 3561 litres person 1 day 1 zinc 6091 litres person 1 day 1 and β carotene 13 litres person 1 day 1 limited information exists on nutritional water productivity of crops a study by nyathi et al 2018b reported nutritional water productivity values for selected leafy vegetables ranging from 226 to 1323 mg m 3 for iron 60 to 160 mg m 3 for zinc and 365 to 1886 mg m 3 for β carotene at a glance this suggests that selected leafy vegetables are more productive than orange fleshed sweet potato storage root in terms of iron and zinc nutritional water productivities however caution has to be exercised when comparing leafy vegetables and orange fleshed sweet potato storage root the duration of the growing season differs sweet potato maximum growing period is 180 days whereas for leafy vegetables it is 100 days therefore orange fleshed sweet potato utilises more water 219 658 mm than leafy vegetables 147 457 mm to produce selected micronutrients this highlights the importance of crop diversification in meeting human nutrition requirements with less water consumed for example leafy vegetables are superior in iron and zinc per unit of water used whereas orange fleshed sweet potato is rich in β carotene per unit of water used a diet consisting of leafy vegetables and orange fleshed sweet potato leaves and storage root will reduce the amount of water used to produce iron zinc and β carotene 5 conclusions this study showed that there is an opportunity of utilising orange fleshed sweet potato var bophelo as a dual purpose food crop green leafy vegetable and staple storage root for human consumption our results showed that the dual use of orange fleshed sweet potato is not ideal for market oriented farming because marketable storage root yield decreased by half in contrast the dual use of orange fleshed sweet potato can be considered for less market oriented rural resource poor households the leaves could provide fresh greens for home consumption or for sale in addition to the storage root this spreads food availability over a longer period hence an improvement in the nutritional food security of rural resource poor households however the consequence of the dual use of orange fleshed sweet potato is the reduction in total storage root yield whose effect depends on soil fertilisation no fertiliser application 7 8 to 6 7 t dm ha 1 and n p and k fertiliser application at a recommended rate 11 6 7 1 t dm ha 1 with vine harvesting total storage root yield was reduced and total nutritional yield iron zinc and β carotene was improved the mean results for both seasons showed higher iron nutritional yield 0 94 kg dm ha 1 under the practice of vine harvesting combined with no fertiliser application the highest zinc 0 16 kg dm ha 1 and β carotene 26 kg dm ha 1 nutritional yields were obtained under the practice of no vine harvesting combined with the well fertilised treatment assessments showed that orange fleshed sweet potato storage root cannot be recommended for iron and zinc dietary requirements because of the huge amounts that need to be consumed however the storage root can meet vitamin a human nutritional requirements for all age groups even under the low input regime water stressed and no fertiliser application conditions it was interesting to note that more water was needed to meet the daily recommended nutrient intake iron zinc and β carotene if orange fleshed sweet potato was grown for its storage root than when it was grown as a dual purpose food crop this highlights that nutritional water productivities of rural resource poor households can be maximised these results have to be taken into consideration when making decisions about the nutritional food security of rural resource poor households future research is needed to confirm these findings across a large set of orange fleshed sweet potato varieties that might respond differently to vine harvesting for selected plant parameters storage root yield evapotranspiration water productivity nutrient concentration nutritional yield and nutritional water productivity this research should be conducted on the farm so that suitable varieties are selected for the dual use of orange fleshed sweet potato rural resource poor households are encouraged to produce orange fleshed sweet potato for their own consumption and any surplus could be sold at the local market we recommend that crop growth models such as aquacrop the soil water balance swb model the agricultural production system simulator apsim and the world food studies wofost model should be calibrated and validated using field experimental data for the aboveground biomass storage root yield

11063,orange fleshed sweet potato ofsp leaves can be utilised as a fresh green leafy vegetable in addition to the traditional use of storage root therefore ofsp can be seen as a dual purpose crop we hypothesized that no vine harvesting combined with fertiliser application and irrigation will improve the storage root yield and selected plant parameters water productivity leaf and storage root nutrient concentrations nutritional yield and nutritional water productivity the objectives of the study were to i evaluate the effect of vine harvesting on the selected plant parameters and ii assess the effect of irrigation regimes and soil fertilisation on these selected parameters field experiments were conducted at arc vop pretoria south africa during the 2013 14 and 2014 15 seasons treatments included irrigation regimes well watered w1 and supplemental irrigation w2 soil fertilisation well fertilised f1 and no fertiliser application f2 and vine harvesting no vine harvesting h1 and vine harvesting h2 for the 2014 15 season the well watered regime improved total storage root yield w1 13 0 t dm ha 1 w2 7 5 t dm ha 1 under the practice of vine harvesting soil fertility treatments did not affect total dry storage root yield and dry marketable storage root yield storage root production our results further revealed that vine harvesting reduced storage root nutrient concentrations 23 for iron 14 for zinc 12 for β carotene nevertheless total nutritional yields increased the highest total nutritional yields for iron zinc and β carotene were found under the water and nutrient input regime w1f1 assessments showed that boiled orange fleshed sweet potato aboveground edible biomass could potentially contribute to the daily recommended nutritional requirement of iron and vitamin a for a family of six people more water was needed to meet the daily recommended nutrient intake iron zinc and vitamin a with ofsp grown as a storage root crop only than when grown as a dual purpose crop our results indicated that there is an opportunity to utilise ofsp as a dual purpose crop for rural resource poor households because total nutritional yields iron zinc and β carotene and total nutritional water productivities iron zinc and β carotene were improved more research is needed to assess the effect of vine harvesting on a range of ofsp varieties and should be conducted on the farm rural resource poor households are encouraged to produce ofsp for their own consumption and the surplus could be sold at the local market keywords micronutrient deficiency nutritional water productivity vitamin a green leafy vegetable water stress 1 introduction in sub saharan africa micronutrient deficiencies known as hidden hunger are a major problem affecting rural resource poor households rrphs the most common deficiencies in some sub saharan africa countries are iron zinc and vitamin a harika et al 2017 harika et al 2017 assessed the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in ethiopia kenya nigeria and south africa their findings revealed that the prevalence of iron deficiency stands at 28 in south africa moreover in south africa vitamin a deficiency is more prevalent 22 than in ethiopia 4 or nigeria 4 this highlights that nutritional food insecurity is pervasive in rural areas of south africa several approaches are being followed in combating micronutrient deficiencies these include supplementation through the distribution of capsules that are rich in micronutrients fortification of staple foods with micronutrients and through changing diets to achieve adequate intake of micronutrient rich foods mitra 2012 in south africa food based approaches are preferred because 34 of rural resource poor households rely on agriculture therefore this is the main vehicle to address nutritional food insecurity nyathi et al 2018b through plant breeding several orange fleshed sweet potato varieties a 15 beauregard bophelo excel jewel resisto and w 119 were developed these varieties are rich in β carotene which the body converts into vitamin a in addition orange fleshed sweet potato varieties contain significant quantities of iron and zinc laurie et al 2012a b 2015 2018 previous studies claessens et al 2008 larbi et al 2007 megersa et al 2012 mussoline and wilkie 2017 evaluated the potential of using sweet potato as a dual purpose crop i e harvesting the aboveground biomass as fodder for livestock feed and harvesting the storage root for human consumption sweet potato is not a staple crop in south africa its estimated overall consumption is 1 1 kg fresh mass per person per year laurie et al 2018 the practice of using sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop is not common in south africa despite the high levels of micronutrient deficiencies schönfeldt et al 2017 the leaves can be used as a green leafy vegetable during the summer season and could potentially alleviate food shortages sun et al 2014 in the northern parts of south africa and other frost free areas sweet potato can be cultivated throughout the year we presume that if rural resource poor households were to utilize sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop green leafy vegetable and storage root for human consumption in south africa the consumption rate per person per year might increase boiling roasting or baking laurie et al 2018 are some of the methods used to prepare sweet potato for consumption studies by gomes and carr 2001 2003a b and van an et al 2003 showed that increasing the frequency of vine harvesting improved leaf yield but total storage root yield decreased several studies gomes and carr 2001 2003a laurie et al 2012a motsa et al 2015 reported that sweet potato is a drought tolerant crop however water stress reduces canopy growth which causes a reduction in light interception and thus in storage root yield laurie et al 2012a showed that a well watered treatment resulted in a two to four fold increase in total storage root yield compared with a water stressed treatment however the well watered treatment showed a lower β carotene concentration than the water stressed treatment applying fertiliser at 50 of the recommended rate increased total storage root yield two fold whereas fertiliser application at 100 of the recommended rate increased storage root yield three fold relative to no fertiliser application in addition fertiliser application improved the β carotene concentration of the storage root from 134 μg g 1 for the unfertilised treatment to 151 μg g 1 for the treatment receiving fertiliser laurie et al 2012a b this shows that irrigation and fertiliser application are essential for improving orange fleshed sweet potato storage root yield and β carotene concentration studies by laurie et al 2012a b evaluated the effect of water regimes and soil fertility in different environments roodeplaat giyani hazyview and empangeni on water productivity nutrient concentrations iron zinc and β carotene nutritional yield of different sweet potato varieties however the effect of vine harvesting on these crop parameters was not considered to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to assess the potential use of orange fleshed sweet potato var bophelo as a dual purpose food crop green leafy vegetable and as a storage root for human consumption in south africa the objectives of the study were 1 to evaluate the effect of vine harvest on selected plant parameters total storage root yield marketable storage root yield nutrient concentrations iron zinc and β carotene nutritional yield water productivity and nutritional water productivity and 2 to assess the effect of irrigation regimes and soil fertilisation on these selected plant parameters we selected orange fleshed sweet potato var bophelo because it is popular in the informal markets of south africa it is highly productive and has acceptable levels of β carotene 6708 μg 100 g 1 on a fresh mass basis laurie et al 2018 we imposed two irrigation regimes two soil fertilisation levels and two vine harvest treatments our hypotheses were that 1 vine harvesting of orange fleshed sweet potato will reduce storage root yield and the other selected plant parameters water productivity nutrient concentration nutritional yield and nutritional water productivity 2 no vine harvesting combined with fertiliser application and irrigation will improve storage root yield and the selected plant parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description experimental setup environmental conditions and

roots from the nodes the newest five well developed leaves were plucked at 4 8 12 and 16 weeks after planting in the vine harvesting treatments 2 3 sampling procedure plant parameters and potential contribution to human nutrition orange fleshed sweet potato aboveground edible biomass ageb were separated into leaf blades and petioles leaf blades were sampled 500 g at 4 and 12 weeks after planting and thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove debris thereafter samples were put in transparent airtight plastic polythene bags and immediately sent to nvirotek laboratories to be analysed for iron and zinc mass concentrations at the end of the growing seasons 2013 14 and 2014 15 total storage root yield small mechanically damaged long curved sprouts groves cracked marketable and marketable storage root yield were measured fresh and oven dried three marketable medium sized storage roots were sampled from each plot for nutritional analysis and weighed fresh thereafter these samples were washed with distilled water to remove debris and analysed for iron and zinc by nvirotek laboratories analysis of β carotene concentration of ageb and storage roots was conducted at the arc vop biotechnology laboratory storage roots were peeled and dried with a paper towel two opposite quarters from the longitudinal storage root were combined homogenised aliquots weighed and stored at 80 c for a week before freeze drying details of the equipment reagents and extraction methods used in determining iron zinc and β carotene concentrations were as described by nyathi et al 2018b β carotene

children was calculated using nutritional yield ny data iron zinc and β carotene nys kg ha 1 divided by the drni mg 100 g 1 we assumed that 30 of β carotene is lost during cooking boiling as mentioned by laurie et al 2012a and van jaarsveld et al 2006 for iron and zinc around 50 is lost 5 due to boiling and 45 due to bioavailability inside human bodies amagloh et al 2017 gupta et al 2006 2 4 statistical analysis two models of the generalised linear mixed model procedures for genstat version 14 vsn uk were used for data analysis we used model 1 to assess the fixed effects irrigation regime

15 season total rainfall was 554 mm the total irrigation amount was 495 mm w1 and 210 mm w2 in the 2013 14 season during the 2014 15 season total irrigation amount was 338 mm w1 and 218 mm w2 fig 1 a the similarity in irrigation of w2 treatments for both seasons resulted from the difference in the duration of the growing period during season 1 orange fleshed sweet potato storage root was harvested 130 days after planting and for season 2 storage root was harvested 180 days after planting 3 2 total storage root yield marketable storage root yield and aboveground edible biomass the four way and three way interactions between irrigation regime soil fertilisation vine harvesting and season were not significant p 0 05 however there was a significant p 0 05 interaction between irrigation regime and season for total storage root yield and marketable storage root yield fig 1b e for the 2013 14 season irrigation regimes did not affect p 0 05 both storage root yields in contrast the 2014 15 results revealed that the well watered regime significantly p 0 05 increased both storage root yield over the supplemental regime for total storage root yield it was higher by 42 whereas for marketable storage root yield it was higher by 44 correspondingly the soil fertilisation by vine harvesting interaction significantly p 0 05 affected total storage root yield and marketable storage root yield fig 1c f without vine harvesting applying fertiliser increased total storage root yield 33 and marketable storage root yield 41 compared to the control no fertiliser application interestingly with vine harvesting soil fertilisation had no effect p 0 05 on total storage root yield and marketable storage root yield with no fertiliser applied both storage root yields were comparable whether vines were harvested or not there was a significant p 0 04 interaction effect between season and soil fertilisation for marketable storage root yield fig 1d in the 2013 14 season soil fertilisation did not affect p 0 05 marketable storage root yield on the contrary the well fertilised treatment improved marketable storage root yield by 44 compared to the control in the 2014 15 season there were no significant effects p 0 05 of irrigation regimes and soil fertilisation for the aboveground edible biomass harvested during the growing seasons yet our results revealed that between 0 9 1 1 t dm dry matter ha 1 2013 14 season and between 1 2 1 5 t dm ha 1 2014 15 season were harvested table a1 3 3 micronutrients β carotene nutritional yield and potential contribution to human nutrition there were no significant p 0 05 interactions for main effects on moisture content this implies that moisture did not compromise differences in mass concentrations reported here and established on a fresh mass basis for the aboveground edible biomass moisture content ranged from 0 78 to 0 80 and for the storage root moisture content ranged from 0 74 to 0 81 fig a1 similarly irrigation regime soil fertilisation and the season had no effect p 0 05 on iron zinc and β carotene mass concentrations in the aboveground edible biomass and storage roots the aboveground edible biomass was superior in micronutrient concentrations grand means 50 mg fe 100 g 1 2 8 mg zn 100g 1 compared to the storage root grand means 4 6 mg fe 100 g 1 1 2 mg zn 100 g 1 however the storage root was rich in β carotene with mean values ranging from 173 to 229 mg β carotene 100 g 1 table 4 in addition the mean results 2013 14 and 2014 15 for micronutrient and β carotene mass concentrations illustrated that without vine harvesting low input management supplemental irrigation regime and no fertiliser application treatments improved storage root concentrations by 79 for iron and 22 for β carotene whereas for zinc it remained the same in comparison to the highest input regime well watered and well fertilised treatments in contrast vine harvesting reduced storage root concentrations by 20 for iron and 2 for zinc whereas for β carotene concentration it was improved by 9 compared to the highest input regime for both seasons 2013 14 and 2014 15 there was no significant p 0 05 interaction effect between soil fertilisation and vine harvesting for iron nutritional yields storage root and total biomass storage root plus the aboveground edible biomass table 5 however the main effects vine harvesting and season were highly significant p 0 001 for total iron nutritional yield our results displayed that vine harvesting 0 73 kg fe ha 1 improved total iron nutritional yield compared to no vine harvesting 0 39 kg fe ha 1 for the 2014 15 season total iron nutritional yield 0 72 kg fe ha 1 was higher than for the 2013 14 season 0 41 kg fe ha 1 zinc nutritional yields storage root and total biomass and β carotene nutritional yields storage root and total biomass were affected p 0 05 by the interaction of soil fertilisation and vine harvesting table 5 our results illustrated that vine harvesting reduced zinc and β carotene nutritional yields for the storage root relative to no vine harvesting generally the reductions were larger under the well fertilised treatment zinc 43 β carotene 43 compared to the control zinc 11 β carotene 19 similarly vine harvesting reduced total nutritional yields storage root plus aboveground edible biomass for zinc and β carotene under the well fertilised treatment without fertiliser vine harvesting improved total β carotene nutritional yield for the same season 2013 14 there was a significant p 0 05 interaction between irrigation regime and soil fertilisation for β carotene nutritional yields mean values ranged from 11 to 18 kg β carotene ha 1 table 5 under well watered conditions total β carotene nutritional yield declined from 18 to 11 kg β carotene ha 1 when fertiliser was withheld whereas under the supplemental irrigation regime soil fertility had no effect on total β carotene nutritional yield during the 2014 15 season only zinc nutritional yields storage root and total biomass were affected p 0 05 by the interaction of soil fertilisation and vine harvesting table 5 however the main effects irrigation regime fertilisation and vine harvesting were significant p 0 05 for β carotene nutritional yields storage root and total biomass the well watered regime improved both β carotene nutritional yields storage root 25 3 kg ha 1 total biomass 25 5 kg ha 1 compared to the supplemental irrigation regime storage root 18 6 kg ha 1 total biomass 18 9 kg ha 1 correspondingly applying fertiliser enhanced both β carotene nutritional yields storage roots 24 4 kg ha 1 total biomass 24 7 kg ha 1 compared to no fertiliser application storage roots 19 5 kg ha 1 total biomass 19 7 kg ha 1 our results further revealed that vine harvesting reduced storage root β carotene nutritional yield from 28 1 to 15 8 kg ha 1 and total biomass β carotene nutritional yield from 28 1 to 16 3 kg ha 1 zinc nutritional yields storage root and total biomass were affected p 0 05 by the interaction between soil fertilisation and vine harvesting mean values ranged from 0 09 to 0 17 kg ha 1 for the storage root and 0 11 to 0 17 kg ha 1 for the total biomass the 2014 15 results for the effects of soil fertilisation and vine harvesting were similar to the 2013 14 results firstly vine harvesting reduced zinc nutritional yields storage roots and total biomass relative to no vine harvesting secondly reductions were larger under well fertilised conditions in the 2014 15 season iron nutritional yield for the storage root and iron nutritional yield for total biomass were not affected p 0 05 by the irrigation regime table 5 in contrast zinc nutritional yield and β carotene nutritional yield were affected p 0 05 by irrigation regime the well watered regime increased zinc nutritional yields storage roots 43 total biomass 38 and β carotene nutritional yields 26 for storage roots and total biomass compared to the supplemental irrigation regime fig a2 presents mean values of the amount of boiled orange fleshed sweet potato var bophelo aboveground edible biomass harvested during the growing season to meet iron zinc and vitamin a daily recommended nutrient intakes assessments showed that orange fleshed sweet potato aboveground edible biomass could potentially contribute to the daily recommended nutrient intake for iron and vitamin a whereas it cannot meet the daily recommended nutrient intake for zinc this is mainly because of the large amounts of orange fleshed sweet potato that are needed to be consumed for example under the highest input regime well watered and well fertilised treatments a family of six people would need to consume 2465 g per day 411 g per day for an individual to meet iron nutritional requirements and 616 g per day 103 g per day for an individual to meet vitamin a requirements for zinc nutritional requirements a family of six would need to consume an impossible 22096 g per day 3682 g per day for an individual of boiled orange fleshed aboveground edible biomass it was interesting to realise that under the low input regime water stressed and no fertiliser application growing conditions daily iron and vitamin a nutritional requirements for a family of six people could still be met 2694 g per day for iron 449 g per day for an individual and 642 g per day for vitamin a 107 g per day for an individual 3 4 evapotranspiration water productivity and nutritional water productivity for the 2013 14 and 2014 15 seasons there was no significant interaction p 0 05 between irrigation regime soil fertilisation and vine harvesting for actual evapotranspiration eta fig 2 however eta values for different treatment combinations box 1 ranged from 427 to 491 mm for the well watered treatment 2013 14 season and from 592 to 658 mm for the 2014 15 season table a1 for the supplemental regime eta of different treatment combinations ranged from 219 to 257 mm 2013 14 season and from 439 to 467 mm for the 2014 15 season there was no significant effect p 0 05 on water productivity of the treatments irrigation regime fertilisation and vine harvesting during both seasons table a1 for the 2013 14 season two main effects irrigation regime and soil fertilisation were significant p 0 05 for water productivity our results showed that supplemental irrigation 35 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 improved water productivity compared to the well watered regime 22 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 correspondingly the well fertilised treatment 31 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 had superior water productivity compared to the control 26 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 for the 2014 15 season all main effects irrigation regime soil fertilisation and vine harvesting were significant p 0 05 for water productivity the results of the study illustrated that water productivity values were similar regardless of the main effect w1 25 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 and w2 21 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 f1 25 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 and f2 21 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 and h1 25 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 and h2 21 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 however water productivity for irrigation regime displayed contradicting results compared to the 2013 14 season the well watered regime indicated water productivity superior to that of the supplemental regime in addition our results displayed that vine harvesting reduced water productivity table 6 presents iron zinc and β carotene nutritional water productivities for both storage root and total biomass storage root plus the aboveground edible biomass 2013 14 and 2014 15 seasons irrigation regime did not affect p 0 05 iron nutritional water productivities storage root and total biomass however zinc and β carotene nutritional water productivities were affected p 0 05 by irrigation regime 2013 14 season our results showed that the supplemental irrigation regime improved storage root nutritional water productivity 50 for zinc and 56 for β carotene and total biomass nutritional water productivity 52 for zinc and 56 for β carotene relative to the well watered regime vine harvesting affected p 0 05 iron and β carotene nutritional water productivities for the storage root and total biomass except for zinc total biomass nutritional water productivity p 0 383 generally vine harvesting reduced nutritional water productivity for both storage root and total biomass except for the huge increase shown by total biomass iron nutritional water productivity 60 compared to no vine harvesting 2013 14 season in the 2014 15 season water regimes affected only zinc nutritional water productivity for the storage root p 0 045 significantly there was no effect p 0 05 for other storage root nutritional water productivities iron and β carotene and total biomass nutritional water productivities iron zinc and β carotene our results showed that storage root zinc nutritional water productivity decreased under the supplemental irrigation regime relative to the well watered regime iron nutritional water productivities storage root and total biomass were not affected p 0 05 by vine harvesting whereas zinc and β carotene nutritional water productivity were affected p 0 05 by vine harvesting the results of this study showed that the vine harvesting treatment reduced both nutritional water productivities for zinc storage roots 63 and total biomass 18 and β carotene storage roots 72 and total biomass 66 relative to the no vine harvesting treatment 4 discussion this study evaluated the potential of utilising orange fleshed sweet potato var bophelo as a dual purpose food crop producing a green leafy vegetable and storage roots for human consumption the well watered orange fleshed sweet potato produced the highest storage root yields total storage root and marketable storage root for both seasons however the 2014 15 season gave a larger storage root yield than the 2013 14 season fig 1b and e this resulted because firstly the 2014 15 season received more and better distributed rain compared to the 2013 14 season fig 1a secondly in the 2013 14 season storage roots were harvested 130 days after planting whereas in 2014 15 the growing season was almost two months longer with harvest 180 days after planting therefore more solar radiation was intercepted during the 2014 15 season than during the 2013 14 season resulting in higher productivity we made a calculation of orange fleshed sweet potato productivity per day for the well managed treatment well watered full fertilisation and no vine harvesting based on the assumption that storage root formation starts at 52 days after planting our findings indicated that orange fleshed sweet potato productivity per day was the same for both seasons at 132 kg dm ha 1 day 1 in 2013 14 and 133 kg dm ha 1 day 1 in 2014 15 during the 2013 14 season storage root yields for the well watered and the supplemental irrigation treatments were similar fig 1b and e perhaps the length 130 days of the growing season caused the similarity in that the duration of water stress was shorter during the 2013 14 season than for the 2014 15 season where there was a clear difference in storage root yield between the two water treatments fig 1b and e vine harvesting reduced storage root yields total storage root and marketable storage root as found in studies by gomes and carr 2001 a and van an et al 2003 this authenticates our hypothesis that vine harvesting of orange fleshed sweet potato reduces storage root yield the 2014 15 results of this study showed that under low input management supplemental rather than full irrigation and no fertiliser application storage root production total storage root and marketable storage root was reduced fig 1b f in addition our results highlighted that when considering orange fleshed sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop trade off considerations have to be made for example utilising orange fleshed sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop is not an ideal practice for market oriented farming the loss of marketable storage root was 50 under well fertilised conditions fig 1f for subsistence oriented farming rural resource poor households using orange fleshed sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop makes more sense as the aboveground edible biomass is available for consumption during the growing season table a1 at the end of the growing season storage roots can then be consumed however the consequence of vine harvesting is a reduction in the total storage root yield fig 1c our results indicated that without fertiliser application total storage root productivity declined from 7 8 to 6 7 t dm ha 1 whereas under full fertilisation the penalty of vine harvesting was higher total storage root yield dropped from 11 6 to 7 1 t dm ha 1 this implies that for subsistence oriented farming soil fertilisation combined with vine harvesting is not an ideal practice because the reduction in total storage root yield is huge the grand mean results of this study further displayed that the vine harvesting treatment reduced iron zinc and β carotene concentrations of the storage root table 4 in line with our hypothesis this has implications for nutritional food security of rural resource poor households the loss in nutrients of harvested storage root caused by vine harvesting was compensated by the availability of highly nutritious green aboveground edible biomass which rural resource poor households can consume as a relish with maize porridge mavengahama et al 2013 in the winter season the storage root becomes available for consumption this spreads food availability over a longer period thereby improving the nutritional food security of rural resource poor households we expected that vine harvesting of orange fleshed sweet potato would reduce storage root nutritional yield our results concurred with our hypothesis however vine harvesting improved total nutritional yields of iron and zinc whereas there was a minimal increase for total β carotene nutritional yield table 5 this is mainly because the aboveground edible biomass of orange fleshed sweet potato contributed the least amount of β carotene to the total nutritional yield irrigation and fertiliser application are considered important inputs that determine nutritional yields of iron zinc and β carotene laurie et al 2012a the results of this study agreed with our expectations that high inputs well fertilised and well watered treatments improve the nutritional yield of selected nutrients this agrees with laurie et al 2012a findings which showed that optimum management is the best for an improved nutritional yield of the storage root table 5 however the consequence of vine harvesting combined with no fertiliser application is a reduction in total nutrients that can be harvested it was reduced by 42 for iron 45 for zinc and 52 for β carotene relative to no vine harvesting and fertiliser application similarly vine harvesting combined with supplemental irrigation resulted in the reduction of nutrients by 47 for iron 38 for zinc and 39 for β carotene relative to no vine harvesting and full irrigation laurie et al 2012a showed that planting one hectare of sweet potato by community members is feasible for boiled orange fleshed sweet potato total storage root assessments showed that the number of people one could feed for a period of 90 days from one hectare for the requirements of iron and zinc is very low under high input iron 7 people and zinc 4 people and low input iron 7 people and zinc 2 people optimization table a2 practically this suggests that people would need to consume huge amounts of boiled orange fleshed sweet potato storage root to meet their daily iron and zinc dietary requirements therefore the storage root cannot be recommended as a food source for iron and zinc however for β carotene one hectare of orange fleshed sweet potato storage root could potentially supply 1570 262 households people with the required amount of vitamin a for a period of 90 days under high input regime the number of households that can be fed for vitamin a requirement were reduced by three fold under the low input regime table a2 our results showed that treatments irrigation regime soil fertilisation and vine harvesting did not affect β carotene potential contribution to the daily recommended nutrient intake for all age groups under the low input management storage roots could still provide more than the daily recommended nutrient requirements by 6 fold table a3 a study conducted by nyathi et al 2018b indicated that boiled aboveground edible biomass of amaranth amaranthus cruentus and spider flower cleome gynandra could potentially meet human nutritional requirements for iron and zinc to consume a balanced diet that can alleviate micronutrients deficiency iron zinc and vitamin a we recommend that rural resource poor households should prepare a side dish made up of orange fleshed sweet potato plant tissues storage root and the aboveground biomass combined with amaranth and spider flower the main aim of the water productivity concept is to produce more crop with limited water use actual evapotranspiration nyathi et al 2018b our results 2013 14 concurred with other studies chimonyo et al 2016 laurie et al 2012a mabhaudhi et al 2013 motsa et al 2015 nyathi et al 2018b that showed superior water productivity for sorghum sorghum bicolor taro colocasia esculenta sweet potato ipomoea batatas and selected leafy vegetables amaranth amaranthus cruentus spider flower cleome gynandra and swiss chard beta vulguris under water stress and well fertilised conditions the results of this study further revealed that there was a variation in water productivity between seasons the 2014 15 results indicated lower water productivity compared to the 2013 14 season table a4 in addition water productivity results for the 2014 15 season exhibited contrary results compared with the 2013 14 season the well watered regime and soil fertilisation improved water productivity we expected consistency in terms of the effect of water stress and soil fertilisation on water productivity for both seasons the difference in water productivity for both seasons might have been caused by different meteorological conditions temperature rain radiation and vapour pressure deficit table 2 and the length of the growing season steduto et al 2007 chibarabada et al 2017 averred that water use in agriculture crop production and nutritional requirements are assessed in isolation this procedure is not ideal because of the three aspects interlink several studies chibarabada et al 2017 mdemu et al 2009 nyathi et al 2018b renault and wallender 2000 have assessed nutritional water productivity nwp an index that combines aspects of water use crop production and human nutrition of selected crops cowpea vigna unguiculata bambara groundnut vigna subterranea dry bean phaseolus vulgaris groundnut arachis hypogaea tomato solanum lycopersicum rice oryza sativa onion allium cepa amaranth amaranthus cruentus spider flower cleome gynandra swiss chard beta vulgaris var fordhook giant as far as can be ascertained our study is the first attempt to assess iron zinc and β carotene nutritional water productivities of orange fleshed sweet potato var bophelo storage root and total edible biomass storage root plus the aboveground edible biomass using datasets storage root yield aboveground edible biomass evapotranspiration and nutrient concentrations iron zinc and β carotene from the same experiment therefore this study serves as a benchmark the mean for both seasons 2013 14 and 2014 15 displayed superior nutritional water productivities storage root and total biomass under the supplemental irrigation regime table 6 interestingly total nutritional water productivity was higher than the storage root nutritional water productivity in addition the mean for both seasons displayed that nutritional water productivity iron zinc and β carotene for the storage root and total edible biomass declined under the practice of vine harvesting table 6 this highlights that some compromises have to be made when considering orange fleshed sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop quite surprisingly utilising orange fleshed sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop can be recommended because selected micronutrients and β carotene nutritional productivities were maximised per unit water used our results illustrated that considering orange fleshed sweet potato as a dual purpose food crop required less water to meet total human nutrition requirements iron 942 litres person 1 day 1 zinc 3915 litres person 1 day 1 β carotene 12 litres person 1 day 1 under low input management fig a3b and c in contrast considering orange fleshed sweet potato as a storage root only fig a3a and c required more water to meet total human nutrition requirements iron 3561 litres person 1 day 1 zinc 6091 litres person 1 day 1 and β carotene 13 litres person 1 day 1 limited information exists on nutritional water productivity of crops a study by nyathi et al 2018b reported nutritional water productivity values for selected leafy vegetables ranging from 226 to 1323 mg m 3 for iron 60 to 160 mg m 3 for zinc and 365 to 1886 mg m 3 for β carotene at a glance this suggests that selected leafy vegetables are more productive than orange fleshed sweet potato storage root in terms of iron and zinc nutritional water productivities however caution has to be exercised when comparing leafy vegetables and orange fleshed sweet potato storage root the duration of the growing season differs sweet potato maximum growing period is 180 days whereas for leafy vegetables it is 100 days therefore orange fleshed sweet potato utilises more water 219 658 mm than leafy vegetables 147 457 mm to produce selected micronutrients this highlights the importance of crop diversification in meeting human nutrition requirements with less water consumed for example leafy vegetables are superior in iron and zinc per unit of water used whereas orange fleshed sweet potato is rich in β carotene per unit of water used a diet consisting of leafy vegetables and orange fleshed sweet potato leaves and storage root will reduce the amount of water used to produce iron zinc and β carotene 5 conclusions this study showed that there is an opportunity of utilising orange fleshed sweet potato var bophelo as a dual purpose food crop green leafy vegetable and staple storage root for human consumption our results showed that the dual use of orange fleshed sweet potato is not ideal for market oriented farming because marketable storage root yield decreased by half in contrast the dual use of orange fleshed sweet potato can be considered for less market oriented rural resource poor households the leaves could provide fresh greens for home consumption or for sale in addition to the storage root this spreads food availability over a longer period hence an improvement in the nutritional food security of rural resource poor households however the consequence of the dual use of orange fleshed sweet potato is the reduction in total storage root yield whose effect depends on soil fertilisation no fertiliser application 7 8 to 6 7 t dm ha 1 and n p and k fertiliser application at a recommended rate 11 6 7 1 t dm ha 1 with vine harvesting total storage root yield was

combined with no fertiliser application the highest zinc 0 16 kg dm ha 1 and β carotene 26 kg dm ha 1 nutritional yields were obtained under the practice of no vine harvesting combined with the well fertilised treatment assessments showed that orange fleshed sweet potato storage root cannot be recommended for iron and zinc dietary requirements because of the huge amounts that need to be consumed however the storage root can meet vitamin a human nutritional requirements for all age groups even under the low input regime water stressed and no fertiliser application conditions it was interesting to note that more water was needed to meet the daily recommended nutrient intake iron zinc and β carotene if orange fleshed sweet potato was grown for its storage root than when it was grown as a dual purpose food crop this highlights that nutritional water productivities of rural resource poor households can be maximised these results have to be taken into consideration when making decisions about the nutritional food security of rural resource poor households future research is needed to confirm these findings across a large set of orange fleshed sweet potato varieties that might respond

11064,chickpea is susceptible to water logging and responds to soil aeration oxygen deficiency at both a temporal and spatial scale could occur for a subsurface drip irrigated crop particularly in heavy clay soils use of aerated water irrigation oxygation to overcome hypoxia in the rhizosphere was evaluated in broad acre chickpea crops in 2006 and 2007 in a heavy clay soil of central queensland australia the injection of 12 by volume air into subsurface drip irrigation water oxygation to two consecutive broad acre chickpea crops resulted in a beneficial effect on yield gains of 27 and 10 for 2006 and 2007 respectively but the effect of irrigation regimes at deficit and full irrigation 85 and 100 etc was not significantly different chickpea yield with aerated subsurface drip irrigation was much higher 3 24 and 2 05 t ha 1 compared to the 7 year 2008 2015 national average yield 1 13 t ha 1 the aerated irrigation resulted into significantly higher gross production water use index gpwui and irrigation water use index iwui particularly in the year when the crop was planted early in the season there was no significant difference in response to either of these water use efficiency wue indicators between irrigation treatments with the exception of a significantly enhanced iwui with the 85 etc in the first season these results were consistent with those for cotton on the same site

1 introduction chickpea cicer arietinum l is an edible legume of the family fabaceae chickpea has an indeterminate growth habit continuing to flower and set pods as long as climatic conditions are favorable it has seeds high in protein and is one of the earliest known cultivated vegetables chickpea referred to as an ancient crop of modern times yadav et al 2007 was first cultivated in the fertile crescent over 9500 years ago and in the indian subcontinent for at least 4000 years an annual grain legume or pulse chickpea sold into human food markets makes up more than 20 of world pulse production kostal and boersh 2008 world chickpea production is roughly three times that of lentil and global consumption as a human pulse crop food is second amongst legumes only to dry bean watts 2011 chickpea is predominantly grown in the indian sub continent india produces tenfold that produced by the second largest producer australia other key producers include pakistan turkey myanmar ethiopia and iran in 2014 global chickpea production surpassed 13 7 million tonnes mt including 9 88 mt in india and 0 629 mt in australia fao 2015 chickpea was first grown in australia in the 1970 s it is now a common winter crop grown predominantly in queensland desi type and new south wales but also to a far lesser extent in western australia south australia and victoria kabuli type there has been a significant increase in area sown to chickpea in australia during recent years since 2000 there has been a linear annual increase of area planted to chickpea 21 000 ha per year with an associated annual increase in yield of 0 02 tonnes per hectare t ha 1 across the five year period 2008 to 2012 yields averaged 1 13 t ha 1 producing 0 678 mt grdc 2016 in response to favorable climatic conditions and price australian chickpea production in 2015 exceeded 1 mt 0 969 mt desi and 0 043 mt kabuli from 614 357 ha pulse australia 2016 in 2016 australia was the largest exporting country of chickpea in the world eighty percent of australian chickpea is exported predominantly to india bangladesh and pakistan grdc 2016 chickpea is a high value crop that is well adapted to deep soils it tolerates heat and performs well under good soil moisture conditions and daytime temperatures between 21 c and 30 c with night temperatures near 20 c long taproots that enable access to soil water from greater depths than other pulse crops confer a relative drought tolerance making chickpea an attractive crop for rainfed farming kashiwagi et al 2015 sorghum is commonly used in rotation to cotton in the central highlands of queensland in australia as a winter crop chickpea acts as an integral component in the local cotton farming system slatter and lucy 2002 succinctly outlined why chickpeas have become increasingly important as a rotation crop in australian cotton farming systems i chickpea production is well suited to the predominant cotton soil types i e heavy cracking clays and it performs well in wide rows ii it effectively accesses soil moisture reserves and utilizes remaining water held in on farm storages that would otherwise evaporate iii it is relatively water efficient and provides a good return in terms of dollars per megalitre when irrigated to its detriment hulugalle et al 1998 identified some allelopathic effects of grain legumes including chickpea in cotton based systems such as reduced emergence growth lint yield and fibre quality additionally adherence to the planting window restrictions imposed on the predominately genetically modified cotton varieties often provides a restricted window between chickpea harvest and cotton planting which arguably impacts on pre plant preparations with a consequent negative impact on cotton yields in spite of this chickpea remains an attractive option for irrigated cotton growers chickpea is however particularly susceptible to waterlogging and consequently requires great care at crucial stages of plant development e g flowering to avoid incurring yield penalties through inappropriate irrigation management cowie et al 1995 yadav et al 2007 chickpea responds positively to drip irrigation and fertigation deolanker and berad 1999 under a dry tropical environment significant saving in water and fertilizer for chickpea production with drip irrigation has been reported in a number of previous studies deolankar and pandit 1998 leyva et al 2016 in pot experiments bhattarai et al 2008 reported a significant reduction of the negative impact of waterlogging on chickpea yield when irrigated with aerated water oxygation this was demonstrated by introduction of 12 by volume of air into the irrigation water delivered through a subsurface drip irrigation sdi system on a heavy clay soil vertosol which resulted in improved yield 11 in a controlled environment pot experiment the benefit of aeration was more pronounced with increasing emitter depth which again suggests that chickpea will respond to aeration of rhizosphere there is restricted diffusion of oxygen from the atmosphere at deeper soil depth the horizontal and vertical movement of soil moisture in a vertosol calls for deeper placement of drip tape which can reduce water loss due to evaporation from the surface therefore sdi in vertosols are generally placed at a depth of 300 400 mm from the surface however with increasing emitter depth the oxygen diffusion in the wetting fronts of the rhizosphere becomes limited and therefore plants are exposed to potential hypoxia abuarab et al 2013 additionally deeper emitter depth may need alternative or additional initial surface irrigation to ensure uniform germination and establishment of the crop mann 2006 sdi can substantially improve irrigation water use efficiency iwue by minimizing evaporative loss and maximizing capture of in season rainfall by a dry upper soil profile mchugh et al 2008 however in many especially heavier soil types sustained wetting fronts are created around the sdi emitter which can lead to hypoxia of the rhizosphere this effect it has been argued is very prominent in vertosols at higher irrigation rates especially in the summer bhattarai et al 2004 it is likely that this effect would be accentuated for drippers placed deeper in the soil such placement would encourage root growth at greater depth in the soil in a soil volume with a longer diffusive path to the atmosphere to alleviate this the impact of oxygation on the yield of broad acre chickpea crop was assessed this paper specifically examines the effects of aerated water at two irrigation regimes deficit and full irrigation for a subsurface drip irrigated broad acre chickpea crop in the central highlands of queensland australia 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

australia were sown on each plot on 26 may 2006 and again on 9 july 2007 this variety was specifically bred for the short duration hot central queensland winter and is characterized by early flowering pod set and high yield potential seeds were sown at a 6 cm depth into rows directly above the dripper tape in the 1 m tape spaced plots and offset 0 5 m either side of the 2 m spaced tapes using a tractor driven seed dibber a seed rate of 70 kg ha 1 was used in both years resulting in plant populations of 31 and 22 plants m 2 in 2006 and 2007 respectively the recommended planting population under irrigation is 35 40 plants m 2 no defoliant was required in either year crops were harvested on 8 september 2006 and 27 october 2007 2 3 experimental design treatments a factorial experiment of oxygation oxygated or non oxygated by irrigation regime 100 or 85 of daily crop evapotranspiration coefficient etc was employed across the 12 plots in a randomized complete block design with three replications the central 8 rows were used as datum rows with 4 buffer rows either side etc calculation employed a visual observation of chickpea phenological development stage to determine the appropriate crop coefficients kc allen et al 1998 these crop coefficients were then applied to the computed reference crop evapotranspiration eto supplied by the on site environdatatm wm2000 weather station environdata toowoomba in order to calculate the daily etc the weather station recorded rainfall temperature wind speed and direction and humidity at ten minute intervals and computed eto using the modified penman monteith equation meyer et al 1999 the oxygation treatments consisted of aerated water irrigation by entrainment of 12 of air by volume into the irrigation water based on previous research results reported by goorahoo et al 2002 and bhattarai et al 2004 achieved using venturi devices mazzei injector corporation usa model 1583 fitted to the irrigation line see picture 1 for

multi depth probes enviroscan located in each replicate i e 12 installations provided soil moisture data during the 2007 trial both loggers recording the probe data were disabled due to lightning strike in the reboot process some stored data that had not been adequately downloaded and back up was corrupted consequently soil moisture data presented are restricted to those which remained

treatment when moisture content reached refill point for the vertosol 22 mm h2o 100 mm 1 soil depth or 22 cm m 1 the soil moisture measured at 5 cm offset points from emitters at 40 cm depth from the soil surface was used as the basis for determining the irrigation all plots were irrigated independently according to the evaluation of the soil moisture for the specific plot soil moisture data from the field were assessed daily using internet based data transfer and the current data were used to manage irrigation scheduling the irrigation controller allowed for the variable rate irrigation for different plots according to the pre defined set point the volume of irrigation applied was based on calculated etc data supplied by weather station e g 85 of the calculated etc since application of the previous irrigation was delivered at each irrigation event to the 85 irrigation treatment 2 6 yield determination in 2006 all plants were sampled from two randomly selected one linear metre sample

replicate harvested 96 dap 27th october was modified in that a total 48 samples were collected 4 0 5 linear metre per replicate more but smaller sample plots larger sample sizes allowed better determination of the average values of these harvest data and avoided errors from testing a smaller number of possibly atypical samples all plants in each sample were counted separated into stem leaf and pods and then dried at 70 c to a constant weight pods and seed were subsequently separated and all weights recorded to determine dry weight partitioning and yield additionally the use of a load cell mounted sampling bin in 2007 enabled the measurement of total machine harvest yield to be recorded to 1 kg accuracy on a replicate basis dry weight is presented as grams per square metre g m 2 and yields are presented as either grams per plant g plant 1 grams per square metre g m 2 or when derived from commercial harvesting as tonnes per hectare t ha 1 water use efficiencies in different

following the method by allen et al 1998 2 7 statistical analysis data were subjected to analysis of variance anova using the generalized linear model glm for a randomized complete block factorial

1429 huap the 2006 crop received 80 6 mm of rainfall fig 1 with over half of this in two major falls in june 33 8 mm on 17 dap and 8 2 mm on 26 dap the third major event consisted of 25 mm received over the period 41 43 dap in 2007 only 33 mm rain was received i e less than half that of the 2006 experiment mostly occurring in a single two day event with 20 mm on 5th september 58 dap and 6 2 mm

crop i e not including wet up irrigation events occurred only five in crop irrigation events occurred over the 2007 season and then all between 73 and 85 days after planting dap a period that coincided with flower set in crop irrigation delivered to the 85 etc deficit irrigation and 100 etc full irrigation treatments amounted to 37 mm and 43 mm in 2006 and 31 mm and 34 mm in 2007 table 1 in 2006 the 85 etc and 100 etc treatments received 147 mm and 153 mm respectively in 2007 the 85 etc and 100 etc treatments received a total irrigation of 121 mm and 124 mm total irrigation water respectively in 2006 pre planting irrigation 100 mm was required to achieve field capacity at harvest approximately 24 of pre planting total moisture remained in the soil profile across the experimental site 26 mm in the 85 etc and 25 mm 100 mm in the 100 etc treatment plots table 1 the 2007 experiment required slightly less 90 mm pre planting irrigation to achieve a full profile at harvest approximately 21 of pre planting total moisture remained in the soil profile across the experimental site 19 mm in the 85 etc and 17 mm 100 mm in the 100 etc treatment plots table 1 in both seasons the soil moisture remained between the refill point 22 mm 100 mm 1 to field capacity 42 mm 100 mm 1 in the soil until the start of flowering fig 3 and 4 a gradual reduction of soil moisture occurred in the 2006 following flowering from 2 july i e 38 dap to when the probes were removed 48 dap the influence of the early rain event of 34 mm at 17 dap 11th june 2006 and 20 mm on 58 dap 5th sepember 2007 on the soil moisture profile is also clearly seen fig 3 and 4 the graph indicating a rapid recharge of the profile to above field capacity 42 mm 100 mm 1 soil unlike the soil moisture status of the 100 etc treatment which returned to field capacity with each irrigation event soil moisture at 20 40 and 60 cm in the 85 etc treatment was depleted over the course of the trial the soil moisture status over the profile measured i e to 80 cm depth however did not drop below the refill point of 22 cm m 1 see fig 4 3 3 seed yield and dry weight partitioning there was a significant effect of oxygation on seed yield and above ground dry weight in the 2006 experiment table 2 the oxygation treatment produced a greater seed weight per square metre and a larger above ground dry weight than the no oxygation treatment 359 vs 283 g m 2 and 556 vs 439 g m 2 respectively however although yields followed the same trends in 2007 the response to oxygation was not significant table 2 seed yield averaged across treatments was 321 and 205 g m 2 in 2006 and 2007 respectively there was no significant effect of irrigation on yield table 2 and there were no significant interactions between oxygation and irrigation treatments identified for the dry weight and yield parameters in either years there were also no significant differences in commercial harvest yields in 2007 the only year for which the harvester yields were quantified table 2 3 4 irrigation water use efficiencies and soil moisture the oxygated crop in 2006 achieved a significantly higher iwui by 27 compared to the non oxygated treatment table 3 similarly in 2006 the gpwui of oxygated chickpea was also significantly higher by 27 however in the following year differences in either iwui or gpwui were not significant the effects of irrigation treatments on cwui iwui or gpwui were not significantly different in either season expect for a significant increase 18 in iwui by the 85 etc compared to the 100 etc treatment in 2006 table 3 there was no difference between oxygation treatments in either season for cwui table 3 total water used in 2006 and 2007 in different combination treatments under comparison are presented in table 1 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture consideration of soil moisture status throughout the whole profile is important for effective scheduling in some situations irrigators deliberately aim to maintain a full profile so as to provide a buffering capacity against times when their irrigation system may be incapable of delivering sufficient irrigation water to keep pace with plant extraction rates this strategy is often employed when the system operating capacity is incapable of meeting peak crop water use patterns sufficient buffering capacity also provides some insurance against possible irrigation system downtime e g pump malfunction electrical fault in irrigation schedule programmer information on soil moisture status across the depth can be useful in managing potential deep drainage however as shown in fig 3 summed profile soil moisture data do not directly provide assistance in determining what the soil moisture status is at the specific depths that are critical for optimum plant performance i e where the roots are data for 2007 soil moisture are presented as measured at 20 40 60 and 80 cm of the non oxygated chickpea irrigated at 85 etc and 100 etc fig 4 the increase in soil moisture due to the 26 mm of rainfall on the 5th and 6th september 58 59 dap and the five irrigations that occurred from 20th september to 2nd october 73 85 dap are clearly visible the full irrigation treatment 100 etc resulted in a wetter profile soil moisture at the 20 and 40 cm depths of the 85 etc treatment reducing to around 30 mm 100 mm 1 soil on a number of occasions whereas soil moisture of the 100 etc treatment at these depths remained above 35 mm 100 mm 1 with the exception of a single occasion when the soil moisture at the 20 cm depth fell to below this level just prior to the first irrigation on 20th september at both the 60 and 80 cm depths the 100 etc treatment soil moisture was at or above field capacity throughout the experiment remaining at this level to when the probes were extracted in contrast soil moisture at these depths in the 85 etc treatment started to decline in response to peak plant water demand i e when irrigation was applied at 20th september and was noticeably reduced from the first irrigation 2nd october until 12th october see fig 3 suggesting that chickpea roots accessed the water from deeper depth under deficit irrigation compared to full irrigation which could be associated with low soil aeration at deeper depths in the full irrigation regime this also highlights the need when scheduling irrigation to consider soil moisture status within the rooting depth along with moisture at specific depths and across the entire measured profile 4 2 seed yield australian average yield over seven years 2008 2015 of chickpea was 1 13 t ha 1 which is equivalent to 113 g m 2 the national average includes the yield of both irrigated and rainfed chickpea rainfed chickpea yields are highly dependent on the timing of the water stress in relation to phenological stage and timing of fertilizer application singh and bhusan 1980 supplementary irrigated chickpea with aerated water significantly increased yield by 27 in the first 359 vs the non oxygated 283 g m 2 and only 11 in the second year 216 vs 195 g m 2 table 2 there was no significant difference in yield response to irrigation treatment in either season the latter may be attributed to the similarity of the season long profile soil moisture status between the 85 etc and the 100 etc irrigation treatments fig 3 and 4 in both seasons there was little difference between the amounts of in crop irrigation water supplied to the two different irrigation treatments due to the plentiful and unseasonal in crop rainfall received consequently there was limited opportunity for the treatments to effect any difference in yields produced hirich et al 2013 demonstrated that deficit irrigation during the vegetative period for chickpea has positive influence on biomass yield the optimal crop stage in which deficit irrigation could be applied was the vegetative growth stage as the crop had a chance to develop its root system to be able to cover the plant needs for water and nutrient supply during the rest of the cycle and non stress conditions during the flowering and seed filling stages allow the plant to optimize its photosynthesis and carbon translocation therefore increasing its productivity in accord with this in the semi arid tropics during the dry season positive response to increasing rate of irrigation 10 1125 mm on biomass and grain yield 257 1957 kg ha 1 of chickpea was reported by dogan et al 2013 the aerated chickpea yield in both years in our trials are higher than the highest irrigation rate reported in that research the increase in plant dry weight and seed yield with oxygation of sdi is consistent with previous studies involving heavy soils and consistent with the interpretation that oxygen is limiting to root function in the wetting front around the emitters the observed increase in yield associated with the deeper emitter depths 25 and 35 cm vs 5 and 15 cm in the oxygation treatment bhattarai et al 2008 is consistent with increased oxygen limitation at greater soil depth due to increased diffusive resistance to gas movement the positive response of chickpea to oxygation reported herein from field trials as evidenced a by a significantly greater average yield and b by a higher gpwui with oxygation supports the conclusions from earlier research that oxygation mitigates hypoxic conditions associated with the wetting front of sdi in heavy clay soils the 2007 experiment followed a sorghum crop whereas the 2006 experiment followed cotton a delayed sorghum harvest due to late rains enforced a quick turn around and consequently bed preparation for the chickpea was not as comprehensive as is normally achieved the less than adequate incorporation of sorghum residue was regarded as the major contributor to the reduced chickpea plant stand by c 30 of the 2007 experiment compared to that of 2006 table 2 however beech and leach 1989 reported no significant difference in chickpea yield or dry weight per plant between a range of planting densities 14 28 42 and 56 plants m 2 and pulse australia 2016 also report that yields are relatively stable within a range of 20 40 plants m 2 in a report documenting yields from 12 chickpea crops with plant densities ranging from 12 to 61 plants m 2 yields were highly correlated with available soil moisture 90 of the variation was explained by this factor alone grains research and development corporation 2016 these reports suggest that chickpea like many other crops is capable of compensating for reduced plant stand densities by increasing yield per plant this was apparently not the case in 2007 but was in 2006 averaged yield for 2007 was approximately half of that achieved in 2006 but there was less than 10 difference in yield per plant between the two crops suggesting that yield was largely conditioned by plant density plants m 2 and also due to the previous crop in the rotation in this case sorghum it is difficult to compare yields of different planting densities when produced in different seasons there were two obvious differences between the two experiments in crop rainfall in 2006 was considerably higher than in 2007 table 1 and the later planting date of the 2007 crop was late planted for chickpea in central queensland recommended from 26 may to 9 july the recommended planting date is based on two main factors i reducing potential exposure to frosts and their impact on flowering pod set and ii avoiding exposure to high spring temperatures which can negatively impact on plant performance while the 2007 crop did experience several days where the minimum temperature fell below 4 c these days all occurred in the second week after planting and consequently would not be expected to impact on flowering or pod set two possible reasons to explain the apparent lack of compensation for reduced plant stand are proposed the podding period may have been too short to allow for compensation due to exposure to hot spring shut down i e when high daily temperatures in spring reduce the ability of the chickpea to function normally and or that the plants were unable to put on enough branches due to heat stress to carry the extra fruiting positions needed to compensate for missing plants cumming 2009 that the seed yield in 2007 was more reduced by 34 than was aboveground dry weight by 23 gives additional support to the poor podding in 2007 although the latter stages of the 2007 crop did experience higher temperatures than did the 2006 crop the maximum daily temperatures experienced were not excessive exceeding 35 c on only two occasions in the final weeks of the crop 82 88 dap chickpea can tolerate high temperatures certainly up to 30 c devasirvatham et al 2012 if there is adequate soil moisture pulse australia 2016 soil moisture probe data indicated that the soil moisture status was maintained at close to field capacity throughout the experiment until irrigation was ceased to encourage maturity 85 dap and in preparation for harvesting fig 4 overall daily mean temperatures and evaporation rates in the latter stages of the 2007 crop fig 2 were slightly higher than those experienced by the 2006 crop fig 1 but the differences were relatively small as seen by the similar total heat units after planting 1720 vs 1592 huap and total solar radiation 1344 vs 1429 mj m 2 received by the two crops attempts to explain the difference in yields between the two experiments did highlight the apparent scarcity of peer reviewed published information pertaining to irrigated chickpea plant population yield relationships a situation that needs to be addressed by future research 4 3 water use and water use efficiency as calculations of water use efficiencies presented as iwui gpwui and cwui are based on both water used and yield differences in either will be reflected in final wui values the 2007 in crop rainfall was less than half that received by the 2006 crop therefore a greater proportion of the water used by the 2007 crop was delivered by irrigation rather than received as rainfall in 2007 when averaged across all treatments irrigation water comprised 89 of total water used by the crop compared to 72 in 2006 table 1 the combined effect of a greater reliance on irrigation and significantly lower yields i e 36 lower than those produced in the 2006 crop table 2 resulted in the significantly lower iwui for the 2007 crop table 3 the gpwui of the two crops were comparable as reduced 2007 yields again averaged across all treatments were associated with reduced crop water use i e the ratio between yield produced and total water used of the two crops were similar table 3 the greater gpwui with oxygation in the first year was in agreement with results achieved in the sdi pot experiment where yield of oxygated chickpea irrigated at 35 cm depth was superior to that without oxygation bhattarai et al 2008 indeed in the same study gpwui was 21 higher in the oxygated treatment relative to control for the 35 cm emitter depth pendergast 2011 bhattarai et al 2008 also reported increased season long water use efficiency wuesl a term akin to gpwui for soybean and pumpkin in response to oxygation and significantly higher gpwui of pumpkin with oxygation at the deeper of the two emitter depths trialled 15 cm vs 5 cm however the magnitude of the beneficial effect was not so pronounced in the field the wuesl of oxygated chickpea irrigated at 35 cm emitter depth in the pot experiments bhattarai et al 2008 of 28 g dry seed per litre when calculated at the observed pot experiment plant density of 9 plants m 2 translates to 252 g m 3 considerably higher than the gpwui reported in either years of the experiment as all water supplied to the pot experiment was via irrigation it was appropriate that any comparison should be between the yield wuisl of the pot experiment and the gpwui reported for these field experiments improvements in wue can be achieved by practices that optimize the water use by the plants in the current trial the enhanced wue with oxygation was achieved by positive influence on the rhizosphere environment however enhanced wue has also been related to fertilizer management practices as deolankar and pandit 1998 and deolanker and berad 1999 reported doubling wue and increase in yield of chickpea to 2 25 2 29 t ha 1 by the use of liquid fertilizer in fertigation of drip irrigation water the oxygation of chickpea resulted in significantly enhanced yields and water use efficiencies in the first year that results in the second season reflected the trends of the greater yield and wue improvements by oxygation consistent to the first season results is encouraging there is clearly an indication that oxygation has the potential to contribute to increased chickpea production efficiencies this is a positive outcome that merits further investigation as chickpea are commonly used as part of growers irrigated cotton production systems accrued benefits of oxygated chickpea production efficiencies similar to those of cotton pendergast et al 2013 increase the attractiveness of sdi investment in sdi in cotton production systems has been limited by the perception that the potential increase in production has not been sufficient to justify the required capital outlay increased gross profit margins accrued via oxygation of sdi provide justification for investment of the capital outlay required and should contribute to increased industry

11064,chickpea is susceptible to water logging and responds to soil aeration oxygen deficiency at both a temporal and spatial scale could occur for a subsurface drip irrigated crop particularly in heavy clay soils use of aerated water irrigation oxygation to overcome hypoxia in the rhizosphere was evaluated in broad acre chickpea crops in 2006 and 2007 in a heavy clay soil of central queensland australia the injection of 12 by volume air into subsurface drip irrigation water oxygation to two consecutive broad acre chickpea crops resulted in a beneficial effect on yield gains of 27 and 10 for 2006 and 2007 respectively but the effect of irrigation regimes at deficit and full irrigation 85 and 100 etc was not significantly different chickpea yield with aerated subsurface drip irrigation was much higher 3 24 and 2 05 t ha 1 compared to the 7 year 2008 2015 national average yield 1 13 t ha 1 the aerated irrigation resulted into significantly higher gross production water use index gpwui and irrigation water use index iwui particularly in the year when the crop was planted early in the season there was no significant difference in response to either of these water use efficiency wue indicators between irrigation treatments with the exception of a significantly enhanced iwui with the 85 etc in the first season these results were consistent with those for cotton on the same site providing further justification for the capital investment required for oxygated subsurface drip irrigation sdi system keywords oxygation subsurface drip irrigation chickpea hypoxia water productivity 1 introduction chickpea cicer arietinum l is an edible legume of the family fabaceae chickpea has an indeterminate growth habit continuing to flower and set pods as long as climatic conditions are favorable it has seeds high in protein and is one of the earliest known cultivated vegetables chickpea referred to as an ancient crop of modern times yadav et al 2007 was first cultivated in the fertile crescent over 9500 years ago and in the indian subcontinent for at least 4000 years an annual grain legume or pulse chickpea sold into human food markets makes up more than 20 of world pulse production kostal and boersh 2008 world chickpea production is roughly three times that of lentil and global consumption as a human pulse crop food is second amongst legumes only to dry bean watts 2011 chickpea is predominantly grown in the indian sub continent india produces tenfold that produced by the second largest producer australia other key producers include pakistan turkey myanmar ethiopia and iran in 2014 global chickpea production surpassed 13 7 million tonnes mt including 9 88 mt in india and 0 629 mt in australia fao 2015 chickpea was first grown in australia in the 1970 s it is now a common winter crop grown predominantly in queensland desi type and new south wales but also to a far lesser extent in western australia south australia and victoria kabuli type there has been a significant increase in area sown to chickpea in australia during recent years since 2000 there has been a linear annual increase of area planted to chickpea 21 000 ha per year with an associated annual increase in yield of 0 02 tonnes per hectare t ha 1 across the five year period 2008 to 2012 yields averaged 1 13 t ha 1 producing 0 678 mt grdc 2016 in response to favorable climatic conditions and price australian chickpea production in 2015 exceeded 1 mt 0 969 mt desi and 0 043 mt kabuli from 614 357 ha pulse australia 2016 in 2016 australia was the largest exporting country of chickpea in the world eighty percent of australian chickpea is exported predominantly to india bangladesh and pakistan grdc 2016 chickpea is a high value crop that is well adapted to deep soils it tolerates heat and performs well under good soil moisture conditions and daytime temperatures between 21 c and 30 c with night temperatures near 20 c long taproots that enable access to soil water from greater depths than other pulse crops confer a relative drought tolerance making chickpea an attractive crop for rainfed farming kashiwagi et al 2015 sorghum is commonly used in rotation to cotton in the central highlands of queensland in australia as a winter crop chickpea acts as an integral component in the local cotton farming system slatter and lucy 2002 succinctly outlined why chickpeas have become increasingly important as a rotation crop in australian cotton farming systems i chickpea production is well suited to the predominant cotton soil types i e heavy cracking clays and it performs well in wide rows ii it effectively accesses soil moisture reserves and utilizes remaining water held in on farm storages that would otherwise evaporate iii it is relatively water efficient and provides a good return in terms of dollars per megalitre when irrigated to its detriment hulugalle et al 1998 identified some allelopathic effects of grain legumes including chickpea in cotton based systems such as reduced emergence growth lint yield and fibre quality additionally adherence to the planting window restrictions imposed on the predominately genetically modified cotton varieties often provides a restricted window between chickpea harvest and cotton planting which arguably impacts on pre plant preparations with a consequent negative impact on cotton yields in spite of this chickpea remains an attractive option for irrigated cotton growers chickpea is however particularly susceptible to waterlogging and consequently requires great care at crucial stages of plant development e g flowering to avoid incurring yield penalties through inappropriate irrigation management cowie et al 1995 yadav et al 2007 chickpea responds positively to drip irrigation and fertigation deolanker and berad 1999 under a dry tropical environment significant saving in water and fertilizer for chickpea production with drip irrigation has been reported in a number of previous studies deolankar and pandit 1998 leyva et al 2016 in pot experiments bhattarai et al 2008 reported a significant reduction of the negative impact of waterlogging on chickpea yield when irrigated with aerated water oxygation this was demonstrated by introduction of 12 by volume of air into the irrigation water delivered through a subsurface drip irrigation sdi system on a heavy clay soil vertosol which resulted in improved yield 11 in a controlled environment pot experiment the benefit of aeration was more pronounced with increasing emitter depth which again suggests that chickpea will respond to aeration of rhizosphere there is restricted diffusion of oxygen from the atmosphere at deeper soil depth the horizontal and vertical movement of soil moisture in a vertosol calls for deeper placement of drip tape which can reduce water loss due to evaporation from the surface therefore sdi in vertosols are generally placed at a depth of 300 400 mm from the surface however with increasing emitter depth the oxygen diffusion in the wetting fronts of the rhizosphere becomes limited and therefore plants are exposed to potential hypoxia abuarab et al 2013 additionally deeper emitter depth may need alternative or additional initial surface irrigation to ensure uniform germination and establishment of the crop mann 2006 sdi can substantially improve irrigation water use efficiency iwue by minimizing evaporative loss and maximizing capture of in season rainfall by a dry upper soil profile mchugh et al 2008 however in many especially heavier soil types sustained wetting fronts are created around the sdi emitter which can lead to hypoxia of the rhizosphere this effect it has been argued is very prominent in vertosols at higher irrigation rates especially in the summer bhattarai et al 2004 it is likely that this effect would be accentuated for drippers placed deeper in the soil such placement would encourage root growth at greater depth in the soil in a soil volume with a longer diffusive path to the atmosphere to alleviate this the impact of oxygation on the yield of broad acre chickpea crop was assessed this paper specifically examines the effects of aerated water at two irrigation regimes deficit and full irrigation for a subsurface drip irrigated broad acre chickpea crop in the central highlands of queensland australia 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

isbell 2002 the site consisted of 12 0 405 ha plots with existing subsurface drip irrigation at a depth of 40 cm and instrumented to be independently irrigated 8 plots with a drip tape spacing of 1 m 4 plots with a drip tape spacing of 2 m the site had been previously used for trials involving cotton 2004 05 2005 06 2 2 crop details sixteen rows 240 m long of chickpea variety moti desi seednet australia were sown on each plot on 26 may 2006 and again on 9 july 2007 this variety was specifically bred for the short duration hot central queensland winter and is characterized by early flowering pod set and high yield potential seeds were sown at a 6 cm depth into rows directly above the dripper tape in the 1 m tape spaced plots and offset 0 5 m either side of the 2 m spaced tapes using a tractor driven seed dibber a seed rate of 70 kg ha 1 was used in both years resulting in plant populations of 31 and 22 plants m 2 in 2006 and 2007 respectively the recommended planting population under irrigation is 35 40 plants m 2 no defoliant was required in either year crops were harvested on 8 september 2006 and 27 october 2007 2 3 experimental design treatments a factorial experiment of oxygation oxygated or non oxygated by irrigation regime 100 or 85 of daily crop evapotranspiration coefficient etc was employed across the 12 plots in a randomized complete block design with three replications the central 8 rows were used as datum rows with 4 buffer rows either side etc calculation employed a visual observation of chickpea phenological development stage to determine the appropriate crop coefficients kc allen et al 1998 these crop coefficients were then applied to the computed reference crop evapotranspiration eto supplied by the on site environdatatm wm2000 weather station environdata toowoomba in order to calculate the daily etc the weather station recorded rainfall temperature wind speed and direction and humidity at ten minute intervals and computed eto using the modified penman monteith equation meyer et al 1999 the oxygation treatments consisted of aerated water irrigation by entrainment of 12 of air by volume into the irrigation water based on previous research results reported by goorahoo et al 2002 and bhattarai et al 2004 achieved using venturi devices mazzei injector corporation usa model 1583 fitted to the irrigation line see picture 1 for

multi depth probes enviroscan located in each replicate i e 12 installations provided soil moisture data during the 2007 trial both loggers recording the probe data were disabled due to lightning strike in the reboot process some stored data that had not been adequately downloaded and back up was corrupted consequently soil moisture data presented are restricted to those which remained

treatment when moisture content reached refill point for the vertosol 22 mm h2o 100 mm 1 soil depth or 22 cm m 1 the soil moisture measured at 5 cm offset points from emitters at 40 cm depth from the soil surface was used as the basis for determining the irrigation all plots were irrigated independently according to the evaluation of the soil moisture for the specific plot soil moisture data from the field were assessed daily using internet based data transfer and the current data were used to manage irrigation scheduling the irrigation controller allowed for the variable rate irrigation for different plots according to the pre defined set point the volume of irrigation applied was based on calculated etc data supplied by weather station e g 85 of the calculated etc since application of the previous irrigation was delivered at each irrigation event to the 85 irrigation treatment 2 6 yield determination in 2006 all plants were sampled from two randomly selected one linear metre sample

replicate harvested 96 dap 27th october was modified in that a total 48 samples were collected 4 0 5 linear metre per replicate more but smaller sample plots larger sample sizes allowed better determination of the average values of these harvest data and avoided errors from testing a smaller number of possibly atypical samples all plants in each sample were counted separated into stem leaf and pods and then dried at 70 c to a constant weight pods and seed were subsequently separated and all weights recorded to determine dry weight partitioning and yield additionally the use of a load cell mounted sampling bin in 2007 enabled the measurement of total machine harvest yield to be recorded to 1 kg accuracy on a replicate basis dry weight is presented as grams per square metre g m 2 and yields are presented as either grams per plant g plant 1 grams per square metre g m 2 or when derived from commercial harvesting as tonnes per hectare t ha 1 water use efficiencies in different

following the method by allen et al 1998 2 7 statistical analysis data were subjected to analysis of variance anova using the generalized linear model glm for a randomized complete block factorial design as no block effects were detected between the one metre and two metre lateral spaced blocks blocks 1 2 and 3 respectively they were analysed as a complete block design and the pairwise

and 2007 was 15 0 c 0 4 31 6 c and 16 7 c 1 2 35 9 c respectively fig 1 and 2 both crops experienced similar levels of solar radiation 1720 vs 1592 mj m2 and heat units after planting huap 1344 vs 1429 huap the 2006 crop received 80 6 mm of rainfall fig 1 with over half of this in two major falls in june 33 8 mm on 17 dap and 8 2 mm on 26 dap the third major event consisted of 25 mm received over the period 41 43 dap in 2007 only 33 mm rain was received i e less than half that of the 2006 experiment mostly occurring in a single two day event with 20 mm on 5th september 58 dap and 6 2 mm

crop i e not including wet up irrigation events occurred only five in crop irrigation events occurred over the 2007 season and then all between 73 and 85 days after planting dap a period that coincided with flower set in crop irrigation delivered to the 85 etc deficit irrigation and 100 etc full irrigation treatments amounted to 37 mm and 43 mm in 2006 and 31 mm and 34 mm in 2007 table 1 in 2006 the 85 etc and 100 etc treatments received 147 mm and 153 mm respectively in 2007 the 85 etc and 100 etc treatments received a total irrigation of 121 mm and 124 mm total irrigation water respectively in 2006 pre planting irrigation 100 mm was required to achieve field capacity at harvest approximately 24 of pre planting total moisture remained in the soil profile across the experimental site 26 mm in the 85 etc and 25 mm 100 mm in the 100 etc treatment plots table 1 the 2007 experiment required slightly less 90 mm pre planting irrigation to achieve a full profile at harvest approximately 21 of pre planting total moisture remained in the soil profile across the experimental site 19 mm in the 85 etc and 17 mm 100 mm in the 100 etc treatment plots table 1 in both seasons the soil moisture remained between the refill point 22 mm 100 mm 1 to field capacity 42 mm 100 mm 1 in the soil until the start of flowering fig 3 and 4 a gradual reduction of soil moisture occurred in the 2006 following flowering from 2 july i e 38 dap to when the probes were removed 48 dap the influence of the early rain event of 34 mm at 17 dap 11th june 2006 and 20 mm on 58 dap 5th sepember 2007 on the soil moisture profile is also clearly seen fig 3 and 4 the graph indicating a rapid recharge of the profile to above field capacity 42 mm 100 mm 1 soil unlike the soil moisture status of the 100 etc treatment which returned to field capacity with each irrigation event soil moisture at 20 40 and 60 cm in the 85 etc treatment was depleted over the course of the trial the soil moisture status over the profile measured i e to 80 cm depth however did not drop below the refill point of 22 cm m 1 see fig 4 3 3 seed yield and dry weight partitioning there was a significant effect of oxygation on seed yield and above ground dry weight in the 2006 experiment table 2 the oxygation treatment produced a greater seed weight per square metre and a larger above ground dry weight than the no oxygation treatment 359 vs 283 g m 2 and 556 vs 439 g m 2 respectively however although yields followed the same trends in 2007 the response to oxygation was not significant table 2 seed yield averaged across treatments was 321 and 205 g m 2 in 2006 and 2007 respectively there was no significant effect of irrigation on yield table 2 and there were no significant interactions between oxygation and irrigation treatments identified for the dry weight and yield parameters in either years there were also no significant differences in commercial harvest yields in 2007 the only year for which the harvester yields were quantified table 2 3 4 irrigation water use efficiencies and soil moisture the oxygated crop in 2006 achieved a significantly higher iwui by 27 compared to the non oxygated treatment table 3 similarly in 2006 the gpwui of oxygated chickpea was also significantly higher by 27 however in the following year differences in either iwui or gpwui were not significant the effects of irrigation treatments on cwui iwui or gpwui were not significantly different in either season expect for a significant increase 18 in iwui by the 85 etc compared to the 100 etc treatment in 2006 table 3 there was no difference between oxygation treatments in either season for cwui table 3 total water used in 2006 and 2007 in different combination treatments under comparison are presented in table 1 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture consideration of soil moisture status throughout the whole profile is important for effective scheduling in some situations irrigators deliberately aim to maintain a full profile so as to provide a buffering capacity against times when their irrigation system may be incapable of delivering sufficient irrigation water to keep pace with plant extraction rates this strategy is often employed when the system operating capacity is incapable of meeting peak crop water use patterns sufficient buffering capacity also provides some insurance against possible irrigation system downtime e g pump malfunction electrical fault in irrigation schedule programmer information on soil moisture status across the depth can be useful in managing potential deep drainage however as shown in fig 3 summed profile soil moisture data do not directly provide assistance in determining what the soil moisture status is at the specific depths that are critical for optimum plant performance i e where the roots are data for 2007 soil moisture are presented as measured at 20 40 60 and 80 cm of the non oxygated chickpea irrigated at 85 etc and 100 etc fig 4 the increase in soil moisture due to the 26 mm of rainfall on the 5th and 6th september 58 59 dap and the five irrigations that occurred from 20th september to 2nd october 73 85 dap are clearly visible the full irrigation treatment 100 etc resulted in a wetter profile soil moisture at the 20 and 40 cm depths of the 85 etc treatment reducing to around 30 mm 100 mm 1 soil on a number of occasions whereas soil moisture of the 100 etc treatment at these depths remained above 35 mm 100 mm 1 with the exception of a single occasion when the soil moisture at the 20 cm depth fell to below this level just prior to the first irrigation on 20th september at both the 60 and 80 cm depths the 100 etc treatment soil moisture was at or above field capacity throughout the experiment remaining at this level to when the probes were extracted in contrast soil moisture at these depths in the 85 etc treatment started to decline in response to peak plant water demand i e when irrigation was applied at 20th september and was noticeably reduced from the first irrigation 2nd october until 12th october see fig 3 suggesting that chickpea roots accessed the water from deeper depth under deficit irrigation compared to full irrigation which could be associated with low soil aeration at deeper depths in the full irrigation regime this also highlights the need when scheduling irrigation to consider soil moisture status within the rooting depth along with moisture at specific depths and across the entire measured profile 4 2 seed yield australian average yield over seven years 2008 2015 of chickpea was 1 13 t ha 1 which is equivalent to 113 g m 2 the national average includes the yield of both irrigated and rainfed chickpea rainfed chickpea yields are highly dependent on the timing of the water stress in relation to phenological stage and timing of fertilizer application singh and bhusan 1980 supplementary irrigated chickpea with aerated water significantly increased yield by 27 in the first 359 vs the non oxygated 283 g m 2 and only 11 in the second year 216 vs 195 g m 2 table 2 there was no significant difference in yield response to irrigation treatment in either season the latter may be attributed to the similarity of the season long profile soil moisture status between the 85 etc and the 100 etc irrigation treatments fig 3 and 4 in both seasons there was little difference between the amounts of in crop irrigation water supplied to the two different irrigation treatments due to the plentiful and unseasonal in crop rainfall received consequently there was limited opportunity for the treatments to effect any difference in yields produced hirich et al 2013 demonstrated that deficit irrigation during the vegetative period for chickpea has positive influence on biomass yield the optimal crop stage in which deficit irrigation could be applied was the vegetative growth stage as the crop had a chance to develop its root system to be able to cover the plant needs for water and nutrient supply during the rest of the cycle and non stress conditions during the flowering and seed filling stages allow the plant to optimize its photosynthesis and carbon translocation therefore increasing its productivity in accord with this in the semi arid tropics during the dry season positive response to increasing rate of irrigation 10 1125 mm on biomass and grain yield 257 1957 kg ha 1 of chickpea was reported by dogan et al 2013 the aerated chickpea yield in both years in our trials are higher than the highest irrigation rate reported in that research the increase in plant dry weight and seed yield with oxygation of sdi is consistent with previous studies involving heavy soils and consistent with the interpretation that oxygen is limiting to root function in the wetting front around the emitters the observed increase in yield associated with the deeper emitter depths 25 and 35 cm vs 5 and 15 cm in the oxygation treatment bhattarai et al 2008 is consistent with increased oxygen limitation at greater soil depth due to increased diffusive resistance to gas movement the positive response of chickpea to oxygation reported herein from field trials as evidenced a by a significantly greater average yield and b by a higher gpwui with oxygation supports the conclusions from earlier research that oxygation mitigates hypoxic conditions associated with the wetting front of sdi in heavy clay soils the 2007 experiment followed a sorghum crop whereas the 2006 experiment followed cotton a delayed sorghum harvest due to late rains enforced a quick turn around and consequently bed preparation for the chickpea was not as comprehensive as is normally achieved the less than adequate incorporation of sorghum residue was regarded as the major contributor to the reduced chickpea plant stand by c 30 of the 2007 experiment compared to that of 2006 table 2 however beech and leach 1989 reported no significant difference in chickpea yield or dry weight per plant between a range of planting densities 14 28 42 and 56 plants m 2 and pulse australia 2016 also report that yields are relatively stable within a range of 20 40 plants m 2 in a report documenting yields from 12 chickpea crops with plant densities ranging from 12 to 61 plants m 2 yields were highly correlated with available soil moisture 90 of the variation was explained by this factor alone grains research and development corporation 2016 these reports suggest that chickpea like many other crops is capable of compensating for reduced plant stand densities by increasing yield per plant this was apparently not the case in 2007 but was in 2006 averaged yield for 2007 was approximately half of that achieved in 2006 but there was less than 10 difference in yield per plant between the two crops suggesting that yield was largely conditioned by plant density plants m 2 and also due to the previous crop in the rotation in this case sorghum it is difficult to compare yields of different planting densities when produced in different seasons there were two obvious differences between the two experiments in crop rainfall in 2006 was considerably higher than in 2007 table 1 and the later planting date of the 2007 crop was late planted for chickpea in central queensland recommended from 26 may to 9 july the recommended planting date is based on two main factors i reducing potential exposure to frosts and their impact on flowering pod set and ii avoiding exposure to high spring temperatures which can negatively impact on plant performance while the 2007 crop did experience several days where the minimum temperature fell below 4 c these days all occurred in the second week after planting and consequently would not be expected to impact on flowering or pod set two possible reasons to explain the apparent lack of compensation for reduced plant stand are proposed the podding period may have been too short to allow for compensation due to exposure to hot spring shut down i e when high daily temperatures in spring reduce the ability of the chickpea to function normally and or that the plants were unable to put on enough branches due to heat stress to carry the extra fruiting positions needed to compensate for missing plants cumming 2009 that the seed yield in 2007 was more reduced by 34 than was aboveground dry weight by 23 gives additional support to the poor podding in 2007 although the latter stages of the 2007 crop did experience higher temperatures than did the 2006 crop the maximum daily temperatures experienced were not excessive exceeding 35 c on only two occasions in the final weeks of the crop 82 88 dap chickpea can tolerate high temperatures certainly up to 30 c devasirvatham et al 2012 if there is adequate soil moisture pulse australia 2016 soil moisture probe data indicated that the soil moisture status was maintained at close to field capacity throughout the experiment until irrigation was ceased to encourage maturity 85 dap and in preparation for harvesting fig 4 overall daily mean temperatures and evaporation rates in the latter stages of the 2007 crop fig 2 were slightly higher than those experienced by the 2006 crop fig 1 but the differences were relatively small as seen by the similar total heat units after planting 1720 vs 1592 huap and total solar radiation 1344 vs 1429 mj m 2 received by the two crops attempts to explain the difference in yields between the two experiments did highlight the apparent scarcity of peer reviewed published information pertaining to irrigated chickpea plant population yield relationships a situation that needs to be addressed by future research 4 3 water use and water use efficiency as calculations of water use efficiencies presented as iwui gpwui and cwui are based on both water used and yield differences in either will be reflected in final wui values the 2007 in crop rainfall was less than half that received by the 2006 crop therefore a greater proportion of the water used by the 2007 crop was delivered by irrigation rather than received as rainfall in 2007 when averaged across all treatments irrigation water comprised 89 of total water used by the crop compared to 72 in 2006 table 1 the combined effect of a greater reliance on irrigation and significantly lower yields i e 36 lower than those produced in the 2006 crop table 2 resulted in the significantly lower iwui for the 2007 crop table 3 the gpwui of the two crops were comparable as reduced 2007 yields again averaged across all treatments were associated with reduced crop water use i e the ratio between yield produced and total water used of the two crops were similar table 3 the greater gpwui with oxygation in the first year was in agreement with results achieved in the sdi pot experiment where yield of oxygated chickpea irrigated at 35 cm depth was superior to that without oxygation bhattarai et al 2008 indeed in the same study gpwui was 21 higher in the oxygated treatment relative to control for the 35 cm emitter depth pendergast 2011 bhattarai et al 2008 also reported increased season long water use efficiency wuesl a term akin to gpwui for soybean and pumpkin in response to oxygation and significantly higher gpwui of pumpkin with oxygation at the deeper of the two emitter depths trialled 15 cm vs 5 cm however the magnitude of the beneficial effect was not so pronounced in the field the wuesl of oxygated chickpea irrigated at 35 cm emitter depth in the pot experiments bhattarai et al 2008 of 28 g dry seed per litre when calculated at the observed pot experiment plant density of 9 plants m 2 translates to 252 g m 3 considerably higher than the gpwui reported in either years of the experiment as all water supplied to the pot experiment was via irrigation it was appropriate that any comparison should be between the yield wuisl of the pot experiment and the gpwui reported for these field experiments improvements in wue can be achieved by practices that optimize the water use by the plants in the current trial the enhanced wue with oxygation was achieved by positive influence on the rhizosphere environment however enhanced wue has also been related to fertilizer management practices as deolankar and pandit 1998 and deolanker and berad 1999 reported doubling wue and increase in yield of chickpea to 2 25 2 29 t ha 1 by the use of liquid fertilizer in fertigation of drip irrigation water the oxygation of chickpea resulted in significantly enhanced yields and water use efficiencies in the first year that results in the second season reflected the trends of the greater yield and wue improvements by oxygation consistent to the first season results is encouraging there is clearly an indication that oxygation has the potential to contribute to increased chickpea production efficiencies this is a positive outcome that merits further investigation as chickpea are commonly used as part of growers irrigated cotton production systems accrued benefits of oxygated chickpea production efficiencies similar to those of cotton pendergast et al 2013 increase the attractiveness of sdi investment in sdi in cotton production systems has been limited by the perception that the potential increase in production has not been sufficient to justify the required capital outlay increased gross profit margins accrued via oxygation of sdi provide justification for investment of the capital outlay required and should contribute to increased industry adoption 5 conclusions aerated water irrigation oxygation for a broad acre chickpea crop increased seed yield by 20 likewise improvements in water use efficiencies were also evident for the oxygation treatment compared to the control these results provide evidence that oxygation has the potential to contribute to increased chickpea yield and water use efficiencies on a broad acre irrigated scale this positive outcome merits further investigation as chickpea are commonly used as part of growers irrigated cotton production systems the increased yield and improvement in water use efficiency could improve the profitability of cotton chickpea farming systems therefore a cost benefit analysis to determine the net profitability for aerated irrigation in cotton and chickpea is recommended
