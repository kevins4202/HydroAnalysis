18230,escherichia coli levels in recreational waters are often used to predict when fecal associated pathogen levels are a human health risk the reach of the chattahoochee river that flows through the chattahoochee river national recreation area crnra located in the atlanta metropolitan area is a popular recreation area that frequently exceeds the u s environmental protection agency beach action value bav for e coli a bacterialert program has been implemented to provide real time e coli estimates in the reach and notify the public of potentially harmful levels of fecal associated pathogens as indicated by surrogate models based on real time turbidity measurements from continuous water quality monitoring stations however e coli does not provide information about the sources of fecal contamination and its accuracy as a human health indicator is questionable when sources of contamination are non human the objectives of our study were to investigate within the park and surrounding watersheds seasonal and precipitation related patterns in microbial source tracking marker concentrations of possible sources human dog and ruminant assess correlations between source contamination levels and culturable e coli levels determine which sources best explained model based e coli estimates above the bav and detection of esp2 a marker for the esp gene associated with pathogenic strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis and investigate associations between source contamination levels and land use features three bacterialert sites on the chattahoochee river were sampled six times per season in the winter and summer from december 2015 through september 2017 and 11 additional stream sites synoptic sites from the crnra watershed were sampled once per season samples were screened with microbial source tracking mst quantitative pcr qpcr markers for humans hf183 taqman dogs dogbact and ruminants rum2bac the esp2 qpcr marker and culturable e coli at the bacterialert sites hf183 taqman concentrations were higher under wet conditions dogbact concentrations were greater in the winter and under wet conditions and rum2bac concentrations were comparatively low throughout the study with no difference across seasons or precipitation conditions concentrations of hf183 taqman dogbact and rum2bac were positively correlated with culturable e coli concentrations however dogbact had the largest r2 value among the three markers and the forward stepwise regression indicated it was the best predictor of culturable e coli concentrations at the bacterialert sites recursive partitioning indicated that bav exceedances of model based e coli estimates were best explained by dogbact concentrations 3 gene copies per ml cn ml detections of esp2 at bacterialert sites were best explained by dogbact concentrations 11 cn ml while detections of esp2 at synoptic sites were best explained by hf183 taqman 29 cn ml at the synoptic sites hf183 taqman levels were associated with wastewater treatment plant density however this relationship was driven primarily by a single site suggesting possible conveyance issues in that catchment esp2 detections at synoptic sites were positively associated with development within a 2 km radius and negatively associated with development within the catchment suggesting multiple sources of esp2 in the watershed dogbact and rum2bac were not associated with the land use features included in our analyses implications for park management include 1 fecal contamination levels were highest during wet conditions and in the off season when fewer visitors are expected to be participating in water based recreation 2 dogs are likely contributors to fecal contamination in the crnra and may be sources of pathogenic bacteria indicating further investigation of the origins of this contamination may be warranted as would be research to understand the human health risks from exposure to dog fecal contamination and 3 high levels of the human marker at one site in the crnra watershed suggests more extensive monitoring in that catchment may locate the origin of human fecal contamination detected during this study

outcomes in recreational freshwater bodies is often conducted by collecting water samples culturing escherichia coli in the samples and enumerating e coli colonies u s environmental protection agency 2012 however this method for monitoring fib has an 18 24 h minimum delay between potentially harmful conditions at the time of sample collection and notification to the public while not yet widely implemented surrogate models for e coli from continuous water quality monitoring data can solve the delay issue between sample collection and public notification of a potential human health risk lawrence 2012 the chattahoochee river national recreation area crnra has been a case study of the use of surrogate models for predicting e coli concentrations in recreational waters models of e coli concentrations based on water quality condition i e turbidity were developed for two usgs continuous water quality monitoring stations usgs 02335000 and usgs02336000 fig 1 on the chattahoochee river reach within the crnra by lawrence 2012 as part of the collaborative bacterialert program between the national park service nps chattahoochee riverkeeper and u s geological survey usgs the purpose of bacterialert is to monitor e coli levels in the recreational waters of the crnra and inform the park and public when levels exceed the u s environmental protection agency usepa beach action value bav for primary contact 235 colony forming units per 100 ml u s environmental protection agency 2012 when model based estimates of e coli concentrations exceed 235 cfu 100 ml the park cancels all nps sponsored water based activities e g rafting interpretive events river based trash clean ups water based recreational park concessionaires e g tubing and kayaking companies are also required to post the health advisory until the notice is lifted which can deter patrons from their establishments model based estimates of e coli concentrations are updated every 15 min on the bactertialert website https www2 usgs gov water southatlantic ga bacteria accessed oct 15 2019 for the public to make informed decisions about recreating in the park while model based estimates of e coli in recreational waters can provide a general indication when a human health risk exists based on usepa recommendations they do not provide source or spatial origins information for directing mitigation efforts further if the primary sources of fecal contamination are non human the reliability of fib as indicators of the risk to human health can be inconsistent calderon et al 1991 mcbride et al 1998 colford et al 2007 studies used by the usepa to develop the bav for e coli were based on gastrointestinal illness rates in people exposed to waters contaminated primarily by human waste from wastewater treatment plants u s environmental protection agency 2012 due in part to the host specificity of most viruses webby et al 2004 medina and garc√≠a sastre 2011 there the possibility that exposure to human fecal contamination is a greater human health risk than exposure to fecal contamination from non human sources as some studies have indicated colford et al 2007 schoen and ashbolt 2010 soller et al 2010b soller et al 2014 but see mcbride et al 1998 however few studies have directly investigated human morbidity rates associated with exposure to fecal contamination from specific non human sources but see soller et al 2015 escherichia coli are shed in the feces of many different warm blooded animals including wildlife and domesticated species therefore the health risk from exposure to contaminated waters with e coli concentrations above the bav may be different if the primary sources of fecal contamination are non human versus human determining the sources of fecal contamination in the crnra and sources associated with e coli levels above the bav may indicate if further research is warranted to accurately assess the human health risk from exposure to fecal contamination when recreating in the crnra microbial source tracking mst is an approach for determining sources of fecal contamination by detecting bacteria often by quantitative pcr qpcr that occur in the gastrointestinal tract of particular species which allows for the assessment of the presence or absence of enteric bacteria as well as identification of probable animal sources bradshaw et al bernhard and field 2000a meays et al 2004 beversdorf et al 2007 byappanahalli et al 2012a byappanahalli et al 2012b boehm et al 2013 the intestinal systems of different animals such as humans dogs and deer have distinct physiological and dietary signatures because of these differences the characteristics of enteric bacterial populations differ as well quantitative pcr is a sensitive molecular technique for detecting dna sequences of interest and when combined with fluorescently labeled probes can add additional specificity to an assay the species of the order bacteroidales have been established as useful indicator microorganisms for fecal contamination allsop and stickler 1985 because they are restricted to warm blooded animals make up a significant portion of the bacteria present in mammalian feces can be highly specific to particular species or taxonomic groups and are strict anaerobes and therefore indicative of recent contamination as most e coli is non pathogenic to humans the inclusion in an mst study of a molecular marker associated with a pathogen from here on referred to as a pathogenic marker can provide further insight to associations between mst markers and human health risks the goals of this project were to investigate spatial and temporal trends in sources of fecal contamination in the crnra identify potential primary sources humans dogs and deer and spatial or land use origins of contamination and determine sources and mst marker levels associated with exceedances of the bav for e coli and presence of a pathogenic marker the objectives of this study were to 1 compare levels of qpcr mst markers at bacterialert sites in the crnra by season summer high visitation and winter low visitation and precipitation condition wet precipitation within the 24 h prior to sample collection and dry little to no precipitation 24 h prior to sample collection to assess trends in sources of fecal contamination 2 correlate culturable e coli concentrations with qpcr mst marker levels to test for evidence of primary sources of e coli 3 investigate which qpcr mst markers best explain model based estimates of e coli concentrations above the bav and pathogenic marker detection and 4 investigate qpcr mst marker levels and pathogenic marker detection in tributaries throughout the crnra watershed to assess associations between marker levels and surrounding land use characteristics understanding contamination sources and spatial origins will enable park managers target outreach efforts within the crnra and facilitate discussions with local communities from which runoff originates that can impact waterways located within park boundaries further determining which markers best predict e coli bav exceedances from model based concentration estimates may help assess if the current usepa bav for e coli is an appropriate indicator of a human health risk in the crnra or if further research is warranted to determine more effective indicators of human health risk from exposure to contamination of non human sources 2 methods 2 1 study locations this study took place in the crnra watershed in georgia in the greater atlanta metropolitan area a total of 114 samples were collected over the duration of the study different sampling designs were used to study three bacterialert sites on the chattahoochee river usgs 02335000 usgs 02335880 and usgs 02336000 fig 1 versus 11 synoptic sites located throughout the crnra watershed on tributaries to the chattahoochee river fig 1 bacterialert sites were sampled six times in the summer june september and winter december march of water years wy 2016 october 1 2015 september 30 2016 and wy 2017 october 1 2016 september 30 2017 totaling 72 bacterialert samples synoptic sites across the crnra watershed were sampled once in the summer and winter in wy2016 and wy2017 with the exception of usgs02336313 and usgs02336360 which were not sampled in winter wy2016 totaling 42 synoptic samples synoptic sample locations were determined based on the presence of a usgs gaging station current or historic and with an approximately even distribution along the 48 mile stretch of the crnra on both sides of the river fig 1 water samples were collected from the approximated middle of the stream or river channel by hand dipping or with a bridge sampler in sterile 1 l bottles u s geological survey variously dated 2 2 water sample collection and bacterial enrichment and enumeration water samples were processed within 48 h of sample collection with samples kept away from light and refrigerated in the interim to collect bacterial dna 50 to 100 ml mckee 2019 of water were filtered on a vacuum manifold through a 47 mm polycarbonate filters with 0 4 Œºm pore size millipore bedford ma usa six filter replicates were collected per sample two of which were selectively enriched for enterococci with mei agar as described by usepa method 1600 u s environmental protection agency 2006 dna from filters enriched for enterococci were subsequently screened for a gene associated with pathogenic strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis see section 2 3 2 filters were stored in sterile tubes at 80·µíc until dna extraction to investigate correlations between mst marker and culturable e coli concentrations at the three bacterialert sites we used the most probable number mpn

enumerating e coli following myers et al 2014 sterile de ionized water controls were filtered in conjunction with each sample event to test for contamination during sample collection or laboratory processing and were treated identically to filtered samples in subsequent processing model based estimates of e coli were only available for two of the three bacterialert sites usgs 02335000 and usgs 02336000 over the duration of the study model based e coli concentration estimates were calculated for the time of sample collection at the associated site from models by lawrence 2012 with turbidity data from continuous water quality monitoring stations as turbidity measurements are recorded every 15 min turbidity values for times measurements were interpolated for samples collected between measurements 2 3 molecular methods 2 3 1 dna extraction for non enriched filters two filter replicates per sample were extracted and remaining filter replicates were stored as backups for enriched filters dna was extracted from one replicate with the other stored as a backup based on equipment availability dna was extracted using the qiagen dneasy powerlyzer powersoil dna isolation kit catalog no 12855 100 with bead beater homogenization or the qiagen dneasy powersoil dna isolation kit catalog no 12888 100 with sample homogenization via a vortex adapter following manufacturer s instructions s1 table these kits isolate genomic dna from environmental samples and can help remove pcr inhibitors that interfere with quantitative qpcr qpcr accuracy extraction blanks were processed with all batches of dna extractions to test for contamination during the dna extraction process 2 3 2 quantitative polymerase chain reaction for microbial source tracking markers samples were tested for pcr inhibition following bradshaw et al 2016 using the sketa22 assay haugland et al 2010 where a 1 5 ct difference or more between the mean ct values for the qpcr no template control ntc pcr grade water and sample was indicative of pcr inhibition pcr inhibition was not detected in any of the samples and therefore no further action to mitigate inhibition was necessary microbial source tracking markers hf183 taqman human associated marker table 1 green et al 2014a rum2bac ruminant associated marker suggestive of deer contamination in this study table 1 mieszkin et al 2010 and dogbact canine associated marker table 1 dick et al 2005 shibata et al 2010 were screened to detect possible sources of fecal contamination within the crnra we also screened the mei enriched filters for presence of the esp gene associated pathogenic strains of enterococcus faecium and e faecalis table 1 scott et al 2005 which can also be suggestive of human fecal material shankar et al 1999 scott et al 2005 mei enrichments began starting with samples collected on february 23 2016 mckee 2019 all markers were screened using qpcr on a quantstudio 3 applied biosystems extracted dna from non enriched duplicate filters were screened for the mst markers hf183 taqman dogbact and rum2bac each extracted dna sample was run with two qpcr replicates for a total of four qpcr replicates per sample with the exception of one sample for hf183 taqman two qpcr replicates and dogbact 3 qpcr replicates and the sketa22 assay which was screened on two qpcr replicates from one dna sample mckee 2019 because dogbact has demonstrated low specificity to dogs boehm et al 2013 samples that tested positive for dogbact were screened with a second dog source tracking marker dg3 green et al 2014b to verify dogbact results dna from filters enriched with mei agar were screened for esp2 table 1 a probe based qpcr marker for the esp gene two qpcr replicates were run for dna from one mei enriched filter replicate resulting in two esp2 qpcr replicates per sample reactions were carried out in 96 well qpcr plates sealed with optical 8 strip caps quantitative pcrs were carried out in 20 Œºl reaction volumes final concentrations of reagents in the assays were 1 Œºm forward and reverse primers 80 nm 6 carboxy fluorescein fam labeled taqmantm probe 0 02 mg ml bsa life technologies and 1x dna taqman fast universal pcr master mix hf183 taqman rum2bac esp2 and dg3 life technologies or 1x taqman environmental master mix dogbact life technologies and 4 Œºl of template genomic dna pcr grade water as no template controls standard concentrations of 10 to 106 target sequence copies of hf183 taqman rum2bac or dogbact or positive genomic dna control for e faecium no template controls were run in duplicate with all qpcr plates as were standard curves for all markers except esp2 for which positive controls were run with every plate quantification of target sequence copies for hf183 taqman rum2bac and dogbact was determined from a serial dilution standard curve of linearized control plasmid dna containing the targeted amplicon sequence minimum r2 values for standard curves was 0 99 for all markers except dogbact which had a minimum r2 value of 0 96 quantitative pcr efficiencies for all markers were between 80 and 110 with slopes ranging from 3 76 to 3 05 mckee 2019 hf183 taqman rum2bac and esp2 were run with a qpcr protocol of a 20 s 95·µíc hold followed by 40 cycles of a 95·µíc for 3 s and 60·µíc for 30 s dogbact was run with a qpcr protocol of a 2 min 50·µíc hold followed by a 10 min 95·µíc hold followed by 40 cycles of a 95·µíc for 15 s and 60·µíc for 1 min guidelines for determining the limits of quantification loq are based on forootan et al 2017 loq was determined by the lowest copy number with a coefficient of variation cv 100 œÉ Œº where œÉ is the standard deviation and Œº is the mean number of estimated gene copies less than 35 table 1 gene copy estimates were based on the equation x0 eamp b c t where x0 is the initial number of target copies in the qpcr eamp is the exponential amplification value which is 1 the amplification efficiency e g if the amplification efficiency is 0 94 eamp 1 94 b is the y intercept of the standard curve and ct is the cycle number when the amplification curve crosses the threshold line that distinguishes fluorescence intensity of a reaction from background levels 2 3 3 estimating microbial source tracking marker concentrations quantitative pcr data provide an estimate of the initial number of marker copies present in the qpcr reaction also referred to as the copy number per reaction cn rxn which is then used to calculate an estimated concentration of the bacterial marker in the original water sample cn ml the calculation from cn rxn to cn ml is a function of the volume of sample that was filtered the estimated percent of dna from the filter that was captured during the extraction process we assumed capture of approximately 50 of the total sample dna sample based on a 50 volume recovery after the homogenization step in the dna extraction the volume of solution in which the dna was eluted during the extraction process and the volume of dna added to the qpcr reaction when cn rxn estimates of qpcr replicates were less than loq including when the marker was not detected cn rxn 0 we accounted for the error in the cn rxn estimate by randomly selecting a value from a normal distribution centered around the cn rxn estimate the standard error of which was a function of the qpcr based estimate s1 s3 files when the randomly selected value was negative or greater than loq the distribution was resampled until a value between 0 and loq was obtained s1 s3 files the value selected from the distribution s1 table was used in subsequent analyses and treated as an accurate estimate of concentration because of the variation in volumes of water filtered across several filter replicates cn ml was calculated for both subsamples of the qpcr replicate for hf183 taqman dogbact and rum2bac then averaged by sample four reaction average and rounded to the nearest integer to obtain an estimated cn ml value for each sample to facilitate interpretation and discussion of results we used the threshold of 10 cn ml as a general determinant of high marker concentrations for all three mst markers as hf183 taqman concentrations 10 cn ml may indicate sewage contamination templar et al 2016 the esp2 results were reported as detected not detected because of the enrichment with mei agar where amplification at any ct in either qpcr replicate was indicative of esp2 detection for the sample 2 4 land use characterization factors affecting bacterial levels at chattahoochee river bacterialert sites may differ from those affecting bacterial levels at synoptic stream sites buford dam releases can affect flow and resuspension of sediments at the bacterialert sites which may mask possible land use associations with bacterial levels analyses of land use associations with mst marker concentrations and esp2 detections were therefore limited to synoptic sites the land use features investigated for associations with a given marker were based on hypotheses about the relationship between the source and the land use feature table 2 we investigated land use features at three different spatial scales 1 km 2 km and catchment wide mst marker correlations with land use proximal to the stream channel 1 and 2 km buffers would support detection of recent contamination from nearby inputs in contrast mst marker correlations with catchment scale land use may indicate more broad scale sources of contamination catchment areas were delineated for each synoptic site using streamstats https streamstats usgs gov accessed september 12 2018 we created 1 and 2 km buffers around our study sites in arcmap v 10 4 1 environmental systems research institute redlands ca and used the intersecting layers mask tool with our site specific catchment areas to create gis layers of 1 and 2 km buffers within the catchment for each site long and plummer 2004 for each buffer and catchment we calculated septic system density clarke and painter 2014 percent developed land devel homer et al 2015 classes 21 24 30 m resolution percent forested land forest homer et al 2015 classes 41 43 30 m resolution and percent open developed land which includes parks lawns and vegetation planted in recreational areas open homer et al 2015 class 21 30 m resolution percentage variables were arcsin square root transformed for linear modeling wastewater discharge density which was used as a surrogate for sewer infrastructure density was calculated for each catchment area as the number of wastewater treatment plants divided by the area of the catchment wwtp as was septic system density land use variables are heretofore presented as variablescale within a river basin downstream usgs station ids are numerically higher than upstream usgs station ids while usgs station id was not included as an independent variable in land use models of mst marker concentrations it was included as a numerical variable with spearman rank correlations against independent variables to investigate if land use features demonstrated an upstream downstream spatial pattern across the crnra watershed 2 5 statistical analysis hf183 taqman dogbact rum2bac and e coli concentration estimates were log10 transformed to reduce data skew for linear regression numerous qpcr marker concentration estimates were 0 or 1 cn ml for hf183 taqman dogbact and rum2bac after the random number generation for values below loq as described in section 2 3 3 to include qpcr marker estimates of 0 or 1 cn ml and e coli estimates of 0 or 1 colonies 100 ml in subsequent analyses we converted log10 1 to 0 001 and log10 0 to 0 0001 antecedent precipitation values for each sample were obtained through the usgs national water information system nwis https waterdata usgs gov nwis accessed august 29 2018 for sites without precipitation gages we used values from the nearest usgs precipitation gage s1 table 2 5 1 seasonal and precipitations patterns in mst concentrations to investigate seasonal and precipitation related patterns of hf183 taqman rum2bac and dogbact concentrations across the three chattahoochee river bacterialert sites we used precipitation within 24 h prior to of sample collection as our indicator of precipitation conditions any sites that received more than 0 01 inches of rain within 24 h prior to collection were termed wet samples versus dry samples we performed a three factor anova and student s t pairwise comparisons in jmp v 14 2 0 sas institute inc to determine how bacterial concentrations and sources varied by site season and precipitation forward stepwise regression with bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 aho et al 2014 in jmp was used to determine which source tracking marker concentrations were most closely correlated with e coli concentrations at the three bacterialert sites individually and combined 2 5 2 recursive partitioning of e coli beach action value exceedances to investigate which mst marker best explained bav exceedances based on real time gaging station estimates of e coli concentrations s1 table and the presence of esp2 we used the partition platform in jmp with a minimum split size of five data points recursive partitioning is a nonparametric data mining analysis that splits the response variable into two categories based on an explanatory variable cutting value the cutting value is determined with a partition algorithm that finds the explanatory variable split that maximizes the difference in the response frequencies between the two nodes of the split recursive partitioning of model based e coli estimates only included samples for which associated turbidity data were available at the time of sample collection resulting in 19 records for usgs 02335000 and 17 records for usgs 02336000 s1 table recursive partitioning of esp2 was conducted separately for samples from bacterialert n 63 and synoptic sites n 42 explanatory variables included in the analysis were untransformed concentrations of the three source tracking markers hf183 taqman dogbact and rum2bac 2 5 3 land use associations with mst markers seasonal variation and the magnitude and timing of rainfall can affect patterns of bacterial contamination in streams and rivers gentry et al 2006 shanks et al 2006 st laurent and mazumder 2014 to determine land use factors associated with bacteria levels across synoptic sites within the crnra watershed we first accounted for potential variations in bacteria levels due to season and precipitation we used generalized linear modeling to test combinations of antecedent precipitation 12 24 48 and 72 h preciptime and season to determine which were most strongly associated with abundances of each mst marker at synoptic sites hf183 taqman dogbact and rum2bac cn ml values were modeled with log normal distributions using the glm function in r v 3 4 1 r core team 2017 and esp2 detections were modeled with a negative binomial distribution using the glm nb function from the mass package venables and ripley 2002 in r top models were determined as the model with the lowest bic residuals from the top model for each marker were used to calculate a mean residual value mrv for each synoptic site which represented mst marker concentrations after accounting for the effects of season and precipitation mrvs were used as the dependent variables in forward stepwise linear regression in jmp with a minimum of one explanatory variable to determine which selected land use factors table 2 were most closely associated with bacterial concentrations hf183 taqman dogbact and rum2bac or presence esp2 table 2 at synoptic sites the lowest small sample size corrected version of akaike information criterion aicc burnham and anderson 2004 for models with at least one explanatory variable was used as the stopping rule all tests were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results a total of 114 samples were collected over the two year study period 72 of which were from the 3 chattahoochee river bacterialert sites and 42 samples from 11 synoptic sites across the crnra watershed s2 table from the 3 bacterialert sites combined there were 19 summer dry samples 17 summer wet samples 17 winter dry samples and 19 winter wet samples the number of samples with concentrations greater than the loq hf183 taqman 40 cn rxn

size from 7 to 257 km2 wwtp density within catchments ranged from 0 to 0 11 wwtp km2 and estimated catchment wide septic system density ranged from 1 to 164 septic systems km2 s2 table greater variability was seen at proximal scales of 1 and 2 km buffers than at the catchment scale for land cover variables devel open and forest e g devel1km ranged from 40 to 93 versus develcatchment which ranged from 55 to 89 s2 table devel and forest variables were negatively correlated correlations between land use variables and usgs station id indicated upstream downstream land cover spatial trends usgs station id was positively correlated with all spatial scales of devel and was negatively correlated with forestcatchment indicating trends of increasing development downstream towards atlanta and increasing forest cover upstream 3 1 verification of dogbact results we screened samples that were positive for dogbact with a less sensitive second dog mst marker dg3 which was found to be highly specific including the ability to distinguish dog from human fecal contamination green et al 2014b of the 37 samples that tested positive for dogbact 25 also tested positive for dg3 s1 figure and

condition or by site s3 table fig 2c the low number of samples with rum2bac concentrations 10 cn ml suggested that ruminant contamination was generally low esp2 was detected in 10 of 63 samples from bacterialert sites 9 of which were in wet conditions during the summer esp2 was only detected under wet conditions fig 3 concentrations of all three mst markers were positively correlated with e coli fig 4 dogbact was the most strongly correlated mst marker with e coli and was the only mst marker in the best predictive model of e coli concentrations s4 table dogbact was also the best predictor of e coli concentrations at each individual bacterialert site s4 table indicating the strong correlation between dogbact and e coli was not driven by a single site 3 3 recursive partitioning of human health indicators recursive partitioning showed that dogbact was the mst marker that best explained model based e coli bav exceedances r2 0 347 samples with concentrations of dogbact greater than or equal to 3 cn ml at usgs 02335000 and usgs 02336000 had an 87 probability of exceeding the e coli bav whereas samples with dogbact concentrations less than 3 cn ml had a 21 probability of exceeding the e coli bav the dogbact split correctly identified 10 of 15 instances of estimated e coli concentrations exceeding bav and 20 of 21 instances of e coli estimates below bav fig 5 a totaling 83 correct predictions at bacterialert sites esp2 detection was also best explained by dogbact but with poor predictive power r2 0 240 dogbact concentrations 11 cn ml in samples from bacterialert sites had a 56 probability of esp2 detection whereas the probability of esp2 detection in samples with dogbact concentrations 11 cn ml was only 8 the dogbact split at 11 cn ml for samples from the three bacterialert sites resulted in correct classification of esp2 detection for 55 of 63 samples 49 of which were for correct classification of non detects false positives and false negatives were split for the remaining samples fig 5b at synoptic sites esp2 detection was best explained by hf183 taqman but with poor predictive power r2 0 266 and a misclassification rate of 17 fig 5c there was essentially no difference in the likelihood of esp2 detection or non detection for hf183 taqman concentrations greater than or equal to 29 cn ml 52 probability of esp2 detection for hf183 taqman 29 cn ml at synoptic sites however hf183 taqman concentrations less than 29 cn ml were associated with a 93 probability of not detecting esp2 3 4 synoptic sample associations with surrounding land use the top season and precipitation models differed for all mst markers at synoptic sites and indicated higher hf183 taqman levels and esp2 detections in the winter and increasing rum2bac concentrations with increasing 72 h antecedent precipitation s5 table for all markers the sites with the highest marker level were in the downstream half of the crnra and on the west side of the crnra fig 6 the top land

health risk from exposure to fecal associated pathogens in recreational waters but standard methods for quantifying e coli have an 18 24 h delay between sample collection and public notification of potentially harmful conditions model based estimates of e coli from continuous water quality monitoring can reduce this delay by providing the public with notification of harmful conditions in real time however e coli occurs across a wide range of animal species and does not provide information about sources of fecal contamination which is critical information for developing effective mitigation and public outreach plans further while e coli has been demonstrated to be a relatively accurate surrogate of morbidity rates when the primary source of fecal contamination is human the health risk from exposure to non human contamination is poorly understood u s environmental protection agency 2012 viral pathogens which are often host specific webby et al 2004 are believed to be the primary causes of gi illness for swimmers in wastewater impacted recreational waters swimmers sinclair et al 2009 soller et al 2010a given the host specificity of many viral pathogens exposure to non human contamination in recreational waters may be a lower human health risk than exposure to waters impacted by human fecal contamination therefore assessing sources of contamination in recreational waters is important for directing outreach and mitigation efforts as well as determining whether further research is needed to accurately assess human health risks if the primary source of fecal contamination is not human our study has indicated that mst analysis can be combined with model based estimates of e coli concentrations to determine sources of contamination and mst marker concentrations predictive of e coli estimates that suggest a human health risk we investigated the frequency and magnitude of concentrations of three mst markers and one pathogenic marker across the crnra watershed to assess seasonal and precipitation associated patterns in the sources of fecal contamination impacting the watershed in addition we identified land use characteristics associated with the presence of mst markers in tributaries of the chattahoochee river located within the crnra a common challenge with mst markers is the lack of specificity or sensitivity we addressed this issue by using bacteriodales markers determined to be sensitive and specific for humans hf183mgb green et al 2014a and ruminants rum2bac boehm et al 2013 and supplementing a dog marker that has demonstrated high sensitivity and low specificity dogbact boehm et al 2013 with a more specific and potentially less sensitive dog marker dg3 green et al 2014b while we cannot rule out cross amplification with other sources by dogbact the strong correlation between dg3 and dogbact estimates suggest that dogbact was primarily detecting dog fecal material although neither marker has been tested on coyotes which do occur in the atlanta metropolitan area we also screened for presence of the esp gene associated with pathogenic strains of e faecium and e faecalis which is also generally associated with human contamination but has been detected in other species including pigs and dog at lower frequencies than human sewage or septage whitman et al 2007 among the three sources we tested for humans and dogs were detected most frequently the human and dog markers were detected at levels 10 cn ml at all but two study sites indicating that the origins of human and dog contamination are not specific to single locations in the crnra watershed dogs in particular appeared to be a primary contributor of fecal contamination in the crnra as indicated by a strong correlations with culturable e coli and as the best explanatory variable for e coli bav exceedances from model based estimates we found no relationship between land use variables and dogbact concentrations at the synoptic sites suggesting the variables we analyzed were not representative of the number or density of dogs within a 1 km or 2 km buffer or within the catchment more direct indicators of dog presence such dog park density may provide better representation of dog density in a given area dog contamination was higher in the winter and under wet conditions which is consistent with contamination caused by runoff we also saw higher levels of dog contamination at the middle and downstream bacterialert sites in winter wet conditions riedel et al 2015 also found elevated levels of dog contamination in the winter at topanga beach ca and attributed it to changes in owner behavior dogs were not allowed at topanga beach however the authors suggested that illegal dog walking increased in the winter as a result decreased lifeguard hours or lessened social pressure from fewer visitors to the beach in the winter while dogs are allowed in the crnra they are required to be kept on leash further investigation of the origins e g within the crnra dog parks or residential areas of dog fecal contamination may be warranted to determine if contamination is originating from within or outside the park human contamination levels were higher in samples collected during wet conditions when groundwater levels are above septic systems they are more likely to fail cogger and carlile 1984 and when groundwater levels are above sewer lines groundwater infiltration to sewer systems can occur wittenberg and aksoy 2010 thorndahl et al 2016 resulting in capacity exceedences for the systems as well as for treatment processes at wwtps modeling of land use features associated with the human marker suggested sewer infrastructure as plausible origins of human contamination in this study after accounting for the seasonal and precipitation effects on hf183 taqman concentrations at synoptic sites the human mst marker was significantly associated with increasing wwtp density in the catchment which we used as a surrogate for sewer line density this relationship with wwtp density was primarily driven by one site suggesting possible conveyance issues in that catchment while not significant it is worth noting that the top land use model for hf183 taqman indicated a near significant p 0 051 negative correlation between hf183 taqman and septic system density within 1 km peed et al 2011 found a strong negative correlation between septic and sewer line densities suggesting the negative correlation between hf183 taqman and septic system density may indicate a positive correlation with sewer line density hf183 taqman was frequently detected at levels below loq in samples collected during dry conditions suggesting chronic low levels of human contamination due to leaking sewer lines across the crnra watershed recursive partitioning results for esp2 at synoptic sites suggested that humans are a source of esp2 in tributaries in the crnra watershed while the correlation strength was relatively low the predictive split for esp2 detection at synoptic sites of hf183 taqman 29 cn ml is similar to the 32 2 to 42 3220 to 4200 hf183 gene copies gc per 100 ml 3220 to 4200 gc 100 ml bernhard and field 2000b seurinck et al 2005 determined by quantitative microbial risks assessments to be a benchmarks for 30 to 36 gastrointestinal gi illnesses 1000 swimmers swimming event in recreational waters contaminated with untreated and secondary treated sewage boehm et al 2015 ahmed et al 2018 this qmra based benchmark is essentially the same as the benchmark gi illness rates 36 illnesses 1000 swimmers swimming event used to determine the e coli bav threshold u s environmental protection agency 2012 suggesting further research is warranted to determine if and under what conditions do hf183 taqman concentrations 29 cn ml indicate a human health risk similar to the e coli bav humans as a source of esp2 at synoptic sites is further supported by the positive association between esp2 and development within 2 km upstream of the sampling location the negative correlation between esp2 and development at the catchment scale is counterintuitive as values of devel2km and develcatchment were positively correlated however the inverse relationship between esp2 and development at the 2 km and catchment scales may indicate that multiple sources are contributing to esp2 presence at synoptic sites while the esp gene occurs at only about a 30 rate in septic waste whitman et al 2007 the negative correlation between development and septic system density at the catchment scale supports the possibility that human contamination originating from septic systems further upstream in the watershed may be sources of esp2 the esp gene is even less frequent in dog waste 21 whitman et al 2007 however recursive partitioning of esp2 detection at bacterialert sites suggests dogs were a source of esp2 in the crnra therefore also possibly sources of esp2 in streams within the crnra watershed while levels of rum2bac were generally lower than hf183 taqman or dogbact infrequent detections of rum2bac 10 cn ml suggests that deer are occasional sources of fecal contamination in the crnra cha et al 2016 found that fecal indicator bacteria levels in forested areas increased in response to temperature under both wet and dry conditions potentially because of an increase in wildlife activity given that deer contamination in the chattahoochee river likely would be from surface water runoff we would expect to see an increase in contamination levels in wet samples if deer activity increased with warmer temperatures we would expect that rum2bac contamination levels would be highest in summer wet samples this pattern did not appear to be the case for deer in our study while rum2bac concentrations were positively associated with rainfall within the antecedent 72 h at synoptic sites they did not significantly differ across seasons or rain conditions at the three bacterialert sites of the three mst markers tested the dog mst marker was the best predictor of bav exceedances demonstrating that dog fecal contamination is in part periodically responsible for park cessation of water based activities the error in dogbact predictions of bav exceedances tended towards false negatives i e bav was exceeded but dogbact concentrations were below 3 cn ml indicating that when dogbact concentrations are greater than or equal to 3 cn ml e coli concentrations are likely greater than 235 cfu 100 ml the association between dogbact concentrations and esp2 detections in the crnra indicate that swimming in recreational waters contaminated by dog waste is potentially a human health risk further research into the human health risks from exposure to dog contamination would help the park determine if the e coli bav is an appropriate surrogate of human health risk when dogs are primary sources of contamination and if not to assess potential alternative surrogate indicators that provide more relevant indices 5 conclusions while several samples from sites within the crnra had human marker concentrations indicative of a risk to human health these levels were only detected in the off season for the park indicating a lower likelihood of guests being exposed to unsafe levels of contamination in the water than if these levels had occurred in samples collected during peak visitation season in the summer for sites outside the crnra human mst marker concentrations were associated with wastewater treatment plant density however this relationship was dictated primarily by one site suggesting possible conveyance issues in the associated catchment future studies may target this catchment to assess possible point or distributed sources of sewage impact because the dog mst marker was the best predictor of e coli concentrations in the crnra we assume that dog fecal material contributes to a significant portion of the fecal contamination at these locations while a supplementary assay provided evidence of specificity of the dog marker in this study previous studies have demonstrated low marker specificity indicating a need to be cautious about designating dogs as the major source of e coli in the crnra dog fecal contamination was the best predictor of usepa e coli beach action value exceedances indicating dogs are in part periodically responsible for park cessation of water based activities determining the human health outcomes from primary contact with dog contamination in recreational waters would assist the development of more

18230,escherichia coli levels in recreational waters are often used to predict when fecal associated pathogen levels are a human health risk the reach of the chattahoochee river that flows through the chattahoochee river national recreation area crnra located in the atlanta metropolitan area is a popular recreation area that frequently exceeds the u s environmental protection agency beach action value bav for e coli a bacterialert program has been implemented to provide real time e coli estimates in the reach and notify the public of potentially harmful levels of fecal associated pathogens as indicated by surrogate models based on real time turbidity measurements from continuous water quality monitoring stations however e coli does not provide information about the sources of fecal contamination and its accuracy as a human health indicator is questionable when sources of contamination are non human the objectives of our study were to investigate within the park and surrounding watersheds seasonal and precipitation related patterns in microbial source tracking marker concentrations of possible sources human dog and ruminant assess correlations between source contamination levels and culturable e coli levels determine which sources best explained model based e coli estimates above the bav and detection of esp2 a marker for the esp gene associated with pathogenic strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis and investigate associations between source contamination levels and land use features three bacterialert sites on the chattahoochee river were sampled six times per season in the winter and summer from december 2015 through september 2017 and 11 additional stream sites synoptic sites from the crnra watershed were sampled once per season samples were screened with microbial source tracking mst quantitative pcr qpcr markers for humans hf183 taqman dogs dogbact and ruminants rum2bac the esp2 qpcr marker and culturable e coli at the bacterialert sites hf183 taqman concentrations were higher under wet conditions dogbact concentrations were greater in the winter and under wet conditions and rum2bac concentrations were comparatively low throughout the study with no difference across seasons or precipitation conditions concentrations of hf183 taqman dogbact and rum2bac were positively correlated with culturable e coli concentrations however dogbact had the largest r2 value among the three markers and the forward stepwise regression indicated it was the best predictor of culturable e coli concentrations at the bacterialert sites recursive partitioning indicated that bav exceedances of model based e coli estimates were best explained by dogbact concentrations 3 gene copies per ml cn ml detections of esp2 at bacterialert sites were best explained by dogbact concentrations 11 cn ml while detections of esp2 at synoptic sites were best explained by hf183 taqman 29 cn ml at the synoptic sites hf183 taqman levels were associated with wastewater treatment plant density however this relationship was driven primarily by a single site suggesting possible conveyance issues in that catchment esp2 detections at synoptic sites were positively associated with development within a 2 km radius and negatively associated with development within the catchment suggesting multiple sources of esp2 in the watershed dogbact and rum2bac were not associated with the land use features included in our analyses implications for park management include 1 fecal contamination levels were highest during wet conditions and in the off season when fewer visitors are expected to be participating in water based recreation 2 dogs are likely contributors to fecal contamination in the crnra and may be sources of pathogenic bacteria indicating further investigation of the origins of this contamination may be warranted as would be research to understand the human health risks from exposure to dog fecal contamination and 3 high levels of the human marker at one site in the crnra watershed suggests more extensive monitoring in that catchment may locate the origin of human fecal contamination detected during this study

implemented surrogate models for e coli from continuous water quality monitoring data can solve the delay issue between sample collection and public notification of a potential human health risk

waters can provide a general indication when a human health risk exists based on usepa recommendations they do not provide source or spatial origins information for directing mitigation efforts further if the primary sources of fecal contamination are non human the reliability of fib as indicators of the risk to human health can be inconsistent calderon et al 1991 mcbride et al 1998 colford et al 2007 studies used by the usepa to develop the bav for e coli were based on gastrointestinal illness rates in people exposed to waters contaminated primarily by human waste from wastewater treatment plants u s environmental protection agency 2012 due in part to the host specificity of most viruses webby et al 2004 medina and garc√≠a sastre 2011 there the possibility that exposure to human fecal contamination is a greater human health risk than exposure to fecal contamination from non human sources as some studies have indicated colford et al 2007 schoen and ashbolt 2010 soller et al 2010b soller et al 2014 but see mcbride et al 1998 however few studies have directly investigated human morbidity rates associated with exposure to fecal contamination from specific non human sources but see soller et al 2015 escherichia coli are shed in the feces of many different warm blooded animals including wildlife and domesticated species therefore the health risk from exposure to contaminated waters with e coli concentrations above the bav may be different if the primary sources of fecal contamination are non human versus human determining the sources of fecal contamination in the crnra and sources associated with e coli levels above the bav may indicate if further research is warranted to accurately assess the human health risk from exposure to fecal contamination when recreating in the crnra microbial source tracking mst is an approach for determining sources of fecal contamination by detecting bacteria often by quantitative pcr qpcr that occur in the gastrointestinal tract of particular species which allows for the assessment of the presence or absence of enteric bacteria as well as identification of probable animal sources bradshaw et al bernhard and field 2000a meays et al 2004 beversdorf et al 2007 byappanahalli et al 2012a byappanahalli et al 2012b boehm et al 2013 the intestinal systems of different animals such as humans dogs and deer have distinct physiological and dietary signatures because of these differences the characteristics of enteric bacterial populations differ as well quantitative pcr is a sensitive molecular technique for detecting dna sequences of interest and when combined with fluorescently labeled probes can add additional specificity to an assay the species of the order bacteroidales have been established as useful indicator microorganisms for fecal contamination allsop and stickler 1985 because they are restricted to warm blooded animals make up a significant portion of the bacteria present in mammalian feces can be highly specific to particular species or taxonomic groups and are strict anaerobes and therefore indicative of recent contamination as most e coli is non pathogenic to humans the inclusion in an mst study of a molecular marker associated with a pathogen from here on referred to as a pathogenic marker can provide further insight to associations between mst markers and human health risks the goals of this project were to investigate spatial and temporal trends in sources of fecal contamination in the crnra identify potential primary sources humans dogs and deer and spatial or land use origins of contamination and determine sources and mst marker levels associated with exceedances of the bav for e coli and presence of a pathogenic marker the objectives of this study were to 1 compare levels of qpcr mst markers at bacterialert sites in the crnra by season summer high visitation and winter low visitation and precipitation condition wet precipitation within the 24 h prior to sample collection and dry little to no precipitation 24 h prior to sample collection to assess trends in sources of fecal contamination 2 correlate culturable e coli concentrations with qpcr mst marker levels to test for evidence of primary sources of e coli 3 investigate which qpcr mst markers best explain model based estimates of e coli concentrations above the bav and pathogenic marker detection and 4 investigate qpcr mst marker levels and pathogenic marker detection in tributaries throughout the crnra watershed to assess associations between marker levels and surrounding land use characteristics understanding contamination sources and spatial origins will enable park managers target outreach efforts within the crnra and facilitate discussions with local communities from which runoff originates that can impact waterways located within park boundaries further determining which markers best predict e coli bav exceedances from model based concentration estimates may help assess if the current usepa bav for e coli is an appropriate indicator of a human health risk in the crnra or if further research is warranted to determine more effective indicators of human health risk from exposure to contamination of non human sources 2 methods 2 1 study locations this study took place in the crnra watershed in georgia in the greater atlanta metropolitan area

number with a coefficient of variation cv 100 œÉ Œº where œÉ is the standard deviation and Œº is the mean number of estimated gene copies less than 35 table 1 gene copy estimates were based on the equation x0 eamp b c t where x0 is the initial number of target copies in the qpcr eamp is the exponential amplification value which is 1 the amplification efficiency e g if the amplification efficiency is 0 94 eamp 1 94 b is the y intercept of the standard curve and ct is the cycle number when the amplification curve crosses the threshold line that distinguishes fluorescence intensity of a reaction from background levels 2 3 3 estimating microbial source tracking marker concentrations quantitative pcr data provide an estimate of the initial number of marker copies present in the qpcr reaction also referred to as the copy number per reaction cn rxn which is then used to calculate an estimated concentration of the bacterial marker in the original water sample cn ml the calculation from cn rxn to cn ml is a function of the volume of sample that was filtered the estimated percent of dna from the filter that was captured during the extraction process we assumed capture of approximately 50 of the total sample dna sample based on a 50 volume recovery after the homogenization step in the dna extraction the volume of solution in which the dna was eluted during the extraction process and the volume of dna added to the qpcr reaction when cn rxn estimates of qpcr replicates were less than loq including when the marker was not detected cn rxn 0 we accounted for the error in the cn rxn estimate by randomly selecting a value from a normal distribution centered around the cn rxn estimate the standard error of which was a function of the qpcr based estimate s1 s3 files when the randomly selected value was negative or greater than loq the distribution was resampled until a value between 0 and loq was obtained s1 s3 files the value selected from the distribution s1 table was used in subsequent analyses and treated as an accurate estimate of concentration because of the variation in volumes of water filtered across several filter replicates cn ml was calculated for both subsamples of the qpcr replicate for hf183 taqman dogbact and rum2bac then averaged by sample four reaction average and rounded to the nearest integer to obtain an estimated cn ml value for each sample to facilitate interpretation and discussion of results we used the threshold of 10 cn ml as a general determinant of high marker concentrations for all three mst markers as hf183 taqman concentrations 10 cn ml may indicate sewage contamination templar et al 2016 the esp2 results were reported as detected not detected because of the enrichment with mei agar where amplification at any ct in either qpcr replicate was indicative of esp2 detection for the sample 2 4 land use characterization factors affecting bacterial levels at chattahoochee river bacterialert sites may differ from those affecting bacterial levels at synoptic stream sites buford dam releases can affect flow and resuspension of sediments at the bacterialert sites which may mask possible land use associations with bacterial levels analyses of land use associations with mst marker concentrations and esp2 detections were therefore limited to synoptic sites the land use features investigated for associations with a given marker were based on hypotheses about the relationship between the source and the land use feature table 2 we investigated land use features at three different spatial scales 1 km 2 km and catchment wide mst marker correlations with land use proximal to the stream channel 1 and 2 km buffers would support detection of recent contamination from nearby inputs in contrast mst marker correlations with catchment scale land use may indicate more broad scale sources of contamination catchment areas were delineated for each synoptic site using streamstats https streamstats usgs gov

by the area of the catchment wwtp as was septic system density land use variables are heretofore presented as variablescale within a river basin downstream usgs station ids are numerically higher than upstream usgs station ids while usgs station id was not included as an independent variable in land use models of mst marker concentrations it was included as a numerical variable with spearman rank correlations against independent variables to investigate if land use features demonstrated an upstream downstream spatial pattern across the crnra watershed 2 5 statistical analysis hf183 taqman dogbact rum2bac and e coli concentration estimates were log10 transformed to reduce data skew for linear regression numerous qpcr marker concentration estimates were 0 or 1 cn ml for hf183 taqman dogbact and rum2bac after the random number generation for values below loq as described in section 2 3 3 to include qpcr marker estimates of 0 or 1 cn ml and e coli estimates of 0 or 1 colonies 100 ml in subsequent analyses we converted log10 1 to 0 001 and log10 0 to 0 0001 antecedent precipitation values for each sample were obtained through the usgs national water information system nwis https waterdata usgs gov nwis accessed august 29 2018 for sites without precipitation gages we used values from the nearest usgs precipitation gage s1 table 2 5 1 seasonal and precipitations patterns in mst concentrations to investigate seasonal and precipitation related patterns of hf183 taqman rum2bac and dogbact concentrations across the three chattahoochee river bacterialert sites we used precipitation within 24 h prior to of sample collection as our indicator of precipitation conditions any sites that received more than 0 01 inches of rain within 24 h prior to collection were termed wet samples versus dry samples we performed a three factor anova and student s t pairwise comparisons in jmp v 14 2 0 sas institute inc to determine how bacterial concentrations and sources varied by site season and precipitation forward stepwise regression with bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 aho et al 2014 in jmp was used to determine which source tracking marker concentrations were most closely correlated with e coli concentrations at the three bacterialert sites individually and combined 2 5 2 recursive partitioning of e coli beach action value exceedances to investigate which mst marker best explained bav exceedances based on real time gaging station estimates of e coli concentrations s1 table and the presence of esp2 we used the partition platform in jmp with a minimum split size of five data points recursive partitioning is a nonparametric data mining analysis that splits the response variable into two categories based on an explanatory variable cutting value the cutting value is determined with a partition algorithm that finds the explanatory variable split that maximizes the difference in the response frequencies between the two nodes of the split recursive partitioning of model based e coli estimates only included samples for which associated turbidity data were available at the time of sample collection resulting in 19 records for usgs 02335000 and 17 records for usgs 02336000 s1 table recursive partitioning of esp2 was conducted separately for samples from bacterialert n 63 and synoptic sites n 42 explanatory variables included in the analysis were untransformed concentrations of the three source tracking markers hf183 taqman dogbact and rum2bac 2 5 3 land use associations with mst markers seasonal variation and the magnitude and timing of rainfall can affect patterns of bacterial contamination in streams and rivers gentry et al 2006 shanks et al 2006 st laurent and mazumder 2014 to determine land use factors associated with bacteria levels across synoptic sites within the crnra watershed we first accounted for potential variations in bacteria levels due to season and precipitation we used generalized linear modeling to test combinations of antecedent precipitation 12 24 48 and 72 h preciptime and season to determine which were most strongly associated with abundances of each mst marker at synoptic sites hf183 taqman dogbact and rum2bac cn ml values were modeled with log normal distributions using the glm function in r v 3 4 1 r core team 2017 and esp2 detections were modeled with a negative binomial distribution using the glm nb function from the mass package venables and ripley 2002 in r top models were determined as the model with the lowest bic residuals from the top model for each marker were used to calculate a mean residual value mrv for each synoptic site which represented mst marker concentrations after accounting for the effects of season and precipitation mrvs were used as the dependent variables in forward stepwise linear regression in jmp with a minimum of one explanatory variable to determine which selected land use factors table 2 were most closely associated with bacterial concentrations hf183 taqman dogbact and rum2bac or presence esp2 table 2 at synoptic sites the lowest small sample size corrected version of akaike information criterion aicc burnham and anderson 2004 for models with at least one explanatory variable was used as the stopping rule all tests were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results a total of 114 samples were collected over the two year study period 72 of which were from the 3 chattahoochee river bacterialert sites and 42 samples from 11 synoptic sites across the crnra watershed s2 table from the 3 bacterialert sites

ranged from 55 to 89 s2 table devel and forest variables were negatively correlated correlations between land use variables and usgs station id indicated upstream downstream land cover spatial trends usgs station id was positively correlated with all spatial scales of devel and was negatively correlated with forestcatchment indicating trends of increasing development downstream towards atlanta and increasing forest cover upstream 3 1 verification of dogbact results we screened samples that were positive for dogbact with a less sensitive second dog mst marker dg3 which was found to be highly specific including the ability to distinguish dog from human fecal contamination green et al 2014b of the 37 samples that tested positive for dogbact 25 also tested positive for dg3 s1 figure and

and e coli concentrations at bacterialert sites concentrations 10 cn ml of hf183 taqman dogbact and rum2bac were detected in 12 14 and 4 samples out of 72 samples from bacterialert sites respectively s1 table hf183 taqman concentrations were higher in wet samples s3 table fig 2 a dogbact concentrations were greater in winter and wet samples overall with significantly higher levels at the middle and downstream bacterialert sites under winter wet conditions compared to the most upstream bacterialert site s3 table fig 2b rum2bac concentrations were not different across seasons precipitation condition or by site s3 table fig 2c the low number of samples with rum2bac concentrations 10 cn ml suggested that ruminant contamination was generally low esp2 was detected in 10 of 63 samples from bacterialert sites 9 of which were in wet conditions during the summer esp2 was only detected under wet conditions fig 3 concentrations of all three mst markers were positively correlated with e coli fig 4 dogbact was the most strongly correlated mst marker with e coli and was the only mst marker in the best predictive model of e coli concentrations s4 table dogbact was also the best predictor of e coli concentrations at each individual bacterialert site s4 table indicating the strong correlation between dogbact and e coli was not driven by a single site 3 3 recursive partitioning of human health indicators recursive partitioning showed that dogbact was the mst marker that best explained model based e coli bav exceedances r2 0 347 samples with concentrations of dogbact greater than or equal to 3 cn ml at usgs 02335000 and usgs 02336000 had an 87 probability of exceeding the e coli bav whereas samples with dogbact concentrations less than 3 cn ml had a 21 probability of exceeding the e coli bav the dogbact split correctly identified 10 of 15 instances of estimated e coli concentrations exceeding bav and 20 of 21 instances of e coli estimates below bav fig 5 a totaling 83 correct predictions at bacterialert sites esp2 detection was also best explained by dogbact but with poor predictive power r2 0 240 dogbact concentrations 11 cn ml in samples from bacterialert sites had a 56 probability of esp2 detection whereas the probability of esp2 detection in samples with dogbact concentrations 11 cn ml was only 8 the dogbact split at 11 cn ml for samples from the three bacterialert sites resulted in correct classification of esp2 detection for 55 of 63 samples 49 of which were for correct classification of non detects false positives and false negatives were split for the remaining samples fig 5b at synoptic sites esp2 detection was best explained by hf183 taqman but with poor predictive power r2 0 266 and a misclassification rate of 17 fig 5c there was essentially no difference in the likelihood of esp2 detection or non detection for hf183 taqman concentrations greater than or equal to 29 cn ml 52 probability of esp2 detection for hf183 taqman 29 cn ml at synoptic sites however hf183 taqman concentrations less than 29 cn ml were associated with a 93 probability of not detecting esp2 3 4 synoptic sample associations with surrounding land use the top season and precipitation models differed for all mst markers at synoptic sites and indicated higher hf183 taqman levels and esp2 detections in the winter and increasing rum2bac concentrations with increasing 72 h antecedent precipitation s5 table for all markers the sites with the highest marker level were in the downstream half of the crnra and on the west side of the crnra fig 6 the top land

health risk from exposure to fecal associated pathogens in recreational waters but standard methods for quantifying e coli have an 18 24 h delay between sample collection and public notification of potentially harmful conditions model based estimates of e coli from continuous water quality monitoring can reduce this delay by providing the public with notification of harmful conditions in real time however e coli occurs across a wide range of animal species and does not provide information about sources of fecal contamination which is critical information for developing effective mitigation and public outreach plans further while e coli has been demonstrated to be a relatively accurate surrogate of morbidity rates when the primary source of fecal contamination is human the health risk from exposure to non human contamination is poorly understood u s environmental protection agency 2012 viral pathogens which are often host specific webby et al 2004 are believed to be the primary causes of gi illness for swimmers in wastewater impacted recreational waters swimmers sinclair et al 2009 soller et al 2010a given the host specificity of many viral pathogens exposure to non human contamination in recreational waters may be a lower human health risk than exposure to waters impacted by human fecal contamination therefore assessing sources of contamination in recreational waters is important for directing outreach and mitigation efforts as well as determining whether further research is needed to accurately assess human health risks if the primary source of fecal contamination is not human our study has indicated that mst analysis can be combined with model based estimates of e coli concentrations to determine sources of contamination and mst marker concentrations predictive of e coli estimates that suggest a human health risk we investigated the frequency and magnitude of concentrations of three mst markers and one pathogenic marker across the crnra watershed to assess seasonal and precipitation associated patterns in the sources of fecal contamination impacting the watershed in addition we identified land use characteristics associated with the presence of mst markers in tributaries of the chattahoochee river located within the crnra a common challenge with mst markers is the lack of specificity or sensitivity we addressed this issue by using bacteriodales markers determined to be sensitive and specific for humans hf183mgb green et al 2014a and ruminants rum2bac boehm et al 2013 and supplementing a dog marker that has demonstrated high sensitivity and low specificity dogbact boehm et al 2013 with a more specific and potentially less sensitive dog marker dg3 green et al 2014b while we cannot rule out cross amplification with other sources by dogbact the strong correlation between dg3 and dogbact estimates suggest that dogbact was primarily detecting dog fecal material although neither marker has been tested on coyotes which do occur in the atlanta metropolitan area we also screened for presence of the esp gene associated with pathogenic strains of e faecium and e faecalis which is also generally associated with human contamination but has been detected in other species including pigs and dog at lower frequencies than human sewage or septage whitman et al 2007 among the three sources we tested for humans and dogs were detected most frequently the human and dog markers were detected at levels 10 cn ml at all but two study sites indicating that the origins of human and dog contamination are not specific to single locations in the crnra watershed dogs in particular appeared to be a primary contributor of fecal contamination in the crnra as indicated by a strong correlations with culturable e coli and as the best explanatory variable for e coli bav exceedances from model based estimates we found no relationship between land use variables and dogbact concentrations at the synoptic sites suggesting the variables we analyzed were not representative of the number or density of dogs within a 1 km or 2 km buffer or within the catchment more direct indicators of dog presence such dog park density may provide better representation of dog density in a given area dog contamination was higher in the winter and under wet conditions which is consistent with contamination caused by runoff we also saw higher levels of dog contamination at the middle and downstream bacterialert sites in winter wet conditions riedel et al 2015 also found elevated levels of dog contamination in the winter at topanga beach ca and attributed it to changes in owner behavior dogs were not allowed at topanga beach however the authors suggested that illegal dog walking increased in the winter as a result decreased lifeguard hours or lessened social pressure from fewer visitors to the beach in the winter while dogs are allowed in the crnra they are required to be kept on leash further investigation of the origins e g within the crnra dog parks or residential areas of dog fecal contamination may be warranted to determine if contamination is originating from within or outside the park human contamination levels were higher in samples collected during wet conditions when groundwater levels are above septic systems they are more likely to fail cogger and carlile 1984 and when groundwater levels are above sewer lines groundwater infiltration to sewer systems can occur wittenberg and aksoy 2010 thorndahl et al 2016 resulting in capacity exceedences for the systems as well as for treatment processes at wwtps modeling of land use features associated with the human marker suggested sewer infrastructure as plausible origins of human contamination in this study after accounting for the seasonal and precipitation effects on hf183 taqman concentrations at synoptic sites the human mst marker was significantly associated with increasing wwtp density in the catchment which we used as a surrogate for sewer line density this relationship with wwtp density was primarily driven by one site suggesting possible conveyance issues in that catchment while not significant it is worth noting that the top land use model for hf183 taqman indicated a near significant p 0 051 negative correlation between hf183 taqman and septic system density within 1 km peed et al 2011 found a strong negative correlation between septic and sewer line densities suggesting the negative correlation between hf183 taqman and septic system density may indicate a positive correlation with sewer line density hf183 taqman was frequently detected at levels below loq in samples collected during dry conditions suggesting chronic low levels of human contamination due to leaking sewer lines across the crnra watershed recursive partitioning results for esp2 at synoptic sites suggested that humans are a source of esp2 in tributaries in the crnra watershed while the correlation strength was relatively low the predictive split for esp2 detection at synoptic sites of hf183 taqman 29 cn ml is similar to the 32 2 to 42 3220 to 4200 hf183 gene copies gc per 100 ml 3220 to 4200 gc 100 ml bernhard and field 2000b seurinck et al 2005 determined by quantitative microbial risks assessments to be a benchmarks for 30 to 36 gastrointestinal gi illnesses 1000 swimmers swimming event in recreational waters contaminated with untreated and secondary treated sewage boehm et al 2015 ahmed et al 2018 this qmra based benchmark is essentially the same as the benchmark gi illness rates 36 illnesses 1000 swimmers swimming event used to determine the e coli bav threshold u s environmental protection agency 2012 suggesting further research is warranted to determine if and under what conditions do hf183 taqman concentrations 29 cn ml indicate a human health risk similar to the e coli bav humans as a source of esp2 at synoptic sites is further supported by the positive association between esp2 and development within 2 km upstream of the sampling location the negative correlation between esp2 and development at the catchment scale is counterintuitive as values of devel2km and develcatchment were positively correlated however the inverse relationship between esp2 and development at the 2 km and catchment scales may indicate that multiple sources are contributing to esp2 presence at synoptic sites while the esp gene occurs at only about a 30 rate in septic waste whitman et al 2007 the negative correlation between development and septic system density at the catchment scale supports the possibility that human contamination originating from septic systems further upstream in the watershed may be sources of esp2 the esp gene is even less frequent in dog waste 21 whitman et al 2007 however recursive partitioning of esp2 detection at bacterialert sites suggests dogs were a source of esp2 in the crnra therefore also possibly sources of esp2 in streams within the crnra watershed while levels of rum2bac were generally lower than hf183 taqman or dogbact infrequent detections of rum2bac 10 cn ml suggests that deer are occasional sources of fecal contamination in the crnra cha et al 2016 found that fecal indicator bacteria levels in forested areas increased in response to temperature under both wet and dry conditions potentially because of an increase in wildlife activity given that deer contamination in the chattahoochee river likely would be from surface water runoff we would expect to see an increase in contamination levels in wet samples if deer activity increased with warmer temperatures we would expect that rum2bac contamination levels would be highest in summer wet samples this pattern did not appear to be the case for deer in our study while rum2bac concentrations were positively associated with rainfall within the antecedent 72 h at synoptic sites they did not significantly differ across seasons or rain conditions at the three bacterialert sites of the three mst markers tested the dog mst marker was the best predictor of bav exceedances demonstrating that dog fecal contamination is in part periodically responsible for park cessation of water based activities the error in dogbact predictions of bav exceedances tended towards false negatives i e bav was exceeded but dogbact concentrations were below 3 cn ml indicating that when dogbact concentrations are greater than or equal to 3 cn ml e coli concentrations are likely greater than 235 cfu 100 ml the association between dogbact concentrations and esp2 detections in the crnra indicate that swimming in recreational waters contaminated by dog waste is potentially a human health risk further research into the human health risks from exposure to dog contamination would help the park determine if the e coli bav is an appropriate surrogate of human health risk when dogs are primary sources of contamination and if not to assess potential alternative surrogate indicators that provide more relevant indices 5 conclusions while several samples from sites within the crnra had human marker concentrations indicative of a risk to human health these levels were only detected in the off season for the park indicating a lower likelihood of guests being exposed to unsafe levels of contamination in the water than if these levels had occurred in samples collected during peak visitation season in the summer for sites outside the crnra human mst marker concentrations were associated with wastewater treatment plant density however this relationship was dictated primarily by one site suggesting possible conveyance issues in the associated catchment future studies may target this catchment to assess possible point or distributed sources of sewage impact because the dog mst marker was the best predictor of e coli concentrations in the crnra we assume that dog fecal material contributes to a significant portion of the fecal contamination at these locations while a supplementary assay provided evidence of specificity of the dog marker in this study previous studies have demonstrated low marker specificity indicating a need to be cautious about designating dogs as the major source of e coli in the crnra dog fecal contamination was the best predictor of usepa e coli beach action value exceedances indicating dogs are in part periodically responsible for park cessation of water based activities determining the human health outcomes from primary contact with dog contamination in recreational waters would assist the development of more

18231,the wide use of silver nanoparticles ag nps inevitably leads to their increasing emission into aquatic environments however before their final deposition into sediments the ecological effects of ag nps in suspended sediment sps systems have not received much attention herein we investigated the influences of ag nps on denitrification in sps systems and explored the potential toxicity mechanism through microbial metabolism electron behaviors and isotope tracing added 15no3 after exposure to 10 mg l ag nps electron generation transport and consumption during denitrification were clearly inhibited which led to a decrease in the sps denitrification rate specifically the generation of nadh electron donor was significantly decreased to 59 92 86 47 with the ag nps treatments by affecting the degradation of glucose one of the major reasons for the decreased denitrification it also indicated that ag nps could affect nitrogen metabolism by influencing carbon metabolism in addition etsa was clearly inhibited by the affected electron transfer and reception during denitrification that was the most direct way in the microbial electron transport chain to affect the sps denitrification rate furthermore the particle size and concentration of sps affected the toxicity of ag nps the denitrification process in sps systems with a smaller particle size and lower particle concentration was easily affected by ag nps suggesting that sps systems dominated by clay particle size 3 9 Œºm or that less turbulence having low sps concentration might be at greater risk factor when exposed to nps thus it is important to understand the risks of pollutants such as ag nps to biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem function in sps systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification suspended sediment ag nps electron behavior isotopic tracing method 1 introduction due to special antimicrobial activity ag nanoparticles ag nps are widely used as broad spectrum antimicrobial agents as one of the most promising metal nanoparticles keller et al 2013 however their increasing usage unavoidably leads to greater ag nps release into aquatic systems gottschalk et al 2009 and sediment is regarded as the main sink of ag nps praetorius et al 2012 recently more and more studies have focused on the fate and environmental impacts of ag nps in water and sediment zhang

2008 majedi et al 2014 xiu et al 2012 however few studies have focused on the biological effects of ag nps in suspended sediments sps systems sps is very common in natural aquatic environments consisting with a complex mixture including clay minerals detritus fe mn oxyhydroxides phytoplankton zooplankton bacteria and so on √∂dman et al 1999 yao et al 2016 the environmental behaviors of pollutants such as heavy metals mehdi and mulligan 2016 organic pollutants yang et al 2018 and nps koetsem et al 2015 are strongly influenced by sps through adsorption or aggregation studies have demonstrated that the hetero aggregation of nps with sps in water sediment systems control the sedimentation of nps regardless of np type velzeboer et al 2014 and this is an important factor governing the fate of np in aquatic environments further affecting their ecological toxicity zhang et al 2016 as sps plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycles in aquatic systems horowitz 2008 and the toxicity of ag nps on many organisms has been studied zhang et al 2016 the ecological risks of ag nps to sps systems should be examined denitrification is a process including a series of reductions to convert nitrate no3 to nitrite no2 then nitrous oxide n2o and finally to nitrogen n2 hou et al 2015 these stepwise bio reductions are mainly driven by the electron generation transport and utilization processes in denitrifiers berks et al 1995 it is well accepted that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh is the major electron donor during denitrification and it is commonly generated through the metabolism of easily biodegradable carbon sources e g glucose li et al 2016 in the canonical denitrification electrons are produced from nadh via nadh dehydrogenase complex i and then they are transferred to denitrification enzymes through the electron transport chain including the quinone pool bc1 complex complex iii and cytochrome c cyt c chen and strous 2013 subsequently electrons are consumed by nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos to catalyze the reduction of no3 to n2 berks et al 1995 wan et al 2016 denitrification in sps has been widely observed in aquatic environments e g rivers lakes and oceans liu et al 2013 and it plays an important role in nitrogen removal in aquatic environments possibly comparable with the nitrogen loss by sediment denitrification yao et al 2016 the physiochemical factors of sps are closely related to denitrification performance for example a higher sps concentration usually has a stronger denitrification rate due to the higher denitrifiers contents jia et al 2016 however to the best of our knowledge the influences of ag nps on denitrification and other nutrients transformation processes in sps systems have not been reported yet electron generation transport and utilization are crucial for denitrification performance li et al 2016 the significant relationships between electron transport consumption and denitrification rate have been observed under different conditions such as pure denitrifying bacteria cultures wan et al 2016 sediments su et al 2018 and landfill leachate dong et al 2017 researchers have found that denitrifiers are sensitive to ag nps exposure and the inhibition on denitrification performance by ag nps was observed in natural and artificial ecological environments with the main focus being on the denitrification rate n2o emission microbial community structure genes abundance and transcription liu et al 2018 samarajeewa et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 however there is still a lack of a deep exploration of ag nps inhibition mechanisms on denitrification in sps systems from microbial electron behaviors a previous study showed that the activity of cytochrome c in bacteria was influenced after exposure to ag nps possibly signifying that ag nps will affect sps denitrification via electron behaviors in denitrifers zheng et al 2018 therefore a 72 h exposure experiment in sps systems was performed to explore the hypothesis furthermore the influences of ag nps on denitrification in sps systems with particles of different sizes and concentrations were also observed in detail the major objectives of this study were to i explore the effects of ag nps on the denitrification rate in sps through a 15no3 addition technique ii clarify the potential inhibition mechanisms of ag nps on denitrification in sps from electron generation transport and utilization and iii investigate the denitrification responses to ag nps in different properties of sps systems 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection the water and surface sediments samples were collected from the zhushan bay 31 3794 n 120 0249 e of taihu lake in october 2018 fig s1 taihu lake is the third largest freshwater lake in china which has been one of the most severely polluted lakes due to the amount of domestic sewage and wastewater being discharged yu et al 2012 the water samples were collected with the depth of 2 m using a poly methyl methacrylate water sampler uwitec austria the surface sediments were easily resuspended during fluctuation so 0 8 cm surface sediments were sampled by a gravity corer rigo co japan xia et al 2017 the parameters of the water ph oxidation reduction potential orp dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ by portable water analyzers hq 30d hach the properties of water and sediment samples such as the contents of no3 no2 nh4 toc avs and ph are presented in tables s1 and s2 the detailed methods are available in supplementary materials sm test s1 before the experiments the water was filtered through a 0 22 Œºm membrane the sediments were mixed to avoid heterogeneity and wet sieved to remove large particles and the background nitrogen nutrients were wiped off in sediments to avoid affecting sps denitrification in the next experiments hou et al 2015 three different sps grain size ranges 5 Œºm 5 50 Œºm and 50 200 Œºm were obtained based on our previous investigation and other studies on the sediment grain size distribution of taihu lake 5 Œºm 2 4 14 7 5 50 Œºm 53 1 82 6 50 200 Œºm 15 0 34 3 fan and zhang 2009 trace metal levels in sediments table s3 were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700 usa using the digestion method with the concentration of ag 0 10 0 04 mg kg dry weight determined to be negligible for the subsequent exposure experiments 2 2 preparation and characterization of ag nps ag np powders were purchased form sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the original average size was less than 100 nm based on the specification and this was also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s4800 japan imaging and x ray diffraction xrd philips x pert mpd pro netherlands cu ka radiation 40 kv 100 ma fig s2 before the exposure experiments 100 mg l stock solutions of ag nps were prepared by dissolving the corresponding ag nps powders in sterile di water with 30 min sonication at 400 w the concentrations of ag nps stock solution 95 78 mg l and the released ag less than 0 5 were evaluated by icp ms as described in our previous study liu et al 2018 in our study different sps systems were exposed to 1 5 and 10 mg l ag nps the used concentrations of nps may be greater than the environmental level approximately pg l Œºg l in water blaser et al 2008 fabrega et al 2011 gottschalk et al 2009 2013 however high concentrations are usually used to study the possible toxicity mechanism of nps and observations of no effect or minimal effects at high concentrations are also applicable to low environmentally relevant concentrations fan et al 2017 additionally the amounts of ag nps could up to 1 9 mg l in some polluted areas hoque et al 2012 hence the incidental or accidental release of high concentrations of ag nps into environmental systems should also be considered the aggregation and dissolution of ag nps in water samples were explored to better understand their behavior in aqueous systems the detailed steps and results are available in test s2 2 3 incubation experiments with ag nps the incubated chamber was made with poly methyl methacrylate column to simulate the sps system with an inside diameter of 8 cm and height of 40 cm fig s4 a rubber plug was sealed at the top of the chamber to form the airtight system and a long mechanical agitator 35 cm was fixed in the middle of the rubber plug to stir water and form the sps system in addition a 25 cm long glass tube was installed through the rubber plug to collect water samples and provide aeration from the middle of the incubated column in this study 1 g l sps with different sediment particle size distributions 5 Œºm 5 50 Œºm and 50 200 Œºm was set to explore the influences of ag nps on denitrification the concentration was formed based on the environmental sps concentration of taihu lake ranging from 6 to 606 mg l according to the data of wuxi taihu lake environment monitoring station and it has been used in other studies yang et al 2018 yao et al 2016 at the same time 5 g l sps was also used to explore the influence of the sps concentration on denitrifier responses which was within the range of the concentration of sps in estuaroes and other aqueous environments under larger disturbance xia et al 2017 previous studies have selected similar concentrations of sps to investigate the interaction between nps and sps van koetsem et al 2015 velzeboer et al 2014 before the addition of ag nps and 15no3 all sps systems in incubated columns were pre suspended for 24 h at 20 c 200 rpm to adapt the incubation systems and remove residual nitrogen nutrients in the sps systems a final concentration of 200 Œºm k15no3 55 15n shanghai research institute of chemical industry china was added into each system to afford enough nutrients for denitrification process additionally 10 mg l glucose was added to the water as a carbon source for denitrifiers which was essential for the complete reduction of no3 to n2 xia et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 subsequently in 1 g l sps of three grain size ranges 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm the ag nps stock solution was pulse injected to obtain 0 control and 10 mg l ag nps for each group at the same time at the same time 1 and 5 mg l ag nps were synchronously exposed in 1 g l 5 50 Œºm sps systems to investigate the effects of the ag nps concentration on their toxicity in addition another incubation experiment with a higher sps concentration was conducted to explore the influence of the sps concentration on denitrifiers responses with 5 g l 5 50 Œºm sps of 0 control and 10 mg l ag nps exposure in these experiments only 5 50 Œºm sps was selected due to the wide distribution in taihu lake furthermore an experiment on the effects of the adsorption of sps with different grain sizes on ag nps was also conducted and more details are available in sm test s3 three replicates were prepared for each group and all the columns were incubated for 72 h at 20 c 200 rpm jia et al 2016 during the incubation for the measurement of dissolved 15n n2 in the sps systems samples including water and sps were carefully collected every 24 h from each column into 12 ml gastight brown vials and spiked with 200 Œºl 50 w zncl2 to inhibit the denitrifying bacterial activities hou et al 2015 the production of 15n n2 29n2 and 30n2 via sps denitrification was measured by membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims hiden analytical uk hou et al 2015 after each sampling a 30 min agitation was conducted to guarantee the adequate oxygen in the sps systems the value of do was maintained at approximately 7 mg l during the incubation and the original accumulated n2 was removed the sum of the three measurements of 15n n2 24 48 and 72 h was the final concentration of 15n n2 in denitrification during the 72 h incubation time the denitrification rate was calculated by the total concentrations of 15n n2 according to previous studies liu et al 2018 thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 and the details are available in sm test s4 at the end of the experiment the sps were separated by gravitational settling and collected for the microbial measurements 2 4 key products and enzymes activities in microbial metabolism the key products and enzymes activities in glycolysis and the tca cycle were measured after ag nps exposure sps samples were collected after the experiment from each incubated chamber and then were ground with phosphate buffer saline pbs ph 7 2 7 4 using a tissue homogenizer next the homogenate was sonicated at 20 khz for 2 min and then centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min samarajeewa et al 2017 the above operations were performed at 4 c the liquid supernatant was collected for the following measurements the activities of glucokinase gk glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh pyruvate kinase pk succinate dehydrogenase sdh succinyl coa synthase scs and malate dehydrogenase mdh were measured according to the previous methods li et al 2016 test s5 the amount of intracellular nadh was measured by an enzymatic cycling assay as described in another study saltiel and kahn 2001 briefly the mixture of cycling assay consisted of bicine buffer ethanol edta thiazolyl blue phenazine methosulfate and alcohol dehydrogenase the reaction mixture was checked every 30 s at 570 nm and the concentration of nadh was calibrated with standard solutions of nadh the atp content was measured following the literature su et al 2018 twenty milliliters of trichloroacetic acid hpo4 2 were added into the sps samples to extract atp followed by sonification for 2 min and assessment using an assay kit in addition the level of pyruvate t aoc ros and rns were detected using a pyruvate t aoc ros and rns assay kit jiancheng bioengineering co ltd nanjing china in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions respectively 2 5 measurements of electron transport system activity at the end of the incubation period sps samples were collected and disposed as the described above the assay mixture was immediately used for the measurement of electron transport system activity etsa which can be used to evaluate electron transport and reception during denitrification broberg 1985 wan et al 2016 briefly after 0 5 ml 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride int and 0 5 ml nadh were added the mixture was incubated at 30 c for 30 min in the dark after which 0 5 ml formaldehyde was added as the termination agent next the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and then 2 ml methanol 96 were injected to collect formazan inf after collecting the supernatants the mixed inf extract was measured spectrophotometrically at 490 nm against a solvent blank more details in test s6 additionally the key enzymes in electron transport system the activity of nadh dehydrogenase complex i bc1 complex complex iii and cytochrome c cyt c were analyzed by double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assays elisas using a microbiological elisa kit feiya biotechnology china according to the specific interaction between an antibody and corresponding antigen the detailed steps are available in test s7 2 6 assays of denitrification enzymes activities and functional genes after the 72 h ag nps exposure experiment the activities of nar nir nor and nos were detected dong et al 2017 and the specific measurement process was given in test s8 in addition the copy numbers of narg encoding nar nirk encoding nir norb encoding nor and nosz encoding nos were quantified by qpcr tib 8600 canada to illustrate the effects of ag nps on denitrifying microbe abundance in briefly genomic dna was extracted using the e z n a tissue dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s based on the manufacturer s instructions the concentrations and purities a260 a280 ratio 1 5 of the extracted dna samples were analyzed by a nanodrop nd 2000 thermo fisher scientific usa miao et al 2017 the reaction mixtures used for pcr comprised 10 Œºl of aceq qpcr sybr green master mix 0 4 Œºl of each f and r primers 10 Œºm and 1 Œºl of template dna liu et al 2018 and the primers of genes and detailed thermal conditions are listed in table s4 standard curves were established using the primer amplified gene fragments 2 7 statistical analysis the statistical significance of changes was determined by a one way analysis of variance anova with the lsd post hoc test spss 17 0 p values of less than 0 05 were considered significant all tests were performed in triplicate and all data are represented as the mean standard deviation furthermore to easily compare the results among the ag nps exposure groups with different sps systems each control group was represented as 100 and the results of the nps exposure groups were represented as the percentage after comparison with the corresponding control in addition structure equation modeling sem was performed to explore the direct and indirect effects of electron transport systems on denitrification after ag nps exposure and the details on the development of this model are available in test s9 the linear model was fitted and reported as a standardized coefficient for each path the model was considered a good fit with a root mean square error of approximation rmsea less than 0 05 and comparative fit index cfi larger than 0 9 shipley 2000 3 results 3 1 responses of denitrification rate and antioxidant systems after ag nps exposure in 1 g l sps systems the isotopic tracing method was used in the study to explore the effects of ag nps on the denitrification rate in systems with different sps sizes and concentrations systems in addition the levels of ros rns and t aoc were measured to explore the responses of microbial resistance systems after ag nps exposure compared with their corresponding controls the denitrification rate was evidently inhibited by 10 mg l ag nps in the 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps decreasing to 62 22 3 85 74 84 4 74 and 81 53 3 18 respectively fig 1 a all p 0 05 at the same time the ros and rns contents were obviously increased in three sps size groups after 10 mg l ag nps exposure with an evident decline in t aoc level fig 1b all p 0 05 in detail ros amount was increased to 163 20 5 74 140 22 4 28 and 128 80 5 37 in the 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps respectively and the amount of rns was increased to 127 78 7 08 117 75 4 01 and 110 32 6 90 respectively t aoc was reduced to 56 53 5 79 62 30 5 06 and 80 91 6 48 in the 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps respectively the results showed that 10 mg l ag nps exhibited evident inhibition on the denitrification rate and antioxidant systems in sps systems regardless of sps size moreover a negative correlation between ros rns and t aoc was also confirmed in sps fig s5 thus ag nps would cause excess accumulation of ros and rns which could destroy the resistance systems of sps and be the main reason for the dramatic decrease in t aoc in sps systems 3 2 responses of electron production in glucose metabolism after ag nps exposure in 1 g l sps systems glucose was the main carbon source in sps systems in our study so glycolysis and the tca cycle were the major microbial metabolisms providing nadh electron donor for denitrification during incubation fig 2 broberg 1985 su et al 2018 thus the key enzymes in glycolysis gk gapdh and pk and the tca cycle sdh scs and mdh and the major productions during metabolism nadh atp and pyruvate were investigated compared with their corresponding controls the enzyme activities in the 5 Œºm sps were all clearly inhibited by 10 mg l ag nps fig 3 all p 0 05 in glycolysis the activity of gk gapdh and pk was decreased to 59 31 3 64 49 73 2 10 and 69 80 5 43 respectively and the sdh scs and mdh activity in tca cycle was decreased to 80 37 3 78 55 97 3 50 and 67 36 3 72 respectively similarly the activity of gk gapdh scs and mdh was evidently reduced in 5 50 Œºm sps fig 3 all p 0 05 decreasing to 73 27 4 49 63 85 7 09 63 36 3 63 and 83 61 3 99 respectively in contrast the pk and sdh activity in 5 50 Œºm sps was not affected at the same np exposure and it was even increased in 50 200 Œºm sps considering the above it could be concluded that pk and sdh had higher resistance to ag nps exposure in the 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps systems moreover both enzyme type and sps particle size were key factors influencing the responses of glucose metabolism enzymes to ag nps in this study the amounts of atp nadh and pyruvate were all obviously decreased by 10 mg l ag nps in the sps systems of three different sizes fig 3 all p 0 05 except that pyruvate in 50 200 Œºm sps was slightly improved which was possibly caused by the improved pk activity of the systems specifically compared with each control nadh amount in 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps was dramatically decreased to 59 92 6 30 78 11 4 83 and 86 47 3 27 respectively nadh is the important production in glucose metabolism dong et al 2017 and the level of nadh is directly related to the number of electron in denitrification after ag nps exposure the evident reduction of nadh was caused by the degradation of glucose metabolism which affected the efficiency of denitrification 3 3 responses of electron transport system after ag nps exposure in 1 g l sps systems accepting electrons from the electron transport systems is necessary for denitrification to conduct a series of reduction reactions fig 2 broberg 1985 su et al 2018 fig 4 showed the electron transport system activity etsa and the key enzyme activities in canonical electron transport systems in denitrifiers after exposure to 10 mg l ag nps compared with each control the activity of complex i complex iii and cyt c was evidently inhibited in the sps systems of three different sizes all p 0 05 furthermore compared with each control etsa in 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps was decreased to 55 37 4 10 68 50 4 39 5 and 79 74 4 34 which might because of the dramatic decrease of complex i complex iii and cyt c activities the results showed that 10 mg l ag nps remarkably inhibited the enzyme activities involved in the electron transport chain and dramatically decreased the etsa in denitrifiers which had negative effects on denitrification process in sps 3 4 responses of electron consumption in denitrification after ag nps exposure in 1 g l sps systems four main denitrification enzyme activities nar nir nor and nos and the corresponding gene abundances narg nirk norb and nosz were measured in the study fig 5 the results indicated that the nor activity in the three sps size groups was not affected after exposure to 10 mg l ag nps whereas nar nir and nos were evidently inhibited under the same conditions all p 0 05 specifically the activity of nar decreased to 79 27 2 10 82 24 3 46 and 90 73 3 26 in 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps respectively the activity of nir decreased to 83 21 2 83 88 81 2 34 and 93 77 3 63 in 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps respectively and the activity of nos decreased to 84 13 3 54 87 42 4 52 and 91 52 1 66 in 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps respectively in addition the abundance of narg and nirk was obviously declined in three particle size groups p 0 05 according with the decreased nar and nir in exposure groups however the activity of nor and the abundance of norb and nosz were less affected even after exposure to 10 mg l ag nps demonstrating that different denitrification functional enzymes and genes had different responses to ag nps exposure in the study possibly because periplasmic enzymes such as nir and nos are easily affected than enzymes located in the cell membrane such as nar and nor and because the biosynthetic pathways of riboswitches controlling gene expression were influenced to different extents chen and strous 2013 sullivan et al 2013 in addition it should be noted that after exposure to 10 mg l ag nps the antioxidant systems microbial electron behaviors and denitrification rate were most inhibited in 5 Œºm sps followed by 5 50 Œºm and 50 200 Œºm sps figs 3 5 indicating that sps systems with smaller particle sizes were more sensitive to ag nps and easily affected after ag nps exposure a possible reason is related to the adsorption ability of sps systems and more discussion follows in section 4 2 1 3 5 effects of the concentration of ag nps and sps 3 5 1 effects of the concentration of ag nps in our study different ag nps concentrations 1 5 and 10 mg l were set to investigate the effects of np concentration on their toxicity in sps 1 g l 5 50 Œºm sps the results showed that the inhibition by ag nps of the denitrification rate and microbial electron behaviors in sps was increased with the increasing np concentration with an inhibition order of 10 5 1 mg l ag nps figs s6 9 in general 1 and 5 mg l ag nps exhibited a slight increase and decrease in denitrification in sps respectively and 10 mg l ag nps showed the aforementioned evident toxicity exhibiting the hormesis that low doses stimulate and high doses inhibit liu et al 2018 tang et al 2017 in particularly although in glucose metabolism only gapdh activity catalyzing glyceradehtde 3 phosphate to 3 phosphoglycerate and producing nadh was evidently decreased by 5 mg l ag nps p 0 05 the amount of nadh in sps was obviously decreased fig s7 which confirmed the critical role of gapdh for nadh generation in the process 3 5 2 effects of concentration of sps meanwhile another experiment was conducted to explore the effects of sps concentration 1 and 5 g l on the toxicity of 10 mg l ag nps at the same sps size 5 50 Œºm the np inhibition of the denitrification rate glucose metabolism denitrification enzymes and gene abundance in the 1 g l sps systems were stronger than in the 5 g l sps systems table s5 for example etsa was decreased by 32 72 7 69 and 15 24 6 70 in 1 and 5 g l sps respectively the activity of gk was reduced by 25 30 5 42 and 12 85 3 62 in 1 and 5 g l sps respectively thus compared with the higher sps concentration the lower sps concentration systems experienced more inhibition from ag nps in denitrifying electron generation transport and consumption which resulted in a reduction in the denitrification rate twice that in 5 g l sps 4 discussion 4 1 effects of ag nps on microbial antioxidant systems after ag nps exposure in 1 g l sps systems t aoc is a useful index for the capacity of microbial communities to modulate the damage caused by enhanced production of reactive species such as ros and rns cui et al 2014 normal and effective antioxidant defense systems can eliminate accumulation of their production after 10 mg l ag nps exposure into sps systems the excessive accumulation of ros and rns could lead to an intracellular imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants and thus decreasing the t aoc level in sps microbial systems in addition the redox status disorder may further cause cellular macromolecules damage such as protein and dna leading to lower microbial activity hozayen et al 2019 su et al 2016 thus np induced excessive ros and rns in denitrifiers could directly react with enzymes related to electron behaviors and cause the deterioration of enzymes activities further affecting denitrification process in sps moreover the excessive ros and rns in denitrifiers could destroy the integrity of the cell membrane venditti et al 2013 the key denitrification enzymes are located on the cell membrane such as nar and nor or periplasm such as nir and nos chen and strous 2013 therefore in addition to directly damaging functional enzyme activity the excess ros and rns would damage the microenvironment of enzymes by attacking the membrane components that is one explanation for ag nps inhibition on denitrification in addition the concentration of released ag from 10 mg l ag nps was low test s2 and it had less effect on denitrification based on our previous study liu et al 2018 hence the impact of the released ag was not considered in this experiment 4 2 effects of ag nps on electron behaviors of denitrification in 1 g l sps 4 2 1 electron production in carbon source metabolism almost all enzymatic reactions in microbial metabolism require an electron donor and energy support carbon source metabolism in denitrifiers provides the primary electron donor and atp for denitrification su et al 2018 during glycolysis the first step glucose to glucose 6p and the last step phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate are irreversible reactions being catalyzed by gk and pk respectively fig 2 the critical role of gk and pk in glycolysis has been confirmed in previous studies berks et al 1995 hence the decrease in gk activity in the three sps groups of different sizes could directly inhibit the first step of glycolysis and negatively affect the subsequent process pyruvate is a connection between glycolysis and tca cycle in microbial metabolism and it plays an important role in complete carbon source metabolism song et al 2016 after exposure to 10 mg l ag nps the decreased amount of pyruvate would directly suppress the tca cycle and then influence the following nadh and atp generation the decrease in pyruvate in 5 Œºm sps was directly due to the np inhibition on pk activity ag nps cause the excessive accumulation of ros and rns and then affect the activity of pk by influencing enzyme functional groups li et al 2017 wang et al 2019 it is well accepted that nadh is the major electron donor for denitrification and the amount of nadh is very crucial for electron transport and consumption the catalysis of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate g 3p to 3 phosphogylcerate 3 pg is the only pathway to produce nadh in glucose degradation controlled by gapdh hence the obvious decrease in gapdh activity was one of the major reasons for the reduction of nadh in the three sps groups of different sizes otherwise sdh and mdh are two key enzymes for nadh production in the tca cycle and they were significantly inhibited by 10 mg l ag nps in 5 and 5 50 Œºm sps to different degrees being another reason for the decreased nadh in sps systems the importance of nadh in the denitrification rate has also been confirmed chen et al 2019 hence the obvious decrease in available nadh could directly affect the efficiency of microbial electron transport which is one of the important reasons for the degeneration of denitrification in sps systems furthermore the atp level was inhibited by ag nps through decreasing gk gapdh pk and scs activities in glycolysis and the tca cycle further leading to the insufficient energy supply for denitrification therefore 10 mg l ag nps could reduce the supplementation of electron donors and energy sources for denitrification by inhibiting related enzymes activities in carbon source metabolism in addition the toxicity of ag nps to microbial glucose metabolism in sps systems with a size 5 Œºm was strongest similar tendency was also observed in denitrification rate electron transport systems denitrifying genes and abundance after ag nps exposure the total adsorbed ag nps including ag nps and ag in the sps particles was increased with the decrease in particle size table s6 in the 10 mg l ag nps groups the amount of ag nps in 5 Œºm sps was significantly higher than in 50 200 Œºm sps p 0 05 due to the stronger adsorption ability and ionic attraction of finer particles mehdi and mulligan 2016 similar results confirmed that finer particle size sediments tend to have a relatively higher concentration of contaminants because of the greater surface area to volume ratios yang et al 2018 as the bioavailable concentration of ag nps is the critical factor for their toxicity zhang et al 2016 the different degrees to which ag nps inhibited microbial electron transport in the 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps systems were possibly due to the different particle sizes of sps therefore the exposure of ag nps might lead to more severe inhibition on n cycling in finer sps size systems and cause higher risks to aquatic ecology 4 2 2 electron transport systems a series of intracellular reductions in denitrification are propelled by electron transport and consumption the backbone of the electron transport system constitutes complex i complex iii quinone pool and cytochrome c broberg 1985 chen et al 2019 after exposure to 10 mg l ag nps the decreased activity of complex i directly influenced nadh degradation and the number of electrons because electrons are transduced from nadh in complex i after that electrons are transferred to complex iii via the quinone pool and finally to cyt c in the periplasm hence the dramatic decline in complex i activity led to less electron transport to complex iii being another reason for the decreased complex iii activity other than np directly destroying its activity furthermore cyt c is the important electron transporter in electron transport chains relaying electrons from complex iii to denitrification enzymes wan et al 2016 hence the decrease in cyt c activity reduced electron transport to denitrifying enzymes and inhibited electron utilization in denitrification considering that the activities of these core enzymes are highly related to electron transport systems activity esta the reduction of complex i complex iii and cyt c activity was the important reason for the decrease in etsa which then inhibited denitrification by destroying the electron transport furthermore the structure equation modeling sem was established to investigate the direct and indirect effects of electron transport systems for denitrification after ag nps exposure fig 6 and table s7 showed that only etsa had significant direct effects on denitrification p 0 05 the importance of etsa in microbial electron transport and denitrification process has been proven chen et al 2019 su et al 2018 after exposure to ag nps the dramatic decrease in etsa was consistent with the decline in the denitrification rate which confirmed the critical role of etsa in denitrification the sem results indicated that etsa could be the most important direct factor in electron transport systems for predicting denitrification in ag nps exposure sps systems in addition they showed nadh had the most indirect effects on denitrification further leading to the most total effects table s7 that was because nadh is the main electron donor in the electron transport chain and it is directly related to the efficiency of electron transport the significant direct influence of nadh on complex i and complex iii also confirmed the importance of nadh on electron transport enzymes fig 6 p 0 05 so the decrease of nadh reduced the denitrification rate by affecting microbial electron transport consistent with the conclusion that the decreased amount of nadh is an important reason for the degeneration of denitrification in sps systems 4 2 3 electron consumption in denitrification electrons are transferred to nar nir nor and nos via electron transfer systems and then they consumed by these denitrifying enzymes to complete the reduction of no3 to n2 zheng et al 2018 therefore the activities of denitrification enzymes play a major role in the denitrification rate in our study 10 mg l ag nps significantly inhibited activity of nar nir and nos but nor was less affected showing a higher resistance to ag nps exposure this might be because that nar and nor are located in the cell membrane where nir and nos are distributed in the periplasm chen and strous 2013 periplasmic enzymes were easily inhibited by some foreigner toxicants e g chlorothalonil possibly because these toxicants are first contacted by periplasmic enzymes su et al 2018 it is well known that nar nir nor and nos are controlled by the narg nirk norb and nosz gene zheng et al 2018 our results showed that the abundance of narg and nirk was decreased by ag nps in the three sps size groups and this is one of the important reasons for the decreased nar and nik activity previous studies have indicated that the copy number of narg was highly related to denitrification process and ag nps could inhibit the emission of n2o and n2 in denitrification by decreasing nirk abundance liu et al 2018 however no significant change in the amount of norb and nosz was observed indicating that ag nps might not directly influence nor and nos activity by affecting their corresponding gene abundance in sps systems in brief ag nps inhibited the electron consumption during denitrification by decreasing denitrifying enzymes activities and functional genes abundance causing the deterioration of denitrification in sps systems in addition the decrease of nadh production and reduced electrons transport to denitrifying enzymes might be other important reasons for the decreased denitrifying enzymes activities 4 3 effects of ag nps concentration and the role of sps concentration studies have confirmed that the concentration of ag nps directly determine their bioavailability as well as np toxicity in the environment zhang et al 2016 the inhibition effects of ag nps on sps denitrification were enhanced with increasing np concentration which confirmed the importance of np concentration for their toxicity in sps systems moreover the hydrodynamic diameter hdd of ag nps remained stable after 24 h fig s3 demonstrating that the aggregation of ag nps was not dissolved after they stabilized in the incubated water the higher concentration of ag nps in water usually leads to a larger aggregated size a previous study indicated that nps with a smaller particle size could easily enter or interact with microbes and cause more toxicity yang et al 2011 although 10 mg l ag nps had the largest hdds they still showed the strongest inhibition effect on denitrification compared with 1 and 5 mg l ag nps suggesting that the effects of the np concentration on the toxicity were greater than that of aggregated np size in the study furthermore our results also showed that the inhibition effects of ag nps on the denitrification rate and electron behaviors in 5 g l sps systems were less than in 1 g l sps at the same sps size 5 50 Œºm this is because that sps systems with a higher particle concentration contain more denitrifiers and have more efficient denitrification as well as a stronger microbial defense system jia et al 2016 in our study the denitrification rate in 1 and 5 g l sps was 2 90 0 15 and 5 21 0 34 Œºmol15 n kg 1 h 1 respectively the total abundance of denitrifying genes was 7 15 0 24 105 and 2 21 0 30 106 copies g 1 dw for 1 and 5 g l sps respectively studies have indicated that the complex microbial community structure and composition could resist nps through a rapid evolutionary adaptation and also reduce the damage to microbial function due to the stronger functional redundancy liu et al 2019 thus denitrification in sps systems of lower particle concentration had less resistance for ag nps exposure due to the simple microbial population and composition 4 4 environmental significance here we explored the effects of ag nps on denitrification in sps systems with different particle sizes and concentrations 10 mg l ag nps obviously inhibited the denitrification rate by influencing microbial electron generation transport and consumption ag nps destroyed the antioxidant systems of denitrifiers due to the excessive ros and rns which also decreased crucial electron related enzymes activities possibly by reacting with functional groups or destroying the enzyme microenvironments the inhibition of nadh electron donor generation and etsa in the electron transport chain by ag nps was the most indirect and direct way to affect the denitrification rate which could be used to analyze the extent of inhibition on denitrification or predict the denitrification rate in ag nps polluted areas notably the results also showed the close connection between carbon and nitrogen metabolism in sps systems ag nps inhibited electron generation of denitrification by affecting the amount of nadh in glucose metabolism therefore the effects of pollutants on the transformation of multiple biogenic elements and their interactions in ecology should garner much attention moreover according to the udden wentworth grain size classification scheme the sediment components could be roughly divided into clay 3 9 Œºm silt 3 9 62 5 Œºm and sand 62 5 2000 Œºm in addition stronger disturbances usually lead to higher sps concentrations in water sediment systems jia et al 2016 our results showed a significant inhibition by ag nps on denitrification in sps systems with smaller particle sizes and concentrations indicating that sps systems dominated by clay or less turbulence might be more sensitive to ag nps and at greater risk after np exposure which warrants more attention in aquatic environments 5 conclusions this study indicated that ag nps inhibited electron generation transport and consumption in denitrification by affecting microbial carbon source metabolism electron transport systems and enzymes activities as well as denitrifying genes abundance respectively in addition the denitrification process in sps systems with a finer particle size and lower particle concentration was easily affected by ag nps exposure furthermore we observed that in addition to directly affecting the denitrification process ag nps can affect nitrogen cycling by influencing other nutrient element cycling in sps such as carbon transformation overall the study focused on the impacts of ag nps on sps denitrification at the microbial metabolism and isotope tracing level the results provide a potential toxicity mechanism for

18231,the wide use of silver nanoparticles ag nps inevitably leads to their increasing emission into aquatic environments however before their final deposition into sediments the ecological effects of ag nps in suspended sediment sps systems have not received much attention herein we investigated the influences of ag nps on denitrification in sps systems and explored the potential toxicity mechanism through microbial metabolism electron behaviors and isotope tracing added 15no3 after exposure to 10 mg l ag nps electron generation transport and consumption during denitrification were clearly inhibited which led to a decrease in the sps denitrification rate specifically the generation of nadh electron donor was significantly decreased to 59 92 86 47 with the ag nps treatments by affecting the degradation of glucose one of the major reasons for the decreased denitrification it also indicated that ag nps could affect nitrogen metabolism by influencing carbon metabolism in addition etsa was clearly inhibited by the affected electron transfer and reception during denitrification that was the most direct way in the microbial electron transport chain to affect the sps denitrification rate furthermore the particle size and concentration of sps affected the toxicity of ag nps the denitrification process in sps systems with a smaller particle size and lower particle concentration was easily affected by ag nps suggesting that sps systems dominated by clay particle size 3 9 Œºm or that less turbulence having low sps concentration might be at greater risk factor when exposed to nps thus it is important to understand the risks of pollutants such as ag nps to biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem function in sps systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification suspended sediment ag nps electron behavior isotopic tracing method 1 introduction due to special antimicrobial activity ag nanoparticles ag nps are widely used as broad spectrum antimicrobial agents as one of the most promising metal nanoparticles keller et al 2013 however their increasing usage unavoidably leads to greater ag nps release into aquatic systems gottschalk et al 2009 and sediment is regarded as the main sink of ag nps praetorius et al 2012 recently more and more studies have focused on the fate and environmental impacts of ag nps in water and sediment zhang et al 2016 which depend on nps properties e g type coating concentration and size and environmental medium conditions e g ph dissolved oxygen ion strength organic and inorganic ligands blaser et al 2008 majedi et al 2014 xiu et al 2012 however few studies have focused on the biological effects of ag nps in suspended sediments sps systems sps is very common in natural aquatic environments consisting with a complex mixture including clay minerals detritus fe mn oxyhydroxides phytoplankton zooplankton bacteria and so on √∂dman et al 1999 yao et al 2016 the environmental behaviors of pollutants such as heavy metals mehdi and mulligan 2016 organic pollutants yang et al 2018 and nps koetsem et al 2015 are strongly influenced by sps through adsorption or aggregation studies have demonstrated that the hetero aggregation of nps with sps in water sediment systems control the sedimentation of nps regardless of np type velzeboer et al 2014 and this is an important factor governing the fate of np in aquatic environments further affecting their ecological toxicity zhang et al 2016 as sps plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycles in aquatic systems horowitz 2008 and the toxicity of ag nps on many organisms has been studied zhang et al 2016 the ecological risks of ag nps to sps systems should be examined denitrification is a process including a series of reductions to convert nitrate no3 to nitrite no2 then nitrous oxide n2o and finally to nitrogen n2 hou et al 2015 these stepwise bio reductions are mainly driven by the electron generation transport and utilization processes in denitrifiers berks et al 1995 it is well accepted that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh is the major electron donor during denitrification and it is commonly generated through the metabolism of easily biodegradable carbon sources e g glucose li et al 2016 in the canonical denitrification electrons are produced from nadh via nadh dehydrogenase complex i and then they are transferred to denitrification enzymes through the electron transport chain including the quinone pool bc1 complex complex iii and cytochrome c cyt c chen and strous 2013 subsequently electrons are consumed by nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos to catalyze the reduction of no3 to n2 berks et al 1995 wan et al 2016 denitrification in sps has been widely observed in aquatic environments e g rivers lakes and oceans liu et al 2013 and it plays an important role in nitrogen removal in aquatic environments possibly comparable with the nitrogen loss by sediment denitrification yao et al 2016 the physiochemical factors of sps are closely related to denitrification performance for example a higher sps concentration usually has a stronger denitrification rate due to the higher denitrifiers contents jia et al 2016 however to the best of our knowledge the influences of ag nps on denitrification and other nutrients transformation processes in sps systems have not been reported yet electron generation transport and utilization are crucial for denitrification performance li et al 2016 the significant relationships between electron transport consumption and denitrification rate have been observed under different conditions such as pure denitrifying bacteria cultures wan et al 2016 sediments su et al 2018 and landfill leachate dong et al 2017 researchers have found that denitrifiers are sensitive to ag nps exposure and the inhibition on denitrification performance by ag nps was observed in natural and artificial ecological environments with the main focus being on the denitrification rate n2o emission microbial community structure genes abundance and transcription liu et al 2018 samarajeewa et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 however there is still a lack of a deep exploration of ag nps inhibition mechanisms on denitrification in sps systems from microbial electron behaviors a previous study showed that the activity of cytochrome c in bacteria was influenced after exposure to ag nps possibly signifying that ag nps will affect sps denitrification via electron behaviors in denitrifers zheng et al 2018 therefore a 72 h exposure experiment in sps systems was performed to explore the hypothesis furthermore the influences of ag nps on denitrification in sps systems with particles of different sizes and concentrations were also observed in detail the major objectives of this study were to i explore the effects of ag nps on the denitrification rate in sps through a 15no3 addition technique ii clarify the potential inhibition mechanisms of ag nps on denitrification in sps from electron generation transport and utilization and iii investigate the denitrification responses to ag nps in different properties of sps systems 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection the water and surface sediments samples were collected from the zhushan bay 31 3794 n 120 0249 e of taihu lake in october 2018 fig s1 taihu lake is the third largest freshwater lake in china which has been one of the most severely polluted lakes due to the amount of domestic sewage and wastewater being discharged yu et al 2012 the water samples were collected with the depth of 2 m using a poly methyl methacrylate water sampler uwitec austria the surface sediments were easily resuspended during fluctuation so 0 8 cm surface sediments were sampled by a gravity corer rigo co japan xia et al 2017 the parameters of the water ph oxidation reduction potential orp dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ by portable water analyzers hq 30d hach the properties of water and sediment samples such as the contents of no3 no2 nh4 toc avs and ph are presented in tables s1 and s2 the detailed methods are available in supplementary materials sm test s1 before the experiments the water was filtered through a 0 22 Œºm membrane the sediments were mixed to avoid heterogeneity and wet sieved to remove large particles and the background nitrogen nutrients were wiped off in sediments to avoid affecting sps denitrification in the next experiments hou et al 2015 three different sps grain size ranges 5 Œºm 5 50 Œºm and 50 200 Œºm were obtained based on our previous investigation and other studies on the sediment grain size distribution of taihu lake 5 Œºm 2 4 14 7 5 50 Œºm 53 1 82 6 50 200 Œºm 15 0 34 3 fan and zhang 2009 trace metal levels in sediments table s3 were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700 usa using the digestion method with the concentration of ag 0 10 0 04 mg kg dry weight determined to be negligible for the subsequent exposure experiments 2 2 preparation and characterization of ag nps ag np powders were purchased form sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the original average size was less than 100 nm based on the specification and this was also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s4800 japan imaging and x ray diffraction xrd philips x pert mpd pro netherlands cu ka radiation 40 kv 100 ma fig s2 before the exposure experiments 100 mg l stock solutions of ag nps were prepared by dissolving the corresponding ag nps powders in sterile di water with 30 min sonication at 400 w the concentrations of ag nps stock solution 95 78 mg l and the released ag less than 0 5 were evaluated by icp ms as described in our previous study liu et al 2018 in our study different sps systems were exposed to 1 5 and 10 mg l ag nps the used concentrations of nps may be greater than the environmental level approximately pg l Œºg l in water blaser et al 2008 fabrega et al 2011 gottschalk et al 2009 2013 however high concentrations are usually used to study the possible toxicity mechanism of nps and observations of no effect or minimal effects at high concentrations are also applicable to low environmentally relevant concentrations fan et al 2017 additionally the amounts of ag nps could up to 1 9 mg l in some polluted areas hoque et al 2012 hence the incidental or accidental release of high concentrations of ag nps into environmental systems should also be considered the aggregation and dissolution of ag nps in water samples were explored to better understand their behavior in aqueous systems the detailed steps and results are available in test s2 2 3 incubation experiments with ag nps the incubated chamber was made with poly methyl methacrylate column to simulate the sps system with an inside diameter of 8 cm and height of 40 cm fig s4 a rubber plug was sealed at the top of the chamber to form the airtight system and a long mechanical agitator 35 cm was fixed in the middle of the rubber plug to stir water and form the sps system in addition a 25 cm long glass tube was installed through the rubber plug to collect water samples and provide aeration from the middle of the incubated column in this study 1 g l sps with different sediment particle size distributions 5 Œºm 5 50 Œºm and 50 200 Œºm was set to explore the influences of ag nps on denitrification the concentration was formed based on the environmental sps concentration of taihu lake ranging from 6 to 606 mg l according to the data of wuxi taihu lake environment monitoring station and it has been used in other studies yang et al 2018 yao et al 2016 at the same time 5 g l sps was also used to explore the influence of the sps concentration on denitrifier responses which was within the range of the concentration of sps in estuaroes and other aqueous environments under larger disturbance xia et al 2017 previous studies have selected similar concentrations of sps to investigate the interaction between nps and sps van koetsem et al 2015 velzeboer et al 2014 before the addition of ag nps and 15no3 all sps systems in incubated columns were pre suspended for 24 h at 20 c 200 rpm to adapt the incubation systems and remove residual nitrogen nutrients in the sps systems a final concentration of 200 Œºm k15no3 55 15n shanghai research institute of chemical industry china was added into each system to afford enough nutrients for denitrification process additionally 10 mg l glucose was added to the water as a carbon source for denitrifiers which was essential for the complete reduction of no3 to n2 xia et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 subsequently in 1 g l sps of three grain size ranges 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm the ag nps stock solution was pulse injected to obtain 0 control and 10 mg l ag nps for each group at the same time at the same time 1 and 5 mg l ag nps were synchronously exposed in 1 g l 5 50 Œºm sps systems to investigate the effects of the ag nps concentration on their toxicity in addition another incubation experiment with a higher sps concentration was conducted to explore the influence of the sps concentration on denitrifiers responses with 5 g l 5 50 Œºm sps of 0 control and 10 mg l ag nps exposure in these experiments only 5 50 Œºm sps was selected due to the wide distribution in taihu lake furthermore an experiment on the effects of the adsorption of sps with different grain sizes on ag nps was also conducted and more details are available in sm test s3 three replicates were prepared for each group and all the columns were incubated for 72 h at 20 c 200 rpm jia et al 2016 during the incubation for the measurement of dissolved 15n n2 in the sps systems samples including water and sps were carefully collected every 24 h from each column into 12 ml gastight brown vials and spiked with 200 Œºl 50 w zncl2 to inhibit the denitrifying bacterial activities hou et al 2015 the production of 15n n2 29n2 and 30n2 via sps denitrification was measured by membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims hiden analytical uk hou et al 2015 after each sampling a 30 min agitation was conducted to guarantee the adequate oxygen in the sps systems the value of do was maintained at approximately 7 mg l during the incubation and the original accumulated n2 was removed the sum of the three measurements of 15n n2 24 48 and 72 h was the final concentration of 15n n2 in denitrification during the 72 h incubation time the denitrification rate was calculated by the total concentrations of 15n n2 according to previous studies liu et al 2018 thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 and the details are available in sm test s4 at the end of the experiment the sps were separated by gravitational settling and collected for the microbial measurements 2 4 key products and enzymes activities in microbial metabolism the key products and enzymes activities in glycolysis and the tca cycle were measured after ag nps exposure sps samples were collected after the experiment from each incubated chamber and then were ground with phosphate buffer saline pbs ph 7 2 7 4 using a tissue homogenizer next the homogenate was sonicated at 20 khz for 2 min and then centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min samarajeewa et al 2017 the above operations were performed at 4 c the liquid supernatant was collected for the following measurements the activities of glucokinase gk glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh pyruvate kinase pk succinate dehydrogenase sdh succinyl coa synthase scs and malate dehydrogenase mdh were measured according to the previous methods li et al 2016 test s5 the amount of intracellular nadh was measured by an enzymatic cycling assay as described in another study saltiel and kahn 2001 briefly the mixture of cycling assay consisted of bicine buffer ethanol edta thiazolyl blue phenazine methosulfate and alcohol dehydrogenase the reaction mixture was checked every 30 s at 570 nm and the concentration of nadh was calibrated with standard solutions of nadh the atp content was measured following the literature su et al 2018 twenty milliliters of trichloroacetic acid hpo4 2 were added into the sps samples to extract atp followed by sonification for 2 min and assessment using an assay kit in addition the level of pyruvate t aoc ros and rns were detected using a pyruvate t aoc ros and rns assay kit jiancheng bioengineering co ltd nanjing china in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions respectively 2 5 measurements of electron transport system activity at the end of the incubation period sps samples were collected and disposed as the described above the assay mixture was immediately used for the measurement of electron transport system activity etsa which can be used to evaluate electron transport and reception during denitrification broberg 1985 wan et al 2016 briefly after 0 5 ml 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride int and 0 5 ml nadh were added the mixture was incubated at 30 c for 30 min in the dark after which 0 5 ml formaldehyde was added as the termination agent next the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and then 2 ml methanol 96 were injected to collect formazan inf after collecting the supernatants the mixed inf extract was measured spectrophotometrically at 490 nm against a solvent blank more details in test s6 additionally the key enzymes in electron transport system the activity of nadh dehydrogenase complex i bc1 complex complex iii and cytochrome c cyt c were analyzed by double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assays elisas using a microbiological elisa kit feiya biotechnology china according to the specific interaction between an antibody and corresponding antigen the detailed steps are available in test s7 2 6 assays of denitrification enzymes activities and functional genes after the 72 h ag nps exposure experiment the activities of nar nir nor and nos were detected dong et al 2017 and the specific measurement process was given in test s8 in addition the copy numbers of narg encoding nar nirk encoding nir norb encoding nor and nosz encoding nos were quantified by qpcr tib 8600 canada to illustrate the effects of ag nps on denitrifying microbe abundance in briefly genomic dna was extracted using the e z n a tissue dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s based on the manufacturer s instructions the concentrations and purities a260 a280 ratio 1 5 of the extracted dna samples were analyzed by a nanodrop nd 2000 thermo fisher scientific usa miao et al 2017 the reaction mixtures used for pcr comprised 10 Œºl of aceq qpcr sybr green master mix 0 4 Œºl of each f and r primers 10 Œºm and 1 Œºl of template dna liu et al 2018 and the primers of genes and detailed thermal conditions are listed in table s4 standard curves were established using the primer amplified gene fragments 2 7 statistical analysis the statistical significance of changes was determined by a one way analysis of variance anova with the lsd post hoc test spss 17 0 p values of less than 0 05 were considered significant all tests were performed in triplicate and all data are represented as the mean standard deviation furthermore to easily compare the results among the ag nps exposure groups with different sps systems each control group was represented as 100 and the results of the nps exposure groups were represented as the percentage after comparison with the corresponding control in addition structure equation modeling sem was performed to explore the direct and indirect effects of electron transport systems on denitrification after ag nps exposure and the details on the development of this model are available in test s9 the linear model was fitted and reported as a standardized coefficient for each path the model was considered a good fit with a root mean square error of approximation rmsea less than 0 05 and comparative fit index cfi larger than 0 9 shipley 2000 3 results 3 1 responses of denitrification rate and antioxidant systems after ag nps exposure in 1 g l sps systems the isotopic tracing method was used in the study to explore the effects of ag nps on the denitrification rate in systems with different sps sizes and concentrations systems in addition the levels of ros rns and t aoc were measured to explore the responses of microbial resistance systems after ag nps exposure compared with their corresponding controls the denitrification rate was evidently inhibited by 10 mg l ag nps in the 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps decreasing to 62 22 3 85 74 84 4 74 and 81 53 3 18 respectively fig 1 a all p 0 05 at the same time the ros and rns contents were obviously increased in three sps size groups after 10 mg l ag nps exposure with an evident decline in t aoc level fig 1b all p 0 05 in detail ros amount was increased to 163 20 5 74 140 22 4 28 and 128 80 5 37 in the 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps respectively and the amount of rns was increased to 127 78 7 08 117 75 4 01 and 110 32 6 90 respectively t aoc was reduced to 56 53 5 79 62 30 5 06 and 80 91 6 48 in the 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps respectively the results showed that 10 mg l ag nps exhibited evident inhibition on the denitrification rate and antioxidant systems in sps systems regardless of sps size moreover a negative correlation between ros rns and t aoc was also confirmed in sps fig s5 thus ag nps would cause excess accumulation of ros and rns which could destroy the resistance systems of sps and be the main reason for the dramatic decrease in t aoc in sps systems 3 2 responses of electron production in glucose metabolism after ag nps exposure in 1 g l sps systems glucose was the main carbon source in sps systems in our study so glycolysis and the tca cycle were the major microbial metabolisms providing nadh electron donor for denitrification during incubation fig 2 broberg 1985 su et al 2018 thus the key enzymes in glycolysis gk gapdh and pk and the tca cycle sdh scs and mdh and the major productions during metabolism nadh atp and pyruvate were investigated compared with their corresponding controls the enzyme activities in the 5 Œºm sps were all clearly inhibited by 10 mg l ag nps fig 3 all p 0 05 in glycolysis the activity of gk gapdh and pk was decreased to 59 31 3 64 49 73 2 10 and 69 80 5 43 respectively and the sdh scs and mdh activity in tca cycle was decreased to 80 37 3 78 55 97 3 50 and 67 36 3 72 respectively similarly the activity of gk gapdh scs and mdh was evidently reduced in 5 50 Œºm sps fig 3 all p 0 05 decreasing to 73 27 4 49 63 85 7 09 63 36 3 63 and 83 61 3 99 respectively in contrast the pk and sdh activity in 5 50 Œºm sps was not affected at the same np exposure and it was even increased in 50 200 Œºm sps considering the above it could be concluded that pk and sdh had higher resistance to ag nps exposure in the 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps systems moreover both enzyme type and sps particle size were key factors influencing the responses of glucose metabolism enzymes to ag nps in this study the amounts of atp nadh and pyruvate were all obviously decreased by 10 mg l ag nps in the sps systems of three different sizes fig 3 all p 0 05 except that pyruvate in 50 200 Œºm sps was slightly improved which was possibly caused by the improved pk activity of the systems specifically compared with each control nadh amount in 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps was dramatically decreased to 59 92 6 30 78 11 4 83 and 86 47 3 27 respectively nadh is the important production in glucose metabolism dong et al 2017 and the level of nadh is directly related to the number of electron in denitrification after ag nps exposure the evident reduction of nadh was caused by the degradation of glucose metabolism which affected the efficiency of denitrification 3 3 responses of electron transport system after ag nps exposure in 1 g l sps systems accepting electrons from the electron transport systems is necessary for denitrification to conduct a series of reduction reactions fig 2 broberg 1985 su et al 2018 fig 4 showed the electron transport system activity etsa and the key enzyme activities in canonical electron transport systems in denitrifiers after exposure to 10 mg l ag nps compared with each control the activity of complex i complex iii and cyt c was evidently inhibited in the sps systems of three different sizes all p 0 05 furthermore compared with each control etsa in 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps was decreased to 55 37 4 10 68 50 4 39 5 and 79 74 4 34 which might because of the dramatic decrease of complex i complex iii and cyt c activities the results showed that 10 mg l ag nps remarkably inhibited the enzyme activities involved in the electron transport chain and dramatically decreased the etsa in denitrifiers which had negative effects on denitrification process in sps 3 4 responses of electron consumption in denitrification after ag nps exposure in 1 g l sps systems four main denitrification enzyme activities nar nir nor and nos and the corresponding gene abundances narg nirk norb and nosz were measured in the study fig 5 the results indicated that the nor activity in the three sps size groups was not affected after exposure to 10 mg l ag nps whereas nar nir and nos were evidently inhibited under the same conditions all p 0 05 specifically the activity of nar decreased to 79 27 2 10 82 24 3 46 and 90 73 3 26 in 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps respectively the activity of nir decreased to 83 21 2 83 88 81 2 34 and 93 77 3 63 in 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps respectively and the activity of nos decreased to 84 13 3 54 87 42 4 52 and 91 52 1 66 in 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps respectively in addition the abundance of narg and nirk was obviously declined in three particle size groups p 0 05 according with the decreased nar and nir in exposure groups however the activity of nor and the abundance of norb and nosz were less affected even after exposure to 10 mg l ag nps demonstrating that different denitrification functional enzymes and genes had different responses to ag nps exposure in the study possibly because periplasmic enzymes such as nir and nos are easily affected than enzymes located in the cell membrane such as nar and nor and because the biosynthetic pathways of riboswitches controlling gene expression were influenced to different extents chen and strous 2013 sullivan et al 2013 in addition it should be noted that after exposure to 10 mg l ag nps the antioxidant systems microbial electron behaviors and denitrification rate were most inhibited in 5 Œºm sps followed by 5 50 Œºm and 50 200 Œºm sps figs 3 5 indicating that sps systems with smaller particle sizes were more sensitive to ag nps and easily affected after ag nps exposure a possible reason is related to the adsorption ability of sps systems and more discussion follows in section 4 2 1 3 5 effects of the concentration of ag nps and sps 3 5 1 effects of the concentration of ag nps in our study different ag nps concentrations 1 5 and 10 mg l were set to investigate the effects of np concentration on their toxicity in sps 1 g l 5 50 Œºm sps the results showed that the inhibition by ag nps of the denitrification rate and microbial electron behaviors in sps was increased with the increasing np concentration with an inhibition order of 10 5 1 mg l ag nps figs s6 9 in general 1 and 5 mg l ag nps exhibited a slight increase and decrease in denitrification in sps respectively and 10 mg l ag nps showed the aforementioned evident toxicity exhibiting the hormesis that low doses stimulate and high doses inhibit liu et al 2018 tang et al 2017 in particularly although in glucose metabolism only gapdh activity catalyzing glyceradehtde 3 phosphate to 3 phosphoglycerate and producing nadh was evidently decreased by 5 mg l ag nps p 0 05 the amount of nadh in sps was obviously decreased fig s7 which confirmed the critical role of gapdh for nadh generation in the process 3 5 2 effects of concentration of sps meanwhile another experiment was conducted to explore the effects of sps concentration 1 and 5 g l on the toxicity of 10 mg l ag nps at the same sps size 5 50 Œºm the np inhibition of the denitrification rate glucose metabolism denitrification enzymes and gene abundance in the 1 g l sps systems were stronger than in the 5 g l sps systems table s5 for example etsa was decreased by 32 72 7 69 and 15 24 6 70 in 1 and 5 g l sps respectively the activity of gk was reduced by 25 30 5 42 and 12 85 3 62 in 1 and 5 g l sps respectively thus compared with the higher sps concentration the lower sps concentration systems experienced more inhibition from ag nps in denitrifying electron generation transport and consumption which resulted in a reduction in the denitrification rate twice that in 5 g l sps 4 discussion 4 1 effects of ag nps on microbial antioxidant systems after ag nps exposure in 1 g l sps systems t aoc is a useful index for the capacity of microbial communities to modulate the damage caused by enhanced production of reactive species such as ros and rns cui et al 2014 normal and effective antioxidant defense systems can eliminate accumulation of their production after 10 mg l ag nps exposure into sps systems the excessive accumulation of ros and rns could lead to an intracellular imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants and thus decreasing the t aoc level in sps microbial systems in addition the redox status disorder may further cause cellular macromolecules damage such as protein and dna leading to lower microbial activity hozayen et al 2019 su et al 2016 thus np induced excessive ros and rns in denitrifiers could directly react with enzymes related to electron behaviors and cause the deterioration of enzymes activities further affecting denitrification process in sps moreover the excessive ros and rns in denitrifiers could destroy the integrity of the cell membrane venditti et al 2013 the key denitrification enzymes are located on the cell membrane such as nar and nor or periplasm such as nir and nos chen and strous 2013 therefore in addition to directly damaging functional enzyme activity the excess ros and rns would damage the microenvironment of enzymes by attacking the membrane components that is one explanation for ag nps inhibition on denitrification in addition the concentration of released ag from 10 mg l ag nps was low test s2 and it had less effect on denitrification based on our previous study liu et al 2018 hence the impact of the released ag was not considered in this experiment 4 2 effects of ag nps on electron behaviors of denitrification in 1 g l sps 4 2 1 electron production in carbon source metabolism almost all enzymatic reactions in microbial metabolism require an electron donor and energy support carbon source metabolism in denitrifiers provides the primary electron donor and atp for denitrification su et al 2018 during glycolysis the first step glucose to glucose 6p and the last step phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate are irreversible reactions being catalyzed by gk and pk respectively fig 2 the critical role of gk and pk in glycolysis has been confirmed in previous studies berks et al 1995 hence the decrease in gk activity in the three sps groups of different sizes could directly inhibit the first step of glycolysis and negatively affect the subsequent process pyruvate is a connection between glycolysis and tca cycle in microbial metabolism and it plays an important role in complete carbon source metabolism song et al 2016 after exposure to 10 mg l ag nps the decreased amount of pyruvate would directly suppress the tca cycle and then influence the following nadh and atp generation the decrease in pyruvate in 5 Œºm sps was directly due to the np inhibition on pk activity ag nps cause the excessive accumulation of ros and rns and then affect the activity of pk by influencing enzyme functional groups li et al 2017 wang et al 2019 it is well accepted that nadh is the major electron donor for denitrification and the amount of nadh is very crucial for electron transport and consumption the catalysis of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate g 3p to 3 phosphogylcerate 3 pg is the only pathway to produce nadh in glucose degradation controlled by gapdh hence the obvious decrease in gapdh activity was one of the major reasons for the reduction of nadh in the three sps groups of different sizes otherwise sdh and mdh are two key enzymes for nadh production in the tca cycle and they were significantly inhibited by 10 mg l ag nps in 5 and 5 50 Œºm sps to different degrees being another reason for the decreased nadh in sps systems the importance of nadh in the denitrification rate has also been confirmed chen et al 2019 hence the obvious decrease in available nadh could directly affect the efficiency of microbial electron transport which is one of the important reasons for the degeneration of denitrification in sps systems furthermore the atp level was inhibited by ag nps through decreasing gk gapdh pk and scs activities in glycolysis and the tca cycle further leading to the insufficient energy supply for denitrification therefore 10 mg l ag nps could reduce the supplementation of electron donors and energy sources for denitrification by inhibiting related enzymes activities in carbon source metabolism in addition the toxicity of ag nps to microbial glucose metabolism in sps systems with a size 5 Œºm was strongest similar tendency was also observed in denitrification rate electron transport systems denitrifying genes and abundance after ag nps exposure the total adsorbed ag nps including ag nps and ag in the sps particles was increased with the decrease in particle size table s6 in the 10 mg l ag nps groups the amount of ag nps in 5 Œºm sps was significantly higher than in 50 200 Œºm sps p 0 05 due to the stronger adsorption ability and ionic attraction of finer particles mehdi and mulligan 2016 similar results confirmed that finer particle size sediments tend to have a relatively higher concentration of contaminants because of the greater surface area to volume ratios yang et al 2018 as the bioavailable concentration of ag nps is the critical factor for their toxicity zhang et al 2016 the different degrees to which ag nps inhibited microbial electron transport in the 5 5 50 and 50 200 Œºm sps systems were possibly due to the different particle sizes of sps therefore the exposure of ag nps might lead to more severe inhibition on n cycling in finer sps size systems and cause higher risks to aquatic ecology 4 2 2 electron transport systems a series of intracellular reductions in denitrification are propelled by electron transport and consumption the backbone of the electron transport system constitutes complex i complex iii quinone pool and cytochrome c broberg 1985 chen et al 2019 after exposure to 10 mg l ag nps the decreased activity of complex i directly influenced nadh degradation and the number of electrons because electrons are transduced from nadh in complex i after that electrons are transferred to complex iii via the quinone pool and finally to cyt c in the periplasm hence the dramatic decline in complex i activity led to less electron transport to complex iii being another reason for the decreased complex iii activity other than np directly destroying its activity furthermore cyt c is the important electron transporter in electron transport chains relaying electrons from complex iii to denitrification enzymes wan et al 2016 hence the decrease in cyt c activity reduced electron transport to denitrifying enzymes and inhibited electron utilization in denitrification considering that the activities of these core enzymes are highly related to electron transport systems activity esta the reduction of complex i complex iii and cyt c activity was the important reason for the decrease in etsa which then inhibited denitrification by destroying the electron transport furthermore the structure equation modeling sem was established to investigate the direct and indirect effects of electron transport systems for denitrification after ag nps exposure fig 6 and table s7 showed that only etsa had significant direct effects on denitrification p 0 05 the importance of etsa in microbial electron transport and denitrification process has been proven chen et al 2019 su et al 2018 after exposure to ag nps the dramatic decrease in etsa was consistent with the decline in the denitrification rate which confirmed the critical role of etsa in denitrification the sem results indicated that etsa could be the most important direct factor in electron transport systems for predicting denitrification in ag nps exposure sps systems in addition they showed nadh had the most indirect effects on denitrification further leading to the most total effects table s7 that was because nadh is the main electron donor in the electron transport chain and it is directly related to the efficiency of electron transport the significant direct influence of nadh on complex i and complex iii also confirmed the importance of nadh on electron transport enzymes fig 6 p 0 05 so the decrease of nadh reduced the denitrification rate by affecting microbial electron transport consistent with the conclusion that the decreased amount of nadh is an important reason for the degeneration of denitrification in sps systems 4 2 3 electron consumption in denitrification electrons are transferred to nar nir nor and nos via electron transfer systems and then they consumed by these denitrifying enzymes to complete the reduction of no3 to n2 zheng et al 2018 therefore the activities of denitrification enzymes play a major role in the denitrification rate in our study 10 mg l ag nps significantly inhibited activity of nar nir and nos but nor was less affected showing a higher resistance to ag nps exposure this might be because that nar and nor are located in the cell membrane where nir and nos are distributed in the periplasm chen and strous 2013 periplasmic enzymes were easily inhibited by some foreigner toxicants e g chlorothalonil possibly because these toxicants are first contacted by periplasmic enzymes su et al 2018 it is well known that nar nir nor and nos are controlled by the narg nirk norb and nosz gene zheng et al 2018 our results showed that the abundance of narg and nirk was decreased by ag nps in the three sps size groups and this is one of the important reasons for the decreased nar and nik activity previous studies have indicated that the copy number of narg was highly related to denitrification process and ag nps could inhibit the emission of n2o and n2 in denitrification by decreasing nirk abundance liu et al 2018 however no significant change in the amount of norb and nosz was observed indicating that ag nps might not directly influence nor and nos activity by affecting their corresponding gene abundance in sps systems in brief ag nps inhibited the electron consumption during denitrification by decreasing denitrifying enzymes activities and functional genes abundance causing the deterioration of denitrification in sps systems in addition the decrease of nadh production and reduced electrons transport to denitrifying enzymes might be other important reasons for the decreased denitrifying enzymes activities 4 3 effects of ag nps concentration and the role of sps concentration studies have confirmed that the concentration of ag nps directly determine their bioavailability as well as np toxicity in the environment zhang et al 2016 the inhibition effects of ag nps on sps denitrification were enhanced with increasing np concentration which confirmed the importance of np concentration for their toxicity in sps systems moreover the hydrodynamic diameter hdd of ag nps remained stable after 24 h fig s3 demonstrating that the aggregation of ag nps was not dissolved after they stabilized in the incubated water the higher concentration of ag nps in water usually leads to a larger aggregated size a previous study indicated that nps with a smaller particle size could easily enter or interact with microbes and cause more toxicity yang et al 2011 although 10 mg l ag nps had the largest hdds they still showed the strongest inhibition effect on denitrification compared with 1 and 5 mg l ag nps suggesting that the effects of the np concentration on the toxicity were greater than that of aggregated np size in the study furthermore our results also showed that the inhibition effects of ag nps on the denitrification rate and electron behaviors in 5 g l sps systems were less than in 1 g l sps at the same sps size 5 50 Œºm this is because that sps systems with a higher particle concentration contain more denitrifiers and have more efficient denitrification as well as a stronger microbial defense system jia et al 2016 in our study the denitrification rate in 1 and 5 g l sps was 2 90 0 15 and 5 21 0 34 Œºmol15 n kg 1 h 1 respectively the total abundance of denitrifying genes was 7 15 0 24 105 and 2 21 0 30 106 copies g 1 dw for 1 and 5 g l sps respectively studies have indicated that the complex microbial community structure and composition could resist nps through a rapid evolutionary adaptation and also reduce the damage to microbial function due to the stronger functional redundancy liu et al 2019 thus denitrification in sps systems of lower particle concentration had less resistance for ag nps exposure due to the simple microbial population and composition 4 4 environmental significance here we explored the effects of ag nps on denitrification in sps systems with different particle sizes and concentrations 10 mg l ag nps obviously inhibited the denitrification rate by influencing microbial electron generation transport and consumption ag nps destroyed the antioxidant systems of denitrifiers due to the excessive ros and rns which also decreased crucial electron related enzymes activities possibly by reacting with functional groups or destroying the enzyme microenvironments the inhibition of nadh electron donor generation and etsa in the electron transport chain by ag nps was the most indirect and direct way to affect the denitrification rate which could be used to analyze the extent of inhibition on denitrification or predict the denitrification rate in ag nps polluted areas notably the results also showed the close connection between carbon and nitrogen metabolism in sps systems ag nps inhibited electron generation of denitrification by affecting the amount of nadh in glucose metabolism therefore the effects of pollutants on the transformation of multiple biogenic elements and their interactions in ecology should garner much attention moreover according to the udden wentworth grain size classification scheme the sediment components could be roughly divided into clay 3 9 Œºm silt 3 9 62 5 Œºm and sand 62 5 2000 Œºm in addition stronger disturbances usually lead to higher sps concentrations in water sediment systems jia et al 2016 our results showed a significant inhibition by ag nps on denitrification in sps systems with smaller particle sizes and concentrations indicating that sps systems dominated by clay or less turbulence might be more sensitive to ag nps and at greater risk after np exposure which warrants more attention in aquatic environments 5 conclusions this study indicated that ag nps inhibited electron generation transport and consumption in denitrification by affecting microbial carbon source metabolism electron transport systems and enzymes activities as well as denitrifying genes abundance respectively in addition the denitrification process in sps systems with a finer particle size and lower particle concentration was easily affected by ag nps exposure furthermore we observed that in addition to directly affecting the denitrification process ag nps can affect nitrogen cycling by influencing other nutrient element cycling in sps such as carbon transformation overall the study focused on the impacts of ag nps on sps denitrification at the microbial metabolism and isotope tracing level the results provide a potential toxicity mechanism for revealing the effects of ag nps on sps denitrification via microbial electron behaviors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

18232,although estimates of total co2 emissions from global estuaries are gradually decreasing current numbers are based on limited data and the impacts of anthropogenic and seasonal disturbances have not been studied extensively our study estimates annual and seasonal co2 fluxes in china s yellow river estuary yre which incorporated spatiotemporal variations and the effects of water and sediment regulation wsr aquatic metabolism was estimated using odum s open water dissolved oxygen methods and used to represent the production and assimilation of co2 net ecosystem production nep was used to represent the co2 flux from biological activities and estimate the major co2 emitters in the yre according to our measurements the annual co2 release was 6 14 33 63 mol c m 2 yr 1 from 2009 to 2013 and the annual co2 efflux from the 1521 3 km2 of estuarine surface area was 0 11 0 61 tg c yr 1 in the yre high co2 emissions in autumn were balanced by high co2 sequestration in summer leading to a lower than expected annual net co2 efflux the system is an atmospheric co2 source in spring and winter near neutral in early summer a large sink in late summer after wsr and finally a large atmospheric co2 source in autumn discharge events and seasonality jointly affect estuarine co2 flux high co2 sequestration in summer is due mainly to a combination of high water temperature chlorophyll a levels dissolved inorganic carbon and solar radiation and low turbidity discharge and chemical oxygen demand cod after wsr wsr supports the high gross primary productivity rate which exceeds the increase in ecosystem respiration although the yre as a whole is a source of atmospheric co2 the amount of co2 released is lower than the average estuarine value of mid latitude regions our findings therefore suggest that global co2 release from estuarine systems is overestimated if spatiotemporal variations and the effects of anthropogenic disturbance are excluded the nep method is effective for estimating the co2 flux especially in estuaries where co2 variation is mainly due to biological processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords net ecosystem production biological processes carbon dioxide flux seasonal variability anthropogenic disturbance yellow river estuary 1 introduction estuaries and other near shore ecosystems are considered net heterotrophic environments acting as a source of co2 to the atmosphere and balancing the global net co2 uptake by continental shelves cai 2011 laruelle et al 2010 the total co2 emissions from european estuaries is 0 03 0 06 gt c yr 1 1 gt 1015 g frankignoulle et al 1998 equivalent to 5 10 of the total anthropogenic co2 emissions from western europe in 1995 however the role of estuaries as an atmospheric co2 source or sink is still a matter of debate estimates on the total co2 emissions from global estuaries are also gradually decreasing from 0 34 gt c yr 1 borges et al 2005 0 27 0 23 gt c yr 1 laruelle et al 2010 0 25 0 25 gt c yr 1 cai 2011 to 0 10 gt c yr 1 chen et al 2013 the disparity is due to the following firstly the current global estuarine co2 flux estimate is based on a limited dataset specifically the co2 flux estimates for particular asian estuaries guo et al 2009 sarma et al 2011 shim et al 2007 wang et al 2005 zhai and dai 2009 are under or overestimated due to limited spatiotemporal data laruelle et al 2010 for example the yellow river is the second longest river in china and sixth longest in the world however co2 flux data for the yellow river estuary yre are still lacking secondly highly heterotrophic estuaries are likely overrepresented in the global estimate and recent studies have shown low air sea co2 exchange rates for high emission estuarine environments harley et al 2015 m√∏rk et al 2016 in addition estuarine organic carbon metabolism is significantly more affected by nearby anthropogenic disturbance levels and climate change than any other aspect smith and hollibaugh 1993 regnier et al 2013 therefore to accurately estimate the co2 flux and the role of estuaries as carbon sources or sinks both spatiotemporal variations and the effects of anthropogenic disturbance should be considered estuaries are typically subject to natural hydrological changes and intense anthropogenic disturbances that are reflected in the elevated loading of detrital organic matter high respiration rates and the production of dissolved co2 time series observations from indian estuaries identified high co2 emissions 52 6 mol c m 2 yr 1 in godavari estuary because of high bacterial respiration due to high quantities of organic matter associated with high monsoonal river discharges sarma et al 2011 2012 simultaneously high levels of inorganic matter and nutrients were loaded due to anthropogenic disturbance which may support photosynthesis and the consumption of dissolved co2 for example dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations increased when water and sediment regulation measures were in place but decreased during natural flood periods in the yre liu et al 2014 the former enhances the photosynthesis rate but the latter does not aquatic metabolism

et al 2000 gu et al 2011 shen et al 2015 nep analogous to net ecosystem metabolism nem is the difference between organic matter production and respiration and provides an estimate of the role of oceanic organic metabolism in the carbon budget muller karger et al 2005 smith and hollibaugh 1993 turner et al 2013 an ecosystem is identified as net autotrophic nep 0 if it produces more organic matter than it consumes and acts as an atmospheric co2 sink alternatively if organic consumption exceeds production nep 0 the system is identified as net heterotrophic and acts as a source of atmospheric co2 heterotrophy or autotrophy has a significant influence on dissolved co2 level and emissions sarma et al 2011 studies suggest that about 10 of the co2 outgassing from estuaries is sustained by the input from upstream freshwaters and 90 by local net heterotrophy borges and abril 2011 for these estuaries as the variability of co2 flux is predominantly controlled by changes in carbon concentrations from biological activities the nep reflects co2 fluxes generated from biological reactions as well as major co2 fluxes in the estuary the co2 emissions from intertidal zones and coastal marshes have been assessed in yellow river delta wetlands han et al 2013 sun et al 2018 however there was insufficient water air co2 partial pressure data pco2 in the yre thus annual co2 fluxes are yet to be determined here we estimated the aquatic metabolism of the yre and nep was used to represent the co2 flux from biological processes our objective is to clarify the effect of spatial and temporal variability on the role of the yre as an atmospheric co2 source or sink especially under the double influence of seasonal factors and anthropogenic disturbance artificial water and sediment regulation in addition we also want to clarify if the effects of water and sediment regulation on co2 flux were more significant than that of the seasonal factors 2 sampling and methods 2 1 study region and environmental monitoring the yre is in a temperate climate zone in north china 117 31 119 30 e 36 55 38 30 n with an arid and semiarid climate its sediment load as measured at lijin hydrometric station about 100 km from the gulf of bohai was 1 1 109 t yr 1 between the 1950s and 1970s annual water discharge prior to 1970 was consistently greater than 25 km3 yr 1 and greater than 90 km3 yr 1 for several years in the early 1960s however the sediment load and discharge decreased significantly due to intensive irrigation and damming from the 1950s to 2011 yang et al 1998 liu et al 2014 the flow was not high enough to transport sediment to the ocean and the water column in the estuary contains high sediment concentrations resulting in a perched river downstream since 2002 the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc has implemented an annual wsr scheme to prevent heavy sedimentation of the riverbed by releasing water from several dams in the middle and upper reaches of the river the enforced discharge events usually begin at the end of june and typically last for more than ten days two or three events can last a few dozens of days the frequency and timing of wsr events depend on dam storage river flow bottom sediment and seasonal precipitation thus annual wsr events provide the yre with a significant amount of nutrients organic carbon and high turbidity from river runoff bai et al 2012 shen et al 2015 the yre experiences a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with distinct seasons including high precipitation and warm temperatures in the summer months the inner estuary has a shallow water depth of 1 3 5 5 m we monitored the water chemistry at four sampling sites in the yre from 2009 to 2013 including may june august and september in 2009 april june and september in 2010 april june august and october in 2011 april and may in 2012 and june and december in 2013 fig 1 salinity ph water temperature dissolved oxygen do do saturation percentage do and chlorophyll a concentrations chl a were measured at 15 min intervals over one or three days using a hydrolab series ds5x multi parameter water quality data sonde hydrolab ds5x hach loveland co u s the

correction factor the monitoring time interval was 15 min thus we divided k by 4 to obtain a 15 min rate the 15 min wind and water temperature diffusion corrected rates of dissolved oxygen change were then summed over a 24 h period to calculate daily nep g o2 m 2d 1 or mg o2 l 1d 1 we present er value as positive nep that occurs at night was multiplied by 1 to give a night respiration rate ern where solar radiation at night was defined as 2 w m 2 ern divided by hours of night equals the hourly respiration rate g o2 m 2h 1 and er g o2 m 2d 1 equals the hourly respiration rate multiplied by 24 thus gpp nep er this assumes the hourly respiration rate is the same during the day and night a claim that is sometimes challenged but is currently consistent with most standard methods marcarelli et al 2010 some metabolism data in the oxygen unit g o2 m 2d 1 has been published tang et al 2015 shen et al 2015 2018 we assume that photosynthesis produces 1 mol of o2 for every mole of co2 consumed in the estuarine ecosystem similarly we assume respiration releases 1 mol of co2 for every mole of o2 consumed the metabolic oxygen unit g o2 m 2d 1 was converted to carbon units mmol co2 m 2d 1 by assuming 1 g o2 m 2d 1 is equal to 1 32 mol co2 m 2d 1 1 g o2 m 2d 1 1000 32 mmol co2 m 2d 1 nep estimates also represent the estuarine co2 flux caused by biological activities in aquatic ecosystems and it can allow us to determine estuary s role as a sink or a source of atmospheric co2 positive negative nep can result in sequestration emission of co2 and a sharp decrease increase in dic to calculate the co2 flux the estuarine surface area must be accurately estimated borges 2005 here we divided the estuarine area into two regions the inner estuary area and the outer estuary area firstly the inner estuary included the tidal watercourse and the coastline area fig 1 white area the tidal watercourse area is 20 km2 with 20 km annual average length and 1 km width of the tidal river section the coastline area is 30 km2 with a width of 0 2 km and a length of 150 km and water depth of this area is less than 2 m thus the inner estuary area is 50 km2 for the outer estuary area waters within 13 m depth limit were considered to be the outer boundary according to the bathymetric chart of bohai bay because the water depth range is less than 13 m in most areas of the yre due to sediment transportation from the middle reaches of the loess plateau and the deepest water depth is 20 m in the southern bohai bay peng et al 2012 sun et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 in order to distinguish the outer boundary of other estuaries which flow into bohai such as luan river estuary and xiaoqing river estuary xiao et al 2012 we set the near shore coastal waters as the big boundary in fig 1 bay blue area 119 0 119 30 e 37 30 38 0 n we used arcmap 10 2 to estimate outer estuary area co2 flux from biological processes was calculated using estuarine carbon flux per unit and estimated estuarine surface area 2 3 statistical analysis the average seasonal and monthly metabolism was computed by combining all samples obtained during 2009 2013 and aggregating and averaging the calculated fluxes according to the sampling month we applied repeated measures analysis of variance anova at a confidence level of 0 05 to test the differences in environmental factors and metabolism between different

principal components 1 and 2 pc 1 and 2 accounted for 70 62 and 14 86 of the variance respectively combined pc 1 and 2 explain 85 48 of the total variance fig 4 a pc 1 is correlated with variables that are dependent on the discharge pulse such as high turbidity high cod high nutrients and low salinity maximum turbidity 1000 ntu and cod 80 mg l 1 both occurred in october 2011 when there was higher daily discharge 1500 m3 s 1 and lower salinity pc 2 is correlated with seasonally changing environmental factors such as high solar radiation and high chl a concentrations the environmental conditions at each site varied depending on the distance from the discharge source coastal site d is characterized by higher salinity lower turbidity lower cod and lower nutrients relative to the other 3 sites fig 4b the highest mean salinities were observed at site d because it is flushed by tidal action the remaining three sites are almost entirely filled with freshwater during peak discharge periods mean salinity 0 45 both maximum and minimum values of do occurred at site d 3 2 variations in metabolism and co2 flux from biological processes nep was highly variable during the sampling period fluctuating between 181 mmol c m 2 d 1 and 227 91 mmol c m 2 d 1 and averaging 16 83 92 14 mmol c m 2 d 1 table 2 and fig 5 the highly variable nep indicates that co2 sourcing or sinking from biological activities is also highly variable in the yre the observed average negative nep value of the estuary indicates the dominance of respiration over primary production table 2 therefore biological activities are a net source of atmospheric co2 in the estuary the mean value of co2 emitted from biological activities alone is 6 14 33 63 mol c m 2 yr 1 73 73 403 57 g c m 2 yr 1 nep of the estuary was highest in summer 52 03 91 96 mmol c m 2 d 1 and lowest in autumn 114 07 60 93 mmol c m 2 d 1 fig 5a table 2 inferring co2 influx from the atmosphere via net photosynthesis in summer and estuarine co2 efflux to the atmosphere via net respiration in autumn estuarine co2 degassing also occurred during spring 29 97 33 mmol c m 2 d 1 and winter 58 23 5 16 mmol c m 2 d 1 according to our nep values throughout the entire monitoring period average gpp was 73 86 86 80 mmol c m 2 d 1 though it fluctuated between 0 06 mmol c m 2 d 1 and 278 50 mmol c m 2 d 1 gpp was significantly high in summer 147 89 86 24 mmol c m 2 d 1 and low in winter 9 02 12 75 mmol c m 2 d 1 fig 5a average er was 92 79 58 94 mmol c m 2 d 1 in a range between 11 94 mmol c m 2 d 1 and 280 25 mmol c m 2 d 1 er was significantly higher in summer and autumn fig 5a peak values were observed in autumn 135 77 40 49 mmol c m 2 d 1 and lowest values were observed in spring 57 15 46 72 mmol c m 2 d 1 our results demonstrate that the yre acts as a co2 sink in the summer months due to high gpp rates and as a co2 source in autumn when er rates increase and gpp rates decrease the estuary also acts as a co2 source in spring and winter to a lesser extent as gpp rates decrease by a larger amount relative to the observed decrease in er however no significant difference in gpp er and nep was observed between the four monitoring sites and metabolism was highly variable at each site table 2 fig 5b this suggests that it may be reasonable to use the mean nep to estimate the co2 emissions in the entire yre the outer estuary area of yre was estimated at 1471 3 km2 using arcmap 10 2 the total surface area of the yre was estimated at 1521 3 km2 with a 50 km2 inner estuary area therefore the annual estuarine co2 emissions were estimated to be 0 11 0 61 tg c yr 1 1 tg 1012 g based on the mean nep 73 73 403 57 g c m 2 yr 1 and total estuarine surface area 1521 3 km2 calculated we compared monthly variations in metabolism rates especially before and after the occurrence of wsr fig 5c nep remain high after wsr reaching a maximum in august 127 89 21 51 mmol c m 2 d 1 and a minimum in september 122 56 70 53 mmol c m 2 d 1 fig 5c gpp increased and remained high following wsr reaching a maximum in august 239 02 32 35 mmol c m 2 d 1 and decreasing in september 35 08 51 71 mmol c m 2 d 1 er remained high after wsr in august 111 13 26 84 mmol c m 2 d 1 and reached a maximum in september 157 64 33 41 mmol c m 2 d 1 these results indicate a clear transition from a weak co2 sink 3 61 94 78 mmol c m 2 d 1 in june to a strong sink in august 127 89 21 51 mmol c m 2 d 1 after wsr was implemented although gpp and er increased simultaneously in august the former was larger resulting in a net estuarine co2 influx as the decrease in gpp significantly outweighed the increase in er the estuary recovered the following month becoming a strong co2 source in september 3 3 the main impacting factors on metabolism and co2 flux from biological processes rda identified the factors associated with metabolism axes 1 and 2 explained 55 36 and 7 15 of the variance in production and respiration respectively combined they explained 62 51 of the variance fig 6 a only three factors din dip and ph did not show significant correlation with metabolism the contribution of each environmental

a water temperature solar radiation and salinity were positively correlated with nep and therefore positively correlated with co2 sequestration rate discharge turbidity and cod showed significant negative correlation with nep p 0 01 giving a positive correlation with co2 emission rates fig 6a rda also identified the factors associated with metabolism at sites a c and coastal site d at sites a c axes 1 and 2 explained 50 23 and 9 75 of the variance in metabolism respectively combined they explained 59 97 of the variance table 3 only four factors din dip ph and salinity did not show

variance fig 6c table 3 discharge turbidity and cod did not show significant correlation with metabolism the contribution of each environmental variable to the variance in metabolism p 0 05 was as follows do 63 1 chl a 29 2 water temperature 23 2 fig 6c table 3 vpa identified the contribution of environmental factors to the observed variability in estuarine metabolism the environmental factors were divided into two groups based on pca results fig 4a the first included variables associated with seasonal change including solar radiation water temperature and chl a the second included variables related to discharge events including discharge turbidity cod ph nutrients and salinity do mg l 1 and do were excluded from vpa vpa showed that the first group alone accounted for 39 60 of the variability and the second group alone accounted for 31 20 the two groups jointly accounted for 29 20 fig 7 these results suggest that seasonality and discharge events jointly affect estuarine production and respiration the impact of the latter is only slightly smaller than the former 4 discussions 4 1 variation of co2 flux and comparison to other estuaries to compare the difference of co2 flux from biological activities and air sea co2 flux from the whole estuarine water surface we estimated the air sea exchanges of co2 in the yre using directly measured co2 guo et al 2009 sarmar et al 2012 using pco2 water temperature and salinity data for may and september 2009 liu et al 2014 the co2 flux was 29 94 20 68 mmol m 2 d 1 in may 2009 slightly lower than our co2 flux data from biological activities in may table 2 36 26 39 86 mmol m 2 d 1 however the co2 flux for september 2009 51 75 38 76 mmol m 2 d 1 was far lower and the variability range from 2 99 to 87 66 mmol m 2 d 1 was much narrower than the co2 flux from biological activities 122 56 70 53 mmol m 2 d 1 from 25 to 181 mmol m 2 d 1 this suggests that one or a few monitoring trips cannot represent the entire co2 flux level especially given the large variations in discharge in september in our study high co2 emissions in autumn were balanced by high co2 sequestration in summer especially after wsr m√∏rk et al 2016 found that more than 30 of the air sea net co2 emissions in the roskilde fjord estuary in denmark was a result of two large fall and winter storms thus global estimates of air sea co2 exchange in estuarine systems need further study to determine whether relevant temporal variations especially under the effects of human activities are captured on a global scale estuaries are considered co2 sources estuaries between 23 5 and 50 n latitude have the largest flux per unit area 23 37 mmol c m 2 d 1 chen et al 2013 the estuarine type tidal systems show an average release of 18 2 mol co2 m 2 yr 1 laruelle et al 2013 thus the overall net co2 release 6 14 33 63 mol c m 2 yr 1 from the yre is lower than expected due to the effect of high summer co2 influx caused by enforced sediment discharge the co2 release from yre is comparable to the co2 flux calculated in the york river tidal system usa 5 6 mol c m 2 yr 1 37 2 n 76 4 w with similar latitude to the yre raymond et al 2000 compared to some estuaries published in chen et al 2013 the annual co2 emission from the yre was also low table 4 4 2 analysis of variation in co2 flux from biological processes multivariate analyses pca rda and vpa elucidated the reasons for seasonal and monthly variations of co2 flux in the yre in summer high discharge and turbidity associated with june wsr events transport elevated levels of detrital organic matter to the estuary fig 3a b c following these events rapid settling of coarse sand causes a decrease in flow turbidity during august fig 3b 200 ntu thus august gpp rates accelerate due to the combination of high water temperature chl a and solar radiation fig 3d e f simultaneously warm water temperatures and high organic matter also stimulated estuarine er rates during this month the gpp rates increased faster than the er rates resulting in estuarine co2 sequestration in summer especially after wsr the yre also experiences intense discharge pulse events in autumn due to high precipitation fig 2 high organic matter cod 42 8 mg l 1 transported during this high discharge season increases estuarine respiration rates and releases large quantities of dissolved co2 our results agree with previous studies that observed an increase in bacterial respiration during high discharge events due to the availability of organic carbon sarma et al 2009 shiah et al 2006 simultaneously gpp rates were limited by high turbidity and low solar radiation and low water temperature fig 3b f adding to the estuarine release of co2 in autumn in winter and spring gpp and er rates also remained low due to lower water temperatures solar radiation and chl a concentrations fig 3d e f we avoided monitoring metabolism during very high hydrological pulse periods monitoring discharge 1870 m3s 1 for the safety of monitoring equipment previous research found that dic concentrations in the yre increased during wsr floods but decreased during natural flood periods different water origins for the different types of floods account for the variability in dic liu et al 2014 during the wsr period floodwaters are mainly from upstream reservoirs which held waters of relatively high dic content co2 content however natural floodwaters originated primarily as rainwater with very low dic therefore it can be speculated that the high gpp rate was supported by the high dic content after wsr in summer which exceeds the increase in respiration so that the estuary changes from a weak co2 sink to a strong co2 sink the gpp rate can also be limited by low dic due to dilution in autumn no significant differences were observed in metabolism between the four monitoring sites fig 5b frequent discharge pulses likely caused some degree of water homogeneity across the estuary summer and autumn discharge events are the largest cause of observed variability in estuarine production and respiration rates however discharge events and seasonal factors only account for 62 51 of the variance based on rda fig 6a table 3 especially at coastal site d the discharge turbidity and cod did not show significant correlation with metabolism fig 6c table 3 this suggests that other factors must also contribute to the variability of production and respiration such as the tide action the exchange of organic matter and energy between the estuary and the open ocean 4 3 implications for co2 flux variation in the yellow river estuary studies on estuarine co2 emissions need to include spatiotemporal variations and the effects of anthropogenic disturbance although the yre as a whole is a source of atmospheric co2 the amount of co2 released is lower than the average estuarine value of mid latitude regions and shows high seasonal variability our findings therefore suggest a further lowering of the estimated global co2 release from estuarine systems we provided a research example for the conversion of oxygen metabolism to carbon metabolism to estimate of co2 emission a large amount of data calculated by aquatic metabolism is directly used in the statistics of global co2 emissions and c budget chen et al 2013 laruelle et al 2013 smith and hollibaugh 1993 therefore the nep calculated in the c unit can be used to estimate the co2 flux especially for those estuaries where co2 variation was mainly due to biological processes with the popularity of online dissolved oxygen monitoring technology continuous estimation of aquatic ecosystem metabolism can provide a new perspective for more accurate understanding of the spatiotemporal variation of co2 flux and estimates of co2 emissions 5 conclusions our study estimated the annual and seasonal co2 fluxes of china s yellow river estuary yre considering spatiotemporal variations and the effects of human activities wsr net ecosystem production nep was used to represent the co2 flux from biological activities and estimate co2 emission in the yre the annual co2 release was 6 14 33 63 mol c m 2 yr 1 from 2009 to 2013 and the annual co2 efflux from the 1521 3 km2 of estuarine surface area was 0 11 0 61 tg c yr 1 in the yre high co2 emissions in autumn were balanced by high co2 sequestration in summer which led to a lower annual net co2 efflux than expected in the yre across seasons the system changed from a source of atmospheric co2 during spring and winter to near neutral during earlier summer and a big sink during later summer after wsr later to a big source of atmospheric co2 during autumn discharge events and seasonality jointly affect estuarine co2 flux and the impact of the former is only slightly smaller than the latter high co2 sequestration in summer was mainly due to the combination of high water temperature chl a dic solar radiation and low turbidity discharge cod after wsr supporting the high gpp and exceeding the increase of er although the yre as a whole is a source of atmospheric co2 the amount of co2 released is lower than expected our findings therefore suggest a further lowering of the estimated global co2 release from estuarine systems the nep used to estimate the co2 flux also can be effective especially for those estuaries where co2 variation is mainly due to biological

18232,although estimates of total co2 emissions from global estuaries are gradually decreasing current numbers are based on limited data and the impacts of anthropogenic and seasonal disturbances have not been studied extensively our study estimates annual and seasonal co2 fluxes in china s yellow river estuary yre which incorporated spatiotemporal variations and the effects of water and sediment regulation wsr aquatic metabolism was estimated using odum s open water dissolved oxygen methods and used to represent the production and assimilation of co2 net ecosystem production nep was used to represent the co2 flux from biological activities and estimate the major co2 emitters in the yre according to our measurements the annual co2 release was 6 14 33 63 mol c m 2 yr 1 from 2009 to 2013 and the annual co2 efflux from the 1521 3 km2 of estuarine surface area was 0 11 0 61 tg c yr 1 in the yre high co2 emissions in autumn were balanced by high co2 sequestration in summer leading to a lower than expected annual net co2 efflux the system is an atmospheric co2 source in spring and winter near neutral in early summer a large sink in late summer after wsr and finally a large atmospheric co2 source in autumn discharge events and seasonality jointly affect estuarine co2 flux high co2 sequestration in summer is due mainly to a combination of high water temperature chlorophyll a levels dissolved inorganic carbon and solar radiation and low turbidity discharge and chemical oxygen demand cod after wsr wsr supports the high gross primary productivity rate which exceeds the increase in ecosystem respiration although the yre as a whole is a source of atmospheric co2 the amount of co2 released is lower than the average estuarine value of mid latitude regions our findings therefore suggest that global co2 release from estuarine systems is overestimated if spatiotemporal variations and the effects of anthropogenic disturbance are excluded the nep method is effective for estimating the co2 flux especially in estuaries where co2 variation is mainly due to biological processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords net ecosystem production biological processes carbon dioxide flux seasonal variability anthropogenic disturbance yellow river estuary 1 introduction estuaries and other near shore ecosystems are considered net heterotrophic environments acting as a source of co2 to the atmosphere and balancing the global net co2 uptake by continental shelves cai 2011 laruelle et al 2010 the total co2 emissions from european estuaries is 0 03 0 06 gt c yr 1 1 gt 1015 g frankignoulle et al 1998 equivalent to 5 10 of the total anthropogenic co2 emissions from western europe in 1995 however the role of estuaries as an atmospheric co2 source or sink is still a matter of debate estimates on the total co2 emissions from global estuaries are also gradually decreasing from 0 34 gt c yr 1 borges et al 2005 0 27 0 23 gt c yr 1 laruelle et al 2010 0 25 0 25 gt c yr 1 cai 2011 to 0 10 gt c yr 1 chen et al 2013 the disparity is due to the following firstly the current global estuarine co2 flux estimate is based on a limited dataset specifically the co2 flux estimates for particular asian estuaries guo et al 2009 sarma et al 2011 shim et al 2007 wang et al 2005 zhai and dai 2009 are under or overestimated due to limited spatiotemporal data laruelle et al 2010 for example the yellow river is the second longest river in china and sixth longest in the world however co2 flux data for the yellow river estuary yre are still lacking secondly highly heterotrophic estuaries are likely overrepresented in the global estimate and recent studies have shown low air sea co2 exchange rates for high emission estuarine environments harley et al 2015 m√∏rk et al 2016 in addition estuarine organic carbon metabolism is significantly more affected by nearby anthropogenic disturbance levels and climate change than any other aspect smith and hollibaugh 1993 regnier et al 2013 therefore to accurately estimate the co2 flux and the role of estuaries as carbon sources or sinks both spatiotemporal variations and the effects of anthropogenic disturbance should be considered estuaries are typically subject to natural hydrological changes and intense anthropogenic disturbances that are reflected in the elevated loading of detrital organic matter high respiration rates and the production of dissolved co2 time series observations from indian estuaries identified high co2 emissions 52 6 mol c m 2 yr 1 in godavari estuary because of high bacterial respiration due to high quantities of organic matter associated with high monsoonal river discharges sarma et al 2011 2012 simultaneously high levels of inorganic matter and nutrients were loaded due to anthropogenic disturbance which may support photosynthesis and the consumption of dissolved co2 for example dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations increased when water and sediment regulation measures were in place but decreased during natural flood periods in the yre liu et al 2014 the former enhances the photosynthesis rate but the latter does not aquatic metabolism represented by the gross primary productivity gpp ecosystem respiration er and net ecosystem production nep of the water column provides a useful composite indicator of aquatic ecosystem function cole et al 2000 gu et al 2011 shen et al 2015 nep analogous to net ecosystem metabolism nem is the difference between organic matter production and respiration and provides an estimate of the role of oceanic organic metabolism in the carbon budget muller karger et al 2005 smith and hollibaugh 1993 turner et al 2013 an ecosystem is identified as net autotrophic nep 0 if it produces more organic matter than it consumes and acts as an atmospheric co2 sink alternatively if organic consumption exceeds production nep 0 the system is identified as net heterotrophic and acts as a source of atmospheric co2 heterotrophy or autotrophy has a significant influence on dissolved co2 level and emissions sarma et al 2011 studies suggest that about 10 of the co2 outgassing from estuaries is sustained by the input from upstream freshwaters and 90 by local net heterotrophy borges and abril 2011 for these estuaries as the variability of co2 flux is predominantly controlled by changes in carbon concentrations from biological activities the nep reflects co2 fluxes generated from biological reactions as well as major co2 fluxes in the estuary the co2 emissions from intertidal zones and coastal marshes have been assessed in yellow river delta wetlands han et al 2013 sun et al 2018 however there was insufficient water air co2 partial pressure data pco2 in the yre thus annual co2 fluxes are yet to be determined here we estimated the aquatic metabolism of the yre and nep was used to represent the co2 flux from biological processes our objective is to clarify the effect of spatial and temporal variability on the role of the yre as an atmospheric co2 source or sink especially under the double influence of seasonal factors and anthropogenic disturbance artificial water and sediment regulation in addition we also want to clarify if the effects of water and sediment regulation on co2 flux were more significant than that of the seasonal factors 2 sampling and methods 2 1 study region and environmental monitoring the yre is in a temperate climate zone in north china 117 31 119 30 e 36 55 38 30 n with an arid and semiarid climate its sediment load as measured at lijin hydrometric station about 100 km from the gulf of bohai was 1 1 109 t yr 1 between the 1950s and 1970s annual water discharge prior to 1970 was consistently greater than 25 km3 yr 1 and greater than 90 km3 yr 1 for several years in the early 1960s however the sediment load and discharge decreased significantly due to intensive irrigation and damming from the 1950s to 2011 yang et al 1998 liu et al 2014 the flow was not high enough to transport sediment to the ocean and the water column in the estuary contains high sediment concentrations resulting in a perched river downstream since 2002 the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc has implemented an annual wsr scheme to prevent heavy sedimentation of the riverbed by releasing water from several dams in the middle and upper reaches of the river the enforced discharge events usually begin at the end of june and typically last for more than ten days two or three events can last a few dozens of days the frequency and timing of wsr events depend on dam storage river flow bottom sediment and seasonal precipitation thus annual wsr events provide the yre with a significant amount of nutrients organic carbon and high turbidity from river runoff bai et al 2012 shen et al 2015 the yre experiences a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with distinct seasons including high precipitation and warm temperatures in the summer months the inner estuary has a shallow water depth of 1 3 5 5 m we monitored the water chemistry at four sampling sites in the yre from 2009 to 2013 including may june august and september in 2009 april june and september in 2010 april june august and october in 2011 april and may in 2012 and june and december in 2013 fig 1 salinity ph water temperature dissolved oxygen do do saturation percentage do and chlorophyll a concentrations chl a were measured at 15 min intervals over one or three days using a hydrolab series ds5x multi parameter water quality data sonde hydrolab ds5x hach loveland co u s the

correction factor the monitoring time interval was 15 min thus we divided k by 4 to obtain a 15 min rate the 15 min wind and water temperature diffusion corrected rates of dissolved oxygen change were then summed over a 24 h period to calculate daily nep g o2 m 2d 1 or mg o2 l 1d 1 we present er value as positive nep that occurs at night was multiplied by 1 to give a night respiration rate ern where solar radiation at night was defined as 2 w m 2 ern divided by hours of night equals the hourly respiration rate g o2 m 2h 1 and er g o2 m 2d 1 equals the hourly respiration rate multiplied by 24 thus gpp nep er this assumes the hourly respiration rate is the same during the day and night a claim that is sometimes challenged but is currently consistent with most standard methods marcarelli et al 2010 some metabolism data in the oxygen unit g o2 m 2d 1 has been published tang et al 2015 shen et al 2015 2018 we assume that photosynthesis produces 1 mol of o2 for every mole of co2 consumed in the estuarine ecosystem similarly we assume respiration releases 1 mol of co2 for every mole of o2 consumed the metabolic oxygen unit g o2 m 2d 1 was converted to carbon units mmol co2 m 2d 1 by assuming 1 g o2 m 2d 1 is equal to 1 32 mol co2 m 2d 1 1 g o2 m 2d 1 1000 32 mmol co2 m 2d 1 nep estimates also represent the estuarine co2 flux caused by biological activities in aquatic ecosystems and it can allow us to determine estuary s role as a sink or a source of atmospheric co2 positive negative nep can result in sequestration emission of co2 and a sharp decrease increase in dic to calculate the co2 flux the estuarine surface area must be accurately estimated borges 2005 here we divided the estuarine area into two regions the inner estuary area and the outer estuary area firstly the inner estuary included the tidal watercourse and the coastline area fig 1 white area the tidal watercourse area is 20 km2 with 20 km annual average length and 1 km width of the tidal river section the coastline area is 30 km2 with a width of 0 2 km and a length of 150 km and water depth of this area is less than 2 m thus the inner estuary area is 50 km2 for the outer estuary area waters within 13 m depth limit were considered to be the outer boundary according to the bathymetric chart of bohai bay because the water depth range is less than 13 m in most areas of the yre due to sediment transportation from the middle reaches of the loess plateau and the deepest water depth is 20 m in the southern bohai bay peng et al 2012 sun et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 in order to distinguish the outer boundary of other estuaries which flow into bohai such as luan river estuary and xiaoqing river estuary xiao et al 2012 we set the near shore coastal waters as the big boundary in fig 1 bay blue area 119 0 119 30 e 37 30 38 0 n we used arcmap 10 2 to estimate outer estuary area co2 flux from biological processes was calculated using estuarine carbon flux per unit and estimated estuarine surface area 2 3 statistical analysis the average seasonal and monthly metabolism was computed by combining all samples obtained during 2009 2013 and aggregating and averaging the calculated fluxes according to the sampling month we applied repeated measures analysis of variance anova at a confidence level of 0 05 to test the differences in environmental factors and metabolism between different months seasons and sites using spss 22 to explain the variation in metabolism we performed principal component analysis pca for environmental factors redundancy analysis rda and variation partitioning analyses vpa using canoco 5 terbraak and smilauer 2012 3 results 3 1 variations in environmental parameters there were eleven short term high flow pulses from 2009 to 2013 in the yre maximum discharge

daily dissolved oxygen saturation ranged from 66 02 to 149 maximum values of do occurred in august table 1 fig 3g f 9 21 p 0 003 mean daily ph ranged from 7 86 to 10 14 and mean daily salinity ranged from 0 29 to 33 15 dissolved inorganic nitrogen content din ranged from 0 16 to 5 04 mg l 1 and dissolved inorganic phosphorus content dip analogous to soluble reactive phosphorus srp ranged from 0 02 to 0 75 mg l 1 the last four factors ph salinity and nutrients did not show significant monthly variations fig 3h and i pca was used to identify and correlate important environmental variables principal components 1 and 2 pc 1 and 2 accounted for 70 62 and 14 86 of the variance respectively combined pc 1 and 2 explain 85 48 of the total variance fig 4 a pc 1 is correlated with variables that are dependent on the discharge pulse such as high turbidity high cod high nutrients and low salinity maximum turbidity 1000 ntu and cod 80 mg l 1 both occurred in october 2011 when there was higher daily discharge 1500 m3 s 1 and lower salinity pc 2 is correlated with seasonally changing environmental factors such as high solar radiation and high chl a concentrations the environmental conditions at each site varied depending on the distance from the discharge source coastal site d is characterized by higher salinity lower turbidity lower cod and lower nutrients relative to the other 3 sites fig 4b the highest mean salinities were observed at site d because it is flushed by tidal action the remaining three sites are almost entirely filled with freshwater during peak discharge periods mean salinity 0 45 both maximum and minimum values of do occurred at site d 3 2 variations in metabolism and co2 flux from biological processes nep was highly variable during the sampling period fluctuating between 181 mmol c m 2 d 1 and 227 91 mmol c m 2 d 1 and averaging 16 83 92 14 mmol c m 2 d 1 table 2 and fig 5 the highly variable nep indicates that co2 sourcing or sinking from biological activities is also highly variable in the yre the observed average negative nep value of the estuary indicates the dominance of respiration over primary production table 2 therefore biological activities are a net source of atmospheric co2 in the estuary the mean value of co2 emitted from biological activities alone is 6 14 33 63 mol c m 2 yr 1 73 73 403 57 g c m 2 yr 1 nep of the estuary was highest in summer 52 03 91 96 mmol c m 2 d 1 and lowest in autumn 114 07 60 93 mmol c m 2 d 1 fig 5a table 2 inferring co2 influx from the atmosphere via net photosynthesis in summer and estuarine co2 efflux to the atmosphere via net respiration in autumn estuarine co2 degassing also occurred during spring 29 97 33 mmol c m 2 d 1 and winter 58 23 5 16 mmol c m 2 d 1 according to our nep values throughout the entire monitoring period average gpp was 73 86 86 80 mmol c m 2 d 1 though it fluctuated between 0 06 mmol c m 2 d 1 and 278 50 mmol c m 2 d 1 gpp was significantly high in summer 147 89 86 24 mmol c m 2 d 1 and low in winter 9 02 12 75 mmol c m 2 d 1 fig 5a average er was 92 79 58 94 mmol c m 2 d 1 in a range between 11 94 mmol c m 2 d 1 and 280 25 mmol c m 2 d 1 er was significantly higher in summer and autumn fig 5a peak values were observed in autumn 135 77 40 49 mmol c m 2 d 1 and lowest values were observed in spring 57 15 46 72 mmol c m 2 d 1 our results demonstrate that the yre acts as a co2 sink in the summer months due to high gpp rates and as a co2 source in autumn when er rates increase and gpp rates decrease the estuary also acts as a co2 source in spring and winter to a lesser extent as gpp rates decrease by a larger amount relative to the observed decrease in er however no significant difference in gpp er and nep was observed between the four monitoring sites and metabolism was highly variable at each site table 2 fig 5b this suggests that it may be reasonable to use the mean nep to estimate the co2 emissions in the entire yre the outer estuary area of yre was estimated at 1471 3 km2 using arcmap 10 2 the total surface area of the yre was estimated at 1521 3 km2 with a 50 km2 inner estuary area therefore the annual estuarine co2 emissions were estimated to be 0 11 0 61 tg c yr 1 1 tg 1012 g based on the mean nep 73 73 403 57 g c m 2 yr 1 and total estuarine surface area 1521 3 km2 calculated we compared monthly variations in metabolism rates especially before and after the occurrence of wsr fig 5c nep remain high after wsr reaching a maximum in august 127 89 21 51 mmol c m 2 d 1 and a minimum in september 122 56 70 53 mmol c m 2 d 1 fig 5c gpp increased and remained high following wsr reaching a maximum in august 239 02 32 35 mmol c m 2 d 1 and decreasing in september 35 08 51 71 mmol c m 2 d 1 er remained high after wsr in august 111 13 26 84 mmol c m 2 d 1 and reached a maximum in september 157 64 33 41 mmol c m 2 d 1 these results indicate a clear transition from a weak co2 sink 3 61 94 78 mmol c m 2 d 1 in june to a strong sink in august 127 89 21 51 mmol c m 2 d 1 after wsr was implemented although gpp and er increased simultaneously in august the former was larger resulting in a net estuarine co2 influx as the decrease in gpp significantly outweighed the increase in er the estuary recovered the following month becoming a strong co2 source in september 3 3 the main impacting factors on metabolism and co2 flux from biological processes rda identified the factors associated with metabolism axes 1 and 2 explained 55 36 and 7 15 of the variance in production and respiration respectively combined they explained 62 51 of the variance fig 6 a only three factors din dip and ph did not show significant correlation with metabolism the contribution of each environmental

a water temperature solar radiation and salinity were positively correlated with nep and therefore positively correlated with co2 sequestration rate discharge turbidity and cod showed significant negative correlation with nep p 0 01 giving a positive correlation with co2 emission rates fig 6a rda also identified the factors associated with metabolism at sites a c and coastal site d at sites a c axes 1 and 2 explained 50 23 and 9 75 of the variance in metabolism respectively combined they explained 59 97 of the variance table 3 only four factors din dip ph and salinity did not show significant correlation with metabolism the contribution of each environmental variable to the variance in metabolism p 0 05 was as follows do 31 5 turbidity 25 5 chl a 24 cod 17 5 discharge 15 4 water temperature 14 4 solar radiation 10 8 fig 6b table 3 at coastal site d axes 1 and 2 explained 77 40 and 12 92 of the variance in metabolism respectively combined they explained 90 32 of the variance fig 6c table 3 discharge turbidity and cod did not show significant correlation with metabolism the contribution of each environmental variable to the variance in metabolism p 0 05 was as follows do 63 1 chl a 29 2 water temperature 23 2 fig 6c table 3 vpa identified the contribution of environmental factors to the observed variability in estuarine metabolism the environmental factors were divided into two groups based on pca results fig 4a the first included variables associated with seasonal change including solar radiation water temperature and chl a the second included variables related to discharge events including discharge turbidity cod ph nutrients and salinity do mg l 1 and do were excluded from vpa vpa showed that the first group alone accounted for 39 60 of the variability and the second group alone accounted for 31 20 the two groups jointly accounted for 29 20 fig 7 these results suggest that seasonality and discharge events jointly affect estuarine production and respiration the impact of the latter is only slightly smaller than the former 4 discussions 4 1 variation of co2 flux and comparison to other estuaries to compare the difference of co2 flux from biological activities and air sea co2 flux from the whole estuarine water surface we estimated the air sea exchanges of co2 in the yre using directly measured co2 guo et al 2009 sarmar et al 2012 using pco2 water temperature and salinity data for may and september 2009 liu et al 2014 the co2 flux was 29 94 20 68 mmol m 2 d 1 in may 2009 slightly lower than our co2 flux data from biological activities in may table 2 36 26 39 86 mmol m 2 d 1 however the co2 flux for september 2009 51 75 38 76 mmol m 2 d 1 was far lower and the variability range from 2 99 to 87 66 mmol m 2 d 1 was much narrower than the co2 flux from biological activities 122 56 70 53 mmol m 2 d 1 from 25 to 181 mmol m 2 d 1 this suggests that one or a few monitoring trips cannot represent the entire co2 flux level especially given the large variations in discharge in september in our study high co2 emissions in autumn were balanced by high co2 sequestration in summer especially after wsr m√∏rk et al 2016 found that more than 30 of the air sea net co2 emissions in the roskilde fjord estuary in denmark was a result of two large fall and winter storms thus global estimates of air sea co2 exchange in estuarine systems need further study to determine whether relevant temporal variations especially under the effects of human activities are captured on a global scale estuaries are considered co2 sources estuaries between 23 5 and 50 n latitude have the largest flux per unit area 23 37 mmol c m 2 d 1 chen et al 2013 the estuarine type tidal systems show an average release of 18 2 mol co2 m 2 yr 1 laruelle et al 2013 thus the overall net co2 release 6 14 33 63 mol c m 2 yr 1 from the yre is lower than expected due to the effect of high summer co2 influx caused by enforced sediment discharge the co2 release from yre is comparable to the co2 flux calculated in the york river tidal system usa 5 6 mol c m 2 yr 1 37 2 n 76 4 w with similar latitude to the yre raymond et al 2000 compared to some estuaries published in chen et al 2013 the annual co2 emission from the yre was also low table 4 4 2 analysis of variation in co2 flux from biological processes multivariate analyses pca rda and vpa elucidated the reasons for seasonal and monthly variations of co2 flux in the yre in summer high discharge and turbidity associated with june wsr events transport elevated levels of detrital organic matter to the estuary fig 3a b c following these events rapid settling of coarse sand causes a decrease in flow turbidity during august fig 3b 200 ntu thus august gpp rates accelerate due to the combination of high water temperature chl a and solar radiation fig 3d e f simultaneously warm water temperatures and high organic matter also stimulated estuarine er rates during this month the gpp rates increased faster than the er rates resulting in estuarine co2 sequestration in summer especially after wsr the yre also experiences intense discharge pulse events in autumn due to high precipitation fig 2 high organic matter cod 42 8 mg l 1 transported during this high discharge season increases estuarine respiration rates and releases large quantities of dissolved co2 our results agree with previous studies that observed an increase in bacterial respiration during high discharge events due to the availability of organic carbon sarma et al 2009 shiah et al 2006 simultaneously gpp rates were limited by high turbidity and low solar radiation and low water temperature fig 3b f adding to the estuarine release of co2 in autumn in winter and spring gpp and er rates also remained low due to lower water temperatures solar radiation and chl a concentrations fig 3d e f we avoided monitoring metabolism during very high hydrological pulse periods monitoring discharge 1870 m3s 1 for the safety of monitoring equipment previous research found that dic concentrations in the yre increased during wsr floods but decreased during natural flood periods different water origins for the different types of floods account for the variability in dic liu et al 2014 during the wsr period floodwaters are mainly from upstream reservoirs which held waters of relatively high dic content co2 content however natural floodwaters originated primarily as rainwater with very low dic therefore it can be speculated that the high gpp rate was supported by the high dic content after wsr in summer which exceeds the increase in respiration so that the estuary changes from a weak co2 sink to a strong co2 sink the gpp rate can also be limited by low dic due to dilution in autumn no significant differences were observed in metabolism between the four monitoring sites fig 5b frequent discharge pulses likely caused some degree of water homogeneity across the estuary summer and autumn discharge events are the largest cause of observed variability in estuarine production and respiration rates however discharge events and seasonal factors only account for 62 51 of the variance based on rda fig 6a table 3 especially at coastal site d the discharge turbidity and cod did not show significant correlation with metabolism fig 6c table 3 this suggests that other factors must also contribute to the variability of production and respiration such as the tide action the exchange of organic matter and energy between the estuary and the open ocean 4 3 implications for co2 flux variation in the yellow river estuary studies on estuarine co2 emissions need to include spatiotemporal variations and the effects of anthropogenic disturbance although the yre as a whole is a source of atmospheric co2 the amount of co2 released is lower than the average estuarine value of mid latitude regions and shows high seasonal variability our findings therefore suggest a further lowering of the estimated global co2 release from estuarine systems we provided a research example for the conversion of oxygen metabolism to carbon metabolism to estimate of co2 emission a large amount of data calculated by aquatic metabolism is directly used in the statistics of global co2 emissions and c budget chen et al 2013 laruelle et al 2013 smith and hollibaugh 1993 therefore the nep calculated in the c unit can be used to estimate the co2 flux especially for those estuaries where co2 variation was mainly due to biological processes with the popularity of online dissolved oxygen monitoring technology continuous estimation of aquatic ecosystem metabolism can provide a new perspective for more accurate understanding of the spatiotemporal variation of co2 flux and estimates of co2 emissions 5 conclusions our study estimated the annual and seasonal co2 fluxes of china s yellow river estuary yre considering spatiotemporal variations and the effects of human activities wsr net ecosystem production nep was used to represent the co2 flux from biological activities and estimate co2 emission in the yre the annual co2 release was 6 14 33 63 mol c m 2 yr 1 from 2009 to 2013 and the annual co2 efflux from the 1521 3 km2 of estuarine surface area was 0 11 0 61 tg c yr 1 in the yre high co2 emissions in autumn were balanced by high co2 sequestration in summer which led to a lower annual net co2 efflux than expected in the yre across seasons the system changed from a source of atmospheric co2 during spring and winter to near neutral during earlier summer and a big sink during later summer after wsr later to a big source of atmospheric co2 during autumn discharge events and seasonality jointly affect estuarine co2 flux and the impact of the former is only slightly smaller than the latter high co2 sequestration in summer was mainly due to the combination of high water temperature chl a dic solar radiation and low turbidity discharge cod after wsr supporting the high gpp and exceeding the increase of er although the yre as a whole is a source of atmospheric co2 the amount of co2 released is lower than expected our findings therefore suggest a further lowering of the estimated global co2 release from estuarine systems the nep used to estimate the co2 flux also can be effective especially for those estuaries where co2 variation is mainly due to biological

18233,the performance of the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb is significantly governed by the hydrodynamics of the reactor though the influence of hydrodynamics on mass transfer granular size distribution and biogas production was well studied the interaction between biogas bubbles and anaerobic granular sludge ags is poorly understood this study used the impinging jet technique and bubble probe atomic force microscope afm to investigate the attachment and adhesion force between biogas bubbles ch4 and co2 and ags the fluxes of normalized ch4 or co2 bubble attachment on two kinds of ags were directly affected by gas velocity and decreased with an increase in the reynolds number ranged from 40 to 140 the bubble attachment had a positive linear relationship with the contact angles ratio of exopolymeric protein and polysaccharide and hydrophilic functional groups of ags a bubble probe afm was used to explore the adhesion force between a single bubble and ags the results indicated that the adhesion force between the bubbles and the two kinds of ags also decreased with increasing approach velocity overall these results contribute to a new insight into the understanding of interaction between biogas bubbles and ags in uasb reactors graphical abstract image 1 keywords up flow anaerobic sludge blanket bubble attachment impinging jet technique bubble probe atomic force microscope 1 introduction over the past decades anaerobic digestion has been widely used in the management of wastes and wastewaters as it reduces organic pollutants and produces renewable energy nguyen and khanal 2018 moreover it has undergone significant improvement due to the use of bio reactors that are based on granular sludge zhang et al 2012 among them up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb is one of the most widely used high rate anaerobic reactors for sewage treatment lettinga 2001 the performance of a uasb is significantly influenced by the mixing of wastewater with anaerobic granular sludge ags which is governed by the hydrodynamics of the reactor kundu et al 2014 the characteristics of hydrodynamics in a uasb have been studied extensively under different conditions batstone et al 2005 pe√±a et al 2006 ren et al 2009 in previous papers granular settlement in uasb was considered as stokes flow having a reynolds number lower than 1 gupta and gupta 2005 laguna et al 1999 however further research indicated that the reynolds number of ags in the typical uasb reactor fell in an intermediate flow regime category with the reynolds number between 1 and 500 tassew et al 2019 computational fluid dynamics cfd with eulerian eulerian model has often been used to characterize and optimize the hydrodynamics in a uasb wei et al 2019 however the gas phase in this model is considered as a continuum similar to the liquid phase though the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on mass transfer ags size distribution and biogas production are well studied afridi et al 2017 wu et al 2012a 2012b little is known about the interaction between biogas bubbles and ags ags has pores channels and cavities which are conducive to the transport of nutrients metabolites and biogas bubbles jiang et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 proposed that the micro bubbles of biogas inside ags diffused toward large size channels to form an observable bubble on ags at a certain time the bubble detaches from the surface of ags to form a crater in addition extracellular polymeric substances eps that are located outside ags govern the mass transfer of substances and products sheng et al 2010 as biogas bubbles must pass through the eps layer before detaching from ags into the liquid phase eps might play a crucial role in the interaction between biogas bubbles and ags hence the interaction between gas phase and solid phase especially the single bubble and ags has not been described suitably the impinging jet technique fig 1 a was initially used in the deposition of latex particles on glass surfaces dabro≈õ and van de ven 1983 dabros and vandeven 1987 then it was successfully used to describe the particle and submicron colloidal particles deposition dijt et al 1990 sanders et al 1995 furthermore yang et al 2003 measured the attachment of bubble flux onto a solid surface in an impinging jet stagnation flow indicating that both electrolyte concentration and hydrodynamic flow were key factors for the attachment flux hence the impinging jet technique might provide direct information on the attachment between biogas bubbles and ags even though both impinging jet technique and cfd can describe the hydrodynamics of uasb there is a difficulty to directly observe the interaction forces between biogas bubbles and ags at a single particle level atomic force microscope afm a powerful tool for sensitive force measurements has been widely used to quantitatively measure the interaction forces between a bubble and the surface of solids or cells cui et al 2016 ditscherlein et al 2018 xie et al 2015 it has led to further understanding of many physical and biological processes such as mining froth flotation and fermentation liu et al 2019 wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 the bubble probe afm technique where a gas bubble anchored on a tipless cantilever was applied as a force probe to measure the interaction forces between a bubble and substrates tabor et al 2011a 2011b vakarelski et al 2008 xie et al 2015 with the help of this technique previous studies investigated the interaction of a bubble and particles under different conditions cui et al 2017 xie et al 2015 furthermore nguyen et al 2003 2004 indicated that the repulsive force between a bubble and a hydrophilic particle increased with increasing approach velocities of afm tips this bubble probe afm technique with different approach velocities might provide a new insight into the interaction between a biogas bubble and ags which has important benefits on the optimization of hydrodynamics in uasb for the first time the interaction between ags and biogas bubble is investigated in this study both by impinging jet technique and bubble probe afm technique the attachment between biogas bubbles co2 and ch4 and ags at different reynolds numbers was studied using impinging jet technique in addition the adhesion force between a biogas bubble co2 and ch4 and ags was also studied by bubble probe afm at different approach velocities these results may contribute to a better and new insight into the understanding of surface interaction between biogas bubbles and ags in uasb 2 materials and methods 2 1 impinging jet experiment the impinging jet experiment system is shown in fig 1a two kinds of ags were collected from uasb treating wastewaters of beer factory agsb and protein factory agsp respectively the characteristics of these two kinds of ags are shown in table 1 the solution in the impinging jet apparatus was 0 9 nacl m v the ags was washed three times with 0 9 nacl and fixed on to the glass plate diameter of 6 50 cm with epoxy glue in one layer the gas bubbles were generated using a capillary tube inner diameter of 3 20 Œºm connected with a cylinder containing ch4 or co2 the process of bubbles rising to the glass plate was recorded by a high speed camera acuteye ketianjian co china as shown in fig s1a the number of bubbles attached to the ags plate was recorded by the camera image pro plus 6 0 was used for image processing bubble attachment density Œ≤ mm 2 which refers to the ratio of the number of attached bubbles to the area of the stagnation region radius of 300

2 2 force measurement by bubble probe afm as shown in fig 1b bubble probe afm nanowizard 4 bruker germany was used for force measurement before the experiment a glass sheet was immersed into a toluene solution containing 5 mm octadecyltrichlorosilane ots for about 1 s to produce a slightly hydrophobic glass sheet with a contact angle of 40 60 in order to immobilize bubbles the afm cantilever was a commercialized tipless silicon nitride cantilever np o10 bruker germany the tipless cantilever was placed in an electron beam thermal evaporator meb 600 kyky china to coat the film with 5 nm of titanium and 30 nm of gold to obtain a higher hydrophobicity than the glass sheet for bubble anchoring the coated cantilever was immersed in an ethanol solution with 10 mm dodecanethiol for 12 h and washed with ethanol ags with an average diameter of 2 mm was fixed on to the glass sheet with epoxy glue fig s2a the bubbles of ch4 or co2 were generated by a gas cylinder connected with a capillary tube and were immobilized on the ots modified glass sheet fig s2b a bubble probe was then prepared by selecting a bubble with radius of about 60 90 Œºm fig s1b the spring constant of the cantilever was determined to be 0 24 n m using the hutter bechhoefer method hutter and bechhoefer 1993 the interaction forces between the anchored biogas bubble and ags were measured in 0 01 m phosphate buffer solution pbs ph value of 7 4 at different approach velocities at least three pairs of bubble and ags were used in a set of experiment for a pair of bubble and ags at least 800 force curves were collected the force curves were not less than 200 at one approach velocity 2 3 hydrophilicity and Œ∂ potential of ags to evaluate the hydrophilicity of ags a contact angle goniometer jc2000d1 zhongchen co china was used to analyze the contact angle of ags against water and propanetriol at 25 c using the sessile drop method liu et al 2010 ags was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min and washed three times with 0 01 m pbs ph value of 7 4 the ags was obtained using 0 45 Œºm acetate cellulose membrane filters hou et al 2015 the filters were air dried for 10 min and deposited with 3 Œºl deionized water or propanetriol for 3 s each kind of ags was measured at least 7 times to obtain reliable average data the Œ∂ potential mv was determined using dynamic light scattering dls zetasizer nano zs malvern uk hou et al 2015 before determination ags was washed with 0 01 m pbs ph value of 7 4 and prepared in 10 ml pbs to a concentration of 0 1 gvss l 2 4 eps and xps analysis the eps was extracted using cation exchange resin method as described by feng et al 2018 the contents of polysaccharide ps and exopolymeric protein pn in eps were determined by phenol sulphuric method dubois et al 1956 and bca protein assay kit thermo fisher usa ras et al 2008 respectively the elemental composition and the local functionality of ags were measured by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250 thermo usa with an al kŒ± x ray source 1486 6 ev the ags was freeze dried overnight and a broad survey scan 20 0 ev pass energy was performed for the major element component analysis with a high resolution scan 70 0 ev pass energy for component speciation the binding energies were calibrated using containment carbon c1s 284 6 ev to compensate for surface charging effects the xps spectra peaks were fitted using xps peak 4 1 2 5 statistical analysis the correlation between adhesion fluxes and functional groups of ags was examined by pearson correlation analysis in spss 17 0 the statistical significance of the attachment and adhesion force between the bubbles and ags was estimated by the two tailed t test in spss 17 0 and differences was considered significant at p 0 05 and p 0 01 3 results 3 1 bubble attachment on ags the attachment of bubbles and ags is considered to occur when the bubbles attach to the ags layer excluding the bubbles attached to the ags layer for a short duration less than 1 s and then are swept away by the flow a typical video of bubble attachment is shown in the supporting information based on the feature of impinging jet technique the bubble attachment flux is uniform near the stagnation point fig s3 shows the time dependent change of normalized bubble attachment density of ch4 or co2 bubble onto two kinds of ags with the reynolds numbers ranging from 40 to 140 in a 0 9 nacl solution variation of the normalized ch4 or co2 bubble attachment density with time was described well by a linear function indicating a constant rate of bubble attachment that is normalized bubble attachment flux j expressed in eq 4 respected an average attachment flux in the whole experiment hence the mean fluxes of normalized ch4 or co2 bubble attachment onto two kinds of ags are given in fig 2 as shown in fig 2a the flux of ch4 bubble onto agsb decreased from 0 63 mm s to 0 05 mm s when the reynolds number increased from 37 to 125 similarly the mean flux of normalized co2 bubble attachment onto agsb was 0 41 mm s 0 18 mm s 0 07 mm s 0 06 mm s and 0 03 mm s with a reynolds number of 41 58 68 103 and 115 respectively fig 2c there was little difference between the attachment of ch4 and co2 onto agsb for example the flux of co2 bubble was 0 18 mm s when reynolds number was 58 while the j of ch4 bubble was 0 20 mm s with reynolds number of 54 fig 2b and d show j values of ch4 and co2 bubble attachment onto agsp and their trends are similar to the tendency of attachment between the bubbles onto agsb hence the bubble attachment was directly affected by gas velocity with reynolds number ranging between 30 and 120 however there was an obvious difference in the attachment of biogas bubbles onto different ags the flux of ch4 onto agsb was 0 05 mm s with reynolds number being 63 while the flux of ch4 onto agsp was 0 12 mm s when reynolds number was 71 similarly the flux of co2 onto agsb and agsp was 0 07 mm s and 0 12 mm s with reynolds number of 68 and 75 respectively hence the attachment of ch4 or co2 onto agsp was greater than that of agsb within the reynolds numbers range used in this study in particular the fluxes of ch4 onto agsp were significantly higher than that of agsb p 0 01 when the reynolds numbers ranged from 60 to 80 3 2 surface characteristics of ags responsible for bubble attachment to identify the relationship between ags and bubble attachment described above the surface characteristics of ags were studied as shown in table 1 the water contact angles of agsb and agsp were 61 09 and 58 50 respectively this indicated that the surfaces of agsb and agsp were hydrophilic hou et al 2015 ma et al 2007 in addition the oil contact angle suggested that the agsb had less oil wettability than agsp table 1 also shows that both ags are negatively charged 23 80 mv and 25 14 mv for agsb and agsp respectively for both ags pn was the main component in eps which is considered to govern the surface charge of ags liu et al 2004 agsb had a higher pn content and a higher ratio of pn ps compared to agsp previous research indicated that pn could improve the hydrophobicity of cell surface zhu et al 2012 a higher pn ps ratios in eps shows stronger hydrophobicity mei et al 2009 sheng et al 2010 sp√§th et al 1998 however li et al demonstrated that the pn was mainly located inside the ags and the amount on the surface was negligible li et al 2016 besides the surface charge had a good negative linear relationship with the ratio of pn ps zhu et al 2015 these results were consistent with the contact angles of ags to identify the potential reason for the different bubble attachment onto ags the elemental composition of ags was determined by xps in the energy range from 0 ev to 1200 ev fig 3 a as shown in table 2 the ratios of o c for agsb and agsp were 1 241 and 0 755 respectively the increment of o c ratio could render the hydrophilic feature of the surface fu et al 2014 from fig 3b and c the c1s scan consisted of four peaks c c h 283 65 ev c o n 284 95 ev c o or o c o 287 ev and ho c o or ro c o 288 5 ev the c c h peak from the side chains of lipids or amino acids was dominant in both ags in terms of total carbon element accounting for 13 2 in agsb and 21 1 in agsp however the relative intensities of the other three peaks oxygen related functional groups in agsb were higher than those in agsp fig 3d and e show that o 1s peaks are assigned to c o 530 39 ev and c o c 531 49 ev c o c was the main oxygen functional group in both ags displaying 69 77 in agsb and 71 42 in agsp without significant difference the n 1s peaks shown in fig 3f and g were decomposed into two component peaks one peak at 398 89 ev was a non protonated nitrogen peak of amines and amides and the other peak at about 399 5 ev was protonated nitrogen of amino acids and amino sugars song et al 2014 the non protonated nitrogen in agsb was lower than that in agsp whereas the protonated nitrogen was agsb was higher than that in agsp the correlation between fluxes of normalized ch4 or co2 bubble attachment onto ags and functional groups were calculated using pearson correlation coefficient as shown in fig s4 the fluxes of bubble attachment were positively correlated with c o n c o or o c o ho c o or ro c o c o and protonated nitrogen however they were negatively correlated with c c h c o c or c o h and non protonated nitrogen 3 3 forces measure between ags and bubble fig 4 shows the adhesion forces and typical force signatures between ch4 or co2 bubble and two kinds of ags at different approach velocities as shown in fig 4a when a ch4 bubble approached agsb with the velocity of 2 Œºm s most of the force curves showed large peaks of adhesion force in the range of 6786 35304 nn m however when the approach velocity increased the adhesion force between ch4 bubble and agsb decreased 6419 30854 nn m with 5 Œºm s 5822 28000 nn m with 8 Œºm s 8138 25140 nn m with 10 Œºm s the force curves between ch4 and agsp were 4832 nn m to 138595 nn m 12268 nn m to 81656 nn m 7876 nn m to 41549 nn m and 8245 nn m to 22503 nn m with an approach velocity of 2 Œºm s 5 Œºm s 8 Œºm s and 10 Œºm s respectively fig 4b the force curves between co2 and the two kinds of ags had a similar tendency as shown in fig 4c and d fig 5 a shows that the mean adhesion force of ch4 bubble approaching agsb at a velocity of 2 Œºm s was 22005 4927 nn m n 326 force curves high standard deviations of the mean values were due to the high heterogeneity of ags which has already been reported gonzalez gil et al 2001 he et al 2019 the mean adhesion forces of ch4 bubble onto agsb with approach velocity of 5 Œºm s 8 Œºm s and 10 Œºm s were 19563 6302 nn m n 588 16964 7588 nn m n 399 and 12987 3088 nn m n 307 respectively as expected the adhesion force decreased with an increase in approach velocity the adhesion forces of ch4 on agsp with approach velocities of 2 Œºm s 5 Œºm s 8 Œºm s and 10 Œºm s were 28429 19338 nn m n 556 22331 8755 nn m n 484 17140 5550 nn m n 404 and 14570 2685 nn m n 402 respectively which were significantly higher than that between ch4 bubble and agsb p 0 01 in addition the adhesion force between co2 and two kinds of ags also decreased with increasing approach velocity as shown in fig 5b consistent with the impinging jet results the adhesion force between the bubbles and agsp was greater than that between bubbles and agsb at the same approach velocity for example when the approach velocity was 2 Œºm s the mean adhesion forces of co2 on agsb and agsp were 18108 10901 nn m n 498 and 21741 10647 nn m n 615 respectively 4 discussions bubble transport in uasb is mainly driven by hydrodynamic forces the first step in successfully attaching the bubbles onto solids such as ags was enough contact time for both bubbles and the ags surface so that the bubbles could deform and slide along the ags surface to reach the maximum collision angle then the liquid film between the bubble and ags surface was thinned to a critical thickness and ruptured to form a three phase contact this three phase contact was expansion and formation for a stable aggregate phan et al 2003 xing et al 2017 however in an intermediate flow regime the liquid flow field around the bubble became more fore and aft asymmetric with an increase in reynolds number phan et al 2003 the liquid streamlines were compressed towards the front of the bubble surface thereby affecting the direction of radial liquid velocity before the liquid approached the bubble equator hence the collision angle of these bubbles was smaller than that with reynolds number of 0 when the bubble approached the surface rapidly there was not enough time for effective attachment the bubble is displaced by the following one in addition the calculations suggested that an increase in bubble approach velocity enhanced the critical thickness of the liquid film albijanic et al 2018 bubble probe afm results also indicated that the liquid film thickness for a bubble approach velocity of 1 Œºm s and 10 Œºm s was 26 nm and 35 nm respectively xing et al 2018 this delays the successful bubbles attachment onto ags hence the normalized bubble attachment flux in uasb decreased with an increase in reynolds number the approach velocity of bubbles had a significant influence on hydrodynamics which together with surface forces played an important role in the interaction of bubbles to ags xie et al 2015 in uasb suitable turbulence contributes to the detachment of biogas bubbles from ags rico et al 2017 however a high degree of turbulence characterized by a high reynolds number leads to the disintegration of granular sludge bassani et al 2016 in addition if the attachment time between biogas bubbles and ags is longer than the hydraulic retention time the ags will be washed out for the attachment of biogas bubbles the hydrophilic or hydrophobic interaction between hydrophilic or hydrophobic colloid and surface strongly affects the particle bubble interaction ≈°kvarla and kmet 1993 there was a strong attraction between air bubble and hydrophobic particles whereas the hydrophilic particles were strongly repelled by air bubbles fielden et al 1996 several studies have been carried out to improve hydrophobicity by reducing surface hydroxyl groups through hydrophobic treatment of glass sheets glass microspheres chen et al 2017 ishida 2007 zhang et al 2019 in addition previous results indicated that polar groups such as oh co and nh2 were responsible for the hydrophilicity of ags li et al 2016 the contents of co in agsb was higher than that in agsp suggesting more hydrophilicity which was consist with the oil contact angles results table 2 in addition cola√ßo et al 2009 indicated that bubbles could be stabilized by the geographic heterogeneity of pores and grooves on weak hydrophobic surfaces the Œ∂ potential is a key parameter to control the interaction between bubbles and colloids in this study both ags have a negative surface with the Œ∂ potential of 23 80 mv for agsb and 25 14 mv for agsp respectively due to the adsorption of polarized anions on the bubbles surface the gas bubbles in aqueous solution always have negative charges within a wide ph value ranging from 3 to 11 yang et al 2001 2003 hence there might be electrostatic repulsion between the ags and the biogas bubble the afm results were consistent with the impinging jet experiment indicating agsp had greater adhesion force than agsb due to its more hydrophobic surface when bubbles were separated from the surface of ags the adhesion force on the surface of granular sludge affected the mass transfer efficiency the yield and production rate of biogas thus affecting the stable operation of anaerobic reactors in addition this study can be used to guide the optimization of the surface properties of ags thereby increasing methane production and stabilizing the reactor furthermore the real biogas bubble composition is more complicated and needs further research 5 conclusions to our best knowledge this is the first study that applies impinging jet technique and bubble probe afm to explore the interaction between bubbles and anaerobic granular sludge ags in uasb the results obtained revealed that the fluxes of normalized ch4 or co2 bubble attachment onto ags decreased with an increase in the reynolds number due to the change in collision angle and the enhancement of the liquid film in addition for the more hydrophobic surface and oxygen containing functional groups the attachment of bubbles ch4 and co2 onto agsp was greater than that onto agsb within the same reynolds number range the flux of ch4 onto agsp was 0 12 0 007 mm s when the reynolds numbers was 71 which was significantly higher than that of agsb 0 05 0 001 mm s when the reynolds numbers was 63 p 0 01 similar to the impinging jet results the bubble probe afm results also indicated that the adhesion forces between the bubbles ch4 and co2 and ags deceased with increasing approach velocity the adhesion force of ch4 on agsp with approach velocities of 5 Œºm s was significantly higher than that between ch4 bubble and agsb p 0 01 thus these results are expected to fulfill the knowledge on the influence of hydrodynamics on the interaction between biogas bubbles and ags declaration of competing

18233,the performance of the up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb is significantly governed by the hydrodynamics of the reactor though the influence of hydrodynamics on mass transfer granular size distribution and biogas production was well studied the interaction between biogas bubbles and anaerobic granular sludge ags is poorly understood this study used the impinging jet technique and bubble probe atomic force microscope afm to investigate the attachment and adhesion force between biogas bubbles ch4 and co2 and ags the fluxes of normalized ch4 or co2 bubble attachment on two kinds of ags were directly affected by gas velocity and decreased with an increase in the reynolds number ranged from 40 to 140 the bubble attachment had a positive linear relationship with the contact angles ratio of exopolymeric protein and polysaccharide and hydrophilic functional groups of ags a bubble probe afm was used to explore the adhesion force between a single bubble and ags the results indicated that the adhesion force between the bubbles and the two kinds of ags also decreased with increasing approach velocity overall these results contribute to a new insight into the understanding of interaction between biogas bubbles and ags in uasb reactors graphical abstract image 1 keywords up flow anaerobic sludge blanket bubble attachment impinging jet technique bubble probe atomic force microscope 1 introduction over the past decades anaerobic digestion has been widely used in the management of wastes and wastewaters as it reduces organic pollutants and produces renewable energy nguyen and khanal 2018 moreover it has undergone significant improvement due to the use of bio reactors that are based on granular sludge zhang et al 2012 among them up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb is one of the most widely used high rate anaerobic reactors for sewage treatment lettinga 2001 the performance of a uasb is significantly influenced by the mixing of wastewater with anaerobic granular sludge ags which is governed by the hydrodynamics of the reactor kundu et al 2014 the characteristics of hydrodynamics in a uasb have been studied extensively under different conditions batstone et al 2005 pe√±a et al 2006 ren et al 2009 in previous papers granular settlement in uasb was considered as stokes flow having a reynolds number lower than 1 gupta and gupta 2005 laguna et al 1999 however further research indicated that the reynolds number of ags in the typical uasb reactor fell in an intermediate flow regime category with the reynolds number between 1 and 500 tassew et al 2019 computational fluid dynamics cfd with eulerian eulerian model has often been used to characterize and optimize the hydrodynamics in a uasb wei et al 2019 however the gas phase in this model is considered as a continuum similar to the liquid phase though the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on mass transfer ags size distribution and biogas production are well studied afridi et al 2017 wu et al 2012a 2012b little is known about the interaction between biogas bubbles and ags ags has pores channels and cavities which are conducive to the transport of nutrients metabolites and biogas bubbles jiang et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 proposed that the micro bubbles of biogas inside ags diffused toward large size channels to form an observable bubble on ags at a certain time the bubble detaches from the surface of ags to form a crater in addition extracellular polymeric substances eps that are located outside ags govern the mass transfer of substances and products sheng et al 2010 as biogas bubbles must pass through the eps layer before detaching from ags into the liquid phase eps might play a crucial role in the interaction between biogas bubbles and ags hence the interaction between gas phase and solid phase especially the single bubble and ags has not been described suitably the impinging jet technique fig 1 a was initially used in the deposition of latex particles on glass surfaces dabro≈õ and van de ven 1983 dabros and vandeven 1987 then it was successfully used to describe the particle and submicron colloidal particles deposition dijt et al 1990 sanders et al 1995 furthermore yang et al 2003 measured the attachment of bubble flux onto a solid surface in an impinging jet stagnation flow indicating that both electrolyte concentration and hydrodynamic flow were key factors for the attachment flux hence the impinging jet technique might provide direct information on the attachment between biogas bubbles and ags even though both impinging jet technique and cfd can describe the hydrodynamics of uasb there is a difficulty to directly observe the interaction forces between biogas bubbles and ags at a single particle level atomic force microscope afm a powerful tool for sensitive force measurements has been widely used to quantitatively measure the interaction forces between a bubble and the surface of solids or cells cui et al 2016 ditscherlein et al 2018 xie et al 2015 it has led to further understanding of many physical and biological processes such as mining froth flotation and fermentation liu et al 2019 wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 the bubble probe afm technique where a gas bubble anchored on a tipless cantilever was applied as a force probe to measure the interaction forces between a bubble and substrates tabor et al 2011a 2011b vakarelski et al 2008 xie et al 2015 with the help of this technique previous studies investigated the interaction of a bubble and particles under different conditions cui et al 2017 xie et al 2015 furthermore nguyen et al 2003 2004 indicated that the repulsive force between a bubble and a hydrophilic particle increased with increasing approach velocities of afm tips this bubble probe afm technique with different approach velocities might provide a new insight into the interaction between a biogas bubble and ags which has important benefits on the optimization of hydrodynamics in uasb for the first time the interaction between ags and biogas bubble is investigated in this study both by impinging jet technique and bubble probe afm technique the attachment between biogas bubbles co2 and ch4 and ags at different reynolds numbers was studied using impinging jet technique in addition the adhesion force between a biogas bubble co2 and ch4 and ags was also studied by bubble probe afm at different approach velocities these results may contribute to a better and new insight into the understanding of surface interaction between biogas bubbles and ags in uasb 2 materials and methods 2 1 impinging jet experiment the impinging jet experiment system is shown in fig 1a two kinds of ags were collected from uasb treating wastewaters of beer factory agsb and protein factory agsp respectively the characteristics of these two kinds of ags are shown in table 1 the solution in the impinging jet apparatus was 0 9 nacl m v the ags was washed three times with 0 9 nacl and fixed on to the glass plate diameter of 6 50 cm with epoxy glue in one layer the gas bubbles were generated using a capillary tube inner diameter of 3 20 Œºm connected with a cylinder containing ch4 or co2 the process of bubbles rising to the glass plate was recorded by a high speed camera acuteye ketianjian co china as shown in fig s1a the number of bubbles attached to the ags plate was recorded by the camera image pro plus 6 0 was used for image processing bubble attachment density Œ≤ mm 2 which refers to the ratio of the number of attached bubbles to the area of the stagnation region radius of 300 Œºm was chosen to characterize the results of bubble attachment as expressed in eq 1 yang et al 2003 1 Œ≤ n t œÄ r s 2 where n t is the number of bubbles generated and rs is the radius of the circular

impinging jet system 5 re œÅ f v 0 r Œº f where œÅf is the density of the solution 1000 kg m3 v0 is the mean velocity at the capillary outlet m s and Œºf is the dynamic viscosity of the solution pa s 2 2 force measurement by bubble probe afm as shown in fig 1b bubble probe afm nanowizard 4 bruker germany was used for force measurement before the experiment a glass sheet was immersed into a toluene solution containing 5 mm octadecyltrichlorosilane ots for about 1 s to produce a slightly hydrophobic glass sheet with a contact angle of 40 60 in order to immobilize bubbles the afm cantilever was a commercialized tipless silicon nitride cantilever np o10 bruker germany the tipless cantilever was placed in an electron beam thermal evaporator meb 600 kyky china to coat the film with 5 nm of titanium and 30 nm of gold to obtain a higher hydrophobicity than the glass sheet for bubble anchoring the coated cantilever was immersed in an ethanol solution with 10 mm dodecanethiol for 12 h and washed with ethanol ags with an average diameter of 2 mm was fixed on to the glass sheet with epoxy glue fig s2a the bubbles of ch4 or co2 were generated by a gas cylinder connected with a capillary tube and were immobilized on the ots modified glass sheet fig s2b a bubble probe was then prepared by selecting a bubble with radius of about 60 90 Œºm fig s1b the spring constant of the cantilever was determined to be 0 24 n m using the hutter bechhoefer method hutter and bechhoefer 1993 the interaction forces between the anchored biogas bubble and ags were measured in 0 01 m phosphate buffer solution pbs ph value of 7 4 at different approach velocities at least three pairs of bubble and ags were used in a set of experiment for a pair of bubble and ags at least 800 force curves were collected the force curves were not less than 200 at one approach velocity 2 3 hydrophilicity and Œ∂ potential of ags to evaluate the hydrophilicity of ags a contact angle goniometer jc2000d1 zhongchen co china was used to analyze the contact angle of ags against water and propanetriol at 25 c using the sessile drop method liu et al 2010 ags was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min and washed three times with 0 01 m pbs ph value of 7 4 the ags was obtained using 0 45 Œºm acetate cellulose membrane filters hou et al 2015 the filters were air dried for 10 min and deposited with 3 Œºl deionized water or propanetriol for 3 s each kind of ags was measured at least 7 times to obtain reliable average data the Œ∂ potential mv was determined using dynamic light scattering dls zetasizer nano zs malvern uk hou et al 2015 before determination ags was washed with 0 01 m pbs ph value of 7 4 and prepared in 10 ml pbs to a concentration of 0 1 gvss l 2 4 eps and xps analysis the eps was extracted using cation exchange resin method as described by feng et al 2018 the contents of polysaccharide ps and exopolymeric protein pn in eps were determined by phenol sulphuric method dubois et al 1956 and bca protein assay kit thermo fisher usa ras et al 2008 respectively the elemental composition and the local functionality of ags were measured by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250 thermo usa with an al kŒ± x ray source 1486 6 ev the ags was freeze dried overnight and a broad survey scan 20 0 ev pass energy was performed for the major element component analysis with a high resolution scan 70 0 ev pass energy for component speciation the binding energies were calibrated using containment carbon c1s 284 6 ev to compensate for surface charging effects the xps spectra peaks were fitted using xps peak 4 1 2 5 statistical analysis the correlation between adhesion fluxes and functional groups of ags was examined by pearson correlation analysis in spss 17 0 the statistical significance of the attachment and adhesion force between the bubbles and ags was estimated by the two tailed t test in spss 17 0 and differences was considered significant at p 0 05 and p 0 01 3 results 3 1 bubble attachment on ags the attachment of bubbles and ags is considered to occur when the bubbles attach to the ags layer excluding the bubbles attached to the ags layer for a short duration less than 1 s and then are swept away by the flow a typical video of bubble attachment is shown in the supporting information based on the feature of impinging jet technique the bubble attachment flux is uniform near the stagnation point fig s3 shows the time dependent change of normalized bubble attachment density of ch4 or co2 bubble onto two kinds of ags with the reynolds numbers ranging from 40 to 140 in a 0 9 nacl solution variation of the normalized ch4 or co2 bubble attachment density with time was described well by a linear function indicating a constant rate of bubble attachment that is normalized bubble attachment flux j expressed in eq 4 respected an average attachment flux in the whole experiment hence the mean fluxes of normalized ch4 or co2 bubble attachment onto two kinds of ags are given in fig 2 as shown in fig 2a the flux of ch4 bubble onto agsb decreased from 0 63 mm s to 0 05 mm s when the reynolds number increased from 37 to 125 similarly the mean flux of normalized co2 bubble attachment onto agsb was 0 41 mm s 0 18 mm s 0 07 mm s 0 06 mm s and 0 03 mm s with a reynolds number of 41 58 68 103 and 115 respectively fig 2c there was little difference between the attachment of ch4 and co2 onto agsb for example the flux of co2 bubble was 0 18 mm s when reynolds number was 58 while the j of ch4 bubble was 0 20 mm s with reynolds number of 54 fig 2b and d show j values of ch4 and co2 bubble attachment onto agsp and their trends are similar to the tendency of attachment between the bubbles onto agsb hence the bubble attachment was directly affected by gas velocity with reynolds number ranging between 30 and 120 however there was an obvious difference in the attachment of biogas bubbles onto different ags the flux of ch4 onto agsb was 0 05 mm s with reynolds number being 63 while the flux of ch4 onto agsp was 0 12 mm s when reynolds number was 71 similarly the flux of co2 onto agsb and agsp was 0 07 mm s and 0 12 mm s with reynolds number of 68 and 75 respectively hence the attachment of ch4 or co2 onto agsp was greater than that of agsb within the reynolds numbers range used in this study in particular the fluxes of ch4 onto agsp were significantly higher than that of agsb p 0 01 when the reynolds numbers ranged from 60 to 80 3 2 surface characteristics of ags responsible for bubble attachment to identify the relationship between ags and bubble attachment described above the surface characteristics of ags were studied as shown in table 1 the water contact angles of agsb and agsp were 61 09 and 58 50 respectively this indicated that the surfaces of agsb and agsp were hydrophilic hou et al 2015 ma et al 2007 in addition the oil contact angle suggested that the agsb had less oil wettability than agsp table 1 also shows that both ags are negatively charged 23 80 mv and 25 14 mv for agsb and agsp respectively for both ags pn was the main component in eps which is considered to govern the surface charge of ags liu et al 2004 agsb had a higher pn content and a higher ratio of pn ps compared to agsp previous research indicated that pn could improve the hydrophobicity of cell surface zhu et al 2012 a higher pn ps ratios in eps shows stronger hydrophobicity mei et al 2009 sheng et al 2010 sp√§th et al 1998 however li et al demonstrated that the pn was mainly located inside the ags and the amount on the surface was negligible li et al 2016 besides the surface charge had a good negative linear relationship with the ratio of pn ps zhu et al 2015 these results were consistent with the contact angles of ags to identify the potential reason for the different bubble attachment onto ags the elemental composition of ags was determined by xps in the energy range from 0 ev to 1200 ev fig 3 a as shown in table 2 the ratios of o c for agsb and agsp were 1 241 and 0 755 respectively the increment of o c ratio could render the hydrophilic feature of the surface fu et al 2014 from fig 3b and c the c1s scan consisted of four peaks c c h 283 65 ev c o n 284 95 ev c o or o c o 287 ev and ho c o or ro c o 288 5 ev the c c h peak from the side chains of lipids or amino acids was dominant in both ags in terms of total carbon element accounting for 13 2 in agsb and 21 1 in agsp however the relative intensities of the other three peaks oxygen related functional groups in agsb were higher than those in agsp fig 3d and e show that o 1s peaks are assigned to c o 530 39 ev and c o c 531 49 ev c o c was the main oxygen functional group in both ags displaying 69 77 in agsb and 71 42 in agsp without significant difference the n 1s peaks shown in fig 3f and g were decomposed into two component peaks one peak at 398 89 ev was a non protonated nitrogen peak of amines and amides and the other peak at about 399 5 ev was protonated nitrogen of amino acids and amino sugars song et al 2014 the non protonated nitrogen in agsb was lower than that in agsp whereas the protonated nitrogen was agsb was higher than that in agsp the correlation between fluxes of normalized ch4 or co2 bubble attachment onto ags and functional groups were calculated using pearson correlation coefficient as shown in fig s4 the fluxes of bubble attachment were positively correlated with c o n c o or o c o ho c o or ro c o c o and protonated nitrogen however they were negatively correlated with c c h c o c or c o h and non protonated nitrogen 3 3 forces measure between ags and bubble fig 4 shows the adhesion forces and typical force signatures between ch4 or co2 bubble and two kinds of ags at different approach velocities as shown in fig 4a when a ch4 bubble approached agsb with the velocity of 2 Œºm s most of the force curves showed large peaks of adhesion force in the range of 6786 35304 nn m however when the approach velocity increased the adhesion force between ch4 bubble and agsb decreased 6419 30854 nn m with 5 Œºm s 5822 28000 nn m with 8 Œºm s 8138 25140 nn m with 10 Œºm s the force curves between ch4 and agsp were 4832 nn m to 138595 nn m 12268 nn m to 81656 nn m 7876 nn m to 41549 nn m and 8245 nn m to 22503 nn m with an approach velocity of 2 Œºm s 5 Œºm s 8 Œºm s and 10 Œºm s respectively fig 4b the force curves between co2 and the two kinds of ags had a similar tendency as shown in fig 4c and d fig 5 a shows that the mean adhesion force of ch4 bubble approaching agsb at a velocity of 2 Œºm s was 22005 4927 nn m n 326 force curves high standard deviations of the mean values were due to the high heterogeneity of ags which has already been reported gonzalez gil et al 2001 he et al 2019 the mean adhesion forces of ch4 bubble onto agsb with approach velocity of 5 Œºm s 8 Œºm s and 10 Œºm s were 19563 6302 nn m n 588 16964 7588 nn m n 399 and 12987 3088 nn m n 307 respectively as expected the adhesion force decreased with an increase in approach velocity the adhesion forces of ch4 on agsp with approach velocities of 2 Œºm s 5 Œºm s 8 Œºm s and 10 Œºm s were 28429 19338 nn m n 556 22331 8755 nn m n 484 17140 5550 nn m n 404 and 14570 2685 nn m n 402 respectively which were significantly higher than that between ch4 bubble and agsb p 0 01 in addition the adhesion force between co2 and two kinds of ags also decreased with increasing approach velocity as shown in fig 5b consistent with the impinging jet results the adhesion force between the bubbles and agsp was greater than that between bubbles and agsb at the same approach velocity for example when the approach velocity was 2 Œºm s the mean adhesion forces of co2 on agsb and agsp were 18108 10901 nn m n 498 and 21741 10647 nn m n 615 respectively 4 discussions bubble transport in uasb is mainly driven by hydrodynamic forces the first step in successfully attaching the bubbles onto solids such as ags was enough contact time for both bubbles and the ags surface so that the bubbles could deform and slide along the ags surface to reach the maximum collision angle then the liquid film between the bubble and ags surface was thinned to a critical thickness and ruptured to form a three phase contact this three phase contact was expansion and formation for a stable aggregate phan et al 2003 xing et al 2017 however in an intermediate flow regime the liquid flow field around the bubble became more fore and aft asymmetric with an increase in reynolds number phan et al 2003 the liquid streamlines were compressed towards the front of the bubble surface thereby affecting the direction of radial liquid velocity before the liquid approached the bubble equator hence the collision angle of these bubbles was smaller than that with reynolds number of 0 when the bubble approached the surface rapidly there was not enough time for effective attachment the bubble is displaced by the following one in addition the calculations suggested that an increase in bubble approach velocity enhanced the critical thickness of the liquid film albijanic et al 2018 bubble probe afm results also indicated that the liquid film thickness for a bubble approach velocity of 1 Œºm s and 10 Œºm s was 26 nm and 35 nm respectively xing et al 2018 this delays the successful bubbles attachment onto ags hence the normalized bubble attachment flux in uasb decreased with an increase in reynolds number the approach velocity of bubbles had a significant influence on hydrodynamics which together with surface forces played an important role in the interaction of bubbles to ags xie et al 2015 in uasb suitable turbulence contributes to the detachment of biogas bubbles from ags rico et al 2017 however a high degree of turbulence characterized by a high reynolds number leads to the disintegration of granular sludge bassani et al 2016 in addition if the attachment time between biogas bubbles and ags is longer than the hydraulic retention time the ags will be washed out for the attachment of biogas bubbles the hydrophilic or hydrophobic interaction between hydrophilic or hydrophobic colloid and surface strongly affects the particle bubble interaction ≈°kvarla and kmet 1993 there was a strong attraction between air bubble and hydrophobic particles whereas the hydrophilic particles were strongly repelled by air bubbles fielden et al 1996 several studies have been carried out to improve hydrophobicity by reducing surface hydroxyl groups through hydrophobic treatment of glass sheets glass microspheres chen et al 2017 ishida 2007 zhang et al 2019 in addition previous results indicated that polar groups such as oh co and nh2 were responsible for the hydrophilicity of ags li et al 2016 the contents of co in agsb was higher than that in agsp suggesting more hydrophilicity which was consist with the oil contact angles results table 2 in addition cola√ßo et al 2009 indicated that bubbles could be stabilized by the geographic heterogeneity of pores and grooves on weak hydrophobic surfaces the Œ∂ potential is a key parameter to control the interaction between bubbles and colloids in this study both ags have a negative surface with the Œ∂ potential of 23 80 mv for agsb and 25 14 mv for agsp respectively due to the adsorption of polarized anions on the bubbles surface the gas bubbles in aqueous solution always have negative charges within a wide ph value ranging from 3 to 11 yang et al 2001 2003 hence there might be electrostatic repulsion between the ags and the biogas bubble the afm results were consistent with the impinging jet experiment indicating agsp had greater adhesion force than agsb due to its more hydrophobic surface when bubbles were separated from the surface of ags the adhesion force on the surface of granular sludge affected the mass transfer efficiency the yield and production rate of biogas thus affecting the stable operation of anaerobic reactors in addition this study can be used to guide the optimization of the surface properties of ags thereby increasing methane production and stabilizing the reactor furthermore the real biogas bubble composition is more complicated and needs further research 5 conclusions to our best knowledge this is the first study that applies impinging jet technique and bubble probe afm to explore the interaction between bubbles and anaerobic granular sludge ags in uasb the results obtained revealed that the fluxes of normalized ch4 or co2 bubble attachment onto ags decreased with an increase in the reynolds number due to the change in collision angle and the enhancement of the liquid film in addition for the more hydrophobic surface and oxygen containing functional groups the attachment of bubbles ch4 and co2 onto agsp was greater than that onto agsb within the same reynolds number range the flux of ch4 onto agsp was 0 12 0 007 mm s when the reynolds numbers was 71 which was significantly higher than that of agsb 0 05 0 001 mm s when the reynolds numbers was 63 p 0 01 similar to the impinging jet results the bubble probe afm results also indicated that the adhesion forces between the bubbles ch4 and co2 and ags deceased with increasing approach velocity the adhesion force of ch4 on agsp with approach velocities of 5 Œºm s was significantly higher than that between ch4 bubble and agsb p 0 01 thus these results are expected to fulfill the knowledge on the influence of hydrodynamics on the interaction between biogas bubbles and ags declaration of competing

18234,microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps have gained increasing attention for various water treatment applications in this study eps produced from nitrogen limited glycerol ethanol rich wastewater were used to recover cu2 and pb2 from aqueous solutions continuous flow through tests were conducted on a column packed with silica gel coated with polyethyleneimine to which eps were irreversibly attached as shown by optical reflectometry these immobilised eps excellently adsorbed cu2 and pb2 with 99 9 of influent metal adsorbed before the breakthrough points metal desorption was achieved with 0 1m hcl with an average recovery of 86 for cu2 and 90 recovery for pb2 for the first time we successfully showed the possibility to regenerate and reuse the immobilised eps for five adsorption desorption cycles using cu2 as an example with no reduction in the adsorbed amount at the breakthrough point q bp based on the mass balance of the associated metal ions participating in the adsorption process ion exchange was identified as the major mechanism responsible for cu2 and pb2 adsorption by eps the results demonstrate the potential of wastewater produced eps as an attractive and perhaps cost effective biosorbent for heavy metal removal to trace effluent concentrations and recovery 86 99 graphical abstract image 1 keywords biosorption column extracellular polymeric substances ion exchange mechanism metal adsorption 1 introduction heavy metal pollution is one of the most critical environmental concerns today due to the hazard caused on human health and the environment heavy metals are directly toxic to exposed organisms and indirectly by accumulation in soil and suspended matter in water bodies gray 2004 liu et al 2015 they are found in high concentrations in wastes discharged into the environment by various industries such as metallurgy mining and smelting electroplating electrolysis iron and steel photography and electric appliance manufacturing wang and chen 2009 at the same time the provision of these metals which are essential and critical elements for our lifestyles to many industries and economies is at risk due to depleting natural reserves and their concentration in a few nations thus subjected to geopolitical risks dodson et al 2015 the recovery of metals from waste streams is therefore of increasing economic interest hence treating heavy metal waste streams has two important objectives removal to environmental standards and recovery to economic standards conventional methods for removing metal ions from aqueous solution such as chemical precipitation and filtration are ineffective to remove low metal concentrations 1 50 mg l and produce large quantities of sludge which are expensive to dispose of volesky 2001 wang and chen 2009 on the other hand technologies that do not generate such secondary waste streams and are efficient for metal removal and recovery are very costly examples of these are ion exchange reverse osmosis adsorption on activated carbon and evaporation volesky 2001 biosorption has been proposed and has received increasing attention as a promising technology for heavy metal removal and recovery volesky 2007 biosorbents defined as biomass and products of microbial biomass such as extracellular polymers gadd 2009 offer some advantages they can be cheap and effective when using the adequate type of biomass and processing method and in some cases can be regenerated for multiple uses just like ion exchange resins and are therefore eco friendly volesky 2001 wang and chen 2009 one of the most promising biosorbents from an economically viable point of view are microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps these are products of microbial biochemical secretions typically comprising polysaccharides and proteins these biopolymers have functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl and amine groups that bind with heavy metals either via ion exchange where the cooh groups are involved or complexation mechanism where cooh oh and nh2 groups may be involved gadd 2009 li and yu 2014 liu and fang 2002 eps are either produced from pure cultures which necessitate sterile conditions and are therefore expensive or from mixed cultures that require non sterile cultures and feedstocks e g organic wastewater making the latter a more sustainable alternative although there are various reports on the use of eps for heavy metal adsorption more et al 2014 most are still far from an economically feasible application in practice due to various limitations the use of pure cultured eps requiring sterile conditions raj et al 2018 a focus on adsorption only and not on recovery the use of unrealistically high eps concentrations in batch studies without practical significance in an industrial or environmental context gadd 2009 and the lack of information on the possibility to regenerate and reuse the sorbent in this study we investigated i the immobilisation of wastewater derived eps eps harvested from waste surplus sludge on a column for continuous flow through tests ii the adsorption and subsequent desorption of heavy metals using cu2 and pb2 as examples present in another waste water iii the possibility to regenerate and reuse the immobilised eps for several cycles and iv the predominant mechanism involved in the eps metal interaction to our knowledge this is the first study to prove the regeneration and reuse of eps for several adsorption and recovery cycles in a continuous process 2 materials and methods 2 1 eps producing bioreactor a submerged membrane bioreactor mbr with a working volume of 67 l was operated to combine wastewater treatment with eps production the mbr was equipped with two pvdf flat sheet membranes membrane cartridge type 510 kubota japan with an effective area of 0 8 m2 each and nominal pore size of 0 2 Œºm perforated tubes made of polyvinyl chloride were placed underneath the membrane to provide aeration the reactor was inoculated with aerobic sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in leeuwarden the netherlands it was operated at a room temperature of 20 1 c a ph of 7 5 0 2 a dissolved oxygen concentration of 2 5 1 0 mg o2 l a solids retention time of 3 days to minimise cod mineralisation and a hydraulic retention time of 10 h the reactor was operated under a nitrogen limited condition i e a cod n ratio cod n 85 calculated based on g cod g n nitrogen limitation has been previously reported to enhance eps recovery from glycerol ethanol rich wastewater up to 54 of wastewater cod recovered as eps cod ajao et al 2019 influent cod was 2000 100 mg l mainly provided from glycerol 820 20 mg l and ethanol 480 10 mg l in a 1 1 cod ratio simulating biodiesel and bioethanol wastewater the main nitrogen source was nh4cl 75 5 mg l and yeast extract 30 mg l contributed 10 of the total nitrogen content the nutrient medium composition per litre of tap water comprised 100 mg mgcl2 6h2o 150 mg cacl2 2h2o 40 mg k2hpo4 60 mg kh2po4 and 2 ml trace elements solution the composition of trace elements has been reported by ajao et al 2018 2 2 eps harvesting after operating the reactor at a steady state for at least 30 days the soluble s eps were harvested from the waste sludge having been reported to be the major eps fraction 62 77 wt in a nitrogen limited system ajao et al 2019 s eps were recovered via centrifugation 400 ml sludge was centrifuged at 17000 g and 4 c for 1 h after which the supernatant containing the s eps henceforth called eps was dialysed successively against demineralised water dialysed eps were freeze dried to obtain dry solids which were used for the metal adsorption tests 2 3 eps characterisation 2 3 1 functional group determination fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was carried out on the freeze dried eps samples using an irtracer 100 spectrometer shimadzu japan with a scanning range of 4000 450 cm 1 for 40 scans at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 2 3 2 total protein polysaccharide and uronic acids quantification the total protein content of the dried eps was determined using a bicinchoninic acid bca assay kit thermo scientific usa the assay was performed in a microplate where 25 Œºl of eps solution dissolved in a phosphate buffer saline ph 7 4 ajao et al 2018 or bovine serum albumin bsa used as a standard protein was mixed with 200 Œºl of bca working reagent and incubated at 37 c for 30 min afterwards the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer victor3 1420 multilabel counter perkinelmer usa total polysaccharides were quantified using the phenol sulphuric acid method described by dubois et al 1956 using glucose as the standard sugar absorbance was measured at 490 nm in the spectrophotometer mentioned above the sugar composition was further analysed according to englyst and cummings 1984 see supplementary material 2 3 3 molecular weight determination a solution of eps was first passed through 0 45 Œºm hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene filter purchased from merck the netherlands before molecular weight determination using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd model 8 doc labor germany detailed method described by ajao et al 2019 lc ocd was also used to analyse the different eps fractions biopolymers such as polysaccharides proteins glycoproteins building blocks humic acids low molecular weight lmw acids and lmw neutrals ajao et al 2018 huber et al 2011 2 3 4 charge density measurements the charge densities of eps and polyethyleneimine pei were determined by colloid titration using a m√ºtek particle charge detector pcd03 germany described by tan et al 2011 and a titration procedure explained by ajao et al 2018 the charge densities were calculated from the consumption of the titrant polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride for eps titration and polyethylenesulfonate for pei titration according to the equation 1 q c v m where q is the specific charge quantity eq g c is the titrant concentration eq l v is the consumed titrant volume l and m is the mass of the polymer sample g the charge density of eps was determined at ph 10 ph of the eps solution flowed into the column to attach to pei freeze dried eps was dissolved in milli q and alkalinised to ph 10 with drops of 1m naoh and ph 7 at ph 10 the functional groups are largely deprotonated and the eps have a high anionic charge density from which a fraction is sacrificed to bind with the pei 2 4 chemical analysis metals were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkinelmer optima 5300 dv total organic carbon toc of eps pei and column effluents was measured using a toc analyser shimadzu toc l all samples were passed through 0 45 Œºm hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene filter merck before icp oes and toc analysis 2 5 optical reflectometry test for a continuous metal adsorption process eps was supported in a column packed with silica gel since silica gel is negatively charged a cationic polymer such as pei branched mw 10 kda purchased from vwr the netherlands was first attached to the silica gel followed by eps attachment to assess the attachment of anionic eps on the cationic pei an adsorption test was carried out using fixed angle stagnation point optical reflectometry described by dijt et al 1990 reflectometry is an optical technique used to observe in situ adsorption of molecules on an optically flat surface such as a silicon wafer the changes in signal measured upon adsorption on the surface Œ¥s is directly proportional to the adsorbed amount Œ≥ mg m2 according to the equation 2 Œ≥ q f Œ¥ s s 0 where q f is the sensitivity factor mg m2 s 0 is the starting output signal of the bare silicon wafer and Œ¥s s s 0 is a change in the signal upon adsorption on the surface instead of using mass uptake Œ≥ we used the relative signal increase Œ¥s s0 to interpret the surface adsorption process since both parameters are directly proportional to each other silicon wafers were first baked at 1000 c for 1 h to form an oxide layer on the silicon the oxidised wafers with a silica layer thickness of 81 5 nm were cut into strips of approximately 1 4 cm2 immersed in a freshly prepared piranha solution 1 part of 30 h2o2 and 3 parts of 95 h2so4 for 20 min and rinsed in milli q water although 10 g l pei and 10 g l eps were used for the column preparation much lower concentrations were needed for the reflectometry tests in order to monitor the adsorption of the polymers on the flat surface thus 0 5 g l of each polymer was used the adsorption sequence on the oxidised wafer was as follows solvent demineralised water was passed to establish the baseline then 0 5 g l pei was injected until adsorption reached saturation the solvent was passed again to know if the adsorption was ir reversible 0 5 g l eps was then injected until adsorption reached saturation after which the solvent was passed 2 6 biosorption tests 2 6 1 batch tests batch tests were conducted using dialysis bags according to the method described by wang et al 2014 50 mg l each of cu2 pb2 and zn2 solutions were prepared by dissolving cuso4 5h2o pb no3 2 and zn no3 2 6h2o respectively in milli q water a dialysis bag 12 14 kda molecular weight cut off filled with 5 ml undialysed and undried eps was suspended in 100 ml heavy metal solution and stirred continuously at a speed of 400 rpm at room temperature 22 c an aliquot of the heavy metal solution was taken for icp oes measurement 2 6 2 small scale syringe test to assess the feasibility for a continuous column experiment and to test the possibility of coating an eps layer on a solid surface a small scale syringe test was carried out first a glass microfibre filter 25 mm diameter camlab ltd uk was treated in a low pressure oxygen plasma system diener electronic femto germany for 20 s to activate the anionic silica groups subsequently a series of solvents solution was passed through the glass microfibre filter in the following order 10 ml of milli q water to clean the filter 1 ml of 10 g l cationic pei to bind to the anionic groups on the filter 10 ml of milli q water to remove any residual pei 1 ml of 10 g l eps anionic polymer to attach to the cationic pei and 10 ml of milli q water to remove any excess unattached eps fig 1 the flow rate of the syringe pump was set at 2 ml min throughout the tests this feasibility experiment was tested for cu2 adsorption on the attached eps 2 6 3 fixed bed column set up adsorption and desorption studies upflow lab scale columns height 11 cm internal diameter 1 5 cm bed volume bv 19 ml were made from transparent polyvinylchloride fig 2 silica gel pore size 60 √• 35 60 mesh purchased from sigma aldrich was used in lieu of the previously used glass filter to act as a support for eps attachment the silica groups were activated by re circulating 50 ml of 10 mm koh instead of using a plasma system for 3 h chandra et al 2015 afterwards 50 ml of 10 g l pei was re circulated for 1 h and finally 50 ml of 10 g l eps was re circulated for 1 h between each step and after the final step 60 ml milli q water was flushed through the column for 1 h the flow rate of the peristaltic pump was set at 1 ml min 3 16 bv h throughout the column preparation process to determine the mass of eps immobilised in the column the toc values of influent and effluent eps solution were measured full calculations in the supplementary material table s1 out of 5 3 g l toceps entering the column 1 6 g l toceps was retained after flushing with water thus about 31 of the influent eps concentration 3 1 g l out of 10 g l was immobilised in the column however not all the sites of the immobilised eps are available for metal adsorption a fraction of the charges was attached to the pei leaving the remaining free sites available for metal adsorption typically about 45 4 mg of pei was immobilised in the column which corresponds to a charge of 0 66 meq from the charge density values of pei and eps see section 3 12 we established a stoichiometry ratio of 1 6 meq of eps to 1 meq of pei for their interaction assuming all the measured sites are available for binding thus 1 06 meq of eps was attached to pei corresponding to 115 4 mg of eps leaving 39 1 mg eps charge equivalent of 0 35 meq available for metal adsorption metal adsorption and desorption studies were carried out on 50 mg l cu2 and 50 mg l pb2 from metal salt solutions of cuso4 5h2o solution ph 5 7 and pb no3 2 solution ph 5 6 respectively the flow rate of the metal solution was set at 1 ml min 3 16 bv h except stated otherwise the desorption test was done with the aim of concentrating the adsorbed metal to 10 times the original concentration to achieve this the volume of the desorbent 0 1m hcl used was 10 times less than that of the metal solution that had flowed through the column during the preceding adsorption phase the desorption was carried out at a flowrate of 0 25 ml min 0 79 bv h the adsorbed amount q mg g available eps and the desorption recovery of metal ions were calculated from equations 3 and 4 3 a d s o r b e d a m o u n t q m a s s o f m e t a l i o n a d s o r b e d m a s s o f e p s a v a i l a b l e f o r a d s o r p t i o n 4 d e s o r p t i o n r e c o v e r y m a s s o f m e t a l i o n d e s o r b e d m a s s o f m e t a l i o n a d s o r b e d at the end of the desorption test an hcl volume equivalent to the total volume of hcl used for the desorption process was also flowed through the column at a rate of 2 ml min to flush out any residual metal ion present in the column to reuse the eps for another cycle the column was first washed with milli q water as stated above and recirculated with 10 mm koh for 2 h flow rate 1 ml min to deprotonate the eps for another adsorption process hence the immobilised eps was in the k form after which milli q water was flushed again for an hour 3 results and discussion 3 1 eps characteristics 3 1 1 functionality and composition eps being a mixture of compounds provide different functional groups that are relevant for heavy metal adsorption the ftir spectrum in fig 3 shows distinct and sharp absorption bands at 3280 cm 1 oh and or nh2 groups 2905 cm 1 c h groups 1717 cm 1 co of amide i 1593 cm 1 out of phase n h bending and c n of amide ii 1406 cm 1 in phase n h bending of amide iii barth 2007 1368 cm 1 co of coo groups 1234 cm 1 c o of ether or alcohol and 1022 cm 1 c o c yuan et al 2011 these bands suggest the presence of polysaccharides and proteins with carboxyl hydroxyl and amino groups as the main functional groups this result is also consistent with our previous studies and reports of other studies ajao et al 2019 2018 yuan et al 2011 the quantification of the total polysaccharide and protein content shows that the eps were composed of 12 wt proteins and 44 wt polysaccharides this value is close to that obtained from the eps sugar compositional analysis see supplementary material out of which uronic acids account for 26 5 wt table 1 lc ocd analysis revealed that the eps also contain building blocks humic acids molecular weight 500 2500 da lmw acids and neutrals 500 da and a hydrophobic organic fraction huber et al 2011 which together account for the remaining 44 wt see supplementary material table s2 in general the biopolymer fraction of this particular eps produced from biodiesel bio ethanol wastewater under nitrogen limited condition high cod n ratio has polysaccharides as its main eps component ajao et al 2019 3 1 2 molecular weight and charge density molecular weight mw is an important property for irreversible attachment of eps with pei the longer the polymeric chains the stronger the attachment with pei dijt et al 1990 the result of the lc ocd analysis reveals four biopolymer chromatographic peaks of the eps fig s1 supplementary material and table 1 the peaks can be categorised into high 1000 kda medium 1000 100 kda and low 100 kda mw fractions indicating the heterogeneous macromolecular characteristics of microbial eps a phenomenon also found in other studies ajao et al 2018 stewart et al 2013 wang et al 2018 in addition to mw charge density is another crucial property of eps for their successful attachment with cationic pei and as active sites for binding with heavy metals the charge density of eps is due to the presence of carboxyl and amino groups and is ph dependent at ph 10 the ph of the eps solution flowed into the column to attach to pei the anionic charge density was 9 meq g eps table 1 this high value is owing to the functional groups in a largely deprotonated form coo and nh2 at such an elevated ph the highly charged form of the eps is desirable to maximise the fraction of the sites that binds with the pei charge density of pei 14 6 0 1 leaving the remaining fraction available for metal adsorption see table s1 3 2 adsorption of eps on polyethyleneimine the result presented in fig 4 shows the sequential adsorption of pei and eps on an activated silicon wafer first cationic pei showed a fast largely irreversible adsorption on the silica surface after which anionic eps was adsorbed on the pei layer after a subsequent solvent injection demineralised water no desorption took place implying that the eps was irreversibly attached to the pei the sudden increase after solvent injection was due to the change in ionic strength between the eps solution and water and stabilised at values not lower than that reached with eps previously this is likely due to the strong attachment of the long eps chains to pei which has a large number of adsorption sites dijt et al 1990 moreover the layer by layer adsorption suggests that the interaction between pei and eps was governed by electrostatic attraction 3 3 cu2 adsorption on a modified glass filter having established the strong attachment of eps on pei a small scale syringe test was carried out to assess the feasibility of metal adsorption on an eps coated glass filter the result in fig 5 proves this possibility 89 of cu2 in the first 10 bed volumes 0 5 ml flowed through the filter was adsorbed by the eps it is important to state that this was not an optimised experiment and the adsorption was limited due to the very small bed volume 0 05 ml and a relatively high flow rate 2 ml min hence the retention time of cu2 was very short 3 4 fixed bed adsorption and desorption of cu2 the results of the column experiment show that the recovered eps have a high affinity for cu2 fig 6 a in all the five cycles 99 9 of the influent cu2 was adsorbed in the column in the first six bed volumes corresponding to effluent cu2 concentrations 50 Œºg l our quantifiable limit these concentrations are much lower than the us environmental protection agency usepa maximum permissible concentration of 1 3 mg l cu2 in drinking water epa 2019 fig 6 shows that the adsorption cycles were not continued long enough to obtain full breakthrough curves i e to reach a c c0 1 during the first cycle which was operated at twice the flowrate 2 ml min 6 32 bv h of the other cycles 151 6 mg cu2 g eps was adsorbed at the breakthrough point q bp defined as c c0 0 001 at 6 3 bv and after 31 6 bv 562 4 mg cu2 g eps had been adsorbed it is important to mention that this value was not the eps maximum adsorption capacity q max for cu2 but the q max could be as high as 787 mg g eps as determined in the batch experiments see supplementary information fig s2 the q values reported for the column tests are based on the mass of eps available for binding and do not take into account the amount of eps sacrificed to attach to pei nevertheless these q max values are not as important as the q bp from the practical viewpoint and can even be misleading when solely reported since they do not take into account the limits of metals permitted in drinking water or industrial effluent discharge saeed et al 2005 attractive from an application perspective is the possibility to regenerate and reuse the eps for subsequent adsorption desorption cycles without a reduction in the adsorbed amount at the breakthrough point q bp table 2 shows that the q bp for cu2 was fairly constant 151 6 160 1 mg g in all the five tested cycles and the cycles had their breakthrough points at approximately the same bed volume fig 6a comparing the q values at a common bed volume of 15 8 the total bed volume of the 2nd to 5th adsorption cycles the q value of the first adsorption cycle was 357 6 mg g and that of the second cycle was 316 1 mg g implying that only about 11 6 of the eps adsorption capacity was lost either during the first cycle metal desorption or eps regeneration process in spite of this loss in capacity the q values of the reused eps in this study somewhat constant between 294 and 316 mg g are much higher than the q max values of most reported commercial ion exchange resins 9 71 mg g resin cochrane et al 2006 pehlivan and altun 2007 swelam et al 2015 and other adsorbents zeolites 2 5 mg g activated carbon 12 32 mg g chitosan composites 25 200 mg g activated sludge 19 mg g seaweed 8 108 mg g microbial biomass such as bacteria fungi and algae 2 133 mg g and lignocellulosic materials such as rice shell hazelnut shell orange peel modified orange peel 8 289 mg g aslan et al 2018 cochrane et al 2006 hammaini et al 2007 kapoor 2002 krstiƒá et al 2018 wan ngah et al 2011 for the eps producing biomasses such as activated sludge seaweed and microbial biomass their much lower q max values mg g biomass compared to our study may be due to a low amount of available eps charge or functional group when eps is attached to biomass it may be that a fraction of the eps functional groups needed for adsorption have been sacrificed for biomass attachment flemming and wingender 2010 moreover biomass composition does not vary significantly at least between different species of the same genus or order and will usually result in similar metal adsorption capacities gadd 2009 for instance different bacteria species studied for cr4 adsorption showed comparable metal sorption affinities quintelas et al 2008 on the contrary microbial eps can differ considerably based on factors such as the utilised substrates and operational conditions consequently leading to new eps properties liu et al 2015 salehizadeh and shojaosadati 2003 as a control cu2 adsorption was performed on only the silica particles without pei or eps attachment to check if they likely participated in the eps adsorption process results see supplementary information fig s3 showed that the lowest c c0 value attained was 0 2 which is much higher than what was obtained with eps c c0 0 001 therefore the values obtained in this study were solely from the attached eps and not from the silica gel after each adsorption process cu2 was desorbed from the eps using a 10 time less bed volume of 0 1 m hcl compared to the total bed volumes of cu2 adsorbed 1 6 bed volume of hcl leading to a 10 time concentrated desorbed cu2 solution however to flush out any residual metal ion on the column an hcl volume equivalent to the total volume of hcl used for the desorption was also flowed through the column an additional 1 6 bed volume of hcl this second desorption process afforded a 5 time concentrated cu2 solution in both cases the desorbed amount was calculated by integrating the area below the desorption peaks of each cycle in fig 6b after the first adsorption 80 of the adsorbed cu2 was desorbed in a 10 time concentrated solution table 2 however both the residual 20 from the first cycle and all the cu2 adsorbed in the second cycle were cumulatively desorbed in the second desorption cycle table 2 a somewhat similar phenomenon was also observed for the third and fourth desorption cycles on average 86 of the adsorbed cu2 could be recovered as a 10 time concentrated solution with a possibility to further desorb the residual adsorbed cu2 in the next desorption cycle nonetheless an average desorption recovery of 99 was possible as a 5 time concentrated cu2 solution 3 5 pb2 adsorption and desorption the ability of eps to adsorb other heavy metals such as pb2 and zn2 and monovalent cations such as nh4 was shown by preliminary batch experiments see supplementary information fig s2 pb2 was also tested in a newly prepared column for an adsorption desorption cycle like the cu2 adsorption eps also showed an excellent affinity for pb2 fig 7 a close to 100 adsorption before the breakthrough point was reached with c c0 0 001 corresponding to effluent concentration of pb2 20 Œºg l which may be lower than the usepa maximum permissible concentration of 15 Œºg l cdc lead tips sources of lead water n d the q bp for pb2 was 1204 mg g eps which is in the same order of magnitude as the q max of the acidic polysaccharide produced by bacillus firmus 1103 mg g salehizadeh and shojaosadati 2003 higher than the q max reported for eps from aerobic granular sludge 900 mg g at 50 mg l pb2 liu et al 2015 and much higher than the q max of most reported ion exchange resins 62 110 mg g bo≈ºƒôcka et al 2016 demirbas et al 2005 pehlivan and altun 2007 the eps q bp for pb2 5 8 mmol g eps was higher than that of cu2 2 4 mmol g eps and was also at a much higher bed volume 49 bv for pb2 compared to 6 bv for cu2 this is likely due to the difference in eps adsorption affinities between the two metal ion species the binding affinity of metal ions is strongly dependent on the ion s charge density which in turn is inversely related to the hydrated ionic radius chen et al 2010 li and yu 2014 since pb2 has a smaller hydrated ionic radius than cu2 it therefore has a higher charge density and a stronger affinity to adsorb to eps the desorption test with 0 1m hcl shows a recovery of 90 in a 10 time concentrated pb2 solution fig 7b demonstrating the possibility to also successfully recover pb2 from aqueous solution with eps 3 6 adsorption mechanism apparently mixed eps mixed composition consisting polysaccharides and proteins and mixed mw high medium and low mw fractions produced aerobically under the nitrogen limited condition have an excellent affinity for heavy metals namely cu2 pb2 and also for au3 see supplementary information fig s4 this can be explained based on their composition charge density and molecular weights the main functional groups of the eps polysaccharides and proteins coo nh2 oh can serve as effective binding sites li and yu 2014 with more than half of the polysaccharides being uronic acids the carboxyl group is likely the main functional group contributing to the binding ability and has been reported to have the strongest binding affinity out of the three functional groups present li and yu 2014 the hydroxyl group of neutral polysaccharides and the amine group of proteins have also been found to bind with metals although they typically exhibit a weaker binding ability than carboxyl groups due to their relatively higher pka values li and yu 2014 liu and fang 2002 the presence of carboxyl and amine groups also makes the charge density of eps ph dependent at a high ph 10 the carboxyl and amine groups are deprotonated leading to a high charge density ajao et al 2018 and more metal adsorption via the ion exchange mechanism li and yu 2014 furthermore the distribution of the many charges on the long polymeric chains and associated electrostatic repulsion is likely to keep the polymer in an uncoiled conformation and provide accessible binding sites for adsorption it is also worth mentioning that these two eps properties high molecular weight and high charge density also make eps effective flocculants for particle adsorption and aggregation ajao et al 2019 from the column experiment we could also determine if the metal adsorption by eps was exclusively based on ion exchange or not by determining the molar equivalents of the eps counter ions k ca2 na mg2 in the effluent although summarised in table 3 fig 8 a and b give a more vivid picture of the exchange of the counter ions with cu2 and pb2 respectively in both figures k was the main eps counter ion due to the washing step with 10 mm koh and was predominantly eluted k along with the other counter ions followed the same trend as the adsorbed metal demonstrating that as cu2 or pb2 was being adsorbed the counter ions were simultaneously being eluted from the eps overall pb2 adsorption by eps appears to be exclusively via ion exchange 99 7 molar equivalents exchange with k exchange contributing the most 76 fig 8b ion exchange for cu2 adsorption in the first cycle fig 8a accounted for 68 with k exchange also contributing the most 40 8 and the remaining 32 may be attributed to other mechanisms such as complexation or precipitation gadd 2009 li and yu 2014 although complexation was more likely to occur due to the presence of coo oh and nh2 groups on the eps that can serve as metal binding ligands li and yu 2014 precipitation is also possible considering the ph in the column during adsorption was 6 8 for instance cu oh 2 precipitate was reported as the major form of cu2 at ph above 6 6 li and yu 2014 notwithstanding ion exchange mechanism proves to play the leading role in pb2 and cu2 adsorption on eps this is also in accordance with the findings of wei et al 2016 where 85 7 molar equivalents of k and mg2 in eps produced by klebsiella sp j1 was exchanged with pb2 3 7 practical implications and outlook although eps was produced from a specific wastewater we expect that some other biodegradable industrial wastewater types would also be suitable substrates provided nitrogen is limiting generally eps produced under nitrogen limited conditions which mainly consist of polysaccharides may have a higher mw and anionic cd than those produced from excess nitrogen ajao et al 2019 these two properties govern the immobilisation and metal adsorption efficiency of the eps one advantage of this technology is the ability to adsorb heavy metals in low concentrations to reach trace concentrations in the effluent this is important to meet the limits for drinking water or effluent discharge quality for surface water in addition the alkali solution used for eps regeneration could be reused for several regeneration processes instead of disposing after a one time use although we have proved the reusability of an immobilised eps for five adsorption desorption cycles longer experiments will be needed to fully test their durability for multiple cycles as found in ion exchange resins however compared to commercial resins eps are considered low cost biosorbents raj et al 2018 which could be beneficial from a business case perspective the studied system could be further optimised by using a cationic polymer with a lower charge demand since a significant fraction 75 of the flowed eps had to be sacrificed to bind with the pei selective separation is an important factor that still needs further study it may be necessary to study how different eps fractions soluble and bound eps or eps produced under different conditions fresh versus saline wastewater grown on different substrates with and without nitrogen limitation may have different selectivity for specific metals furthermore the desorption process needs to be optimised to obtain higher concentration factors compared to a factor of 10 used in this study 3 8 conclusions eps produced from nitrogen limited wastewater were immobilised in a column and used to adsorb cu2 and pb2 in a continuous process for the first time the possibility to regenerate and reuse the immobilised eps for repetitive adsorption desorption cycles was successfully shown for cu2 with no reduction in the adsorption capacity as indicated by stable breakthrough points q bp in all the cycles 99 9 of influent cu2 was adsorbed before the breakthrough points effluent concentrations 50 Œºg l and an average of 86 could be recovered in a 10 time concentrated cu2 solution and 99 recovery in a 5 time concentrated cu2 solution quite similar results were also obtained for the adsorption desorption cycle of pb2 close to 100 adsorption and 90 desorption in a 10 time concentrated pb2 solution interestingly the mechanism of adsorption was discovered to be via ion exchange especially for pb2 adsorption with 99 7 molar equivalents exchanged between the adsorbed pb2 and the eluted eps counter ions for the eps cu2 interaction ion exchange accounted for 68 of the binding suggesting other mechanisms also in operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

18234,microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps have gained increasing attention for various water treatment applications in this study eps produced from nitrogen limited glycerol ethanol rich wastewater were used to recover cu2 and pb2 from aqueous solutions continuous flow through tests were conducted on a column packed with silica gel coated with polyethyleneimine to which eps were irreversibly attached as shown by optical reflectometry these immobilised eps excellently adsorbed cu2 and pb2 with 99 9 of influent metal adsorbed before the breakthrough points metal desorption was achieved with 0 1m hcl with an average recovery of 86 for cu2 and 90 recovery for pb2 for the first time we successfully showed the possibility to regenerate and reuse the immobilised eps for five adsorption desorption cycles using cu2 as an example with no reduction in the adsorbed amount at the breakthrough point q bp based on the mass balance of the associated metal ions participating in the adsorption process ion exchange was identified as the major mechanism responsible for cu2 and pb2 adsorption by eps the results demonstrate the potential of wastewater produced eps as an attractive and perhaps cost effective biosorbent for heavy metal removal to trace effluent concentrations and recovery 86 99 graphical abstract image 1 keywords biosorption column extracellular polymeric substances ion exchange mechanism metal adsorption 1 introduction heavy metal pollution is one of the most critical environmental concerns today due to the hazard caused on human health and the environment heavy metals are directly toxic to exposed organisms and indirectly by accumulation in soil and suspended matter in water bodies gray 2004 liu et al 2015 they are found in high concentrations in wastes discharged into the environment by various industries such as metallurgy mining and smelting electroplating electrolysis iron and steel photography and electric appliance manufacturing wang and chen 2009 at the same time the provision of these metals which are essential and critical elements for our lifestyles to many industries and economies is at risk due to depleting natural reserves and their concentration in a few nations thus subjected to geopolitical risks dodson et al 2015 the recovery of metals from waste streams is therefore of increasing economic interest hence treating heavy metal waste streams has two important objectives removal to environmental standards and recovery to economic standards conventional methods for removing metal ions from aqueous solution such as chemical precipitation and filtration are ineffective to remove low metal concentrations 1 50 mg l and produce large quantities of sludge which are expensive to dispose of volesky 2001 wang and chen 2009 on the other hand technologies that do not generate such secondary waste streams and are efficient for metal removal and recovery are very costly examples of these are ion exchange reverse osmosis adsorption on activated carbon and evaporation volesky 2001 biosorption has been proposed and has received increasing attention as a promising technology for heavy metal removal and recovery volesky 2007 biosorbents defined as biomass and products of microbial biomass such as extracellular polymers gadd 2009 offer some advantages they can be cheap and effective when using the adequate type of biomass and processing method and in some cases can be regenerated for multiple uses just like ion exchange resins and are therefore eco friendly volesky 2001 wang and chen 2009 one of the most promising biosorbents from an economically viable point of view are microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps these are products of microbial biochemical secretions typically comprising polysaccharides and proteins these biopolymers have functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl and amine groups that bind with heavy metals either via ion exchange where the cooh groups are involved or complexation mechanism where cooh oh and nh2 groups may be involved gadd 2009 li and yu 2014 liu and fang 2002 eps are either produced from pure cultures which necessitate sterile conditions and are therefore expensive or from mixed cultures that require non sterile cultures and feedstocks e g organic wastewater making the latter a more sustainable alternative although there are various reports on the use of eps for heavy metal adsorption more et al 2014 most are still far from an economically feasible application in practice due to various limitations the use of pure cultured eps requiring sterile conditions raj et al 2018 a focus on adsorption only and not on recovery the use of unrealistically high eps concentrations in batch studies without practical significance in an industrial or environmental context gadd 2009 and the lack of information on the possibility to regenerate and reuse the sorbent in this study we investigated i the immobilisation of wastewater derived eps eps harvested from waste surplus sludge on a column for continuous flow through tests ii the adsorption and subsequent desorption of heavy metals using cu2 and pb2 as examples present in another waste water iii the possibility to regenerate and reuse the immobilised eps for several cycles and iv the predominant mechanism involved in the eps metal interaction to our knowledge this is the first study to prove the regeneration and reuse of eps for several adsorption and recovery cycles in a continuous process 2 materials and methods 2 1 eps producing bioreactor a submerged membrane bioreactor mbr with a working volume of 67 l was operated to combine wastewater treatment with eps production the mbr was equipped with two pvdf flat sheet membranes membrane cartridge type 510 kubota japan with an effective area of 0 8 m2 each and nominal pore size of 0 2 Œºm perforated tubes made of polyvinyl chloride were placed underneath the membrane to provide aeration the reactor was inoculated with aerobic sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in leeuwarden the netherlands it was operated at a room temperature of 20 1 c a ph of 7 5 0 2 a dissolved oxygen concentration of 2 5 1 0 mg o2 l a solids retention time of 3 days to minimise cod mineralisation and a hydraulic retention time of 10 h the reactor was operated under a nitrogen limited condition i e a cod n ratio cod n 85 calculated based on g cod g n nitrogen limitation has been previously reported to enhance eps recovery from glycerol ethanol rich wastewater up to 54 of wastewater cod recovered as eps cod ajao et al 2019 influent cod was 2000 100 mg l mainly provided from glycerol 820 20 mg l and ethanol 480 10 mg l in a 1 1 cod ratio simulating biodiesel and bioethanol wastewater the main nitrogen source was nh4cl 75 5 mg l and yeast extract 30 mg l contributed 10 of the total nitrogen content the nutrient medium composition per litre of tap water comprised 100 mg mgcl2 6h2o 150 mg cacl2 2h2o 40 mg k2hpo4 60 mg kh2po4 and 2 ml trace elements solution the composition of trace elements has been reported by ajao et al 2018 2 2 eps harvesting after operating the reactor at a steady state for at least 30 days the soluble s eps were harvested from the waste sludge having been reported to be the major eps fraction 62 77 wt in a nitrogen limited system ajao et al 2019 s eps were recovered via centrifugation 400 ml sludge was centrifuged at 17000 g and 4 c for 1 h after which the supernatant containing the s eps henceforth called eps was dialysed successively against demineralised water dialysed eps were freeze dried to obtain dry solids which were used for the metal adsorption tests 2 3 eps characterisation 2 3 1 functional group determination fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was carried out on the freeze dried eps samples using an irtracer 100 spectrometer shimadzu japan with a scanning range of 4000 450 cm 1 for 40 scans at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 2 3 2 total protein polysaccharide and uronic acids quantification the total protein content of the dried eps was determined using a bicinchoninic acid bca assay kit thermo scientific usa the assay was performed in a microplate where 25 Œºl of eps solution dissolved in a phosphate buffer saline ph 7 4 ajao et al 2018 or bovine serum albumin bsa used as a standard protein was mixed with 200 Œºl of bca working reagent and incubated at 37 c for 30 min afterwards the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer victor3 1420 multilabel counter perkinelmer usa total polysaccharides were quantified using the phenol sulphuric acid method described by dubois et al 1956 using glucose as the standard sugar absorbance was measured at 490 nm in the spectrophotometer mentioned above the sugar composition was further analysed according to englyst and cummings 1984 see supplementary material 2 3 3 molecular weight determination a solution of eps was first passed through 0 45 Œºm hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene filter purchased from merck the netherlands before molecular weight determination using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd model 8 doc labor germany detailed method described by ajao et al 2019 lc ocd was also used to analyse the different eps fractions biopolymers such as polysaccharides proteins glycoproteins building blocks humic acids low molecular weight lmw acids and lmw neutrals ajao et al 2018 huber et al 2011 2 3 4 charge density measurements the charge densities of eps and polyethyleneimine pei were determined by colloid titration using a m√ºtek particle charge detector pcd03 germany described by tan et al 2011 and a titration procedure explained by ajao et al 2018 the charge densities were calculated from the consumption of the titrant polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride for eps titration and polyethylenesulfonate for pei titration according to the equation 1 q c v m where q is the specific charge quantity eq g c is the titrant concentration eq l v is the consumed titrant volume l and m is the mass of the polymer sample g the charge density of eps was determined at ph 10 ph of the eps solution flowed into the column to attach to pei freeze dried eps was dissolved in milli q and alkalinised to ph 10 with drops of 1m naoh and ph 7 at ph 10 the functional groups are largely deprotonated and the eps have a high anionic charge density from which a fraction is sacrificed to bind with the pei 2 4 chemical analysis metals were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkinelmer optima 5300 dv total organic carbon toc of eps pei and column effluents was measured using a toc analyser shimadzu toc l all samples were passed through 0 45 Œºm hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene filter merck before icp oes and toc analysis 2 5 optical reflectometry test for a continuous metal adsorption process eps was supported in a column packed with silica gel since silica gel is negatively charged a cationic polymer such as pei branched mw 10 kda purchased from vwr the netherlands was first attached to the silica gel followed by eps attachment to assess the attachment of anionic eps on the cationic pei an adsorption test was carried out using fixed angle stagnation point optical reflectometry described by dijt et al 1990 reflectometry is an optical technique used to observe in situ adsorption of molecules on an optically flat surface such as a silicon wafer the changes in signal measured upon adsorption on the surface Œ¥s is directly proportional to the adsorbed amount Œ≥ mg m2 according to the equation 2 Œ≥ q f Œ¥ s s 0 where q f is the sensitivity factor mg m2 s 0 is the starting output signal of the bare silicon wafer and Œ¥s s s 0 is a change in the signal upon adsorption on the surface instead of using mass uptake Œ≥ we used the relative signal increase Œ¥s s0 to interpret the surface adsorption process since both parameters are directly proportional to each other silicon wafers were first baked at 1000 c for 1 h to form an oxide layer on the silicon the oxidised wafers with a silica layer thickness of 81 5 nm were cut into strips of approximately 1 4 cm2 immersed in a freshly prepared piranha solution 1 part of 30 h2o2 and 3 parts of 95 h2so4 for 20 min and rinsed in milli q water although 10 g l pei and 10 g l eps were used for the column preparation much lower concentrations were needed for the reflectometry tests in order to monitor the adsorption of the polymers on the flat surface thus 0 5 g l of each polymer was used the adsorption sequence on the oxidised wafer was as follows solvent demineralised water was passed to establish the baseline then 0 5 g l pei was injected until adsorption reached saturation the solvent was passed again to know if the adsorption was ir reversible 0 5 g l eps was then injected until adsorption reached saturation after which the solvent was passed 2 6 biosorption tests 2 6 1 batch tests batch tests were conducted using dialysis bags according to the method described by wang et al 2014 50 mg l each of cu2 pb2 and zn2 solutions were prepared by dissolving cuso4 5h2o pb no3 2 and zn no3 2 6h2o respectively in milli q water a dialysis bag 12 14 kda molecular weight cut off filled with 5 ml undialysed and undried eps was suspended in 100 ml heavy metal solution and stirred continuously at a speed of 400 rpm at room temperature 22 c an aliquot of the heavy metal solution was taken for icp oes measurement 2 6 2 small scale syringe test to assess the feasibility for a continuous column experiment and to test the possibility of coating an eps layer on a solid surface a small scale syringe test was carried out first a glass microfibre filter 25 mm diameter camlab ltd uk was treated in a low pressure oxygen plasma system diener electronic femto germany for 20 s to activate the anionic silica groups subsequently a series of solvents solution was passed through the glass microfibre filter in the following order 10 ml of milli q water to clean the filter 1 ml of 10 g l cationic pei to bind to the anionic groups on the filter 10 ml of milli q water to remove any residual pei 1 ml of 10 g l eps anionic polymer to attach to the cationic pei and 10 ml of milli q water to remove any excess unattached eps fig 1 the flow rate of the syringe pump was set at 2 ml min throughout the tests this feasibility experiment was tested for cu2 adsorption on the attached eps 2 6 3 fixed bed column set up adsorption and desorption studies upflow lab scale columns height 11 cm internal diameter 1 5 cm bed volume bv 19 ml were made from transparent polyvinylchloride fig 2 silica gel pore size 60 √• 35 60 mesh purchased from sigma aldrich was used in lieu of the previously used glass filter to act as a support for eps attachment the silica groups were activated by re circulating 50 ml of 10 mm koh instead of using a plasma system for 3 h chandra et al 2015 afterwards 50 ml of 10 g l pei was re circulated for 1 h and finally 50 ml of 10 g l eps was re circulated for 1 h between each step and after the final step 60 ml milli q water was flushed through the column for 1 h the flow rate of the peristaltic pump was set at 1 ml min 3 16 bv h throughout the column preparation process to determine the mass of eps immobilised in the column the toc values of influent and effluent eps solution were measured full calculations in the supplementary material table s1 out of 5 3 g l toceps entering the column 1 6 g l toceps was retained after flushing with water thus about 31 of the influent eps concentration 3 1 g l out of 10 g l was immobilised in the column however not all the sites of the immobilised eps are available for metal adsorption a fraction of the charges was attached to the pei leaving the remaining free sites available for metal adsorption typically about 45 4 mg of pei was immobilised in the column which corresponds to a charge of 0 66 meq from the charge density values of pei and eps see section 3 12 we established a stoichiometry ratio of 1 6 meq of eps to 1 meq of pei for their interaction assuming all the measured sites are available for binding thus 1 06 meq of eps was attached to pei corresponding to 115 4 mg of eps leaving 39 1 mg eps charge equivalent of 0 35 meq available for metal adsorption metal adsorption and desorption studies were carried out on 50 mg l cu2 and 50 mg l pb2 from metal salt solutions of cuso4 5h2o solution ph 5 7 and pb no3 2 solution ph 5 6 respectively the flow rate of the metal solution was set at 1 ml min 3 16 bv h except stated otherwise the desorption test was done with the aim of concentrating the adsorbed metal to 10 times the original concentration to achieve this the volume of the desorbent 0 1m hcl used was 10 times less than that of the metal solution that had flowed through the column during the preceding adsorption phase the desorption was carried out at a flowrate of 0 25 ml min 0 79 bv h the adsorbed amount q mg g available eps and the desorption recovery of metal ions were calculated from equations 3 and 4 3 a d s o r b e d a m o u n t q m a s s o f m e t a l i o n a d s o r b e d m a s s o f e p s a v a i l a b l e f o r a d s o r p t i o n 4 d e s o r p t i o n r e c o v e r y m a s s o f m e t a l i o n d e s o r b e d m a s s o f m e t a l i o n a d s o r b e d at the end of the desorption test an hcl volume equivalent to the total volume of hcl used for the desorption process was also flowed through the column at a rate of 2 ml min to flush out any residual metal ion present in the column to reuse the eps for another cycle the column was first washed with milli q water as stated above and recirculated with 10 mm koh for 2 h flow rate 1 ml min to deprotonate the eps for another adsorption process hence the immobilised eps was in the k form after which milli q water was flushed again for an hour 3 results and discussion 3 1 eps characteristics 3 1 1 functionality and composition eps being a mixture of compounds provide different functional groups that are relevant for heavy metal adsorption the ftir spectrum in fig 3 shows distinct and sharp absorption bands at 3280 cm 1 oh and or nh2 groups 2905 cm 1 c h groups 1717 cm 1 co of amide i 1593 cm 1 out of phase n h bending and c n of amide ii 1406 cm 1 in phase n h bending of amide iii barth 2007 1368 cm 1 co of coo groups 1234 cm 1 c o of ether or alcohol and 1022 cm 1 c o c yuan et al 2011 these bands suggest the presence of polysaccharides and proteins with carboxyl hydroxyl and amino groups as the main functional groups this result is also consistent with our previous studies and reports of other studies ajao et al 2019 2018 yuan et al 2011 the quantification of the total polysaccharide and protein content shows that the eps were composed of 12 wt proteins and 44 wt polysaccharides this value is close to that obtained from the eps sugar compositional analysis see supplementary material out of which uronic acids account for 26 5 wt table 1 lc ocd analysis revealed that the eps also contain building blocks humic acids molecular weight 500 2500 da lmw acids and neutrals 500 da and a hydrophobic organic fraction huber et al 2011 which together account for the remaining 44 wt see supplementary material table s2 in general the biopolymer fraction of this particular eps produced from biodiesel bio ethanol wastewater under nitrogen limited condition high cod n ratio has polysaccharides as its main eps component ajao et al 2019 3 1 2 molecular weight and charge density molecular weight mw is an important property for irreversible attachment of eps with pei the longer the polymeric chains the stronger the attachment with pei dijt et al 1990 the result of the lc ocd analysis reveals four biopolymer chromatographic peaks of the eps fig s1 supplementary material and table 1 the peaks can be categorised into high 1000 kda medium 1000 100 kda and low 100 kda mw fractions indicating the heterogeneous macromolecular characteristics of microbial eps a phenomenon also found in other studies ajao et al 2018 stewart et al 2013 wang et al 2018 in addition to mw charge density is another crucial property of eps for their successful attachment with cationic pei and as active sites for binding with heavy metals the charge density of eps is due to the presence of carboxyl and amino groups and is ph dependent at ph 10 the ph of the eps solution flowed into the column to attach to pei the anionic charge density was 9 meq g eps table 1 this high value is owing to the functional groups in a largely deprotonated form coo and nh2 at such an elevated ph the highly charged form of the eps is desirable to maximise the fraction of the sites that binds with the pei charge density of pei 14 6 0 1 leaving the remaining fraction available for metal adsorption see table s1 3 2 adsorption of eps on polyethyleneimine the result presented in fig 4 shows the sequential adsorption of pei and eps on an activated silicon wafer first cationic pei showed a fast largely irreversible adsorption on the silica surface after which anionic eps was adsorbed on the pei layer after a subsequent solvent injection demineralised water no desorption took place implying that the eps was irreversibly attached to the pei the sudden increase after solvent injection was due to the change in ionic strength between the eps solution and water and stabilised at values not lower than that reached with eps previously this is likely due to the strong attachment of the long eps chains to pei which has a large number of adsorption sites dijt et al 1990 moreover the layer by layer adsorption suggests that the interaction between pei and eps was governed by electrostatic attraction 3 3 cu2 adsorption on a modified glass filter having established the strong attachment of eps on pei a small scale syringe test was carried out to assess the feasibility of metal adsorption on an eps coated glass filter the result in fig 5 proves this possibility 89 of cu2 in the first 10 bed volumes 0 5 ml flowed through the filter was adsorbed by the eps it is important to state that this was not an optimised experiment and the adsorption was limited due to the very small bed volume 0 05 ml and a relatively high flow rate 2 ml min hence the retention time of cu2 was very short 3 4 fixed bed adsorption and desorption of cu2 the results of the column experiment show that the recovered eps have a high affinity for cu2 fig 6 a in all the five cycles 99 9 of the influent cu2 was adsorbed in the column in the first six bed volumes corresponding to effluent cu2 concentrations 50 Œºg l our quantifiable limit these concentrations are much lower than the us environmental protection agency usepa maximum permissible concentration of 1 3 mg l cu2 in drinking water epa 2019 fig 6 shows that the adsorption cycles were not continued long enough to obtain full breakthrough curves i e to reach a c c0 1 during the first cycle which was operated at twice the flowrate 2 ml min 6 32 bv h of the other cycles 151 6 mg cu2 g eps was adsorbed at the breakthrough point q bp defined as c c0 0 001 at 6 3 bv and after 31 6 bv 562 4 mg cu2 g eps had been adsorbed it is important to mention that this value was not the eps maximum adsorption capacity q max for cu2 but the q max could be as high as 787 mg g eps as determined in the batch experiments see supplementary information fig s2 the q values reported for the column tests are based on the mass of eps available for binding and do not take into account the amount of eps sacrificed to attach to pei nevertheless these q max values are not as important as the q bp from the practical viewpoint and can even be misleading when solely reported since they do not take into account the limits of metals permitted in drinking water or industrial effluent discharge saeed et al 2005 attractive from an application perspective is the possibility to regenerate and reuse the eps for subsequent adsorption desorption cycles without a reduction in the adsorbed amount at the breakthrough point q bp table 2 shows that the q bp for cu2 was fairly constant 151 6 160 1 mg g in all the five tested cycles and the cycles had their breakthrough points at approximately the same bed volume fig 6a comparing the q values at a common bed volume of 15 8 the total bed volume of the 2nd to 5th adsorption cycles the q value of the first adsorption cycle was 357 6 mg g and that of the second cycle was 316 1 mg g implying that only about 11 6 of the eps adsorption capacity was lost either during the first cycle metal desorption or eps regeneration process in spite of this loss in capacity the q values of the reused eps in this study somewhat constant between 294 and 316 mg g are much higher than the q max values of most reported commercial ion exchange resins 9 71 mg g resin cochrane et al 2006 pehlivan and altun 2007 swelam et al 2015 and other adsorbents zeolites 2 5 mg g activated carbon 12 32 mg g chitosan composites 25 200 mg g activated sludge 19 mg g seaweed 8 108 mg g microbial biomass such as bacteria fungi and algae 2 133 mg g and lignocellulosic materials such as rice shell hazelnut shell orange peel modified orange peel 8 289 mg g aslan et al 2018 cochrane et al 2006 hammaini et al 2007 kapoor 2002 krstiƒá et al 2018 wan ngah et al 2011 for the eps producing biomasses such as activated sludge seaweed and microbial biomass their much lower q max values mg g biomass compared to our study may be due to a low amount of available eps charge or functional group when eps is attached to biomass it may be that a fraction of the eps functional groups needed for adsorption have been sacrificed for biomass attachment flemming and wingender 2010 moreover biomass composition does not vary significantly at least between different species of the same genus or order and will usually result in similar metal adsorption capacities gadd 2009 for instance different bacteria species studied for cr4 adsorption showed comparable metal sorption affinities quintelas et al 2008 on the contrary microbial eps can differ considerably based on factors such as the utilised substrates and operational conditions consequently leading to new eps properties liu et al 2015 salehizadeh and shojaosadati 2003 as a control cu2 adsorption was performed on only the silica particles without pei or eps attachment to check if they likely participated in the eps adsorption process results see supplementary information fig s3 showed that the lowest c c0 value attained was 0 2 which is much higher than what was obtained with eps c c0 0 001 therefore the values obtained in this study were solely from the attached eps and not from the silica gel after each adsorption process cu2 was desorbed from the eps using a 10 time less bed volume of 0 1 m hcl compared to the total bed volumes of cu2 adsorbed 1 6 bed volume of hcl leading to a 10 time concentrated desorbed cu2 solution however to flush out any residual metal ion on the column an hcl volume equivalent to the total volume of hcl used for the desorption was also flowed through the column an additional 1 6 bed volume of hcl this second desorption process afforded a 5 time concentrated cu2 solution in both cases the desorbed amount was calculated by integrating the area below the desorption peaks of each cycle in fig 6b after the first adsorption 80 of the adsorbed cu2 was desorbed in a 10 time concentrated solution table 2 however both the residual 20 from the first cycle and all the cu2 adsorbed in the second cycle were cumulatively desorbed in the second desorption cycle table 2 a somewhat similar phenomenon was also observed for the third and fourth desorption cycles on average 86 of the adsorbed cu2 could be recovered as a 10 time concentrated solution with a possibility to further desorb the residual adsorbed cu2 in the next desorption cycle nonetheless an average desorption recovery of 99 was possible as a 5 time concentrated cu2 solution 3 5 pb2 adsorption and desorption the ability of eps to adsorb other heavy metals such as pb2 and zn2 and monovalent cations such as nh4 was shown by preliminary batch experiments see supplementary information fig s2 pb2 was also tested in a newly prepared column for an adsorption desorption cycle like the cu2 adsorption eps also showed an excellent affinity for pb2 fig 7 a close to 100 adsorption before the breakthrough point was reached with c c0 0 001 corresponding to effluent concentration of pb2 20 Œºg l which may be lower than the usepa maximum permissible concentration of 15 Œºg l cdc lead tips sources of lead water n d the q bp for pb2 was 1204 mg g eps which is in the same order of magnitude as the q max of the acidic polysaccharide produced by bacillus firmus 1103 mg g salehizadeh and shojaosadati 2003 higher than the q max reported for eps from aerobic granular sludge 900 mg g at 50 mg l pb2 liu et al 2015 and much higher than the q max of most reported ion exchange resins 62 110 mg g bo≈ºƒôcka et al 2016 demirbas et al 2005 pehlivan and altun 2007 the eps q bp for pb2 5 8 mmol g eps was higher than that of cu2 2 4 mmol g eps and was also at a much higher bed volume 49 bv for pb2 compared to 6 bv for cu2 this is likely due to the difference in eps adsorption affinities between the two metal ion species the binding affinity of metal ions is strongly dependent on the ion s charge density which in turn is inversely related to the hydrated ionic radius chen et al 2010 li and yu 2014 since pb2 has a smaller hydrated ionic radius than cu2 it therefore has a higher charge density and a stronger affinity to adsorb to eps the desorption test with 0 1m hcl shows a recovery of 90 in a 10 time concentrated pb2 solution fig 7b demonstrating the possibility to also successfully recover pb2 from aqueous solution with eps 3 6 adsorption mechanism apparently mixed eps mixed composition consisting polysaccharides and proteins and mixed mw high medium and low mw fractions produced aerobically under the nitrogen limited condition have an excellent affinity for heavy metals namely cu2 pb2 and also for au3 see supplementary information fig s4 this can be explained based on their composition charge density and molecular weights the main functional groups of the eps polysaccharides and proteins coo nh2 oh can serve as effective binding sites li and yu 2014 with more than half of the polysaccharides being uronic acids the carboxyl group is likely the main functional group contributing to the binding ability and has been reported to have the strongest binding affinity out of the three functional groups present li and yu 2014 the hydroxyl group of neutral polysaccharides and the amine group of proteins have also been found to bind with metals although they typically exhibit a weaker binding ability than carboxyl groups due to their relatively higher pka values li and yu 2014 liu and fang 2002 the presence of carboxyl and amine groups also makes the charge density of eps ph dependent at a high ph 10 the carboxyl and amine groups are deprotonated leading to a high charge density ajao et al 2018 and more metal adsorption via the ion exchange mechanism li and yu 2014 furthermore the distribution of the many charges on the long polymeric chains and associated electrostatic repulsion is likely to keep the polymer in an uncoiled conformation and provide accessible binding sites for adsorption it is also worth mentioning that these two eps properties high molecular weight and high charge density also make eps effective flocculants for particle adsorption and aggregation ajao et al 2019 from the column experiment we could also determine if the metal adsorption by eps was exclusively based on ion exchange or not by determining the molar equivalents of the eps counter ions k ca2 na mg2 in the effluent although summarised in table 3 fig 8 a and b give a more vivid picture of the exchange of the counter ions with cu2 and pb2 respectively in both figures k was the main eps counter ion due to the washing step with 10 mm koh and was predominantly eluted k along with the other counter ions followed the same trend as the adsorbed metal demonstrating that as cu2 or pb2 was being adsorbed the counter ions were simultaneously being eluted from the eps overall pb2 adsorption by eps appears to be exclusively via ion exchange 99 7 molar equivalents exchange with k exchange contributing the most 76 fig 8b ion exchange for cu2 adsorption in the first cycle fig 8a accounted for 68 with k exchange also contributing the most 40 8 and the remaining 32 may be attributed to other mechanisms such as complexation or precipitation gadd 2009 li and yu 2014 although complexation was more likely to occur due to the presence of coo oh and nh2 groups on the eps that can serve as metal binding ligands li and yu 2014 precipitation is also possible considering the ph in the column during adsorption was 6 8 for instance cu oh 2 precipitate was reported as the major form of cu2 at ph above 6 6 li and yu 2014 notwithstanding ion exchange mechanism proves to play the leading role in pb2 and cu2 adsorption on eps this is also in accordance with the findings of wei et al 2016 where 85 7 molar equivalents of k and mg2 in eps produced by klebsiella sp j1 was exchanged with pb2 3 7 practical implications and outlook although eps was produced from a specific wastewater we expect that some other biodegradable industrial wastewater types would also be suitable substrates provided nitrogen is limiting generally eps produced under nitrogen limited conditions which mainly consist of polysaccharides may have a higher mw and anionic cd than those produced from excess nitrogen ajao et al 2019 these two properties govern the immobilisation and metal adsorption efficiency of the eps one advantage of this technology is the ability to adsorb heavy metals in low concentrations to reach trace concentrations in the effluent this is important to meet the limits for drinking water or effluent discharge quality for surface water in addition the alkali solution used for eps regeneration could be reused for several regeneration processes instead of disposing after a one time use although we have proved the reusability of an immobilised eps for five adsorption desorption cycles longer experiments will be needed to fully test their durability for multiple cycles as found in ion exchange resins however compared to commercial resins eps are considered low cost biosorbents raj et al 2018 which could be beneficial from a business case perspective the studied system could be further optimised by using a cationic polymer with a lower charge demand since a significant fraction 75 of the flowed eps had to be sacrificed to bind with the pei selective separation is an important factor that still needs further study it may be necessary to study how different eps fractions soluble and bound eps or eps produced under different conditions fresh versus saline wastewater grown on different substrates with and without nitrogen limitation may have different selectivity for specific metals furthermore the desorption process needs to be optimised to obtain higher concentration factors compared to a factor of 10 used in this study 3 8 conclusions eps produced from nitrogen limited wastewater were immobilised in a column and used to adsorb cu2 and pb2 in a continuous process for the first time the possibility to regenerate and reuse the immobilised eps for repetitive adsorption desorption cycles was successfully shown for cu2 with no reduction in the adsorption capacity as indicated by stable breakthrough points q bp in all the cycles 99 9 of influent cu2 was adsorbed before the breakthrough points effluent concentrations 50 Œºg l and an average of 86 could be recovered in a 10 time concentrated cu2 solution and 99 recovery in a 5 time concentrated cu2 solution quite similar results were also obtained for the adsorption desorption cycle of pb2 close to 100 adsorption and 90 desorption in a 10 time concentrated pb2 solution interestingly the mechanism of adsorption was discovered to be via ion exchange especially for pb2 adsorption with 99 7 molar equivalents exchanged between the adsorbed pb2 and the eluted eps counter ions for the eps cu2 interaction ion exchange accounted for 68 of the binding suggesting other mechanisms also in operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have
