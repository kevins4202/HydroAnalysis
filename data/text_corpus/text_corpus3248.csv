16240,electroactive biofilms have attracted increasing attention due to their unique ability to exchange electrons with electrodes geobacter spp are widely found to be dominant in biofilms in acetate rich environments when an appropriate voltage is applied but it is still largely unknown how these bacteria are selectively enriched herein two key geobacter spp that have been demonstrated predominant in wastewater enriched electroactive biofilm after long term operation g sulfurreducens and g anodireducens responded to electric field ef differently leading to a higher abundance of ef sensitive g anodireducens in the strong ef region after cocultivation with g sulfurreducens transcriptome analysis indicated that two component systems containing sensor histidine kinases and response regulators were the key for ef sensing in g anodireducens rather than in g sulfurreducens which are closely connected to chemotaxis c di gmp fatty acid metabolism pilus oxidative phosphorylation and transcription resulting in an increase in extracellular polymeric substance secretion and rapid cell proliferation our data reveal the mechanism by which ef select specific geobacter spp over time

geobacter anodireducens selection effect two component systems 1 introduction bacteria that can transfer electrons to solid electrodes have been of interest to scientists and engineers for more than a century these bacteria can be easily acclimated from sediments holmes et al 2004 lam et al 2018 miceli et al 2012 wastewaters chiranjeevi and patil 2020 du et al 2018 he et al 2021 zhou et al 2017 or even soils wang et al 2021 miceli et al 2012 yu et al 2017 yuan et al 2018 by inserting a pair of polarized electrodes forming bioelectrochemical systems bess to generate bioelectricity from waste biomass produce biohydrogen and value added chemicals or desalinate water bajracharya et al 2016 kalathil et al 2013 yan and wang 2022 these bacteria are usually in the minority 1 2 in abundance of natural microbial inocula but they can dominate the electroactive biofilms eabs on electrodes after 3 5 days of incubation during this process the absence of soluble electron acceptors the abundance of electron donors substrates and an appropriate potential applied to the electrode are critical to enrich electroactive bacteria it is widely accepted that electrochemical potential thermodynamically drives electrode based respiration cao et al 2009 chen et al 2012 zhang and angelidaki 2013 while the electric field ef between both electrodes may also directly stimulate bacterial cells all of the bacterial cells in bess are inevitably under the influence of ef especially electroactive bacteria ef has been found to affect bacterial behaviors for example to stimulate the production of cytochrome omcz nanowires of geobacter yalcin et al 2020 or increase the swimming speed of shewanella harris et al 2010 others also observed that ef can improve the removal efficiency of pollutants by electroactive bacteria based biocatalysis beretta et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 however these studies tended to be conducted at the macro level and the research on the potential roles and mechanisms of ef in bess remains scarce most critically almost all previous studies had to vary the electrode potential rather than the ef only as collateral stimuli are unintentionally created ef is hard to change independently and remain exactly the identical external conditions to identify the ef effects at a constant electrode potential our laboratory constructed a gradient ef by using a very small counter electrode and a large working electrode and observed that geobacter spp selectively accumulated at the place with the high ef du et al 2018 the abundance of geobacter increased with ef intensity which was concurrent with spherical pink aggregate formation most interestingly the distribution of the two dominant geobacter spp g sulfurreducens and g anodireducens had different tendencies in response to the gradient ef according to 16s rrna based amplicon sequence variant analysis why does g anodireducens gain a competitive advantage under strong ef conditions how does the ef select for geobacter spp the answer not only helps to understand the mechanism of eab enrichment but also inspires ingenious design of bioelectrochemical reactors for wastewater treatment the present study aimed to investigate the role of ef on electroactive bacterial growth as well as the formation of eabs two geobacter strains g sulfurreducens pca and g anodireducens sd 1 were chosen as representative strains since they were dominant exoelectrogens in eab after 20 months of succession using wastewater as the inoculum yan et al 2021 and distributed differently under a gradient ef geobacter strains were grown in bess under different ef densities and the biofilm morphology and transcriptomic responses of either pure strains or their binary culture were studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and growth conditions g sulfurreducens pca atcc 51 573 herein called pca was initially grown in nbaf medium o brien and malvankar 2016 while g anodireducens sd 1 herein called sd 1 was enriched in ferric citrate medium supplementary s1 liu et al 2019c to obtain bacterial cells without ferric iron geobacter cells collected from their individual media were subcultured separately in sterile mini microbial electrolysis cells mecs fig s1a and supplementary s2 sun et al 2014 all media were deoxygenated n2 co2 80 20 v v for 50 min in serum vials before being sent to an autoclave at 121 c for 20 min 2 2 preparation and operation of the reactors the reactors designed to generate the gradient ef were adapted from our previous study fig s1b supplementary s3 du et al 2018 the counter electrode was a platinum filament projected area of 2 mm2 fixed at 2 mm above the center of the indium tin oxide ito working electrode projected area of 8 6 cm2 fig 1 a prior to use the ito electrodes were ultrasonically cleaned and then the reactors and their related components were sterilized by autoclaving or illuminating with ultraviolet light overnight a syringe 60 ml containing 50 mm sodium acetate on a pump was connected to the reactor to feed it through a masterflex tygon tube and the drainage tubes were submerged in water the potential of each ito electrode was constantly poised at 0 2 v versus ag agcl 4 m kcl 0 205 v versus a standard hydrogen electrode currents were recorded every 100 s using a multichannel potentiostat chi 1000c ch instruments china the ef strength was measured as previously described du et al 2018 the pca and sd 1 bacterial cells harvested from the anodes of the mini mecs served as the inoculum they were rinsed in sterile deoxygenated medium and triturated via repeated pipetting with a 1000 µl pipette allowing the cells to be dispersed sufficiently the cells were then harvested by centrifugation 5000 g 4 c 10 min and resuspended in fresh electrolyte to an od600 of 0 2 for cocultures suspensions of two strains with the same od600 0 2 were mixed at a ratio of 1 1 all of these experiments were performed in an anaerobic glovebox 1029 thermo scientific usa the inoculated reactors initially stood for 12 h and then fresh medium was pumped constantly at a flow rate of 4 µl min considering destructive sampling 8 reactors were parallelly operated on a multichannel potentiostat in order to avoid the random errors on small samples the biofilms were harvested for dna and rna analysis at the formation stage from 4 repeated reactors while the rest were harvested at the mature stage at least three independent experiments were repeated for each strain or coculture 2 3 extracellular polymeric substance eps and genomic dna analysis three concentric circles divided each ito glass electrode into three regions defined as the central circle a the middle ring b and the outer ring c fig 1b indicating the regions exposed to high middle and low ef intensity respectively after each experiment the biofilms in each of the three regions were scraped off separately using sterile scrapers each sample was resuspended in 1 ml of electrolyte in a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube a total of 0 8 ml of each sample was used for eps extraction and the rest was used for genomic dna extraction the eps was extracted with dowex marathon c sodium form 20 50 mesh as previously described liao et al 2021 with minor modifications supplementary s4 the total content of exopolysaccharides was quantified using a phenol h2so4 assay with glucose as a standard dubois et al 1956 the extracellular protein content was determined with a bca protein quantification kit vazyme nanjing china genomic dna was extracted using a genomic dna extraction kit cwbio beijing china quantification of each strain was performed by quantitative pcr qpcr prokhorova et al 2017 with primers specific for pca and sd 1 supplementary table s1 qpcr was performed in triplicate with sybr green master mix vazyme nanjing china on a biorad iq5 instrument a detailed description of the qpcr procedure is shown in supplementary s5 the number of biofilm cells was calculated by threshold cycle ct values based on a standard curve calculated from five serial 10 fold dilutions of the standard to determine the initial number manual cell counts were performed using a counting frame 0 1 ml and the process of counting was repeated 2 4 microscopy three points in a line marked as a b and c with distances of 2 6 and 10 mm to the center of the ito electrode respectively were selected for morphological and spatial topographical imaging fig 1b morphological observation of the biofilms was performed with a laboratory built electrovisual system modified from model ix73 olympus tokyo japan du et al 2018 the biofilm thickness and the spatial topography at each point were measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm lsm880 zeiss oberkochen germany assisted by a transmission electron microscopy tem ht7700 hitachi japan to reveal the microstructures the staining methods are described in detail in supplementary s6 2 5 rna sequencing analysis and visualization biofilms sampled at the formation stage f and the mature stage m were selected to conduct rna sequencing see the detailed method in supplementary s7 the formation stage meant the time point that the current reached its maximum while the mature stage was the time point of a stable current output achieved samples collected from the different stages and regions

selected based on absolute log2 fold change fc 1 and a false discovery rate 0 05 degs were classified according to the databases of go cog and kegg where the degs of incomplete functional annotation including unknown and hypothetical protein were filtered during the classification process significantly enriched go terms and kegg pathways p 0 05 as well as cog categories containing the highest number of degs were selected for further analyses for protein protein interaction ppi analyses the proteins corresponding to the degs were searched in the string database https string db org li et al 2015 the experimental evidence for the reconstruction of functional protein association were obtained from string software or string database the network data was imported to cytoscape for visualization 2 6 quantitative reverse transcription pcr qrt pcr for validation of the transcriptome data qrt pcr assays were performed total rna was extracted with total rna extractor trizol sangon

supplementary tables s2 and s3 genes rpod and reca were selected as housekeeping genes for g sulfurreducens pca and g anodireducens sd 1 respectively holmes et al 2010 the copy number was determined using ct values relative quantification was performed using the housekeeping gene as a calibrator and determined by the 2 δ δ c t method livak and schmittgen 2001 3 results 3 1 response of geobacter biofilms to the gradient ef a gradient ef varying by a factor of the distance to the center was successfully constructed on the ito electrode according to the model simulation developed previously fig 1a du et al 2018 although the current varied during biofilm growth it was not sufficient to cause a large change in ef density point a exhibited the highest ef intensity 94 2 mv mm hef while point c exhibited the lowest ef intensity 33 2 mv mm lef fig 1b according to the clsm images the thickness of each biofilm at different sampling points positively increased with ef that is the stronger ef was the thicker the biofilm was fig 1c taking the slope to evaluate the response of biofilm thickness to ef we found that biofilms containing sd 1 gave slope values that were more than two times larger than the values obtained from the pure pca 3 4 versus 1 5 suggesting a relatively sensitive response of sd 1 to ef fig 1d these results were consistent with our previous observations that sd 1 but not pca accumulated under a strong ef with wastewater as the inoculum du et al 2018 coculture of sd 1 and pca increased the maximum current density 2 5 0 22 a m2 by 78 128 compared with that of each single strain pca 1 4 0 17 a m2 sd 1 1 1 0 016 a m2 and shortened the time needed to reach the maximum current density 0 93 days by 45 66 pca 1 7 days sd 1 2 8 days fig s2 3 2 positive selection of g anodireducens sd 1 by ef the cell density quantified by associating the qpcr results with cell counting demonstrated the same tendency as the biofilm thickness results and more cells were found in the hef regions at the mature stage fig 2 a the cell density of sd 1 in the hef region 5 1 0 5 109 cells cm2 was 122 higher than that in the lef region 2 3 0 1 109 cells cm2 while the cell density of pca was only 90 higher a 2 1 0 04 109 cells cm2 c 1 1 0 1 109 cells cm2 as noted by the changes in the slopes shown in fig s3 sd 1 0 34 pca 0 12 these results indicate the active proliferation of sd 1 under hef stimulation moreover the average cell density of the sd 1 biofilms 3 5 109 cells cm2 in comparison with that of the pca biofilms 1 7 109 cells cm2 was 2 1 fold greater showing a difference in cell growth between the two species for the cocultured biofilm the cell density increased with ef intensity from 1 5 0 1 109 cells cm2 in the lef region to 4 3 0 6 109 cells cm2 in the hef region fig 2a although the average cell density of the cocultured biofilms 2 7 109 cells cm2 was 23 lower than that of the pure sd 1 biofilms 3 5 109 cells cm2 the difference in cell density induced by the ef was comparable sd 1 dominated the coculture in terms of cell density 1 2 0 2 3 7 0 8 109 cells cm2 which was 4 7 times greater than that of the pca cell density 0 3 0 2 0 6 0 1 109 cells cm2 fig 2b sd 1 tended to accumulate in the largest ef region in the coculture system while pca exhibited the opposite tendency fig 2c in particular sd 1 accounted for 86 3 versus 14 3 of pca in the hef region while these percentages changed to 79 4 versus 21 4 in the lef region this result is mainly due to the faster increase in the number of sd 1 cells than pca cells under the strong ef so that sd 1 is further concentrated in hef region in the coculture the same phenomenon was also observed at the formation stage illustrating that the influence of the ef imposed selective pressure on the microbial community from the very beginning fig s4 this result is in agreement with the mixed biofilms acclimated from wastewater where the abundance of g anodireducens increased linearly with ef intensity but the abundance of g sulfurreducens did not du et al 2018 3 3 ef stimulation enhances the secretion of eps bacterial self produced eps consists of exopolysaccharides nucleic acids and proteins that scaffold the biofilm structure whitney and howell 2013 pure sd 1 biofilms had 4 1 fold more exopolysaccharides per cell in the hef region 16 2 6 µg 109 cells than in the lef region 3 9 0 2 µg 109 cells while biofilms containing pca were only 1 2 1 8 times higher 37 1 3 66 4 6 µg 109 cells versus 31 0 8 36 5 7 µg 109 cells with a relatively small change in response to ef change fig 3 a similar change trends were also observed for the extracellular protein content fig 3b the coculture total eps seemed like the direct sum of pca and sd 1 and the difference in eps contents was mainly contributed by sd 1 while pca provided a similar basic content either exopolysaccharides or proteins differences in the eps content induced by ef may contribute to the differences of biofilm morphology with an electrovisual system we found that planktonic cells started to precipitate randomly on the ito electrode just after inoculation fig s5 these cells then settled down and grew into cohesive clumps with different morphology observed on the optical images fig 3c all of the biofilms consisted of spherical aggregates of different sizes at point a on day 9 when the current was stable pca and its coculture with sd 1 exhibited a larger size of 18 4 23 6 µm n 25 which was 3 3 4 3 times larger than that of pure sd 1 5 4 1 µm n 25 indicating that pca mainly contributed to the enlargement of the spherical size this can be partly attributed to the difference in eps at the species level fig 3a and b pca was observed to determine the morphology of the coculture because it has 4 15 times more eps than sd 1 63 72 µg 109 cells versus 4 7 18 µg 109 cells when normalized to a single cell consistent with the variation in eps content the size of spherical aggregates at point a and point c 7 7 1 8 13 2 5 µm n 25 also exhibited significant differences of 1 8 2 3 times except for sd 1 fig 3c we assume that the morphology is also related to the components of the eps which has to be further investigated in the future 3 4 identification of ef responsive genes in geobacter to explore how geobacter responds to ef transcriptome profiling of the monoculture biofilm cells in hef and lef regions at different stages was performed in sd 1 a total of 1099 genes were significantly altered by the ef shift log2fc 1 which was 6 4 times more than those altered in pca cells 173 genes indicating that ef had a greater effect on sd 1 gene expression than pca fig 4 a the reliability of the rna sequencing data was validated by qrt pcr the qrt pcr results were in close agreement with the rna sequencing data with a correlation coefficient r2 up to 0 8 fig s6 corresponding data are shown in tables s4 and s5 supporting the accuracy of the transcriptomic results although the differential expression analysis identified a large number ef responsive genes differential gene expression varies with growth stages to further identify the continuously response ef cref genes in geobacter we focus our analysis on the overlapping genes between the formation and mature stages as we identify in context that the selective pressure by ef was consecutively imposed since biofilm formation ef responsive genes discussed in this study are listed in table s6 in total 229 candidate genes were identified to be associated with ef in sd 1 while only 5 genes were identified in pca and most of these genes are of unknown function fig 4a hence to reveal the intrinsic mechanisms of the electroactive bacteria that positively responded to ef the transcriptome analysis is mainly focused on sd 1 among these candidate genes more than 86 196 229 216 229 were upregulated in the presence of hef many of the upregulated genes encode proteins with unknown functions whereas the remaining genes have been assigned to cog categories in particular the t signal transduction mechanisms category fig 4b genes in this category were those for chemotaxis proteins and two component systems tcss related proteins including sensor histidine kinases and response regulators fig 4c suggesting that they were likely to be cref genes the significant expression of a large number of tcss related genes suggest that they are the primary mode of action in response to ef as a control genes with high similarity to these tcss related genes in pca cells were not significantly expressed fig s7 in addition extracellular electron transfer eet related genes including omcz nuoa atpf ccsa and ccda were also consistently expressed under hef stimulation fig s8 quorum sensing has been found to regulate eab formation chen et al 2017 jing et al 2019 however the transcription of genes related to quorum sensing hdts lasr rpaⅰ lasⅰ rhlⅰ luxn etc were not significantly changed genes specific to the formation and mature stages are also analyzed and define as non continuously response ef ncref genes fig s9 at the mature stage of sd 1 biofilm a relatively high number of eps related genes were detected including those involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis saccharide processing and outer membrane protein assembly and transport transcriptomics data also depict a scenario in which sd 1 was active and fast growing under hef conditions as reflect by the high expression of genes associated with genetic information processing coenzyme metabolism and cell division these results are consistent with the phenotypes that ef enhanced the cell density and eps content genes involved in cell motility were also highly expressed during biofilm growth a similar situation was observed for transcriptional factors that control gene expression globally rijsewijk et al 2014 especially at the mature stage such as rpon and rpod we also detected the differential expression of genes involved in c di gmp signaling under hef versus lef at the mature stage these include genes encoding diguanylate cyclase ggdef domain and eal domain which are responsible for the making and breaking of c di gmp as well as those encoding pilz domain hengge 2009 3 5 gene regulatory networks based on ef responsive genes from the results of the cref and ncref genes in g anodireducens it become interesting to understand how these genes organize themselves to form a clear biofilm thickness gradient along the ef density so ppi fig 5 a and kegg pathway fig 5b networks were constructed based on these ef responsive genes ppi network analysis show that the tcss had the largest number of edges and all of the other proteins were directly or indirectly under its control suggesting an important role for the tcss in response to ef stimulation fig 5a tcss directly acted on chemotaxis transcription factors pilus and c di gmp the same regulatory relationships were also observed in the kegg pathways fig 5b moreover the tcss sensor proteins can also stimulate fatty acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation in addition to the aforementioned regulatory relationships the remaining proteins were regulated by tcss indirectly although the ppi network only reveal that only flagella assembly related proteins were associated with chemotaxis the expression of the corresponding genes was also regulated by transcription factors or c di gmp fig 5b both wild type geobacter strains are unable to produce flagella fig s10 caccavo et al 1994 sun et al 2014 interestingly flagella were observed in both pure cultures and the coculture at the mature stage fig s11 while they were observed in only the coculture at the formation stage fig s12 it should be noted that flagella were observed on only a very small number of cells and was likely caused by an ef induced random mutation or long culture periods in addition to their roles in regulating the expression of flagella related genes transcription factors and c di gmp also played an important part in eps synthesis fig 5b rpod and rpon indirectly regulated the synthesis of structural polysaccharides or capsules by participating in amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism while c di gmp was associated with the production of extracellular polysaccharides these results indicate that the tcss play a central role in linking the extracellular ef stimulation with the behavioral responses of geobacter 4 discussion we showed that an ef had a positive effect on electroactive bacterial growth and eab formation electroactive bacteria were able to sense the ef to modulate their cellular physiology transcriptome analyses revealed that the tcss serves as the major signal transduction mechanism that links the extracellular ef stimulation to intracellular responses as a critical stimulus response mechanism abundant in most bacteria the tcss could be activated and interact with other proteins under hef conditions network analysis identified that the tcss was involved in the regulation of chemotaxis c di gmp fatty acid metabolism pilus oxidative phosphorylation and transcription fig 5a in particular the tcss was closely connected with c di gmp and transcription factors resulting in increased eps content and rapid cell proliferation according to previous studies this may be due to response regulators or sensor histidine kinases containing pas domains that can link to eal and ggdef domains and interacting with promoter regions to modulate dna transcription groisman 2016 liu et al 2019a zschiedrich et al 2016 the transcription factor rpod is predicted to be enriched in nucleotide and amino acid metabolism and in capsule synthesis reguera and kashefi 2019 fig 5b we also found that hef regulated the expression of eet related genes at transcriptional level such as omcs omcz ccda and cyda fig 5b and table s6 although kegg pathway networks only showed the regulatory relationship between tcss and oxidative phosphorylation eet related genes were also likely regulated by rpon qiu et al 2013 since rpon is reported to be the primary sigma factor for the regulation of energy metabolism and respiration in geobacter we speculated that electron transfer process was co regulated by both tcss and rpon under the stress of hef although pca has high genomic similarity to sd 1 sun et al 2019 and approximately 4 of the genome is devoted to signal transduction pairs sensor histidine kinases and response regulators reguera and kashefi 2019 ef did not consistently induce significant upregulated expression of tcss related genes in pca resulting in the smaller biomass changed when ef intensity varied figs 1c and 2a considering that pca is isolated from surface sediments of a hydrocarbon contaminated ditch caccavo et al 1994 it is likely that it has adapted to substrate rich environments with a variety of electron acceptors however sd 1 is isolated from a mature anode biofilm in formate fed microbial fuel cells sun et al 2014 strain sd 1 may have evolved to use an ef sensing mechanism consisting of tcss as a strategy to successfully colonize and survive on the electrode eet is considered a key factor in determining the performance of various bess chen et al 2018 chiranjeevi and patil 2020 redox c type cytochromes contribute to the construction of a conductive network for long range electron transfer from electroactive bacteria to the electrode bonanni et al 2012 geobacter spp have been reported to secrete extracellular cytochromes and form nanowires wang et al 2019 or vesicles liu et al 2019b to facilitate eet the higher extracellular protein content in the hef region in the sd 1 and coculture samples indicate that ef may enhance eet by stimulating ef sensitive strains to secrete more outer membrane cytochromes which can be partly due to the enhancement of pilus production because pili are reported to involve in extracellular cytochrome secretion in recent studies gu et al 2021 pilus is also found important as the scaffold to facilitate biofilm formation which also help cytochromes to mediate long range charge transfer steidl et al 2016 these findings suggest that sd 1 devoted more energy to improve cellular attachment forming a highly electroactive biofilm this explains our previous finding that why the biofilm growing in the center of the working electrode had the greatest contribution to the current output when the rest of the area was etched away du et al 2018 moreover this result also provides the possibility that the tcss as an ef dependent regulatory system can be used to control the gene expression and metabolic activities of eabs with the aid of an ef hence sd 1 is expected to serve as another host for the synthesis of valuable chemicals in bess combined with electrogenetics as has been reported for shewanella oneidensis mr 1 using an arc system to sense electrode potential and regulate the eet pathway hirose et al 2018 hirose et al 2019 although pca has a nonsignificant trend of increasing eps content it has a high eps secretory capacity fig 3a and b the high eps content not only changes the surface morphology of the eab but also allows the reactor to have a faster and higher current output figs 3c and s2 excitingly pca can be relatively easily genetically modified using standard techniques reguera and kashefi 2019 and various single mutant strains or even double and triple mutant strains have been successfully constructed kim et al 2006 liu et al 2018 steidl et al 2016 voordeckers et al 2010 hence pca can be genetically engineered to express ef dependent regulatory systems and applied to improve the electroactivity of eabs at the community level ef is likely to enhance the intensity of interspecific competition and thus lead to the changes in the biofilm community as previously observed by our group du et al 2018 when both strains are cocultured at the same inoculum dose sd 1 outcompete pca under a strong ef such interspecific competition induced by ef was observed initially and persisted figs s4 and 3c the results may mainly be caused by the following two reasons first sd 1 has a short doubling time which is its native characteristic this can be explained by the fact that the average cell density of the pure sd 1 culture biofilm was 2 1 times greater than that of pca fig 3a the other reason could be the difference in ef induced proliferation rates which is supported by the differences in cell density between the hef and lef regions in the density of sd 1 was 2 8 109 cells cm2 while that of pca was 1 0 109 cells cm2 fig 3a therefore sd 1 obtain a growth advantage under the strong ef outcompeting pca and resulting in reduced pca abundance in hef regions these results provide an example to understand how ef sensitive bacterial strains change the components of the electroactive microbial community the unique ability of g anodireducens to sense ef ensures its dominance after long term operation sun et al 2014 yan et al 2021 given that an ef as a signal that can be input artificially the finding that bacteria are sensitive to ef shows the possibility of manipulating the bacterial community through information technology the highest current output to date come from mixed cultures dominated by geobacter species in bess logan et al 2019 the development of a simple and fast method for the enrichment of geobacter is necessary and crucial the cell density of geobacter in the biofilm increased with ef intensity from 1 1 2 3 109 cells cm2 at 33 2 mv mm to 2 1 5 1 109 cells cm2 at 94 2 mv mm showing that the increase in the ef is a simple and controllable stimulus that can harvest more electroactive bacteria it has long been believed that a constant anode potential provides stationary conditions for electroactive bacterial growth finkelstein et al 2006 but there will be an exception if the ef is nonuniform such as using a cathode with a spiked surface increasing the area of counter electrode and reducing electrode spacing under the same potential of 0 2 v we demonstrate that the ef rather than the electrode potential is critical for the selective enrichment of electroactive bacteria which provides new ideas for the improvement of electroactivity via spatial ef design 5 conclusions the present study demonstrates that electroactive bacteria can respond positively to ef and that the degree of response varies by species an ef sensing regulatory system tcss in geobacter is proposed according to the comparison of the transcriptomics from two species with different responses to ef which has to be further identified in detail increasing knowledge of ef regulatory mechanism provides a molecular basis for the understanding of

drives electrode based respiration cao et al 2009 chen et al 2012 zhang and angelidaki 2013 while the electric field ef between both electrodes may also directly stimulate bacterial cells all of the bacterial cells in bess are inevitably under the influence of ef especially electroactive bacteria ef has been found to affect bacterial behaviors for example to stimulate the production of cytochrome omcz nanowires of geobacter yalcin et al 2020 or increase the swimming speed of shewanella harris et al 2010 others also observed that ef can improve the removal efficiency of pollutants by electroactive bacteria based biocatalysis beretta et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 however these studies tended to be conducted at the macro level and the research on the potential roles and mechanisms of ef in bess remains scarce most critically almost all previous studies had to vary the electrode potential rather than the ef only as collateral stimuli are unintentionally created ef is hard to change independently and remain exactly the identical external conditions to identify the ef effects at a constant electrode potential our laboratory constructed a gradient ef by using a very small counter electrode and a large working electrode and observed that geobacter spp selectively accumulated at the place with the high ef du et al 2018 the abundance of geobacter increased with ef intensity which was concurrent with spherical pink aggregate formation most interestingly the distribution of the two dominant geobacter spp g sulfurreducens and g anodireducens had different tendencies in response to the gradient ef according to 16s rrna based amplicon sequence variant analysis why does g anodireducens gain a competitive advantage under strong ef conditions how does the ef select for geobacter spp the answer not only helps to understand the mechanism of eab enrichment but also inspires ingenious design of bioelectrochemical reactors for wastewater treatment the present study aimed to investigate the role of ef on electroactive bacterial growth as well as the formation of eabs two geobacter strains g sulfurreducens pca and g anodireducens sd 1 were chosen as representative strains since they were dominant exoelectrogens in eab after 20 months of succession using wastewater as the inoculum yan et al 2021 and distributed differently under a gradient ef geobacter strains were grown in bess under different ef densities and the biofilm morphology and transcriptomic responses of either pure strains or their binary culture were studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and growth conditions g sulfurreducens pca atcc 51 573 herein called pca was initially grown in nbaf medium o brien and malvankar 2016 while

of 8 6 cm2 fig 1 a prior to use the ito electrodes were ultrasonically cleaned and then the reactors and their related components were sterilized by autoclaving or illuminating with ultraviolet light overnight a syringe 60 ml containing 50 mm sodium acetate on a pump was connected to the reactor to feed it through a masterflex tygon tube and the drainage tubes were submerged in water the potential of each ito electrode was constantly poised at 0 2 v versus ag agcl 4 m kcl 0 205 v versus a standard hydrogen electrode currents were recorded every 100 s using a multichannel potentiostat chi 1000c ch instruments china the ef strength was measured as previously described du et al 2018 the pca and sd 1 bacterial cells harvested from the anodes of the mini mecs served as the inoculum they were rinsed in sterile deoxygenated medium and triturated via repeated pipetting with a 1000 µl pipette allowing the cells to be dispersed sufficiently the cells were then harvested by centrifugation 5000 g 4 c 10 min and resuspended in fresh electrolyte to an od600 of 0 2 for cocultures suspensions of two strains with the same od600 0 2 were mixed at a ratio of 1 1 all of these experiments were performed in an anaerobic glovebox 1029 thermo scientific usa the inoculated reactors initially stood for 12 h and then fresh medium was pumped constantly at a flow rate of 4 µl min considering destructive sampling 8 reactors were parallelly operated on a multichannel potentiostat in order to avoid the random errors on small samples the biofilms were harvested for dna and rna analysis at the formation stage from 4 repeated reactors while the rest were harvested at the mature stage at least three independent experiments were repeated for each strain or coculture 2 3 extracellular polymeric substance eps and genomic dna analysis three concentric circles divided each ito glass electrode into three regions defined as the central circle a the middle ring b and the outer ring c fig 1b indicating the regions exposed to high middle and low ef intensity respectively after each experiment the biofilms in each of the three regions were scraped off separately using sterile scrapers each sample was resuspended in 1 ml of electrolyte in a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube a total of 0 8 ml of each sample was used for eps extraction and the rest was used for genomic dna extraction the eps was extracted with dowex marathon c sodium form 20 50 mesh as previously described liao et al 2021 with minor modifications supplementary s4 the total content of exopolysaccharides was quantified using a

biofilms to the gradient ef a gradient ef varying by a factor of the distance to the center was successfully constructed on the ito electrode according to the model simulation developed previously fig 1a du et al 2018 although the current varied during biofilm growth it was not sufficient to cause a large change in ef density point a exhibited the highest ef intensity 94 2 mv mm hef while point c exhibited the lowest ef intensity 33 2 mv mm lef fig 1b according to the clsm images the thickness of each biofilm at different sampling points positively increased with ef that is the stronger ef was the thicker the biofilm was fig 1c taking the slope to evaluate the response of biofilm thickness to ef we found that biofilms containing sd 1 gave slope values that were more than two times larger than the values obtained from the pure pca 3 4 versus 1 5 suggesting a relatively sensitive response of sd 1 to ef fig 1d these results were consistent with our previous observations that sd 1 but not pca accumulated under a strong ef with wastewater as the inoculum du et al 2018 coculture of sd 1 and pca increased the maximum current density 2 5 0 22 a m2 by 78 128 compared with that of each single strain pca 1 4 0 17 a m2 sd 1 1 1 0 016 a m2 and shortened the time needed to reach the maximum current density 0 93 days by 45 66 pca 1 7 days sd 1 2 8 days fig s2 3 2 positive selection of g anodireducens sd 1 by ef the cell density quantified by associating the qpcr results with cell counting demonstrated the same tendency as the biofilm thickness results and more cells were found in the hef regions at the mature stage fig 2 a the cell density of sd 1 in the hef region 5 1 0 5 109 cells cm2 was 122 higher than that in the lef region 2 3 0 1 109 cells cm2 while the cell density of pca was only 90 higher a 2 1 0 04 109 cells cm2 c 1 1 0 1 109 cells cm2 as noted by the changes in the slopes shown in fig s3 sd 1 0 34 pca 0 12 these results indicate the active proliferation of sd 1 under hef stimulation moreover the average cell density of the sd 1 biofilms 3 5 109 cells cm2 in comparison with that of the pca biofilms 1 7 109 cells cm2 was 2 1 fold greater showing a difference in cell growth between the two species for the cocultured biofilm the cell density increased with ef intensity from 1 5 0 1 109 cells cm2 in the lef region to 4 3 0 6 109 cells cm2 in the hef region fig 2a although the average cell density of the cocultured biofilms 2 7 109 cells cm2 was 23 lower than that of the pure sd 1 biofilms 3 5 109 cells cm2 the difference in cell density induced by the ef was comparable sd 1 dominated the coculture in terms of cell density 1 2 0 2 3 7 0 8 109 cells cm2 which was 4 7 times greater than that of the pca cell density 0 3 0 2 0 6 0 1 109 cells cm2 fig 2b sd 1 tended to accumulate in the largest ef region in the coculture system while pca exhibited the opposite tendency fig 2c in particular sd 1 accounted for 86 3 versus 14 3 of pca in the hef region while these percentages changed to 79 4 versus 21 4 in the lef region this result is mainly due to the faster increase in the number of sd 1 cells than pca cells under the strong ef so that sd 1 is further concentrated in hef region in the coculture the same phenomenon was also observed at the formation stage illustrating that the influence of the ef imposed selective pressure on the microbial community from the very beginning fig s4 this result is in agreement with the mixed biofilms acclimated from wastewater where the abundance of g anodireducens increased linearly with ef intensity but the abundance of g sulfurreducens did not du et al 2018 3 3 ef stimulation enhances the secretion of eps bacterial self produced eps consists of exopolysaccharides nucleic acids and proteins that scaffold the biofilm structure whitney and howell 2013 pure sd 1 biofilms had 4 1 fold more exopolysaccharides per cell in the hef region 16 2 6 µg 109 cells than in the lef region 3 9 0 2 µg 109 cells while biofilms containing pca were only 1 2 1 8 times higher 37 1 3 66 4 6 µg 109 cells versus 31 0 8 36 5 7 µg 109 cells with a relatively small change in response to ef change fig 3 a similar change trends were also observed for the extracellular protein content fig 3b the coculture total eps seemed like the direct sum of pca and sd 1 and the difference in eps contents was mainly contributed by sd 1 while pca provided a similar basic content either exopolysaccharides or proteins differences in the eps content induced by ef may contribute to the differences of biofilm morphology with an electrovisual system we found that planktonic cells started to precipitate randomly on the ito electrode just after inoculation fig s5 these cells then settled down and grew into cohesive clumps with different morphology observed on the optical images fig 3c all of the biofilms consisted of spherical aggregates of different sizes at point a on day 9 when the current was stable pca and its coculture with sd 1 exhibited a larger size of 18 4 23 6 µm n 25 which was 3 3 4 3 times larger than that of pure sd 1 5 4 1 µm n 25 indicating that pca mainly contributed to the enlargement of the spherical size this can be partly attributed to the difference in eps at the species level fig 3a and b pca was observed to determine the morphology of the coculture because it has 4 15 times more eps than sd 1 63 72 µg 109 cells versus 4 7 18 µg 109 cells when normalized to a single cell consistent with the variation in eps content the size of spherical aggregates at point a and point c 7 7 1 8 13 2 5 µm n 25 also exhibited significant differences of 1 8 2 3 times except for sd 1 fig 3c we assume that the morphology is also related to the components of the eps which has to be further investigated in the future 3 4 identification of ef responsive genes in geobacter to explore how geobacter responds to ef transcriptome profiling of the monoculture biofilm cells in hef and lef regions at different stages was performed in sd 1 a total of 1099 genes were significantly altered by the ef shift log2fc 1 which was 6 4 times more than those altered in pca cells 173 genes indicating that ef had a greater effect on sd 1 gene expression than pca fig 4 a the reliability of the rna sequencing data was validated by qrt pcr the qrt pcr results were in close agreement with the rna sequencing data with a correlation coefficient r2 up to 0 8 fig s6 corresponding data are shown in tables s4 and s5 supporting the accuracy of the transcriptomic results although the differential expression analysis identified a large number ef responsive genes differential gene expression varies with growth stages to further identify the continuously response ef cref genes in geobacter we focus our analysis on the overlapping genes between the formation and mature stages as we identify in context that the selective pressure by ef was consecutively imposed since biofilm formation ef responsive genes discussed in this study are listed in table s6 in total 229 candidate genes were identified to be associated with ef in sd 1 while only 5 genes were identified in pca and most of these genes are of unknown function fig 4a hence to reveal the intrinsic mechanisms of the electroactive bacteria that positively responded to ef the transcriptome analysis is mainly focused on sd 1 among these candidate genes more than 86 196 229 216 229 were upregulated in the presence of hef many of the upregulated genes encode proteins with unknown functions whereas the remaining genes have been assigned to cog categories in particular the t signal transduction mechanisms category fig 4b genes in this category were those for chemotaxis proteins and two component systems tcss related proteins including sensor histidine kinases and response regulators fig 4c suggesting that they were likely to be cref genes the significant expression of a large number of tcss related genes suggest that they are the primary mode of action in response to ef as a control genes with high similarity to these tcss related genes in pca cells were not significantly expressed fig s7 in addition extracellular electron transfer eet related genes including omcz nuoa atpf ccsa and ccda were also consistently expressed under hef stimulation fig s8 quorum sensing has been found to regulate eab formation chen et al 2017 jing et al 2019 however the transcription of genes related to quorum sensing hdts lasr rpaⅰ lasⅰ rhlⅰ luxn etc were not significantly changed genes specific to the formation and mature stages are also analyzed and define as non continuously response ef ncref genes fig s9 at the mature stage of sd 1 biofilm a relatively high number of eps related genes were detected including those involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis saccharide processing and outer membrane protein assembly and transport transcriptomics data also depict a scenario in which sd 1 was active and fast growing under hef conditions as reflect by the high expression of genes associated with genetic information processing coenzyme metabolism and cell division these results are consistent with the phenotypes that ef enhanced the cell density and eps content genes involved in cell motility were also highly expressed during biofilm growth a similar situation was observed for transcriptional factors that control gene expression globally rijsewijk et al 2014 especially at the mature stage such as rpon and rpod we also detected the differential expression of genes involved in c di gmp signaling under hef versus lef at the mature stage these include genes encoding diguanylate cyclase ggdef domain and eal domain which are responsible for the making and breaking of c di gmp as well as those encoding pilz domain hengge 2009 3 5 gene regulatory networks based on ef responsive genes from the results of the cref and ncref genes in g anodireducens it become interesting to understand how these genes organize themselves to form a clear biofilm thickness gradient along the ef density so ppi fig 5 a and kegg pathway fig 5b networks were constructed based on these ef responsive genes ppi network analysis show that the tcss had the largest number of edges and all of the other proteins were directly or indirectly under its control suggesting an important role for the tcss in response to ef stimulation fig 5a tcss directly acted on chemotaxis transcription factors pilus and c di gmp the same regulatory relationships were also observed in the kegg pathways fig 5b moreover the tcss sensor proteins can also stimulate fatty acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation in addition to the aforementioned regulatory relationships the remaining proteins were regulated by tcss indirectly although the ppi network only reveal that only flagella assembly related proteins were associated with chemotaxis the expression of the corresponding genes was also regulated by transcription factors or c di gmp fig 5b both wild type geobacter strains are unable to produce flagella fig s10 caccavo et al 1994 sun et al 2014 interestingly flagella were observed in both pure cultures and the coculture at the mature stage fig s11 while they were observed in only the coculture at the formation stage fig s12 it should be noted that flagella were observed on only a very small number of cells and was likely caused by an ef induced random mutation or long culture periods in addition to their roles in regulating the expression of flagella related genes transcription factors and c di gmp also played an important part in eps synthesis fig 5b rpod and rpon indirectly regulated the synthesis of structural polysaccharides or capsules by participating in amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism while c di gmp was associated with the production of extracellular polysaccharides these results indicate that the tcss play a central role in linking the extracellular ef stimulation with the behavioral responses of geobacter 4 discussion we showed that an ef had a positive effect on electroactive bacterial growth and eab formation electroactive bacteria were able to sense the ef to modulate their cellular physiology transcriptome analyses revealed that the tcss serves as the major signal transduction mechanism that links the extracellular ef stimulation to intracellular responses as a critical stimulus response mechanism abundant in most bacteria the tcss could be activated and interact with other proteins under hef conditions network analysis identified that the tcss was involved in the regulation of chemotaxis c di gmp fatty acid metabolism pilus oxidative phosphorylation and transcription fig 5a in particular the tcss was closely connected with c di gmp and transcription factors resulting in increased eps content and rapid cell proliferation according to previous studies this may be due to response regulators or sensor histidine kinases containing pas domains that can link to eal and ggdef domains and interacting with promoter regions to modulate dna transcription groisman 2016 liu et al 2019a zschiedrich et al 2016 the transcription factor rpod is predicted to be enriched in nucleotide and amino acid metabolism and in capsule synthesis reguera and kashefi 2019 fig 5b we also found that hef regulated the expression of eet related genes at transcriptional level such as omcs omcz ccda and cyda fig 5b and table s6 although kegg pathway networks only showed the regulatory relationship between tcss and oxidative phosphorylation eet related genes were also likely regulated by rpon qiu et al 2013 since rpon is reported to be the primary sigma factor for the regulation of energy metabolism and respiration in geobacter we speculated that electron transfer process was co regulated by both tcss and rpon under the stress of hef although pca has high genomic similarity to sd 1 sun et al 2019 and approximately 4 of the genome is devoted to signal transduction pairs sensor histidine kinases and response regulators reguera and kashefi 2019 ef did not consistently induce significant upregulated expression of tcss related genes in pca resulting in the smaller biomass changed when ef intensity varied figs 1c and 2a considering that pca is isolated from surface sediments of a hydrocarbon contaminated ditch caccavo et al 1994 it is likely that it has adapted to substrate rich environments with a variety of electron acceptors however sd 1 is isolated from a mature anode biofilm in formate fed microbial fuel cells sun et al 2014 strain sd 1 may have evolved to use an ef sensing mechanism consisting of tcss as a strategy to successfully colonize and survive on the electrode eet is considered a key factor in determining the performance of various bess chen et al 2018 chiranjeevi and patil 2020 redox c type cytochromes contribute to the construction of a conductive network for long range electron transfer from electroactive bacteria to the electrode bonanni et al 2012 geobacter spp have been reported to secrete extracellular cytochromes and form nanowires wang et al 2019 or vesicles liu et al 2019b to facilitate eet the higher extracellular protein content in the hef region in the sd 1 and coculture samples indicate that ef may enhance eet by stimulating ef sensitive strains to secrete more outer membrane cytochromes which can be partly due to the enhancement of pilus production because pili are reported to involve in extracellular cytochrome secretion in recent studies gu et al 2021 pilus is also found important as the scaffold to facilitate biofilm formation which also help cytochromes to mediate long range charge transfer steidl et al 2016 these findings suggest that sd 1 devoted more energy to improve cellular attachment forming a highly electroactive biofilm this explains our previous finding that why the biofilm growing in the center of the working electrode had the greatest contribution to the current output when the rest of the area was etched away du et al 2018 moreover this result also provides the possibility that the tcss as an ef dependent regulatory system can be used to control the gene expression and metabolic activities of eabs with the aid of an ef hence sd 1 is expected to serve as another host for the synthesis of valuable chemicals in bess combined with electrogenetics as has been reported for shewanella oneidensis mr 1 using an arc system to sense electrode potential and regulate the eet pathway hirose et al 2018 hirose et al 2019 although pca has a nonsignificant trend of increasing eps content it has a high eps secretory capacity fig 3a and b the high eps content not only changes the surface morphology of the eab but also allows the reactor to have a faster and higher current output figs 3c and s2 excitingly pca can be relatively easily genetically modified using standard techniques reguera and kashefi 2019 and various single mutant strains or even double and triple mutant strains have been successfully constructed kim et al 2006 liu et al 2018 steidl et al 2016 voordeckers et al 2010 hence pca can be genetically engineered to express ef dependent regulatory systems and applied to improve the electroactivity of eabs at the community level ef is likely to enhance the intensity of interspecific competition and thus lead to the changes in the biofilm community as previously observed by our group du et al 2018 when both strains are cocultured at the same inoculum dose sd 1 outcompete pca under a strong ef such interspecific competition induced by ef was observed initially and persisted figs s4 and 3c the results may mainly be caused by the following two reasons first sd 1 has a short doubling time which is its native characteristic this can be explained by the fact that the average cell density of the pure sd 1 culture biofilm was 2 1 times greater than that of pca fig 3a the other reason could be the difference in ef induced proliferation rates which is supported by the differences in cell density between the hef and lef regions in the density of sd 1 was 2 8 109 cells cm2 while that of pca was 1 0 109 cells cm2 fig 3a therefore sd 1 obtain a growth advantage under the strong ef outcompeting pca and resulting in reduced pca abundance in hef regions these results provide an example to understand how ef sensitive bacterial strains change the components of the electroactive microbial community the unique ability of g anodireducens to sense ef ensures its dominance after long term operation sun et al 2014 yan et al 2021 given that an ef as a signal that can be input artificially the finding that bacteria are sensitive to ef shows the possibility of manipulating the bacterial community through information technology the highest current output to date come from mixed cultures dominated by geobacter species in bess logan et al 2019 the development of a simple and fast method for the enrichment of geobacter is necessary and crucial the cell density of geobacter in the biofilm increased with ef intensity from 1 1 2 3 109 cells cm2 at 33 2 mv mm to 2 1 5 1 109 cells cm2 at 94 2 mv mm showing that the increase in the ef is a simple and controllable stimulus that can harvest more electroactive bacteria it has long been believed that a constant anode potential provides stationary conditions for electroactive bacterial growth finkelstein et al 2006 but there will be an exception if the ef is nonuniform such as using a cathode with a spiked surface increasing the area of counter electrode and reducing electrode spacing under the same potential of 0 2 v we demonstrate that the ef rather than the electrode potential is critical for the selective enrichment of electroactive bacteria which provides new ideas for the improvement of electroactivity via spatial ef design 5 conclusions the present study demonstrates that electroactive bacteria can respond positively to ef and that the degree of response varies by species an ef sensing regulatory system tcss in geobacter is proposed according to the comparison of the transcriptomics from two species with different responses to ef which has to be further identified in detail increasing knowledge of ef regulatory mechanism provides a molecular basis for the understanding of

16241,wastewater treatment carried out by microalgae is usually affected by the type of algal strain and the combination of cultivation parameters provided during the process every microalga strain has a different tolerance level towards cultivation parameters including temperature ph light intensity co2 content initial inoculum level pretreatment method reactor type and nutrient concentration in wastewater therefore it is vital to supply the right combination of cultivation parameters to increase the wastewater treatment efficiency and biomass productivity of different microalgae classes in the current investigation the decision tree was used to analyse the dataset of class trebouxiophyceae and chlorophyceae various combinations of cultivation parameters were determined to enhance their performance in wastewater treatment nine combinations of cultivation parameters leading to high biomass production and eleven combinations each for high nitrogen removal efficiency and high phosphorus removal efficiency for class trebouxiophyceae were detected by decision tree models similarly eleven combinations for high biomass production nine for high nitrogen removal efficiency and eight for high phosphorus removal efficiency were detected for class chlorophyceae the results obtained through decision tree analysis can provide the optimum conditions of cultivation parameters saving time in designing new experiments for treating wastewater at a large scale graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microalgae machine learning wastewater treatment biomass

intensity 1 introduction it is a well known fact that the biological treatment of wastewater by microalgae is far more sustainable than conventional methods including biological treatment by bacteria the phycoremediation technique presents an effective route for dealing with eutrophication problems and ensuring the restoration of resources ravikumar et al 2021 now wastewater is being considered as a valuable resource not just mere waste wastewater contains ample organic and inorganic nutrients and traces of heavy metals which support microalgae growth biswas et al 2021 the productivity of microalga biomass is estimated to be higher than that of plants under similar cultivation conditions it can easily replace the current food crops used for oil production such as soybean and jatropha sheehan et al 1998 moreover algal biomass can be transformed into marketable products including bioactive compounds antioxidants pigments feed and fertiliser mata et al 2010 but despite promising results at the lab and pilot scale the microalgae based wastewater treatment is still not feasible at a large scale reasons include a high flow rate of wastewater selection of suitable microalgae strain optimisation and selection of the right combination of cultivation parameters including temperature temp ph li light intensity carbon dioxide content therefore there is a need to tackle these challenges to scale up the microalgae based wastewater treatment process at a larger scale microalgae productivity is strongly influenced by the microalgae strain used and cultivation parameters applied during the wastewater treatment biswas et al 2021 approximately 200 000 to 500 000 microalgae species have been reported the majority of them are from class chlorophyceae and trebouxiophyceae which have been used to treat wastewater silambarasan et al 2021 venkatesan et al 2015 silambarasan et al 2021 cultivated scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp belonging to class chlorophyceae and trebouxiophyceae respectively in domestic wastewater both species were able to remediate 72 98 of nutrients from diluted wastewater with a 1 5 g l biomass yield silambarasan et al 2021 it is to be noted that every microalga species has a different tolerance level towards cultivation parameters or input variables such as nutrient concentration in wastewater li ph temperature co2 content and many others each of them has its own optimum combination of input variables under which they display a high potential to remediate pollutants from wastewater and increase biomass productivity therefore in order to enhance the efficiency of the microalgae based wastewater treatment it is necessary to select the right strain and supply the right combination of cultivation parameters practically it is not feasible to test all combinations of cultivation parameters on different microalgae species in a single experimental study singh and mishra 2021 the selection of suitable strains for wastewater treatment and their right combination of cultivation parameters can be easily detected via analysing published datasets generated experimentally by machine learning decision tree is one of the popular machine learning algorithms which can quickly discover patterns in a large database and provide the right combination of cultivation parameters for different microalgae strains the decision tree algorithm performs the analysis by plotting the learned knowledge from a large database in the form of a tree where the if then rule governs tree growth dallora et al 2017 hitherto a machine learning algorithm was used to analyse microalgae based wastewater treatment datasets considering the general strain used for the treatment process singh and mishra 2021 however no recent study is dealing with applying the decision tree algorithm for inspecting the microalgae based wastewater treatment database concerning specific strain class of microalgae species therefore the present investigation aims at providing the right combination of input variables for the cultivation of microalgae belonging to two classes i e chlorophyceae and trebouxiophyceae in wastewater this study started with constructing a dataset representing output variables namely nitrogen removal efficiency nre phosphorus removal efficiency pre and biomass production for both the classes by collecting data from recent scientific articles 2010 2021 thereafter the decision tree function was applied to analyse the constructed dataset the best combination of input variables was detected for maximising the nutrient removal capability and biomass productivity of both the classes 2 methodology 2 1 dataset construction and pre processing the dataset referring to output variables nre 239 data points pre 239 data points biomass production 214 data points for class trebouxiophyceae and nre 200 data points pre 204 data points biomass production 206 data points for class chlorophyceae was extracted from

2019 zkeri et al 2021 the cultivation parameters or predictor variables for evaluation were considered based on correlation analysis singh and mishra 2021 the selected input variables showing correlation with the output variables and their range or identities considered in studies are shown in table 1 variables such as reactor volume type of light source light wavelength and cultivation time were not considered as they did not show any correlation with output variables input variables were comprised of both categorical and continuous variables which were classified into three groups i pre cultivation stage deciding factors ii growth components in wastewater iii operating variables the hot encoding technique encoded categorical variables the output variables were clustered into two classes i low level class and ii high level class the median of output variables was used to set up the threshold limit values lower than the threshold were clustered in the low level class values higher than the threshold were clustered into high level class at the last step of data pre processing all the null values were removed as they affect the performance of machine learning algorithms and decrease their accuracy also units of all variables were standardised 2 2 decision tree analysis the decision tree algorithm was used for analysing the dataset the combinations of input variables generating low and high levels of output variables for each class were determined fig 1 shows the steps involved in decision tree analysis matlab version 9 2 r2017a function fitctree was applied for constructing decision trees by default classification and regression trees cart algorithm optimizehyperparameters one of the options of the fitctree function was used to build optimum decision tree models by optimising hyperparameters and minimising the cross validation error hyperparameters indicate the parameters whose values needed to be set before performing machine learning analysis chen et al 2021 in the present analysis all hyperparameters including split criterion maxnumspilts minleafsize and numvariablestosample were optimised the training and testing of the model were executed by dividing the whole dataset randomly into two subgroups i training set consisting of 80 of the whole dataset ii testing subset comprising of 20 of the whole dataset as shown in fig 1 this step is needed for building a generalised tree model that can categorise any new experimental finding with high precision division of the dataset into training and testing sets was performed by matlab function cvpartition and the holdout validation procedure performed validation of the trained models different decision tree models were constructed using the training set the model with minimum cross validation error was further picked up for testing the dataset and predicting the final accuracy of the selected model it should be noted that no data from the testing set was used during the training step of decision tree models finally the significant input variables which affected the construction of the decision tree models and the microalgae based wastewater treatment were determined by matlab function predictorimportance 3 result and discussion three decision tree models for both classes were constructed various combinations of input variables leading to low and high level of output variables were determined afterwards by decision tree models 3 1 decision tree analysis for class trebouxiophyceae 3 1 1 nitrogen removal efficiency the optimum tree model representing various combinations of input variables leading to the low and high level of nre for class trebouxiophyceae is shown in fig 2 here anaerobic pretreatment serves as the root of the decision tree this tree has 11 different combinations or paths of input variables showing high nre starting from the left hand side when anaerobic treatment is not done domestic wastewater source provides the next branching level other input variables that influenced the growth of the tree were initial phosphorus concentration initial p concentration initial nitrogen concentration initial n concentration temperature temp initial inoculum level iil co2 content li photoperiod and cultivation type there were nine different paths that led to a high level of nre among them the first and seventh path provided the most generalised rules in the case of the first path pretreatment was other than anaerobic wastewater source was other than domestic initial n concentration 527 mg l temp 24 2 c and photoperiod 20 h the accuracy of this path was nearly 100 and reinforced by 20 data points obtained from ref arbib et al 2014 ge and champagne 2016 gonçalves et al 2016 gouveia et al 2016 hernández et al 2013 mennaa et al 2015b d saranya and shanthakumar 2020 wang et al 2014a statistically this path was the most reliable for class trebouxiophyceae conditions for the seventh path were pre treatment method other than anaerobic wastewater source other than domestic initial n concentration 527 mg l temp 24 2 c initial p concentration 0 36 mg l li between 72 and 181 μmol m 2 s 1 and iil 0 292 g l the accuracy of this path was also 100 however this was reinforced by 13 data points only obtained from ref c y y chen et al 2020b enwereuzoh et al 2021 gebremedhin et al 2018 hülsen et al 2018b kong et al 2021 s dinesh dinesh kumar et al 2015b mujtaba and lee 2017 t t d t t nguyen et al 2020 d saranya and shanthakumar 2020 zhou et al 2012a q 2018 for the right hand side iil provided the next branching level when anaerobic pretreatment was done other factors that influenced the tree s growth were wastewater source temp and initial n concentration there were only two paths that led to high nre the most generalised combination of input variables on the right hand side was provided by path no eleven where pretreatment method was anaerobic iil 0 09 g l wastewater source was industrial temp 23 35 c and initial n concentration 306 85 mg l the accuracy of this path was 62 5 reinforced by eight data points obtained from ref s dinesh s dinesh kumar et al 2015 sayedin et al 2020 tan et al 2014 tan et al 2021 yang et al 2015b zhou et al 2012a at last the general accuracy of the model was determined by a confusion matrix which was constructed by simulating the rules extracted from the tree on the testing set as shown in fig 3 the data in the testing set was new for the models and never used during the training step as shown in fig 3 the model correctly classified 17 low level data points out of 25 and 17 high level data points out of 22 with a general accuracy of 72 34 now for determining the influence of each input variable on the growth of the decision tree models the predictorimportance function was used and the results are shown in fig 4 as evident from fig 4 operating variables including temp iil ph li co2 content and nutrient concentration were more influential than other input variables during the construction of decision tree models as expected the initial n concentration was more significant than the initial p concentration a higher concentration of nitrogen 527 mg l as predicted by the first path acted as a growth reducing factor for class trebouxiophyceae tam and wong 1996 estimated the growth of chlorella species belonging to class trebouxiophyceae at different n concentrations the authors observed that growth was inhibited at 700 mg l ammonium akerstrom et al 2014 71 cultivated chlorella sp at different nitrogen concentrations ranging from 221 to 1210 mg l in sludge liquor nre increased from 47 05 to 83 74 with the surge in n concentration from 221 mg l to 363 mg l after that nre decreased with a further increase of n therefore pretreatment of wastewater such as dilution is needed in case of high n concentration 500 mg l in the wastewater 3 1 2 phosphorus removal efficiency decision tree analysis determined different combinations of input variables leading to high pre for class trebouxiophyceae which is represented by optimum tree structure as shown in fig 5 fig 6 the tree first separates the dataset according to the co2 content supplied to the cultivation medium decision tree analysis identified 11 different paths leading to high pre in case of co2 content less than 0 045 v v iil provides the next cut branching continues further with operating variables nutrient concentration wastewater source and pretreatment method providing six different combinations of input variables leading to high pre among these the sixth path provided the most generalised combination as it has higher accuracy 100 than others and is supported by 17 data points from ref d garcía et al 2018 d 2017 ge and champagne 2016 gebremedhin et al 2018 gupta et al 2016 mujtaba and lee 2017 nguyen et al 2019 rasoul amini et al 2014b rosli et al 2020 d saranya and shanthakumar 2020 viegas et al 2021 wang et al 2014b j zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2012b rules provided by this path were co2 0 045 v v iil 0 21 g l ph 7 4 no presence of agricultural wastewater pre treatment method is not anaerobic and temp 21 5 c for the case of co2 content more than 0 045 v v initial p concentration provides the next cut and branching is continued by ph li initial n concentration and pretreatment method providing five paths or different combinations of input variables leading to high pre out of these the seventh path provided the most generalised rules which were co2 0 045 v v ph 8 35 and initial p concentration 12 43 mg l the accuracy of this path was 100 and was reinforced by 29 data points obtained from ref åkerström et al 2014 ansari et al 2017b arbib et al 2014 cheah et al 2018 chu et al 2015 enwereuzoh et al 2021 ge et al 2018 gonçalves et al 2016 guldhe et al 2017 he et al 2013 kiran et al 2014 kumar et al 2018 mehrabadi et al 2017 rinna et al 2017 song et al 2020b tran et al 2020 wang et al 2014b rules extracted from this path are the most reliable for increasing pre for the case of class trebouxiophyceae next to further justify the rules extracted from the decision tree analysis they were tested on the testing dataset and accuracy was determined by a confusion matrix the model correctly classified 22 low level data points out of 28 and 15 high level data points out of 23 with a general accuracy of 72 5 relative importance of the input variables is shown in fig 7 similar to the nre the construction of the model was influenced significantly by nutrient concentration in wastewater and operating variables in the case of pre initial p concentration was more influential than initial n concentration with the increase of initial p concentration there was a slight decrease in pre as compared to the trend of nre åkerström et al 2014 this may be due to the fact that trebouxiophyceae class has high p uptake capacity they can remediate and store excess p in the form of polyphosphate granules which can be utilised during phosphate deficient conditions larsdotter 2006 among the pretreatment methods the anaerobic pretreatment method exceedingly influenced pre over other methods 3 1 3 biomass production the optimum tree model representing various combinations of input variables leading to the low and high level of biomass production for class trebouxiophyceae is shown in fig 8 the tree splits the whole dataset according to iil level it detected nine different paths leading to high biomass production for class trebouxiophyceae for the left hand side where iil 0 151 g l initial p concentration provides the next cut and the tree s growth was influenced by pretreatment method nutrient concentration and operating variables detecting four different paths leading to high biomass production the first path provided the most generalised rule whose conditions were iil 0 151 g l initial p conc 1 495 mg l anaerobic pretreatment and li 87 75 μmol m 2 s 1 out of these accuracy of this path was 100 and reinforced by 10 data points obtained from ref y gao et al 2021 it is worth noting that initial nutrient concentration becomes one of the significant variables at a low iil level on the left side the reason for this phenomenon has been provided during the relative importance analysis of input variables for the right hand side where iil 0 151 g l temp provides the next cut and growth of the tree is influenced by operating variables and initial nutrient concentration detecting five different paths leading to high biomass production out of them path no fifth and seventh provided the most generalised rules for increasing biomass production for class trebouxiophyceae conditions for the fifth path were iil 0 151 g l temp 18 25 c ph 7 88 and li 83 75 μmol m 2 s 1 the accuracy of this path was 100 and was supported by 22 data points obtained from ref almomani and örmeci 2016 garcía et al 2019 ge and champagne 2016 gupta et al 2016 hongyang et al 2011 kong et al 2021 s dinesh s dinesh kumar et al 2015 you et al 2021 y zhang et al 2012 zhou et al 2012b for path no seven the conditions were iil 0 151 g l temp 18 25 c ph 7 88 and li 83 75 μmol m 2 s 1 initial n concentration 27 73 mg l wastewater source other than livestock initial p concentration 24 52 mg l the accuracy of this path was 84 61 and was held by 13 data points obtained from ref chu et al 2015 ge and champagne 2016 lu et al 2015 sayedin et al 2020 tan et al 2014 umamaheswari et al 2020 yang et al 2015b zhong et al 2021 s zhu et al 2019 the final accuracy of the model was determined by the confusion matrix as shown in fig 9 the model correctly predicted 17 low level data points out of 23 and 16 high level data points out of 19 with a general accuracy of 78 57 the relative importance of the input variables affecting the growth of the decision tree models is shown in fig 10 in this case also operating variables were more influential than other variables iil is of higher importance among the operating variables than the other operating variables as it vastly affects the microalgae growth in wastewater particularly during the treatment process due to the existence of toxic chemicals and heavy metals in wastewater the lag phase of the growth curve increases however if high iil is supplied at the start of wastewater treatment then it readily assists in the acclimatisation of the culture in wastewater thus the lag phase duration decreases guo et al 2020 wang et al 2010 cultivated chlorella sp in dairy manure at different initial inoculum concentrations the authors noticed that with the increase of iil from 0 14 g l to 0 18 g l there was a simultaneous increase in biomass concentration from 1 4 g l to 1 8 g l wang et al 2010 however a very high iil is not suitable for microalgae growth it leads to mutual shading and less light penetrates the culture bohutskyi et al 2016 kumar et al 2014 cultivated chlorella sp in shrimp cultured effluent at different iil ranging from 0 25 to 12 g l it was observed that biomass production also improved with the increase of iil nonetheless there was no significant increase in biomass concentration above 8 12 g l even in few case studies biomass concentration started to decrease at a very high concentration of iil due to autoinhibition chen et al 2012 s dinesh s dinesh kumar et al 2015 hence the selection of optimised iil for large scale wastewater treatment is crucial as it reduces the cost of operation s dinesh s dinesh kumar et al 2015 3 2 decision tree analysis for class chlorophyceae 3 2 1 nitrogen removal efficiency the optimum tree model representing various combinations of input variables leading to the low and high level of nre for class chlorophyceae is shown in fig 11 here primary pretreatment serves as the root of the decision tree here the primary pretreatment method of the wastewater serves as the root of the tree and nine different paths leading to high nre for class chlorophyceae were detected starting from the left side when primary pretreatment is not done the initial p concentration provides the next level of branching the decision tree detected six paths leading to high nre amongst these the sixth path provided the most generalised set of combinations in which the pretreatment method was not primary initial p concentration ranged between 0 975 and 11 6 mg l iil 0 13 g l with no presence of livestock wastewater the accuracy of this path was 100 and was strengthened by 13 data points obtained from ref a hernández garcía et al 2019b kandimalla et al 2016 lv et al 2019 nie et al 2018 posadas et al 2015a su et al 2012 the right hand side presents the cases where primary pretreatment was done here co2 content provided the next cut and li and photoperiod influenced tree growth there were only three paths on the right hand side leading to high nre among them the seventh path provided the most generalised set of rules for increasing nre whose conditions were primary pretreatment method co2 content 0 52 v v photoperiod 15 h and li 112 μmol m 2 s 1 the accuracy of this path was 100 and was strengthened by 16 data points obtained from ref baglieri et al 2016b chaudhary et al 2018b e daneshvar et al 2018 gonçalves et al 2016 habibi et al 2019 han et al 2015 a hernández garcía et al 2019b kothari et al 2013 liu et al 2019 mennaa et al 2015b nie et al 2018 umamaheswari and shanthakumar 2019 ye et al 2020b this path provided the most reliable set of rules for increasing nre in the case of class chlorophyceae the general accuracy of the model was determined by the confusion matrix as shown in fig 12 the model correctly classified 19 low data points out of 23 and 15 high level data points out of 23 with a general accuracy of 73 91 next the relative importance of each parameter is shown in fig 13 operating variables were more influential than other variables among which co2 content and iil were more significant another critical point may be noted that for class chlorophyceae initial p concentration was more influential than initial n concentration as compared to class trebouxiophyceae 3 2 2 phosphorus removal efficiency the optimum tree model representing various combinations of input variables leading to the low and high level of pre for class chlorophyceae is shown in fig 14 here industrial wastewater source acted as the tree s root which means left hand cases will not be applicable for industrial wastewater sources the decision tree determined eight different paths leading to high pre in the case of class chlorophyceae for the left hand side when the wastewater source is not industrial the autoclave pretreatment method provided the second level of branching other variables that influenced the tree s growth were initial p concentration ph photoperiod li reactor type pretreatment method temp and initial n concentration total six paths led to high pre out of which the sixth path provided the most generalised set of rules the conditions of the sixth path were wastewater sources other than industrial autoclave pretreatment method ph 7 75 and iil 0 04 g l the accuracy of this path was 100 and reinforced by 31 data points obtained from ref ansari et al 2017b aravantinou et al 2013 arbib et al 2014 choi et al 2018 fan et al 2020 gentili 2014 kandimalla et al 2016 lv et al 2019 mousavi et al 2018b nie et al 2018 posadas et al 2015a rasoul amini et al 2014b tripathi et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 the sixth path provided the most reliable set of rules or combination of input variables leading to high pre for the case of class chlorophyceae a minimal branching level occurred on the right side where tree started with industrial wastewater source and li provided the next branching level two paths led to high pre only out of which the seventh path provided the most generalised set of rules the conditions of the seventh path were industrial wastewater source li 201 25 μmol m 2 s 1 and co2 12 5 v v the general accuracy of the model was estimated by a confusion matrix as shown in fig 15 the model predicted 12 low level data points out of 19 and 20 high level data points out 21 correctly with a general accuracy of 80 fig 16 represents the relative importance of input variables influencing the pre for class chlorophyceae as concluded by relative importance function among operating variables temperature was more influential than other variables effect of temperature on pre is related to microalgae growth ma et al 2017 cultivated scenedesmus sp z 4 belonging to class chlorophyceae in molasses wastewater at different temperature level ranging from 4 c to 25 c it was observed that as the temperature was increased from 4 c to 25 c pre also increased from 44 12 to 83 3 ma et al 2017 among the nutrient concentration initial p concentration was more influential than initial n concentration similar to the trend observed in class trebouxiophyceae this trend was also supported by the study of ajala and alexander 2020 they cultivated scenedesmus obliqus belonging to class chlorophyceae at different initial concentration of phosphate pre decreased from 100 to 50 17 as with the increase in phosphate concentration from 17 2 g l to 145 1 g l ajala and alexander 2020 3 2 3 biomass production the optimum tree model representing various combinations of input variables leading to the low and high level of biomass production for class chlorophyceae is shown in fig 17 similar to class trebouxiophyceae here also iil level divided the tree into two parts serving as the root of the tree and at the left hand side initial nutrient concentration was more significant eleven paths leading to high biomass production were determined for class chlorophyceae the first eight paths were present on the left hand side where the tree starts with iil 0 104 g l initial n concentration provides the next cut and further branching was influenced by initial p concentration pre treatment method wastewater source ph temp and photoperiod among all the paths the eighth path provided the most generalised set of rules iil 0 104 g l initial n concentration 156 66 mg l initial p concentration 44 83 mg l and pretreatment method was other than primary the accuracy of this path was 100 and reinforced by 11 data points obtained from ref abu hajar et al 2017 fernando et al 2021 ma et al 2017 rasoul amini et al 2014b wu et al 2012 ye et al 2020b zhao et al 2016 the remaining three paths 9 10 11 were present on the right hand side where the tree starts with iil 0 104 g l initial p concentration provided the next cut other factors that influenced the branching were co2 content wastewater source li and initial n concentration path no 11 provided the most reliable set of rules iil 0 104 g l initial p concentration 7 105 mg l li between 30 64 and 1925 μmol m 2 s 1 and initial n concentration 748 1 mg l the accuracy of this path was 97 14 and was held by 35 data points obtained from ref abou shanab et al 2013 almomani and örmeci 2016 r chaudhary et al 2018a da fontoura et al 2017b enwereuzoh et al 2021 gómez et al 2013 haque et al 2017 heredia falconí et al 2021b a

walls et al 2019 a confusion matrix was used to determine the model s final accuracy as shown in fig 18 the model correctly classified 14 low level data points out of 17 and 16 high level data points out of 24 with a final accuracy of 73 17 next the relative importance of each parameter influencing the decision tree models is shown in fig 19 similar to the case of class trebouxiophyceae here also iil was relatively more vital than other operating variables fernando et al 2021 cultivated haematococcus pluvialis in palm oil effluent at iil likewise with the rise in iil from 0 05 mg l to 0 1 g l there was a simultaneous increase in biomass concentration from 0 29 g l to 0 52 g l respectively fernando et al 2021 in addition to this initial n concentration was more significant for both classes than initial p concentration n concentration not only affects the microalgae growth but also regulates the medium s ph while less than 1 by weight of phosphorus is present in microalgae biomass richmond 2004 ajala et al 2019 observed that low n concentration limits biomass production while high n concentration leads to growth inhibition authors cultivated scenedesmus obliquus and oocystis minuta in secondary treated wastewater at different nitrogen concentrations in both species biomass concentration increased as n concentration was increased up to 377 56 mg l above this value biomass concentration started declining a high biomass concentration of 1 3 g l was observed at 377 mg l in the case of oocystis minuta ajala and alexander 2020 in the present study decision tree analysis also detected that n concentrations between 156 66 mg l and 748 1 mg l would be ideal for increasing biomass productivity 4 conclusion the present investigation focuses on determining the best combination of cultivation parameters leading to high wastewater treatment capability and biomass productivity by decision tree analysis for microalgae class trebouxiophyceae and chlorophyceae the

16241,wastewater treatment carried out by microalgae is usually affected by the type of algal strain and the combination of cultivation parameters provided during the process every microalga strain has a different tolerance level towards cultivation parameters including temperature ph light intensity co2 content initial inoculum level pretreatment method reactor type and nutrient concentration in wastewater therefore it is vital to supply the right combination of cultivation parameters to increase the wastewater treatment efficiency and biomass productivity of different microalgae classes in the current investigation the decision tree was used to analyse the dataset of class trebouxiophyceae and chlorophyceae various combinations of cultivation parameters were determined to enhance their performance in wastewater treatment nine combinations of cultivation parameters leading to high biomass production and eleven combinations each for high nitrogen removal efficiency and high phosphorus removal efficiency for class trebouxiophyceae were detected by decision tree models similarly eleven combinations for high biomass production nine for high nitrogen removal efficiency and eight for high phosphorus removal efficiency were detected for class chlorophyceae the results obtained through decision tree analysis can provide the optimum conditions of cultivation parameters

intensity 1 introduction it is a well known fact that the biological treatment of wastewater by microalgae is far more sustainable than conventional methods including biological treatment by bacteria the phycoremediation technique presents an effective route for dealing with eutrophication problems and ensuring the restoration of resources ravikumar et al 2021 now wastewater is being considered as a valuable resource not just mere waste wastewater contains ample organic and inorganic nutrients and traces of heavy metals which support microalgae growth biswas et al 2021 the productivity of microalga biomass is estimated to be higher than that of plants under similar cultivation conditions it can easily replace the current food crops used for oil production such as soybean and jatropha sheehan et al 1998 moreover algal biomass can be transformed into marketable products including bioactive compounds antioxidants pigments feed and fertiliser mata et al 2010 but despite promising results at the lab and pilot scale the microalgae based wastewater treatment is still not feasible at a large scale reasons include a high flow rate of wastewater selection of suitable microalgae strain optimisation and selection of the right combination of cultivation parameters including temperature temp ph li light intensity carbon dioxide content therefore there is a need to tackle these challenges to scale up the microalgae based wastewater treatment process at a larger scale microalgae productivity is strongly influenced by the microalgae strain used and cultivation parameters applied during the wastewater treatment biswas et al 2021 approximately 200 000 to 500 000 microalgae species have been reported the majority of them are from class chlorophyceae and trebouxiophyceae which have been used to treat wastewater silambarasan et al 2021 venkatesan et al 2015 silambarasan et al 2021 cultivated scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp belonging to class chlorophyceae and trebouxiophyceae respectively in domestic wastewater both species were able to remediate 72 98 of nutrients from diluted wastewater with a 1 5 g l biomass yield silambarasan et al 2021 it is to be noted that every microalga species has a different tolerance level towards cultivation parameters or input variables such as nutrient concentration in wastewater li ph temperature co2 content and many others each of them has its own optimum combination of input variables under which they display a high potential to remediate pollutants from wastewater and increase biomass productivity therefore in order to enhance the efficiency of the microalgae based wastewater treatment it is necessary to select the right strain and supply the right combination of cultivation parameters practically it is not feasible to test all combinations of cultivation parameters on different microalgae species in a single experimental study singh and mishra 2021 the selection of suitable strains for wastewater treatment and their right combination of cultivation parameters can be easily detected via analysing published datasets generated experimentally by machine learning decision tree is one of the popular machine learning algorithms which can quickly discover patterns in a large database and provide the right combination of cultivation parameters for different microalgae strains the decision tree algorithm performs the analysis by plotting the learned knowledge from a large database in the form of a tree where the if then rule governs tree growth dallora et al 2017 hitherto a machine learning algorithm was used to analyse microalgae based wastewater treatment datasets considering the general strain used for the treatment process singh and mishra 2021 however no recent study is dealing with applying the decision tree algorithm for inspecting the microalgae based wastewater treatment database concerning specific strain class of microalgae species therefore the present investigation aims at providing the right combination of input variables for the cultivation of microalgae belonging to two classes i e chlorophyceae and trebouxiophyceae in wastewater this study started with constructing a dataset representing output variables namely nitrogen removal efficiency nre phosphorus removal efficiency pre and biomass production for both the classes by collecting data from recent scientific articles 2010 2021 thereafter the decision tree function was applied to analyse the constructed dataset the best combination of input variables was detected for maximising the nutrient removal capability and biomass productivity of both the classes 2 methodology 2 1 dataset construction and pre processing the dataset referring to output variables nre 239 data points pre 239 data

2019 zkeri et al 2021 the cultivation parameters or predictor variables for evaluation were considered based on correlation analysis singh and mishra 2021 the selected input variables showing correlation with the output variables and their range or identities considered in studies are shown in table 1 variables such as reactor volume type of light source light wavelength and cultivation time were not considered as they did not show any correlation with output variables input variables were comprised of both categorical and continuous variables which were classified into three groups i pre cultivation stage deciding factors ii growth components in wastewater iii operating variables the hot encoding technique encoded categorical variables the output variables were clustered into two classes i low level class and ii high level class the median of output variables was used to set up the threshold limit values lower than the threshold were clustered in the low level class values higher than the threshold were clustered into high level class at the last step of data pre processing all the null values were removed as they affect the performance of machine learning algorithms and decrease their accuracy also units of all variables were standardised 2 2 decision tree analysis the decision tree algorithm was used for analysing the dataset the combinations of input variables generating low and high levels of output variables for each class were determined fig 1 shows the steps involved in decision tree analysis matlab version 9 2 r2017a function fitctree was applied for constructing decision trees by default classification and regression trees cart algorithm optimizehyperparameters one of the options of the fitctree function was used to build optimum decision tree models by optimising hyperparameters and minimising the cross validation error hyperparameters indicate the parameters whose values needed to be set before performing machine learning analysis chen et al 2021 in the present analysis all hyperparameters including split criterion maxnumspilts minleafsize and numvariablestosample were optimised the training and testing of the model were executed by dividing the whole dataset randomly into two subgroups i training set consisting of 80 of the whole dataset ii testing subset comprising of 20 of the whole dataset as shown in fig 1 this step is needed for building a generalised tree model that can categorise any new experimental finding with high precision division of the dataset into training and testing sets was performed by matlab function cvpartition and the holdout validation procedure performed validation of the trained models different decision tree models were constructed using the training set the model with minimum cross validation error was further picked up for testing the dataset and predicting the final accuracy of the selected model it should be noted that no data from the testing set was used during the training step of decision tree models finally the significant input variables which affected the construction of the decision tree models and the microalgae based wastewater treatment were determined by matlab function predictorimportance 3 result and discussion three decision tree models for both classes were constructed various combinations of input variables leading to low and high level of output variables were determined afterwards by decision tree models 3 1 decision tree analysis for class trebouxiophyceae 3 1 1 nitrogen removal efficiency the optimum tree model representing various combinations of input variables leading to the low and high level of nre for class trebouxiophyceae is shown in fig 2 here anaerobic pretreatment serves as the root of the decision tree this tree has 11 different combinations or paths of input variables showing high nre starting from the left hand side when anaerobic treatment is not done domestic wastewater source provides the next branching level other input variables that influenced the growth of the tree were initial phosphorus concentration initial p concentration initial nitrogen concentration initial n concentration temperature temp initial inoculum level iil co2 content li photoperiod and cultivation type there were nine different paths that led to a high level of nre among them the first and seventh path provided the most generalised rules in the case of the first path pretreatment was other than anaerobic wastewater source was other than domestic initial n concentration 527 mg l temp 24 2 c and photoperiod 20 h the accuracy of this path was nearly 100 and reinforced by 20 data points obtained from ref arbib et al 2014 ge and champagne 2016 gonçalves et al 2016 gouveia et al 2016 hernández et al 2013 mennaa et al 2015b d saranya and shanthakumar 2020 wang et al 2014a statistically this path was the most reliable for class trebouxiophyceae conditions for the seventh path were pre treatment method other than anaerobic wastewater source other than domestic initial n concentration 527 mg l temp 24 2 c initial p concentration 0 36 mg l li between 72 and 181 μmol m 2 s 1 and iil 0 292 g l the accuracy of this path was also 100 however this was reinforced by 13 data points only obtained from ref c y y chen et al 2020b enwereuzoh et al 2021 gebremedhin et al 2018 hülsen et al 2018b kong et al 2021 s dinesh dinesh kumar et al 2015b mujtaba and lee 2017 t t d t t nguyen et al 2020 d saranya and shanthakumar 2020 zhou et al 2012a q 2018 for the right hand side iil provided the next branching level when anaerobic pretreatment was done other factors that influenced the tree s growth were wastewater source temp and initial n concentration there were only two paths that led to high nre the most generalised combination of input variables on the right hand side was provided by path no eleven where pretreatment method was anaerobic iil 0 09 g l wastewater source was industrial temp 23 35 c and initial n concentration 306 85 mg l the accuracy of this path was 62 5 reinforced by eight data points obtained from ref s dinesh s dinesh kumar et al 2015 sayedin et al 2020 tan et al 2014 tan et al 2021 yang et al 2015b zhou et al 2012a at last the general accuracy of the model was determined by a confusion matrix which was constructed by simulating the rules extracted from the tree on the testing set as shown in fig 3 the data in the testing set was new for the models and never used during the training step as shown in fig 3 the model correctly classified 17 low level data points out of 25 and 17 high level data points out of 22 with a general accuracy of 72 34 now for determining the influence of each input variable on the growth of the decision tree models the predictorimportance function was used and the results are shown in fig 4 as evident from fig 4 operating variables including temp iil ph li co2 content and nutrient concentration were more influential than other input variables during the construction of decision tree models as expected the initial n concentration was more significant than the initial p concentration a higher concentration of nitrogen 527 mg l as predicted by the first path acted as a growth reducing factor for class trebouxiophyceae tam and wong 1996 estimated the growth of chlorella species belonging to class trebouxiophyceae at different n concentrations the authors observed that growth was inhibited at 700 mg l ammonium akerstrom et al 2014 71 cultivated chlorella sp at different nitrogen concentrations ranging from 221 to 1210 mg l in sludge liquor nre increased from 47 05 to 83 74 with the surge in n concentration from 221 mg l to 363 mg l after that nre decreased with a further increase of n therefore pretreatment of wastewater such as dilution is needed in case of high n concentration 500 mg l in the wastewater 3 1 2 phosphorus removal efficiency decision tree analysis determined different combinations of input variables leading to high pre for class trebouxiophyceae which is represented by optimum tree structure as shown in fig 5 fig 6 the tree first separates the dataset according to the co2 content supplied to the cultivation medium decision tree analysis identified 11 different paths leading to high pre in case of co2 content less than 0 045 v v iil provides the next cut branching continues further with operating variables nutrient concentration wastewater source and pretreatment method providing six different combinations of input variables leading to high pre among these the sixth path provided the most generalised combination as it has higher accuracy 100 than others and is supported by 17 data points from ref d garcía et al 2018 d 2017 ge and champagne 2016 gebremedhin et al 2018 gupta et al 2016 mujtaba and lee 2017 nguyen et al 2019 rasoul amini et al 2014b rosli et al 2020 d saranya and shanthakumar 2020 viegas et al 2021 wang et al 2014b j zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2012b rules provided by this path were co2 0 045 v v iil 0 21 g l ph 7 4 no presence of agricultural wastewater pre treatment method is not anaerobic and temp 21 5 c for the case of co2 content more than 0 045 v v initial p concentration provides the next cut and branching is continued by ph li initial n concentration and pretreatment method providing five paths or different combinations of input variables leading to high pre out of these the seventh path provided the most generalised rules which were co2 0 045 v v ph 8 35 and initial p concentration 12 43 mg l the accuracy of this path was 100 and was reinforced by 29 data points obtained from ref åkerström et al 2014 ansari et al 2017b arbib et al 2014 cheah et al 2018 chu et al 2015 enwereuzoh et al 2021 ge et al 2018 gonçalves et al 2016 guldhe et al 2017 he et al 2013 kiran et al 2014 kumar et al 2018 mehrabadi et al 2017 rinna et al 2017 song et al 2020b tran et al 2020 wang et al 2014b rules extracted from this path are the most reliable for increasing pre for the case of class trebouxiophyceae next to further justify the rules extracted from the decision tree analysis they were tested on the testing dataset and accuracy was determined by a confusion matrix the model correctly classified 22 low level data points out of 28 and 15 high level data points out of 23 with a general accuracy of 72 5 relative importance of the input variables is shown in fig 7 similar to the nre the construction of the model was influenced significantly by nutrient concentration in wastewater and operating variables in the case of pre initial p concentration was more influential than initial n concentration with the increase of initial p concentration there was a slight decrease in pre as compared to the trend of nre åkerström et al 2014 this may be due to the fact that trebouxiophyceae class has high p uptake capacity they can remediate and store excess p in the form of polyphosphate granules which can be utilised during phosphate deficient conditions larsdotter 2006 among the pretreatment methods the anaerobic pretreatment method exceedingly influenced pre over other methods 3 1 3 biomass production the optimum tree model representing various combinations of input variables leading to the low and high level of biomass production for class trebouxiophyceae is shown in fig 8 the tree splits the whole dataset according to iil level it detected nine different paths leading to high biomass production for class trebouxiophyceae for the left hand side where iil 0 151 g l initial p concentration provides the next cut and the tree s growth was influenced by pretreatment method nutrient concentration and operating variables detecting four different paths leading to high biomass production the first path provided the most generalised rule whose conditions were iil 0 151 g l initial p conc 1 495 mg l anaerobic pretreatment and li 87 75 μmol m 2 s 1 out of these accuracy of this path was 100 and reinforced by 10 data points obtained from ref y gao et al 2021 it is worth noting that initial nutrient concentration becomes one of the significant variables at a low iil level on the left side the reason for this phenomenon has been provided during the relative importance analysis of input variables for the right hand side where iil 0 151 g l temp provides the next cut and growth of the tree is influenced by operating variables and initial nutrient concentration detecting five different paths leading to high biomass production out of them path no fifth and seventh provided the most generalised rules for increasing biomass production for class trebouxiophyceae conditions for the fifth path were iil 0 151 g l temp 18 25 c ph 7 88 and li 83 75 μmol m 2 s 1 the accuracy of this path was 100 and was supported by 22 data points obtained from ref almomani and örmeci 2016 garcía et al 2019 ge and champagne 2016 gupta et al 2016 hongyang et al 2011 kong et al 2021 s dinesh s dinesh kumar et al 2015 you et al 2021 y zhang et al 2012 zhou et al 2012b for path no seven the conditions were iil 0 151 g l temp 18 25 c ph 7 88 and li 83 75 μmol m 2 s 1 initial n concentration 27 73 mg l wastewater source other than livestock initial p concentration 24 52 mg l the accuracy of this path was 84 61 and was held by 13 data points obtained from ref chu et al 2015 ge and champagne 2016 lu et al 2015 sayedin et al 2020 tan et al 2014 umamaheswari et al 2020 yang et al 2015b zhong et al 2021 s zhu et al 2019 the final accuracy of the model was determined by the confusion matrix as shown in fig 9 the model correctly predicted 17 low level data points out of 23 and 16 high level data points out of 19 with a general accuracy of 78 57 the relative importance of the input variables affecting the growth of the decision tree models is shown in fig 10 in this case also operating variables were more influential than other variables iil is of higher importance among the operating variables than the other operating variables as it vastly affects the microalgae growth in wastewater particularly during the treatment process due to the existence of toxic chemicals and heavy metals in wastewater the lag phase of the growth curve increases however if high iil is supplied at the start of wastewater treatment then it readily assists in the acclimatisation of the culture in wastewater thus the lag phase duration decreases guo et al 2020 wang et al 2010 cultivated chlorella sp in dairy manure at different initial inoculum concentrations the authors noticed that with the increase of iil from 0 14 g l to 0 18 g l there was a simultaneous increase in biomass concentration from 1 4 g l to 1 8 g l wang et al 2010 however a very high iil is not suitable for microalgae growth it leads to mutual shading and less light penetrates the culture bohutskyi et al 2016 kumar et al 2014 cultivated chlorella sp in shrimp cultured effluent at different iil ranging from 0 25 to 12 g l it was observed that biomass production also improved with the increase of iil nonetheless there was no significant increase in biomass concentration above 8 12 g l even in few case studies biomass concentration started to decrease at a very high concentration of iil due to autoinhibition chen et al 2012 s dinesh s dinesh kumar et al 2015 hence the selection of optimised iil for large scale wastewater treatment is crucial as it reduces the cost of operation s dinesh s dinesh kumar et al 2015 3 2 decision tree analysis for class chlorophyceae 3 2 1 nitrogen removal efficiency the optimum tree model representing various combinations of input variables leading to the low and high level of nre for class chlorophyceae is shown in fig 11 here primary pretreatment serves as the root of the decision tree here the primary pretreatment method of the wastewater serves as the root of the tree and nine different paths leading to high nre for class chlorophyceae were detected starting from the left side when primary pretreatment is not done the initial p concentration provides the next level of branching the decision tree detected six paths leading to high nre amongst these the sixth path provided the most generalised set of combinations in which the pretreatment method was not primary initial p concentration ranged between 0 975 and 11 6 mg l iil 0 13 g l with no presence of livestock wastewater the accuracy of this path was 100 and was strengthened by 13 data points obtained from ref a hernández garcía et al 2019b kandimalla et al 2016 lv et al 2019 nie et al 2018 posadas et al 2015a su et al 2012 the right hand side presents the cases where primary pretreatment was done here co2 content provided the next cut and li and photoperiod influenced tree growth there were only three paths on the right hand side leading to high nre among them the seventh path provided the most generalised set of rules for increasing nre whose conditions were primary pretreatment method co2 content 0 52 v v photoperiod 15 h and li 112 μmol m 2 s 1 the accuracy of this path was 100 and was strengthened by 16 data points obtained from ref baglieri et al 2016b chaudhary et al 2018b e daneshvar et al 2018 gonçalves et al 2016 habibi et al 2019 han et al 2015 a hernández garcía et al 2019b kothari et al 2013 liu et al 2019 mennaa et al 2015b nie et al 2018 umamaheswari and shanthakumar 2019 ye et al 2020b this path provided the most reliable set of rules for increasing nre in the case of class chlorophyceae the general accuracy of the model was determined by the confusion matrix as shown in fig 12 the model correctly classified 19 low data points out of 23 and 15 high level data points out of 23 with a general accuracy of 73 91 next the relative importance of each parameter is shown in fig 13 operating variables were more influential than other variables among which co2 content and iil were more significant another critical point may be noted that for class chlorophyceae initial p concentration was more influential than initial n concentration as compared to class trebouxiophyceae 3 2 2 phosphorus removal efficiency the optimum tree model representing various combinations of input variables leading to the low and high level of pre for class chlorophyceae is shown in fig 14 here industrial wastewater source acted as the tree s root which means left hand cases will not be applicable for industrial wastewater sources the decision tree determined eight different paths leading to high pre in the case of class chlorophyceae for the left hand side when the wastewater source is not industrial the autoclave pretreatment method provided the second level of branching other variables that influenced the tree s growth were initial p concentration ph photoperiod li reactor type pretreatment method temp and initial n concentration total six paths led to high pre out of which the sixth path provided the most generalised set of rules the conditions of the sixth path were wastewater sources other than industrial autoclave pretreatment method ph 7 75 and iil 0 04 g l the accuracy of this path was 100 and reinforced by 31 data points obtained from ref ansari et al 2017b aravantinou et al 2013 arbib et al 2014 choi et al 2018 fan et al 2020 gentili 2014 kandimalla et al 2016 lv et al 2019 mousavi et al 2018b nie et al 2018 posadas et al 2015a rasoul amini et al 2014b tripathi et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 the sixth path provided the most reliable set of rules or combination of input variables leading to high pre for the case of class chlorophyceae a minimal branching level occurred on the right side where tree started with industrial wastewater source and li provided the next branching level two paths led to high pre only out of which the seventh path provided the most generalised set of rules the conditions of the seventh path were industrial wastewater source li 201 25 μmol m 2 s 1 and co2 12 5 v v the general accuracy of the model was estimated by a confusion matrix as shown in fig 15 the model predicted 12 low level data points out of 19 and 20 high level data points out 21 correctly with a general accuracy of 80 fig 16 represents the relative importance of input variables influencing the pre for class chlorophyceae as concluded by relative importance function among operating variables temperature was more influential than other variables effect of temperature on pre is related to microalgae growth ma et al 2017 cultivated scenedesmus sp z 4 belonging to class chlorophyceae in molasses wastewater at different temperature level ranging from 4 c to 25 c it was observed that as the temperature was increased from 4 c to 25 c pre also increased from 44 12 to 83 3 ma et al 2017 among the nutrient concentration initial p concentration was more influential than initial n concentration similar to the trend observed in class trebouxiophyceae this trend was also supported by the study of ajala and alexander 2020 they cultivated scenedesmus obliqus belonging to class chlorophyceae at different initial concentration of phosphate pre decreased from 100 to 50 17 as with the increase in phosphate concentration from 17 2 g l to 145 1 g l ajala and alexander 2020 3 2 3 biomass production the optimum tree model representing various combinations of input variables leading to the low and high level of biomass production for class chlorophyceae is shown in fig 17 similar to class trebouxiophyceae here also iil level divided the tree into two parts serving as the root of the tree and at the left hand side initial nutrient concentration was more significant eleven paths leading to high biomass production were determined for class chlorophyceae the first eight paths were present on the left hand side where the tree starts with iil 0 104 g l initial n concentration provides the next cut and further branching was influenced by initial p concentration pre treatment method wastewater source ph temp and photoperiod among all the paths the eighth path provided the most generalised set of rules iil 0 104 g l initial n concentration 156 66 mg l initial p concentration 44 83 mg l and pretreatment method was other than primary the accuracy of this path was 100 and reinforced by 11 data points obtained from ref abu hajar et al 2017 fernando et al 2021 ma et al 2017 rasoul amini et al 2014b wu et al 2012 ye et al 2020b zhao et al 2016 the remaining three paths 9 10 11 were present on the right hand side where the tree starts with iil 0 104 g l initial p concentration provided the next cut other factors that influenced the branching were co2 content wastewater source li and initial n concentration path no 11 provided the most reliable set of rules iil 0 104 g l initial p concentration 7 105 mg l li between 30 64 and 1925 μmol m 2 s 1 and initial n concentration 748 1 mg l the accuracy of this path was 97 14 and was held by 35 data points obtained from ref abou shanab et al 2013 almomani and örmeci 2016 r chaudhary et al 2018a da fontoura et al 2017b enwereuzoh et al 2021 gómez et al 2013 haque et al 2017 heredia falconí et al 2021b a hernández garcía et al 2019b jia et al 2016 ling et al 2019 lv et al 2019 miyawaki et al 2021 mousavi et al 2018b 2018a nayak et al 2016 sacristán de alva et al 2018 tao et al 2017 tripathi et al 2019 walls et al 2019 a confusion matrix was used to determine the model s final accuracy as shown in fig 18 the model correctly classified 14 low level data points out of 17 and 16 high level data points out of 24 with a final accuracy of 73 17 next the relative importance of each parameter influencing the decision tree models is shown in fig 19 similar to the case of class trebouxiophyceae here also iil was relatively more vital than other operating variables fernando et al 2021 cultivated haematococcus pluvialis in palm oil effluent at iil likewise with the rise in iil from 0 05 mg l to 0 1 g l there was a simultaneous increase in biomass concentration from 0 29 g l to 0 52 g l respectively fernando et al 2021 in addition to this initial n concentration was more significant for both classes than initial p concentration n concentration not only affects the microalgae growth but also regulates the medium s ph while less than 1 by weight of phosphorus is present in microalgae biomass richmond 2004 ajala et al 2019 observed that low n concentration limits biomass production while high n concentration leads to growth inhibition authors cultivated scenedesmus obliquus and oocystis minuta in secondary treated wastewater at different nitrogen concentrations in both species biomass concentration increased as n concentration was increased up to 377 56 mg l above this value biomass concentration started declining a high biomass concentration of 1 3 g l was observed at 377 mg l in the case of oocystis minuta ajala and alexander 2020 in the present study decision tree analysis also detected that n concentrations between 156 66 mg l and 748 1 mg l would be ideal for increasing biomass productivity 4 conclusion the present investigation focuses on determining the best combination of cultivation parameters leading to high wastewater treatment capability and biomass productivity by decision tree analysis for microalgae class trebouxiophyceae and chlorophyceae the best combination or paths were determined by accuracy level and no of data points that support them the best combination for class trebouxiophyceae was nre pretreatment was other than anaerobic wastewater source is other than domestic initial n concentration 527 mg l temp 24 2 c and photoperiod 20 h pre co2 0 045 v v ph 8 35 and initial p concentration 12 43 mg l biomass iil 0 151 g l temp 18 25 c ph 7 88 and li 83 75 μmol m 2 s 1 the best combination for class chlorophyceae was nre co2 content 0 52 v v photoperiod 15 h and li 112 μmol m 2 s 1 pre wastewater source other than industrial autoclave pretreatment method ph 7 75 and iil 0 04 g l biomass iil 0 104 g l initial p concentration 7 105 mg l li between 30 64 and 1925 μmol m 2 s 1 and initial n concentration 748 1 mg l it was also concluded that initial inoculum level and initial nitrogen concentration influenced biomass production for both trebouxiophyceae and chlorophyceae classes thus the results obtained through decision tree analysis can assist in designing new experiments with a more broad application of these two microalgae classes at a larger scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare

filter challenge experiments ten different commonly used imported pou filter cartridges were purchased from local filter retailers the cartridges were 25 4 cm long and 7 cm in diameter the polypropylene cartridges had pore sizes of 0 2 µm 0 45 µm absolute and 1 µm activated carbon cartridges had pore sizes of 0 5 1 and 2 µm and polyester cartridges had pore sizes of 1 µm nominal and absolute and 5 µm table 1 the filtration experiments carried out on these filters simulated instantaneous contamination events with high viral loads clean cartridges were fitted into housing units with the input ports on the top and they were connected to both inlet and outlet tubing supplementary fig s1 chlorine free tap water ph 8 ionic strength 1 22 mm supplementary table s1 which was sourced from deep alluvial gravel groundwater was applied at a constant flow rate of 1 l min in all experiments this flow rate was within the cartridges operational flow rate ranges specified by the manufacturers and it typified household usage the flow was introduced via the inlet tubing using a masterflex l s peristaltic pump and pump head model 7 720 062 cole parmer illinois usa injection solutions containing the viruses were prepared by sonicating the virus stocks for 2 min before adding them to the chlorine free tap water before the experiments the injection solutions were homogenised by shaking them at 120 rpm in a cold room overnight the filter was fully saturated and a constant flow was established for 30 min prior to the virus challenge experiments for each test run 166 2 6 ml of a solution containing norovirus adenovirus and rotavirus 106 107 gc ml was injected for 10 s the filter effluent was collected continuously into 26 sample pots over 220 s this was followed by flushing the filter with fresh tap water for 3 min before the subsequent run generally 3 challenge runs were conducted sequentially for each filter to examine whether the mixed virus injections had any confounding effects on virus reduction additional experiments with single virus injections were also conducted using the 5 µm polyester filter in addition to examine differences between using tap water and bore water experiments using shallow bore water ph 7 8 ionic strength 1 16 mm supplementary table s1 were conducted using the 0 45 µm polypropylene filter all experiments were carried out at room temperature 20 c all filter effluent samples were quantified directly by using the qpcr section 2 1 without concentration 2 3 data analysis using the concentration breakthrough curves btcs derived from the individual test runs supplementary figs s2 s4 virus log10 reduction values lrvs were determined from the total numbers of the viruses injected n0 and the total numbers of the viruses recovered in the continuously collected filter effluent n as follows 1 lrv lo g 10 n 0 n lo g 10 c 0 v 0 i 0 n c i v i where c0 is the virus input concentration v0 is the virus pulse volume ci is the sample concentration and vi is the sample volume the percentage mass reductions mrs were calculated as follows 2 mr n 0 n n 0 x 100 the lrvs and mrs derived from multiple test runs were analysed and their mean and standard deviation values were determined for the different viruses student s t test is commonly used to determine whether the means of 2 groups differ significantly assuming normal data distributions to compare differences in the lrvs or mrs between the different viruses and between the different filter types 2 sample t tests usually with a sample size of n 12 for each type of filter medium with unequal variances were performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 reproducibility of the experimental results the virus btcs obtained from multiple test runs supplementary figs s2 s4 suggested that the experimental results were largely reproducible although the rotavirus concentrations were more variable than the adenovirus and norovirus concentrations the results obtained from the experiments involving the 0 45 µm polypropylene filters with tap water and bore water were very similar supplementary fig s2b likely due to the similarity of the chemical characteristics of these waters supplementary table 1 likewise the experimental results obtained from the mixed and single virus injection runs were similar supplementary figs s4c and s4d these results suggested that the mixed virus injections did not have confounding effects amongst the viruses at the start of the 3 sequential experiments the initial virus concentrations were mostly zero supplementary figs s2 s4 this suggests that the virus particles from the earlier experiment s were mostly flushed out and did not interfere with the subsequently injected viruses had significant amounts of residual virus particles from experiments 1 and 2 been present the virus removal in experiment 3 would have been consistently greater than those in the previous experiments because the residual virus particles would have acted as additional virus attachment sites in the subsequent experiments 3 2 adenovirus and norovirus the experimental data indicated that norovirus behaved similarly to adenovirus in the filtration systems this was demonstrated by their similar relative concentrations in the btcs that are plotted using the average concentrations from multiple test runs fig 1 in the 3 filter types examined the lrvs and mrs did not differ significantly between adenovirus and norovirus p 0 49 table 2 fig 2 table 3 norovirus with adenovirus co transport was considered unlikely because our experimental results suggested that the mixed virus injections did not have confounding effects as discussed earlier although norovirus 33 34 nm is smaller than adenovirus 68 nm section 2 1 both viruses could readily pass through filter media with pore sizes ranging from 0 45 μm to 5 μm the norovirus and adenovirus had similar zeta potentials norovirus 15 40 1 25 mv adenovirus 17 27 0 06 mv section 2 1 which could plausibly explain their comparable behaviour in the filtration systems the only exception to our findings occurred in the experiments with the 0 2 μm polypropylene filter in this filter rotavirus behaved more like adenovirus while norovirus showed a markedly higher breakthrough concentration fig 1a as the filter s 0 2 μm nominal size rating represents the average pore size some pores would be much smaller and may have retained some of the rotavirus 70 75 nm and adenovirus particles which are similarly sized 68 nm in contrast the norovirus particles are smaller so may have passed through the filter 3 3 rotavirus compared with norovirus and adenovirus rotavirus showed greater breakthrough concentrations fig 1 lower lrvs fig 2 and lower mrs table 3 in the experiments involving the carbon filters 1 μm absolute and 5 μm polyester filters in the carbon filters comparisons between the rotavirus and norovirus and between the rotavirus and adenovirus breakthrough concentrations showed statistically significant differences both p 0 009 table 2 however the rotavirus reductions were greater than the reductions of one or both of the other viruses in the polypropylene filters and the 1 µm pleated polyester filter figs 1 and 2 table 3 these observations may be explained by rotavirus being more negatively charged 29 77 0 86 mv than adenovirus 17 27 0 06 and norovirus 15 40 1 25 mv section 2 1 thus rotavirus would be subject to greater electrostatic repulsion from the negatively charged surfaces of the filter media and more readily transported with the water past the filter barrier on the other hand if the filter media contained positively charged patches the more negatively charged rotavirus would show a greater affinity than adenovirus and norovirus for attachment to the filter media and therefore higher levels of removal in the filter effluent given the tap water s alkalinity ph 8 and the low isoelectric point of activated carbon ph 2 6 menendez et al 1995 the surfaces of the filter media within the activated carbon filters should carry an overall negative charge this may explain the consistently greater rotavirus breakthrough concentrations compared with adenovirus and norovirus in the activated carbon filters in addition to electrostatic interactions hydrophobic interactions are another key mechanism that determine virus attachment to filter media as the ph of the tap water ph 8 was high in our experiments and the viruses were negatively charged electrostatic repulsion was likely to be strong thus hydrophobic interactions can play important roles in virus attachment to filter media rotavirus adenovirus and norovirus hydrophobicities differ farkas 2014 found that rotavirus hydrophobicity 42 49 was markedly lower than that of adenovirus 88 93 and that while adenovirus showed a 1 log10 reduction rotavirus showed little reduction in the water phase after hexadecane was introduced butot et al 2007 found that after 20 days of storage in polyethylene terephthalate bottles the average virus retention on the bottles walls was rotavirus 80 norovirus 85 and human adenovirus 90 these findings reflect the relative degrees of hydrophobicity of these viruses activated carbon polypropylene and polyester are intrinsically hydrophobic but chemical modifications of filter media can change their surface hydrophobicities lower hydrophobicity levels and less rotavirus retention by hydrophobic surfaces may offer another explanation for the lower levels of rotavirus attachment to the filter media compared with those of adenovirus and norovirus we observed in most experiments 3 4 filter media the lrvs fig 2 and mrs table 3 suggest that the virus reduction efficiencies in the microfilters were determined by the filter media type and did not relate to the microfilters pore sizes directly virus reductions in the filters with smaller pore sizes were not necessarily greater than those in the filters with larger pore sizes for example virus reductions in the 1 and 2 μm carbon filters were greater than those in the 0 5 μm carbon filters fig 2 table 3 these findings further suggest that virus removal in the microfilters we examined involved attachment processes predominantly rather than size exclusion virus reductions in the carbon filters lrvs 1 18 6 0 mrs 93 17 100 were significantly greater than those in the polypropylene lrvs 0 02 0 54 mrs 5 70 and polyester lrvs 0 00 0 73 mrs 0 79 filters p 0 0001 table 2 fig 2 table 3 this was attributed to the excellent adsorption capacity of activated carbon for contaminant removal activated carbon has an extraordinarily high surface area has a high volume of micropores and it is hydrophobic marsh and reinoso 2006 in the presence of a high volume of micropores contaminant transport in activated carbon follows highly tortuous thus effectively long flow paths through a microstructure s pores reale and smith 2018 this would facilitate electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the viruses and the activated carbon media resulting in large virus reductions the polypropylene and polyester microfilters examined were equally poor at reducing virus concentrations these polymeric filters lrvs fig 2 and mrs table 3 did not differ significantly p 0 24 table 2 the poor performances of these polymeric microfilters suggest that without appropriate modifications of the media polypropylene and polyester microfilters are extremely vulnerable to virus breakthroughs the surfaces of commercial filter media are often chemically modified to enhance contaminant removal however these data and descriptions of the surface charges of the media were not available for the filters we purchased surface modification functionalisation of filter media can improve the microbial removal capacities of microfilters significantly for example sinclair et al 2018 observed that while reductions in bacteriophage ms2 levels were only 1 log10 90 in unmodified polymeric microfiltration membranes 0 45 μm pore size they were 3 log10 99 9 after the membranes were coated with a cationic polymer polyethyleneimine sinclair et al 2019 found that the bacteriophage ms2 reductions increased to 5 log10 when the coated microfiltration membranes were optimised using copper and silver nanoparticles mecha and pillay 2014 reported that the removal efficiency of escherichia coli was only 84 91 in unmodified polyester microfiltration membranes and that this increased to 100 after the membranes were coated with silver nanoparticles 3 5 performance targets in this study the tendency for lower rotavirus concentration reductions to occur in the pou filters investigated is a concern rotavirus is amongst the most infectious enteric viruses and one infectious rotavirus particle can cause an infection graham et al 1987 ward et al 1986 to reduce the risk of rotavirus infection to 10 4 person year the maximum allowable concentration of rotavirus in drinking water is 2 22 10 7 infectious particles l regli et al 1991 rotavirus is used as a reference virus to assess the performance of household drinking water treatment because of its immense importance to public health and high level of infectivity who 2011 regarding household drinking water treatment the who 2011 specifies protective and highly protective rotavirus reduction levels of 3 log10 99 9 and 5 log10 99 999 respectively to ensure water is safe for human consumption the australian new zealand standard 1995 requires that drinking water treatment achieves a 4 log10 rotavirus removal none of the filters investigated in the current study met these performance targets as demonstrated by their lrvs carbon 1 2 1 9 polypropylene 0 04 0 36 polyester 0 0 73 fig 2 however the 1 μm carbon filter met the protective targets for adenovirus lrv 3 26 0 13 and norovirus lrv 6 00 0 00 and the 2 μm carbon filter met the protective target for adenovirus lrv 3 61 0 14 4 conclusions in this study we assessed the potentials of 10 commonly used household filters to remove human enteric viruses our study s findings indicate that virus reductions in microfilters are primarily determined by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the viruses and the filter media rather than by size exclusion in all the carbon filters examined rotavirus had significantly lower reductions compared with the adenovirus and norovirus reductions this was probably a consequence of its greater negative charge and lower hydrophobicity the adenovirus and norovirus reductions were similar while the carbon filters outperformed the polymeric filters regarding virus reductions the virus reductions in the polypropylene and polyester filters did not differ significantly our study s findings suggest that activated carbon microfilters and particularly polypropylene and polyester microfilters are vulnerable to virus breakthroughs and that they failed to meet household drinking water treatment performance targets for rotavirus removal to reduce the risks of drinking waterborne virus infections microfilters must be used in conjunction with additional treatment such as water boiling and ultraviolet disinfection the need for surface modified filter media is also compelling because this would enhance virus removal

ceramic filters embedded with silver nitrate and copper nitrate hence more studies of human enteric virus removal in pou filters are needed to address this knowledge gap this study aimed to evaluate 10 commonly used activated carbon polypropylene and polyester pou microfilters with pore sizes of 0 2 5 μm regarding their potential capacities to reduce human rotavirus adenovirus and norovirus levels under unfavourable conditions low ionic strength high ph high flow rate new filters the effects of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions on virus removal are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 virus preparation quantification and characterisation human norovirus gii 4 sydney 2012 was sourced from human faecal samples submitted to the institute of environmental science research

faeces 2 ml viral transport medium and 0 2 ml chloroform were mixed the suspension was vortexed and then centrifuged at 13 000 g for 10 min the supernatants containing norovirus were collected and stored at 4 c until use rotavirus group a vr 2018 and adenovirus type 41 vr 930 were purchased from the american type culture collection manassas va usa rotavirus was cultured in ma 104 foetal monkey kidney cells farkas et al 2013 and adenovirus was cultured in human embryonic kidney 293 cells pang et al 2014 viral dna rna was extracted from 200 μl samples using the high pure viral nucleic acid extraction kit roche applied science mannheim germany and eluted in 50 μl elution buffer published primers probes and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr conditions were applied to detect the adenovirus heim et al 2003 rotavirus pang et al 2004 and norovirus wolf et al 2007 reverse transcriptions of rotavirus and norovirus rna were carried out using the superscript vilo cdna synthesis kit invitrogen corporation carlsbad ca usa and random hexamers real time pcr reactions were set up in 25 μl reaction volumes using the lightcycler 480 probes master reaction mix roche applied science for adenovirus and the platinum qpcr supermix udg kit invitrogen corporation for rotavirus and norovirus plasmid dna standards incorporating the target sequences were used as positive controls to generate standard curves and determine the genome copy gc concentrations during sample analysis 4 negative controls were used during the viral nucleic acid extraction reverse transcription and qpcr steps to test for cross contamination the virus concentrations were expressed as gc ml the virus zeta potentials were measured in milliq water ph 6 5 using a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments malvern uk at concentrations of 109 1010 gc ml the mean zeta potentials determined from triplicate measurements were 15 40 1 25 mv 17 27 0 06 mv and 29 77 0 86 mv for norovirus adenovirus and rotavirus respectively we previously determined the sizes of these virus strains which were as follows norovirus gii 4 33 34 nm adenovirus type 41 vr 930 68 nm and rotavirus group a vr 2018 70 75 nm pang et al 2021 2 2 filter challenge experiments ten different commonly used imported pou filter cartridges were purchased from local filter retailers the cartridges were 25 4 cm long and 7 cm in diameter the polypropylene cartridges had pore sizes of 0 2 µm 0 45 µm absolute and 1 µm activated carbon cartridges had pore sizes of 0 5 1 and 2 µm and polyester cartridges had pore sizes of 1 µm nominal and absolute and 5 µm table 1 the filtration experiments carried out on these filters simulated instantaneous contamination events with high viral loads clean cartridges were fitted into housing units with the input ports on the top and they were connected to both inlet and outlet tubing supplementary fig s1 chlorine free tap water ph 8 ionic strength 1 22 mm supplementary table s1 which was sourced from deep alluvial gravel groundwater was applied at a constant flow rate of 1 l min in all experiments this flow rate was within the cartridges operational flow rate ranges specified by the manufacturers and it typified household usage the flow was introduced via the inlet tubing using a masterflex l s peristaltic pump and pump head model 7 720 062 cole parmer illinois usa injection solutions containing the viruses were prepared by sonicating the virus stocks for 2 min before adding them to the chlorine free tap water before the experiments the injection solutions were homogenised by shaking them at 120 rpm in a cold room overnight the filter was fully saturated and a constant flow was established for 30 min prior to the virus challenge experiments for each test run 166 2 6 ml of a solution containing norovirus adenovirus and rotavirus 106 107 gc ml was injected for 10 s the filter effluent was collected continuously into 26 sample pots over 220 s this was followed by flushing the filter with fresh tap water for 3 min before the subsequent run generally 3 challenge runs were conducted sequentially for each filter to examine whether the mixed virus injections had any confounding effects on virus reduction additional experiments with single virus injections were also conducted using the 5 µm polyester filter in addition to examine differences between using tap water and bore water experiments using shallow bore water ph 7 8 ionic strength 1 16 mm supplementary table s1 were conducted using the 0 45 µm polypropylene filter all experiments were carried out at room temperature 20 c all filter effluent samples were quantified directly by using the qpcr section 2 1 without concentration 2 3 data analysis using the concentration breakthrough curves btcs derived from the individual test runs supplementary figs s2 s4 virus log10 reduction values lrvs were determined from the total numbers of the viruses injected n0 and the total numbers of the viruses recovered in the continuously collected filter effluent n as follows 1 lrv lo g 10 n 0 n lo g 10 c 0 v 0 i 0 n c i v i where c0 is the virus input concentration v0 is the virus pulse volume ci is the sample concentration and vi is the sample volume the percentage mass reductions mrs were calculated as follows 2 mr n 0 n n 0 x 100 the lrvs and mrs derived from multiple test runs were analysed and their mean and standard deviation values were determined for the different viruses student s t test is commonly used to determine whether the means of 2 groups differ significantly assuming normal data distributions to compare differences in the lrvs or mrs between the different viruses and between the different filter types 2 sample t tests usually with a sample size of n 12 for each type of filter medium with unequal variances were performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 reproducibility of the experimental results the virus btcs obtained from multiple test runs supplementary figs s2 s4 suggested that the experimental results were largely reproducible although the rotavirus concentrations were more variable than the adenovirus and norovirus concentrations the results obtained from the experiments involving the 0 45 µm polypropylene filters with tap water and bore water were very similar supplementary fig s2b likely due to the similarity of the chemical characteristics of these waters supplementary table 1 likewise the experimental results obtained from the mixed and single virus injection runs were similar supplementary figs s4c and s4d these results suggested that the mixed virus injections did not have confounding effects amongst the viruses at the start of the 3 sequential experiments the initial virus concentrations were mostly zero supplementary figs s2 s4 this suggests that the virus particles from the earlier experiment s were mostly flushed out and did not interfere with the subsequently injected viruses had significant amounts of residual virus particles from experiments 1 and 2 been present the virus removal in experiment 3 would have been consistently greater than those in the previous experiments because the residual virus particles would have acted as additional virus attachment sites in the subsequent experiments 3 2 adenovirus and norovirus the experimental data indicated that norovirus behaved similarly to adenovirus in the filtration systems this was demonstrated by their similar relative concentrations in the btcs that are plotted using the average concentrations from multiple test runs fig 1 in the 3 filter types examined the lrvs and mrs did not differ significantly between adenovirus and norovirus p 0 49 table 2 fig 2 table 3 norovirus with adenovirus co transport was considered unlikely because our experimental results suggested that the mixed virus injections did not have confounding effects as discussed earlier although norovirus 33 34 nm is smaller than adenovirus 68 nm section 2 1 both viruses could readily pass through filter media with pore sizes ranging from 0 45 μm to 5 μm the norovirus and adenovirus had similar zeta potentials norovirus 15 40 1 25 mv adenovirus 17 27 0 06 mv section 2 1 which could plausibly explain their comparable behaviour in the filtration systems the only exception to our findings occurred in the experiments with the 0 2 μm polypropylene filter in this filter rotavirus behaved more like adenovirus while norovirus showed a markedly higher breakthrough concentration fig 1a as the filter s 0 2 μm nominal size rating represents the average pore size some pores would be much smaller and may have retained some of the rotavirus 70 75 nm and adenovirus particles which are similarly sized 68 nm in contrast the norovirus particles are smaller so may have passed through the filter 3 3 rotavirus compared with norovirus and adenovirus rotavirus showed greater breakthrough concentrations fig 1 lower lrvs fig 2 and lower mrs table 3 in the experiments involving the carbon filters 1 μm absolute and 5 μm polyester filters in the carbon filters comparisons between the rotavirus and norovirus and between the rotavirus and adenovirus breakthrough concentrations showed statistically significant differences both p 0 009 table 2 however the rotavirus reductions were greater than the reductions of one or both of the other viruses in the polypropylene filters and the 1 µm pleated polyester filter figs 1 and 2 table 3 these observations may be explained by rotavirus being more negatively charged 29 77 0 86 mv than adenovirus 17 27 0 06 and norovirus 15 40 1 25 mv section 2 1 thus rotavirus would be subject to greater electrostatic repulsion from the negatively charged surfaces of the filter media and more readily transported with the water past the filter barrier on the other hand if the filter media contained positively charged patches the more negatively charged rotavirus would show a greater affinity than adenovirus and norovirus for attachment to the filter media and therefore higher levels of removal in the filter effluent given the tap water s alkalinity ph 8 and the low isoelectric point of activated carbon ph 2 6 menendez et al 1995 the surfaces of the filter media within the activated carbon filters should carry an overall negative charge this may explain the consistently greater rotavirus breakthrough concentrations compared with adenovirus and norovirus in the activated carbon filters in addition to electrostatic interactions hydrophobic interactions are another key mechanism that determine virus attachment to filter media as the ph of the tap water ph 8 was high in our experiments and the viruses were negatively charged electrostatic repulsion was likely to be strong thus hydrophobic interactions can play important roles in virus attachment to filter media rotavirus adenovirus and norovirus hydrophobicities differ farkas 2014 found that rotavirus hydrophobicity 42 49 was markedly lower than that of adenovirus 88 93 and that while adenovirus showed a 1 log10 reduction rotavirus showed little reduction in the water phase after hexadecane was introduced butot et al 2007 found that after 20 days of storage in polyethylene terephthalate bottles the average virus retention on the bottles walls was rotavirus 80 norovirus 85 and human adenovirus 90 these findings reflect the relative degrees of hydrophobicity of these viruses activated carbon polypropylene and polyester are intrinsically hydrophobic but chemical modifications of filter media can change their surface hydrophobicities lower hydrophobicity levels and less rotavirus retention by hydrophobic surfaces may offer another explanation for the lower levels of rotavirus attachment to the filter media compared with those of adenovirus and norovirus we observed in most experiments 3 4 filter media the lrvs fig 2 and mrs table 3 suggest that the virus reduction efficiencies in the microfilters were determined by the filter media type and did not relate to the microfilters pore sizes directly virus reductions in the filters with smaller pore sizes were not necessarily greater than those in the filters with larger pore sizes for example virus reductions in the 1 and 2 μm carbon filters were greater than those in the 0 5 μm carbon filters fig 2 table 3 these findings further suggest that virus removal in the microfilters we examined involved attachment processes predominantly rather than size exclusion virus reductions in the carbon filters lrvs 1 18 6 0 mrs 93 17 100 were significantly greater than those in the polypropylene lrvs 0 02 0 54 mrs 5 70 and polyester lrvs 0 00 0 73 mrs 0 79 filters p 0 0001 table 2 fig 2 table 3 this was attributed to the excellent adsorption capacity of activated carbon for contaminant removal activated carbon has an extraordinarily high surface area has a high volume of micropores and it is hydrophobic marsh and reinoso 2006 in the presence of a high volume of micropores contaminant transport in activated carbon follows highly tortuous thus effectively long flow paths through a microstructure s pores reale and smith 2018 this would facilitate electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the viruses and the activated carbon media resulting in large virus reductions the polypropylene and polyester microfilters examined were equally poor at reducing virus concentrations these polymeric filters lrvs fig 2 and mrs table 3 did not differ significantly p 0 24 table 2 the poor performances of these polymeric microfilters suggest that without appropriate modifications of the media polypropylene and polyester microfilters are extremely vulnerable to virus breakthroughs the surfaces of commercial filter media are often chemically modified to enhance contaminant removal however these data and descriptions of the surface charges of the media were not available for the filters we purchased surface modification functionalisation of filter media can improve the microbial removal capacities of microfilters significantly for example sinclair et al 2018 observed that while reductions in bacteriophage ms2 levels were only 1 log10 90 in unmodified polymeric microfiltration membranes 0 45 μm pore size they were 3 log10 99 9 after the membranes were coated with a cationic polymer polyethyleneimine sinclair et al 2019 found that the bacteriophage ms2 reductions increased to 5 log10 when the coated microfiltration membranes were optimised using copper and silver nanoparticles mecha and pillay 2014 reported that the removal efficiency of escherichia coli was only 84 91 in unmodified polyester microfiltration membranes and that this increased to 100 after the membranes were coated with silver nanoparticles 3 5 performance targets in this study the tendency for lower rotavirus concentration reductions to occur in the pou filters investigated is a concern rotavirus is amongst the most infectious enteric viruses and one infectious rotavirus particle can cause an infection graham et al 1987 ward et al 1986 to reduce the risk of rotavirus infection to 10 4 person year the maximum allowable concentration of rotavirus in drinking water is 2 22 10 7 infectious particles l regli et al 1991 rotavirus is used as a reference virus to assess the performance of household drinking water treatment because of its immense importance to public health and high level of infectivity who 2011 regarding household drinking water treatment the who 2011 specifies protective and highly protective rotavirus reduction levels of 3 log10 99 9 and 5 log10 99 999 respectively to ensure water is safe for human consumption the australian new zealand standard 1995 requires that drinking water treatment achieves a 4 log10 rotavirus removal none of the filters investigated in the current study met these performance targets as demonstrated by their lrvs carbon 1 2 1 9 polypropylene 0 04 0 36 polyester 0 0 73 fig 2 however the 1 μm carbon filter met the protective targets for adenovirus lrv 3 26 0 13 and norovirus lrv 6 00 0 00 and the 2 μm carbon filter met the protective target for adenovirus lrv 3 61 0 14 4 conclusions in this study we assessed the potentials of 10 commonly used household filters to remove human enteric viruses our study s findings indicate that virus reductions in microfilters are primarily determined by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the viruses and the filter media rather than by size exclusion in all the carbon filters examined rotavirus had significantly lower reductions compared with the adenovirus and norovirus reductions this was probably a consequence of its greater negative charge and lower hydrophobicity the adenovirus and norovirus reductions were similar while the carbon filters outperformed the polymeric filters regarding virus reductions the virus reductions in the polypropylene and polyester filters did not differ significantly our study s findings suggest that activated carbon microfilters and particularly polypropylene and polyester microfilters are vulnerable to virus breakthroughs and that they failed to meet household drinking water treatment performance targets for rotavirus removal to reduce the risks of drinking waterborne virus infections microfilters must be used in conjunction with additional treatment such as water boiling and ultraviolet disinfection the need for surface modified filter media is also compelling because this would enhance virus removal

16243,a comprehensive real time evaluation of the chemical status of surface water bodies is still utopian but in our opinion it is time to use the momentum delivered by recent advanced technical infrastructural and societal developments to get significantly closer procedures like inline and online analysis in situ or in a bypass with close to real time analysis and data provision are already available in several industrial sectors in contrast atline and offline analysis involving manual sampling and time decoupled analysis in the laboratory is still common practice in aqueous environmental monitoring automated tools for data analysis verification and evaluation are changing significantly becoming more powerful with increasing degrees of automation and the introduction of self learning systems in addition the amount of available data will most likely in near future be increased by societal awareness for water quality and by citizen science in this analysis we highlight the significant potential of surface water monitoring techniques showcase lighthouse projects from different sectors and pin point gaps we must overcome to strike a path to the future of chemical

vs potential applications regulatory and scientific chemical monitoring serves societal and ecological needs focusing on surface water bodies and dissolved chemical species in industrialized and populated areas a highly visible challenge is the protection of drinking water resources and the avoidance of adverse ecological effects in the context of global climate change and the associated changing water distribution erfurt et al 2019 describe the impact of drought events from 1800 2018 on southwestern germany and emphasize droughts cause impacts on ecology economy health governance and social behavior consequently while recognizing increasingly competing interests for water use and re use e g temperature zavarsky and duester 2020 and raising societal awareness for global water distribution chemical water monitoring regulatory and scientific is increasingly important in transnational decision making processes strategies on how to monitor the almost unmanageable multitude of anthropogenic chemical species from different sources are available usually at different levels of complexity they aim to provide robust data of the current chemical water quality status in order to i deliver long term data on trends ii detect patterns of chemical substances iii detect potential threats to humans biota and ecosystem health iv evaluate the current risk potential for the water bodies v deliver inputs for prediction tools and vi support decision making on the political environmental and economic level in past monitoring activities the decoupling of sampling analysis and data provision was self evident and a consequence of the clear separation between the in situ sampling and ex situ laboratory workload prominent examples of drawbacks caused by this practice are discontinuous monitoring schemes with grab samples and large time intervals or the failing to address discontinuously released chemical species e g pesticides moreover the delayed availability of data impedes authorities and downstream waterworks to immediately respond to spill events additionally current chemical routine monitoring often provides only a small glimpse of the chemical burden in surface waters so far it focuses on regulated substances and as a direct consequence it usually misses the multitude of emerging contaminants such as precursor species by products of industrial processes or the various transformation products taking this into account it is time to look ahead at potential solutions from technical innovations to verified monitoring approaches nowadays time gaps between sampling sample preparation analysis quality management data processing and provisioning are decreasing through significant technical improvements these key technologies for improvements

complete the picture this article raises awareness for the high innovation potential visible in the chemical surface water quality monitoring provided by the fourth industrial revolution the most significant bottlenecks are addressed to deliver a basis for further discussion between different interest groups e g science administration industry politics the aim is to create a common ground for future activities both in regulative and scientific surface water quality monitoring we share the vision within a timeframe of ten to twenty years the chemical surface water quality monitoring can catch up with its technical potential if we set the right course today 2 current routine today s sensor based monitoring to address the classical physicochemical parameters well established sensor designs are often preferred when large maintenance intervals are needed e g in areas with limited infrastructure these sensors form the basis of almost every chemical surface water monitoring network and the technical development has a significant overlap with the wastewater treatment market segment in the last decades the set of sensors was extended by ion selective electrodes ises and optical detection methods uv vis ir fluorescence for detection of specific chemical species or sum parameters finch et al 1998 jannasch et al 1994 langmuir and jacobson 1970 however sensitivity selectivity interferences and fouling effects may significantly limit their application de marco et al 2007 pellerin et al 2013 an example for interferences limiting ises is an over estimation of the analyte s concentration due to ionic interferences pellerin et al 2013 e g by k while monitoring nh4 wang et al 2020 optical sensors for nitrite own often detection limits in the mg l 1 range which is rarely reached in european natural waters and can be impacted by fouling effects on the optical measurement windows however anti fouling techniques are already in practice or included in prototypes they make use of fouling resistant materials uv light from leds or turbulences from air flushing meyer 2003 in summary certain parameters are still difficult to be analyzed with sensors but several recent technical approaches improve the measurements reagent free or colorimetric optical sensors provide data for nutrients and optically visible substances e g boënne et al 2014 rieger et al 2008 giving higher precision compared to ises pellerin et al 2016 they are sensitive to turbidity and colored water i e high concentrations of suspended matter or humic substances dominant in wetlands or during floods e g blaen et al 2016 sensors based on fluorescence spectroscopy are employed to quantify aromatic organic compounds chlorophyll α blaen et al 2016 and algae besmer et al 2014 ye et al 2014 a validation of the sensor based online techniques in direct comparison to the respective offline methods must therefore always be undertaken within the respective catchment area as an example for optical dissolved organic carbon doc sensors the sum parameter is calibrated in the laboratory with a single substance in contrast in every surface water this sum parameter consists of several substances varying in composition and therefore results may differ significantly this also applies to turbidity which is also a sum parameter in addition cross comparison to remote sensing activities are needed to be able to monitor also inaccessible surface waters e g due to topography gholizadeh et al 2016 sensors are comparably easy to use usually cheaper than the alternatives run continuously blaen et al 2016 and can be applied in situ online in monitoring stations or mobile on trailers ships or autonomous vehicles e g meyer et al 2019 petersen 2014 even if sensor based measurements still sometimes lack precision they already are used to trigger event based sampling during extreme events spills droughts or algae blooms e g by water level sensors gunold et al 2019 as an example they own a significant potential to enhance the precision of river basin balances taking it together to improve routine monitoring better knowledge of the limits of accuracy for the sensors interfering factors and common practice to correct data e g shaughnessy et al 2019 and improved solutions to suppress fouling must be available 3 from offline to online usually the most analytically accurate methods providing often also the lowest limits of detection lods are laboratory offline techniques if feasible these techniques can be transferred to automated online monitoring techniques and adapted to tolerate extended maintenance intervals basically injection systems are modified software is adapted for 24 7 runtimes process and quality control qc as well as the data processing and evaluation need

method development is needed this can be supported e g by 3d printing of low cost autosamplers run by open source software carvalho and murray 2018 designing self cleaning autosamplers with integrated sample filtering controlled by raspberrypi stadler et al 2017 or using cost effective pipetting robots steffens et al 2017 to foster these processes more scientists and institutions must support open

techniques for stable water isotopes without isotopic fractionation have already been evaluated 9 years ago for potential field application herbstritt et al 2012 koehler and wassenaar 2011 while online application was first performed in 2017 von freyberg et al 2017 a similar setup was used for the analysis of δ13c in dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic hartland et al 2012 and therefore also has the potential to be run online total radioactivity of water currently is surveilled continuously by the widely used scintillation analysis with probes in real time within networks across large areas e g doll et al 2013 wedekind et al 1999 most important aspects to be improved in the next 10 to 15 years are reduce the price and raise the robustness as well as further promote online preconcentration and matrix removal methods 3 2 organic substances organic micropollutants in water are usually analyzed by gas chromatography gc or liquid chromatography lc coupled to mass spectrometry ms the automation of sample preparation by online solid phase extraction lc ms for the analysis of a variety of pesticides pharmaceuticals biocides and industrial chemicals in surface water bodies has recently made enormous progress as reviewed by elpa et al 2020 while the technical equipment for such setups is commercially available the automation of the entire workflow including sampling but especially data processing and evaluation is more challenging and requires custom built solutions see section 3 3 nonetheless almost entirely automated laboratories are operating on a continuous basis in one example for the monitoring of specific organic compounds in industrial production water wortberg and kurz 2019 in contrast to target analysis which is restricted to a limited selection of known analytes non target screening nts based on the detection by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms enables the analysis of all compounds amenable to the chosen chromatographic method and detected by the ms applied thus the data can be screened post analysis for any known or suspected contaminant a process which can be automated by employing a substance library jewell et al 2019 in addition nts enables the detection of unknown contaminants by searching the data for characteristic emission patterns or unexpected changes and then identifying these unknowns with the help of the acquired mass spectra ruppe et al 2018 schlüsener et al 2015 nts is thereby both a powerful tool for in a sense digitally storing samples for post analysis screening hollender et al 2017 and also to increase the breadth of chemical monitoring only recently stravs et al 2021 developed a trailer based automated sampling and hrms measurement system for surface water e g for the deployment in remote locations to make use of the full potential of nts we must address the following challenges especially for automated online monitoring optimized and robust algorithms for automated processing and evaluation of nts data are essential see section 3 3 there is a need to increase the comparability of nts data by strategies for quality assurance such as the application of automated quality control charts e g for mass deviation and resolution absolute and relative intensities as well as the evaluation of false positives and false negatives i e erroneous detections or non detections due to errors in the data evaluation algorithms moreover freely available mass spectral libraries tailored to surface water monitoring must be continuously extended and be easily accessible to overcome the bottleneck of compound identification finally databases for storing quality assured nts data combined with powerful and easy to use online dashboards for user specific data evaluation and prioritization would foster the inter regional and retrospective evaluation of both known and unknown organic water contaminants 3 3 automation of data processing and evaluation next to instrumental automation online routines in quality assurance and quality control qa qc process control and data processing must be adapted regarding the high throughput of samples automated data processing data qa qc its evaluation and close to real time availability are becoming more common fleischer and thurow 2018 sometimes commercial solutions are applied ehmann et al 2006 but usually at the moment at least parts of the setups must be adopted or developed from scratch wortberg and kurz 2019 fortunately the lack of commercial software applications is filled by several open source automation solutions for both instrument control and data evaluation rijkenberg 2016 e g ms utils org https bio tools ms utils org 2022 ison et al 2016 open access journals and exchange platforms may help to accelerate knowledge sharing and thereby foster automation of data processing and evaluation techniques which is urgently required for real time data provisioning qa qc can involve regularly analyzed standards redundant systems or statistical data history evaluation like classification of river water composition based on principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis e g filella et al 2014 automated data evaluation may end up in e g pure warning systems by comparing with threshold values wortberg and kurz 2019 or forecasting and early warning systems based on artificial neural network or inferential modeling in addition to threshold values recknagel et al 2017 xia et al 2015 zhu et al 2010 to be able to use automated data evaluation systems on all monitored parameters significantly more time and money must be invested into transdisciplinary collaboration between e g data and environmental scientists here large societal expectations lead in some cases to financial backing in areas like adaptive decision support systems bayesian network modeling machine deep or self learning incl artificial neural network as reviewed in ighalo et al 2020 often misleadingly summarized as artificial intelligence adeyemi et al 2017 kim and lee 2018 marcot and penman 2019 quinn and hanna 2003 yekeen and balogun 2020 next to transdisciplinary collaboration transboundary collaboration must be intensified to successfully apply these emerging techniques for the benefit of our rivers and surface waters 4 non stationary monitoring usually stationary platforms are employed for surface water monitoring and sampling besides these mobile infrastructures e g trailer based ex situ or autonomous in situ equipped with gps trackers self sustaining energy supply and data transmission via satellite or cellular network depending on how remote the location is nam et al 2005 are employed non stationary examples from marine monitoring include buoys autonomous gliders and sailing boats or ferries the latter provide more infrastructure and the water utilized for engine cooling or daily needs can be sampled and analyzed without changing processes on the ships petersen 2014 steffen 2018 buoys are also employed in rivers apel et al 2012 while autonomous gliders e g for microplastic screening with near ir light sensors and optional sampling edson and patterson 2015 are difficult to realize for waterways where the challenges are less of technical nature but more about legal challenges due to increased traffic densities compared to oceans remote controlled boats already monitor small rivers lakes for topography hydrometry and routinely for water quality degel and hofmann 2017 kutschera et al 2017 wiek et al

techniques and selection of monitoring parameters must vary significantly depending on the system monitored e g major rivers need many parameters with lower time resolution while at small rivers fewer

quickly pay back their substantial initial costs as in industrialized countries personnel expenses are high and can be significantly reduced by automation for countries with less infrastructure and significantly different often well known pollution patterns a reduction of costs of the available techniques will presumably enable improvement in surface water monitoring here after price reductions communities supported by citizen science tools are more often likely to take matters into their own hands 7 conclusions to exploit the whole range of the potentials given by the so called fourth

16243,a comprehensive real time evaluation of the chemical status of surface water bodies is still utopian but in our opinion it is time to use the momentum delivered by recent advanced technical infrastructural and societal developments to get significantly closer procedures like inline and online analysis in situ or in a bypass with close to real time analysis and data provision are already available in several industrial sectors in contrast atline and offline analysis involving manual sampling and time decoupled analysis in the laboratory is still common practice in aqueous environmental monitoring automated tools for data analysis verification and evaluation are changing significantly becoming more powerful with increasing degrees of automation and the introduction of self learning systems in addition the amount of available data will most likely in near future be increased by societal awareness for water quality and by citizen science in this analysis we highlight the significant potential of surface water monitoring techniques showcase lighthouse projects from different sectors and pin point gaps we must overcome to strike a path to the future of chemical monitoring of inland surface waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords surface water monitoring automated data processing online analysis real time citizen science 1 current status vs potential applications regulatory and scientific chemical monitoring serves societal and ecological needs focusing on surface water bodies and dissolved chemical species in industrialized and populated areas a highly visible challenge is the protection of drinking water resources and the avoidance of adverse ecological effects in the context of global climate change and the associated changing water distribution erfurt et al 2019 describe the impact of drought events from 1800 2018 on southwestern germany and emphasize droughts cause impacts on ecology economy health governance and social behavior consequently while recognizing increasingly competing interests for water use and re use e g temperature zavarsky and duester 2020 and raising societal awareness for global water distribution chemical water monitoring regulatory and scientific is increasingly important in transnational decision making processes strategies on how to monitor the almost unmanageable multitude of anthropogenic chemical species from different sources are available usually at different levels of complexity they aim to provide robust data of the current chemical water quality status in order to i deliver long term data on trends ii detect patterns of chemical substances iii detect potential threats to humans biota and ecosystem health iv evaluate the current risk potential for the water bodies v deliver inputs for prediction tools and vi support decision making on the political environmental and economic level in past monitoring activities the decoupling of sampling analysis and data provision was self evident and a consequence of the clear separation between the in situ sampling and ex situ laboratory workload prominent examples of drawbacks caused by this practice are discontinuous monitoring schemes with grab samples and large time intervals or the failing to address discontinuously released chemical species e g pesticides moreover the delayed availability of data impedes authorities and downstream waterworks to immediately respond to spill events additionally current chemical routine monitoring often provides only a small glimpse of the chemical burden in surface waters so far it focuses on regulated substances and as a direct consequence it usually misses the multitude of emerging contaminants such as precursor species by products of industrial processes or the various transformation products taking this into account it is time to look ahead at potential solutions from technical innovations to verified monitoring approaches nowadays time gaps between sampling sample preparation analysis quality management data processing and provisioning are decreasing through significant technical improvements these key technologies for improvements are also crucial for development towards the fourth industrial revolution e g digitalization big data and artificial intelligence analytics from offline to inline and atline analyses internet of

physicochemical water quality parameters such as temperature ph conductivity dissolved oxygen do and turbidity in some river basins like at the river rhine international alert and warning plans are in place based on flow time models fed by chemical analyses at seven international stations along the river https www iksr org en topics pollution international warning and alarm plan including close to real time on and atline analysis definitions in fig 1 following this example within the last decades each year between 16 and 61 alerts were triggered these alerts included events from shipping industries agriculture others and unknown sources however as explained later this only includes visible e g oil films or target pollutants and systematic non target approaches are urgently needed to complete the picture this article raises awareness for the high innovation potential visible in the chemical surface water quality monitoring provided by the fourth industrial revolution the most significant bottlenecks are addressed to deliver a basis for further discussion between different interest groups e g science administration industry politics the aim is to create a common ground for future activities both in regulative and scientific surface water quality monitoring we share the vision within a timeframe of ten to twenty years the chemical surface water quality monitoring can catch up with its technical potential if we set the right course today 2 current routine today s sensor based monitoring to address the classical physicochemical parameters well established sensor designs are often preferred when large maintenance intervals are needed e g in areas with limited infrastructure these sensors form the basis of almost every chemical surface water monitoring network and the technical development has a significant overlap with the wastewater treatment market segment in the last decades the set of sensors was extended by ion selective electrodes ises and optical detection methods uv vis ir fluorescence for detection of specific chemical species or sum parameters finch et al 1998 jannasch et al 1994 langmuir and jacobson 1970 however sensitivity selectivity interferences and fouling effects may significantly limit their application de marco et al 2007 pellerin et al 2013 an example for interferences limiting ises is an over estimation of the analyte s concentration due to ionic interferences pellerin et al 2013 e g by k while monitoring nh4 wang et al 2020 optical sensors for nitrite own often detection limits in the mg l 1 range which is rarely reached in european natural waters and can be impacted by fouling effects on the optical measurement windows however anti fouling techniques are already in practice or included in prototypes they make use of fouling resistant materials uv light from leds or turbulences from air flushing meyer 2003 in summary certain parameters are still difficult to be analyzed with sensors but several recent technical approaches improve the measurements reagent free or colorimetric optical sensors provide data for nutrients and optically visible substances e g boënne et al 2014 rieger et al 2008 giving higher precision compared to ises pellerin et al 2016 they are sensitive to turbidity and colored water i e high concentrations of suspended matter or humic substances dominant in wetlands or during floods e g blaen et al 2016 sensors based on fluorescence spectroscopy are employed to quantify aromatic organic compounds chlorophyll α blaen et al 2016 and algae besmer et al 2014 ye et al 2014 a validation of the sensor based online techniques in direct comparison to the respective offline methods must therefore always be undertaken within the respective catchment area as an example for optical dissolved organic carbon doc sensors the sum parameter is calibrated in the laboratory with a single substance in contrast in every surface water this sum parameter consists of several substances varying in composition and therefore results may differ significantly this also applies to turbidity which is also a sum parameter in addition cross comparison to remote sensing activities are needed to be able to monitor also inaccessible surface waters e g due to topography gholizadeh et al 2016 sensors are comparably easy to use usually cheaper than the alternatives run continuously blaen et al 2016 and can be applied in situ online in monitoring stations or mobile on trailers ships or autonomous vehicles e g meyer et al 2019 petersen 2014 even if sensor based measurements still sometimes lack precision they already are used to trigger event based sampling during extreme events spills droughts or algae blooms e g by water level sensors gunold et al 2019 as an example they own a significant potential to enhance the precision of river basin balances taking it together to improve routine monitoring better knowledge of the limits of accuracy for the sensors interfering factors and common practice to correct data e g shaughnessy et al 2019 and improved solutions to suppress fouling must be available 3 from offline to online usually the most analytically accurate methods providing often also the lowest limits of detection lods are laboratory offline techniques if feasible these techniques can be transferred to automated online monitoring techniques and adapted to tolerate extended maintenance intervals basically injection systems are modified software is adapted for 24 7 runtimes process and quality control qc as well as the data processing and evaluation need to be automated in contrast to many fourth industrial revolution trends e g in the semiconductor industry wiederin and otaki 2017 surface water is biologically active delivering its own challenges for which filtration or disinfection e g with uv light may improve the analytical stability to transfer laboratory methods to online monitoring methods a higher degree of freedom than in conventional method development is needed this can be supported e g by 3d printing of low cost autosamplers run by open source software carvalho and murray 2018 designing self cleaning autosamplers with integrated sample filtering controlled by raspberrypi stadler et al 2017 or using cost effective pipetting robots steffens et al 2017 to foster these processes more scientists and institutions must support open source software development and open access technology sharing trends beyond the information usually delivered in publications 3 1 inorganic substances using common analysis techniques robust in situ

et al 2021 in addition to total element concentration analysis isotopic analysis can provide evidence for the origin of the water and impacts from different tributaries the first online injection techniques for stable water isotopes without isotopic fractionation have already been evaluated 9 years ago for potential field application herbstritt et al 2012 koehler and wassenaar 2011 while online application was first performed in 2017 von freyberg et al 2017 a similar setup was used for the analysis of δ13c in dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic hartland et al 2012 and therefore also has the potential to be run online total radioactivity of water currently is surveilled continuously by the widely used scintillation analysis with probes in real time within networks across large areas e g doll et al 2013 wedekind et al 1999 most important aspects to be improved in the next 10 to 15 years are reduce the price and raise the robustness as well as further promote online preconcentration and matrix removal methods 3 2 organic substances organic micropollutants in water are usually analyzed by gas chromatography gc or liquid chromatography lc coupled to mass spectrometry ms the automation of sample preparation by online solid phase extraction lc ms for the analysis of a variety of pesticides pharmaceuticals biocides and industrial chemicals in surface water bodies has recently made enormous progress as reviewed by elpa et al 2020 while the technical equipment for such setups is commercially available the automation of the entire workflow including sampling but especially data processing and evaluation is more challenging and requires custom built solutions see section 3 3 nonetheless almost entirely automated laboratories are operating on a continuous basis in one example for the monitoring of specific organic compounds in industrial production water wortberg and kurz 2019 in contrast to target analysis which is restricted to a limited selection of known analytes non target screening nts based on the detection by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms enables the analysis of all compounds amenable to the chosen chromatographic method and detected by the ms applied thus the data can be screened post analysis for any known or suspected contaminant a process which can be automated by employing a substance library jewell et al 2019 in addition nts enables the detection of unknown contaminants by searching the data for characteristic emission patterns or unexpected changes and then identifying these unknowns with the help of the acquired mass spectra ruppe et al 2018 schlüsener et al 2015 nts is thereby both a powerful tool for in a sense digitally storing samples for post analysis screening hollender et al 2017 and also to increase the breadth of chemical monitoring only recently stravs et al 2021 developed a trailer based automated sampling and hrms measurement system for surface water e g for the deployment in remote locations to make use of the full potential of nts we must address the following challenges especially for automated online monitoring optimized and robust algorithms for automated processing and evaluation of nts data are essential see section 3 3 there is a need to increase the comparability of nts data by strategies for quality assurance such as the application of automated quality control charts e g for mass deviation and resolution absolute and relative intensities as well as the evaluation of false positives and false negatives i e erroneous detections or non detections due to errors in the data evaluation algorithms moreover freely available mass spectral libraries tailored to surface water monitoring must be continuously extended and be easily accessible to overcome the bottleneck of compound identification finally databases for storing quality assured nts data combined with powerful and easy to use online dashboards for user specific data evaluation and prioritization would foster the inter regional and retrospective evaluation of both known and unknown organic water contaminants 3 3 automation of data processing and evaluation next to instrumental automation online routines in quality assurance and quality control qa qc process control and data processing must be adapted regarding the high throughput of samples automated data processing data qa qc its evaluation and close to real time availability are becoming more common fleischer and thurow 2018 sometimes commercial solutions are applied ehmann et al 2006 but usually at the moment at least parts of the setups must be adopted or developed from scratch wortberg and kurz 2019 fortunately the lack of commercial software applications is filled by several open source automation solutions for both instrument control and data evaluation rijkenberg 2016 e g ms utils org https bio tools ms utils org 2022 ison et al 2016 open access journals and exchange platforms may help to accelerate knowledge sharing and thereby foster automation of data processing and evaluation techniques which is urgently required for real time data provisioning qa qc can involve regularly analyzed standards redundant systems or statistical data history evaluation like classification of river water composition based on principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis e g filella et al 2014 automated data evaluation may end up in e g pure warning systems by comparing with threshold values wortberg and kurz 2019 or forecasting and early warning systems based on artificial neural network or inferential modeling in addition to threshold values recknagel et al 2017 xia et al 2015 zhu et al 2010 to be able to use automated data evaluation systems on all monitored parameters significantly more time and money must be invested into transdisciplinary collaboration between e g data and environmental scientists here large societal expectations lead in some cases to financial backing in areas like adaptive decision support systems bayesian network modeling machine deep or self learning incl artificial neural network as reviewed in ighalo et al 2020 often misleadingly summarized as artificial intelligence adeyemi et al 2017 kim and lee 2018 marcot and penman 2019 quinn and hanna 2003 yekeen and balogun 2020 next to transdisciplinary collaboration transboundary collaboration must be intensified to successfully apply these emerging techniques for the benefit of our rivers and surface waters 4 non stationary monitoring usually stationary platforms are employed for surface water monitoring and sampling besides these mobile infrastructures e g trailer based ex situ or autonomous in situ equipped with gps trackers self sustaining energy supply and data transmission via satellite or cellular network depending on how remote the location is nam et al 2005 are employed non stationary examples from marine monitoring include buoys autonomous gliders and sailing boats or ferries the latter provide more infrastructure and the water utilized for engine cooling or daily needs can be sampled and analyzed without changing processes on the ships petersen 2014 steffen 2018 buoys are also employed in rivers apel et al 2012 while autonomous gliders e g for microplastic screening with near ir light sensors and optional sampling edson and patterson 2015 are difficult to realize for waterways where the challenges are less of technical nature but more about legal challenges due to increased traffic densities compared to oceans remote controlled boats already monitor small rivers lakes for topography hydrometry and routinely for water quality degel and hofmann 2017 kutschera et al 2017 wiek et al

16244,the water occurrence states in waste activated sludge was are crucial to its dewaterability and significantly influenced by the water retaining capacity of extracellular polymeric substances eps matrix accordingly the non selective oh oxidation processes were widely reported for the sludge dewaterability improvement just because it can non selectively destruct complex structure units of eps no matter these structure units are crucial to eps water holding capacity or not but these non selective processes may also require the large consumption of oxidant chemicals which limits their wide application this study specifically focused on the oh induced variation in molecular compositions of eps and the corresponding effects on water occurrence states of was which is expected to lay a foundation for optimizing the efficiency of oxidation based sludge conditioning especially through a novel method based on the equilibrium dialysis with alkaline titration the typical hydrophilic functional groups of eps were quantitatively analyzed the results indicated that the free amino group nh2 had the greater impact on the water holding capacity of eps than the acidic hydroxyl groups oh nevertheless by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms the hydrophilic heteroatom classes e g n cw were found to be less sensitive to the varying oxidant dosage than the molecular saturation degree e g weighted averages of double bond equivalents dbew and aromatic index aimod w oh modified the nitrogen containing or oxygen containing functional groups but could not completely remove these hydrophilic functional groups from eps macromolecules therefore the potential competition for oh between the hydrophilic functional groups and the unsaturated structure units of eps was clarified which guides directions that developing highly efficient sludge conditioning approaches should be based on the selective removal of hydrophilic functional groups instead of improving oh production efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge dewaterability eps aops ft icr ms 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment is widely applied worldwide for water pollution control due to its high adaptability to influent quality flexible operation mode and stable process performance wu et al 2020b however waste activated sludge was could be generated by microbial metabolism of pollutants during biological wastewater treatment processes and contain various toxic components such as pathogens heavy metals and organic contaminants the management of was residues accounts for almost 50 of the investment of wastewater treatment facilities dewatering can minimize the sludge volume facilitate the transportation and increase the calorific value therefore it is commonly used as the crucial step for highly efficient re utilization of was and even reducing the carbon emission during sludge disposal wu et al 2020b however was is a colloidal aggregate consisting of microorganisms mainly bacteria embedded in a bio polymeric network it is generally difficult to dewater was without conditioning processes because the highly hydrated extracellular polymeric substances eps bind a large volume of water i e bound water within the bio flocs of was wu et al 2021 and the bound water cannot be removed directly by mechanical means according to its interactions with solid compositions bound water is further refined as steric binding water e g interstitial water and chemically bonded water e g vicinal water wu et al 2019 those features of water occurrence states in was are closely related to the water holding capacity of eps matrix and crucial to the water removal efficiency during dewatering process wu et al 2021 the water holding capacity of eps matrix inevitably relies on its chemical compositions therefore many efforts have been devoted to unveil the key compositions or structure units of eps towards hydrophilicity hydrophobicity for instance three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence analysis found that the sludge dewaterability is dominated by the tyrosine tryptophan protein like compounds in eps kim et al 2016 however 3d eem fluorescence is not able to determine the accurate compositions of eps the proteomics was recently introduced to reveal the origin molecular function and related biological processes of extracellular proteins wu et al 2017 but it still cannot provide the molecular information of extracellular polysaccharides and other humic fulvic acid like compounds in term of further analysis on the functional groups x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir were commonly used tools which determined that the n containing functional groups could be the hydrophilic functional groups of eps xiao et al 2018 however it was hard for both xps and ft ir to quantitatively analyze functional groups these insufficiencies in the existing analytical methods limited the accurate identification on the hydrophilic hydrophobic molecular structure of eps as a result various advanced oxidation processes aops were widely reported for improving dewaterability of was because the highly reactive hydroxyl radical oh eo oh h h2o 2 813 vnhe could non selectively destruct the hydrophilic structure of eps buyukkamaci 2004 no matter these structure units are crucial to eps water holding capacity or not however the non selective oxidation may also cause the large consumption of chemicals which limits its wide application on the other hand aops are commonly applied for the advanced treatment of low strength wastewater containing refractory organic compounds there still may be some debates on whether and what extent of oh based oxidation can change the various macromolecules in complex mixture therefore the deep insights into the molecular changes of eps are still demanded accordingly how the oh induced molecule level changes of eps affect its water holding capacity and how these changes are related to the water occurrence states of was can be unveiled which will serve for the efficiency improvement of sludge conditioning process motivated by the facts outlined above this study specifically focused on the influential mechanism of water occurrence states of was from the perspective of the potential linkage between water holding capacity and molecular compositions of eps the typical fenton reactions were run for oh generation in was the oh induced variations in the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and functional groups of eps especially the hydrophilic amino group nh2 and acidic hydroxyl group oh were quantitatively tracked furthermore as the ultrahigh resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is advantageous for providing accurate molecular formulas of individual organics compounds present in mixtures koch and dittmar 2006 this study applied it for the in depth characterization of oh induced changes in eps a variety of molecular fingerprints of eps including atomic compositions aromaticity index and double bond equivalents koch and dittmar 2006 were explored thus the extent of oh based oxidation for affecting the various macromolecules in complex mixture of was could be characterized by the structural saturation degree of contributing molecules zhang et al 2020 finally the correlative analysis between the molecular compositions and the water holding capacity of eps was conducted as a result the influential mechanism of water eps interactions can be expanded to the molecular levels which is believed to provide the theoretical basis for optimizing the consumption of sludge conditioning chemicals by avoiding unnecessary oxidative modification of extracellular macromolecules 2 materials and methods 2 1 was the was samples were collected from the thickener of a municipal wastewater treatment plant using

the sludge derived samples e g eps extracts were stored at 4 c before use the analytical experiments were completed within 5 d in order to minimize any possible change of physicochemical properties 2 2 typical procedures for oh based conditioning of was the typical oh based conditioning approach i e fenton reactions were run for sludge dewaterability improvement the protocol was modified according to the previous literature mo et al 2015 the ratio of fe ii and h2o2 was set as 25 mmol fe ii g h2o2 for fenton based conditioning buyukkamaci 2004 wu and chai 2016 typically ph of sludge was first adjusted to the pre determined value by adding 1 5 mol l h2so4 and then 0 025 0 4 g h2o2 g dry solid ds was spiked in sludge samples after fe ii feso4 with the corresponding dosage was added after 30 min reaction under the magnetic agitation 300 rpm the dewaterability of pretreated sludge was evaluated in term of normalized capillary suction time cst which was calculated by dividing the measured cst by the solid concentration of was 2 3 eps extraction the extraction of soluble eps s eps and bound eps b eps using the cation exchange resin cer based method followed the procedures previously reported bo et al 1996 the details are described in text s1 of supplementary materials the total organic carbon toc of extracted eps was measured using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc l japan and shown in table s1 2 4 functional group analysis surface hydrophobicity index shi of eps was measured using 1 anilino naphthalene 8 sulfonate ans as fluorescence probe according to the method reported by haskard et al haskard and ecy 1998 free amino group nh2 refers to the amino group that doesn t form peptide bond its content was determined by the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid tnbs method habeeb 1966 which used the reaction between tnbs and free amino group nh2 to form chromogenic trinitrophenyl derivatives protein carbonylation was quantified according to the method described by wu et al wu et al 2010 which used the reaction of 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine with the carbonyl groups co the acidic hydroxyl groups i e carboxylic lactonic and phenolic groups of the extracted eps were quantified by the modified boehm titration method boehm 1994 the number of acidic sites was determined under the assumptions that naoh neutralizes carboxylic lactonic and phenolic groups that na2co3 neutralizes carboxylic and lactonic groups and that nahco3 neutralizes only carboxylic groups boehm 1994 first the ph of eps extraction solution was adjusted to 6 80 0 05 ph of raw sludge to precipitate fe3 derived from fenton reactions next naoh na2co3 and nahco3 solutions 5 ml and 0 05 mol l were mixed with 10 ml eps extraction solution respectively and then the mixed solutions were separately constrained within a dialysis bag 500 da which was immersed in 150 ml ultrapure water the dialysis experiment was continued for 12 h to make sure that the osmotic pressure difference between the inner and outer sides of the dialysis bag disappeared at the same time naoh na2co3 and nahco3 could be consumed by the acidic groups of eps the residual naoh na2co3 and nahco3 was quantified by hydrochloric acid hcl 0 05 mol l titration using methyl orange and phenolphthalein as indicators to avoid the possible interference of eps on the acidic titration only the solution in the outer side of the dialysis bag was taken to measure the concentrations of residual naoh na2co3 and nahco3 accordingly the amount of consumed base and the corresponding contents of acidic hydroxyl groups could be determined the procedures of acidic titration for naoh na2co3 and nahco3 quantification were as follows 4 drops of phenolphthalein ethanol solution 10 g l was added into 50 ml aqueous sample to turn the solution red the consumed volume of hcl standard solution 0 05 mol l for quenching the red color was recorded as v1 then 4 drops of methyl orange solution 0 5 g l was added into the above sample and hcl solution 0 05 mol l was used to titrate the solution until the color changed from yellow to orange the corresponding volume of consumed hcl standard solution 0 05 mol l was recorded as v2 for the samples only containing co3 2 v1 v2 1 co 3 2 mol l c hcl 2 v 1 v 1000 for the samples only containing hco3 v1 0 2 hco 3 mol l c hcl v 2 v 1000 for the samples only containing oh v2 0 3 o h mol l c hcl v 1 v 1000 where v was the volume of aqueous samples to be measured ml c hcl was the concentration of hcl standard solution 0 05 mol l 2 5 other analytical methods 2 5 1 electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis the capacity of fenton reactions for generate oh in was was confirmed via epr method 0 0625 ml feso4 solution 0 5 mol l fe ii and 0 0075 ml h2o2 solution 30 wt were added into 5

0625 ml feso4 solution 0 5 mol l fe ii and 0 0075 ml h2o2 solution 30 wt were added into 5 ml water initial ph was also pre adjusted to 3 the 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was selected as a spin trap the epr spectra were recorded on a field modulated epr spectrometer bruker corporation usa the detailed instrument settings can be found in text s2 of supplementary materials 2 5 2 water occurrence state characterized by t2 relaxation time of low field nmr previously the bound water was regarded as the water fixed to solid phase by chemical bindings or physical capture and hard to be removed from the sludge body using mechanical means also due to lowering its thermodynamic activity by the water solid interaction bound water has the capability to resist freezing under low temperatures accordingly the centrifugal separation and thermogravimetric analysis were introduced to quantify the bound water that cannot be removed by mechanical means or cannot be frozen at 20 c lee and hsu 1995 however these methods can only measure the total amount of bound water and the results varied with varying operating parameters e g centrifugation force or freezing temperature attributed to the different affinities with the surrounding environment the transverse relaxation time t2 of protons differs under the radio frequency pulse of low field nmr therefore t2 can be an indicator probing the mobility of water molecules rudi et al 2008 compared with the conventional methods the nmr based measurement may have some advantages because it can be a nondestructive method that in situ enables probing the mobility of protons and simultaneously determines the relative fractions of different water states in this study the collected was samples were further concentrated by gravity settling until the solid liquid interface didn t drop within 15 min the supernatant was then discarded so the relative percentages of water fractions potentially linked with solid phase were increased and the refined bound water states e g vicinal water and interstitial water could be prominent next the concentrated sludge sample was placed in an 18 mm diameter polytetrafluoroethylene cylindrical tube and subjected to measure the transverse relaxation time by low field nmr nmi20 030h 1 nmr system niumag electric corporation shanghai china the detailed instrument setting and data processing can be referred to our previous study wu et al 2019 the area under each peak of t2 spectrum was determined by cumulative integration for the relative quantification of water molecule protons with different mobility 2 5 3 ft icr ms analysis ft icr ms analysis solarix 7 0 t ft icr ms bruker usa was applied to characterize the molecular compositions of eps from fenton treated sludge the water soluble fractions of eps were extracted by solid phase extraction spe c18 500 mg 6 ml spe tube cnw shanghai china to remove inorganic salt interferences prior to analysis the spe retained organic fraction was then eluted in 1 1 methanol acetonitrile analysis was conducted using negative ion electrospray ionization esi which is particularly suitable for polar compounds sleighter and hatcher 2007 detailed spe protocols and instrument settings are listed in text s3 of supplementary materials molecular formulas chons0 3 were considered for matching weighted averages of h cw o cw n cw double bond equivalent dbew and aromatic index aimod w were calculated for each sample according to the methods described previously koch and dittmar 2006 2 5 4 quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d analysis to characterize the water holding capacity of eps matrix the viscoelastic acoustic response of adhering eps layers on aurum crystal was monitored in qcm d analysis the detailed procedures are described in text s4 of supplementary materials 2 6 statistical analysis pearson correlation coefficient rp was used to evaluate the potential relationships among functional groups of eps and water holding capacity of eps matrix where 1 denotes a perfect negative correlation 1 denotes a perfect positive correlation and 0 denotes the absence of relationship the correlations were considered statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval p value 0 05 principle component analysis pca was applied to distinguish the sensitivities of molecular compositions of eps with varying fenton reagents and water occurrence states bro and smilde 2014 the levels of functional groups and the factors obtained by ft icr ms analysis e g dbew aimod w h cw o cw and n cw were analyzed by ibm spss statistics version 24 0 0 0 and converted to two principal uncorrelated variables according to the factors contributions to principal variables thus a pca plot could be formed in which factors distributed according to each of their influence by two dimensions the percentage of how much each variable can be explained by the principal component was also determined 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of sludge conditioning by radical oxidation 3 1 1 sludge dewaterability characterized by cst primarily the performance of fenton treatment for sludge dewaterability improvement was tested generally with the optimal ratio of fe2 and h2o2 reported in our previous study wu and chai 2016 the normalized cst of was decreased constantly with the increasing addition of h2o2 fig 1 a the oh dominated mechanism was widely accepted for fenton based conditioning operations mo et al 2015 in this study the capacity of fenton reagent for generating oh in was was also verified by epr method as anticipated the epr signals from oh captured by dmpo a 1 2 2 1 quartet pattern with a symmetric center at mt value of 323 the typical characteristic of a dmpo oh adduct was detected fig s1 of supplementary materials buettner 1987 however the oh level of fenton reactions in was was lower compared with that of fenton reactions in water which was reflected by the peak to peak height of epr spectra hence it could be inferred that the high concentration organic compositions of was may consume or quench oh faster than oh self quenching neyens and baeyens 2003 zhang et al 2015 on the other hand fe3 or hydroxyl iron oxide could be formed during fenton process su et al 2019 the hydroxyl iron oxide commonly known as fenton iron mud may make bio flocs easier to be separated from water through catching sweeping mechanism the coagulation effect by fe2 fe3 may also facilitate sludge dewatering therefore the control experiments were conducted with acidification and fe ii but without h2o2 fig 1 b however the results of control experiments showed that fe2 addition with acidification didn t decrease the normalized cst which reflected that the coagulation effect of homogenous catalyst had the limited effectiveness in sludge dewaterability improvement on the contrary more attention could be paid to the role of radical oxidation 3 1 2 water states characterized by t2 distribution of low field nmr the water occurrence state in was is crucial to the water removal efficiency of dewatering process thus the performance of radical oxidation in sludge conditioning was also evaluated by the evolution of water occurrence states characterized by t2 spectra of low field nmr as shown in fig 2 the one dominant peak and one minor peak featured the t2 spectrum of raw sludge suggesting the presence of two major states of protons in raw sludge in general a longer t2 time indicates a lower binding energy and higher mobility of water on the contrary the shorter t2 represents a tight linkage between water and surrounding materials rudi et al 2008 therefore the most left peak at 0 2 ms should be assigned as the protons at solid state which had the extremely lower content than the protons of water molecules gussoni et al 2007 and had no substantial variation with the varying dosages of fenton reagents t22 and t23 correspond to the fixed water strongly bound to organic phase through various physiochemical bond and the water physically trapped in bio flocs only by steric hindrance respectively these two water fractions account for the total bound water in was wu et al 2019 according to the data in table s2 the t23 peaks at around 100 ms appeared in the spectra of samples treated by 0 05 0 4 g h2o2 g ds also the fraction of t23 peak area in the total peak area a23 rose constantly with the increasing h2o2 dosage especially another t24 peak at 439 76 ms was observed in the t2 spectrum of the sludge sample with 0 4 g h2o2 g ds and could be assigned as the moderately mobile water wu et al 2019 the phenomenon indicated that the increasing addition of h2o2 shifted the t2 peaks to the longer t2 range which reflected that the radical oxidation weakened the water holding capacity of bio flocs in was similarly the acidification and fe ii addition also left shifted the t2 peaks but no t24 peak was observed and a23 were only 0 011 0 014 therefore it can be inferred that the effect of ferrous ion on water occurrence states of was was more limited than that of radical oxidation 3 2 variations in functional groups of eps with radical oxidation the oh led modification of molecular compositions of eps was primarily investigated in terms of functional groups especially the hydrophilic functional groups e g amino group nh2 acidic hydroxyl group oh and carbonyl group co 3 2 1 free amino group nh2 of eps free amino group nh2 is a typical functional group with a high affinity to water molecules through hydrogen bond generally oh induces the collapse of eps matrix and decreases the average molecule weight of eps zhou et al 2014 the peptide bonds conh in extracellular proteins can be vulnerable under the oxidation stress of oh which increases the exposure of amino acid residue like lysine zhou et al 2014 therefore the increase of free amino group nh2 with the increasing dosage of h2o2 may occur due to the increased exposure of amino acid residue in this study the free amino group contents of s eps showed an increasing trend with increasing addition of h2o2 fig 3 a on the other hand as an electrophile the large amount of oh produced from fenton reactions can also attack the nucleophile amino group brotzel et al 2007 to form nitro group leading to the loss of free amino group nh2 which should positively contribute to the reduction of water holding capacity of eps matrix accordingly the free amino group nh2 content of b eps constantly decreased with the dosage of h2o2 increasing from 0 to 0 4 g g ds fig 3 b 3 2 2 acidic hydroxyl group oh of eps the acidic hydroxyl group oh refers to the hydroxyl group that is contained in the carboxylic group lactonic group and phenolic group and can dissociate under alkaline conditions the carboxylic group is the typical hydrophilic group due to the hydrogen bond acceptor property of carbonyl group the dissociation of acidic hydroxyl group makes it polar and tend to be soluble in water which positively contributes to its water affinity gomari and hamouda 2006 generally carboxylic group could be produced from the oxidation of primary alcohols or aldehydes oxidative cleavage of unsaturated carbon bond and also through the hydrolysis of nitriles esters or amides boehm 1994 as shown in figs 4 a b the fenton oxidation significantly increased the carboxylic group contents of both s eps and b eps but during the oxidation process carbonyl group could be formed initially and subsequently converted into carboxylic carboxylic anhydride or lactonic groups ros et al 2002 thus due to the sufficient production of oh the carboxylic group content of s eps just kept constant with the dosage of h2o2 over 0 2 g g ds fig 4 a a similar rising trend was also observed for the lactonic group content of b eps oxidized by fenton fig 4 d but the lactonic group contents of s eps first rose and then decreased with the dosage of h2o2 increasing from 0 to 0 4 g g ds which may be due to the toc rising caused by the solubilization of b eps table s1 thus the lactonic group contents per unit toc were measured to decrease fig 4 c the contents of phenolic groups of s eps were extremely low below 0 005 mmol g toc and there was no obvious variation in contents of phenolic groups of b eps fig 4 e f these results suggested that aops based oxidation may prefer to react with oxygen containing groups e g carbonyl group or unsaturated carbon bond to form carboxyl groups instead of benzene ring structure to form phenolic groups aranda et al 2010 also the extracellular proteins and polysaccharides have few benzene ring structures more et al 2014 3 2 3 carbonyl group co of eps carbonyl group co is a putative marker of oxidatively modified macromolecules under oxidative stress uchida et al 1998 the results of carbonyl content measurement indicated that the fenton treatment caused a significant increase of carbonyl formation especially the carbonyl group co of b eps constantly increased from 0 70 mmol g toc to 7 34 mmol g toc with the dosage of h2o2 increasing from 0 to 0 4 g g ds fig 5 carbonyl group can act as a hydrophilic functional group due to its property of hydrogen bond acceptor ziao et al 2002 therefore the increase of carbonyl group could negatively affect the reduction in hydrophilicity of porous bio flocs internal external surface 3 3 evolution of molecular composition of eps with radical oxidation 3 3 1 van krevelen plots for chon molecular formulas van krevelen diagrams plotting o c versus h c were used to visualize the variations in molecular composition of eps fig 6 figs s2 s4 of supplementary materials aligning formulas in regions that can be attributed to lipids o c 0 0 2 h c 1 7 2 2 proteins amino sugars o c 0 2 0 6 h c 1 5 2 2 carbohydrates o c 0 6 1 2 h c 1 5 2 2 lignin o c 0 1 0 6 h c 0 6 1 7 tannins o c 0 6 1 2 h c 0 5 1 5 unsaturated hydrocarbons o c 0 0 1 h c 0 7 1 5 and condensed aromatics like formulas o c 0 1 h c 0 3 0 7 antony et al 2014 throughout this paper chon refers to formulas that contain at least 1n atom and cho formulas have no n as shown in figs s2 and s3 most of the chon formulas fell within regions of the plots assigned as protein like formulas carbohydrates and lignins which should be attributed to the lysis of decaying cells zhang et al 2020 while many of the chon1 5 formulas were also enriched in the lipid like regions the diversity of protein like formulas declined with the increasing number of n atoms in addition for the fenton treated sludge the diversity and intensity of protein like and carbohydrate formulas decreased with the increasing h2o2 especially chon16 50 of s eps and b eps figs s2 and s3 however both the diversity and relative contents of chon1 5 in s eps significantly increased with the elevated h2o2 addition obviously the oh induced solubilization of polysaccharide like and protein like macromolecules contributed to the enrichment of tannins and condensed aromatics like formulas in s eps with respect to the cho formulas fig s4 lipid like compounds unsaturated hydrocarbons and condensed aromatics like compounds were the dominant components for both s eps and b eps the lipid like substances comprised various organic compounds including alcohols esters aliphatic hydrocarbons and fatty acids hockaday et al 2009 the lipid like compounds in eps matrix were thought to be associated with the prevalently detected hydrolytic bacteria e g anaerolineaceae which were responsible for degrading organics like saccharides lipids and proteins liang et al 2009 oh based oxidation affected both bulk molecular composition and molecular structure of eps the o containing and n containing groups e g free amino group nh2 both could be the potential attacking sites of oh for the fenton treated sludge fig 7 h cw increased but o cw and n cw decreased with the addition of h2o2 over 0 025 g g ds which was the evidence that eps were more saturated and less oxygenated wu et al 2020a the decrease in dbew of eps was consistent with the observed increase in h cw and decrease in aimod w since one phenyl group would introduce 4 dbe to the molecule and the cleavage of one cyclic alkyl group would subtract 1 dbe from the molecule antony et al 2014 the decrease in dbew and aimod w may also suggest cracking of heterocyclic n compounds of eps wu et al 2020a additional structural insights into eps were gathered by considering the relationship between dbe and numbers of carbon atoms of individual samples with the higher h2o2 dosage the dbe values of chon6 15 components found in s eps had a greater dependence on the number of carbon atoms fig s6 also with the increasing h2o2 addition chon of b eps especially the chon6 15 formula class contained less species with the high dbe of 10 25 and high carbon number of 40 50 fig s7 which indicated that the large molecule b eps with lower degrees of alkylation were more easily cracked by oh 3 4 evolution of water holding capacity of eps with radical oxidation b eps can form a stable gel that prevents water seepage from the pores of bio flocs instead as the soluble fractions s eps could be removed with filtrate thus plays less important role in water holding capacity of bio flocs than b eps li and yang 2007 primarily this study investigated the solid water interactions by tracking the viscoelastic acoustic response of b eps as shown in fig s9 of supplementary materials the injection of eps induced the substantial shift of frequency δf and dissipation δd in qcm d monitoring which should correspond to the thicker eps adsorption layer on the sensor crystal wang et al 2010 with the prolonged injection time 30 min the gradual stabilization of frequency and dissipation indicated the saturation of crystal surface coverage by adhering eps layers by plotting the frequency shift versus the dissipation shift it is possible to compare the energy dissipation caused by per unit mass of the crystal adsorbed macromolecule layer gutman et al 2013 a lower δf δd value indicates buildup of a dissipative soft and fluid film on the qcm d sensor instead a higher δf δd value stands for a more rigid layer gutman et al 2013 accordingly the rigid layer should correspond to the hydrophobicity of eps matrix according to the values of δf δd shown in fig 8 the value of δf δd constantly rose with the increasing addition of h2o2 this trend indicated an increase in the rigidity which was also a sign of a dense water repelling system in another word the oxidation significantly reduced the water holding capacity of eps matrix shi was also used to characterize the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of eps with the varying functional groups as depicted in fig 9 the oh based oxidation slightly decreased shi of s eps but enhanced the hydrophobicity of b eps which was in accordance with the viscoelastic acoustic response of b eps the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity should be jointly controlled by the various types of functional groups shi and δf δd both significantly correlated with the contents of free amino group nh2 carboxylic group lactonic group and carbonyl group co table 1 according to the above analysis on the functional groups of eps the hydrophilic free amino group nh2 was significantly reduced by fenton treatment but some other hydrophilic groups e g oxygen containing functional groups were introduced by oxidation however the absolute values of pearson coefficients between the free amino group nh2 and δf δd rp 0 95 p value 0 01 were higher than that between the total hydroxyl group oh and δf δd rp 0 80 p value 0 05 table 1 therefore the free amino group nh2 should have the greater impact on the water holding capacity of eps than the acidic hydroxyl groups oh eqs 1 3 3 5 mechanism insights into water state transformation resulted from molecular modification of eps the above analysis clearly indicated the significant correlations among water holding capacity and functional groups of eps in order to further clarify the roles of different physiochemical properties of eps in water occurrence states of was pca was conducted using 17 different molecular indicators of eps according to the rotated component matrix of pca table s3 the variables chon h cw free amino group nh2 lactonic group f d chon aimod w chon dbew carboxylic group carbonyl group cho h cw shi cho dbew cho aimod w and chon n cw could be explained by principal component 1 pc 1 with the correlation coefficients of 0 700 0 984 while principal component 2 pc 2 explained chon n cw cho o cw phenolic group and chon o cw with the correlation coefficients of 0 657 0 935 furthermore it was reasonable that h cw was positively explained by pc 1 but the unsaturation coefficients were negatively explained by pc 1 table s3 which corresponded to the fact that h cw negatively correlated with dbew and aimod w korsten 1997 as shown in fig 10 the samples with the high dosage of h2o2 and the low dosage of h2o2 could form the separated clusters in pca plot for example the sludge samples obtained by 0 1 0 4 g h2o2 g ds were closely located at the fourth quadrant the cluster of samples with 0 025 0 05 g h2o2 g ds distributed in the second quadrant the raw sludge was separately located in the third quadrant the phenomenon indicated that the production of oh could significantly affect the macromolecular compositions of eps since the varying dosage of oxidants led to the different sample clusters on the other hand the three samples of the cluster in the fourth quadrant all had t23 peaks in the low field nmr spectra fig 2 but the raw sludge sample in the third quadrant only had t21 and t22 peaks thus the clustering feature of pca analysis also corresponded to the water occurrence states of was basically it could be inferred that the molecular indicators explained by pc 1 e g free amino group nh2 lactonic group carboxylic group and carbonyl group should play more important roles in water occurrence states than those indicators explained by pc 2 including chon n cw cho o cw phenolic group and chon o cw because pc 1 accounted for 77 391 of the total variance whereas pc 2 accounted for only 16 762 of the total variance following the similar principle the molecular saturation degree pc 1 explained indicators e g dbew and aimod w should be more sensitive to the elevating h2o2 dosage than the heteroatom classes pc 2 explained indicators e g n cw and oxygen containing groups in another word the non selective oh was preferentially consumed by unsaturated structure units at most oh modified the nitrogen containing or oxygen containing functional groups but could not completely remove all these hydrophilic functional groups from eps macromolecules accordingly some recently developed medical technologies for targeted degradation of bio macromolecules may be modified and introduced into sludge conditioning process for example proteolysis targeting chimeras protacs connect the ligand of target protein and recruitment ligand of e3 ubiquitin ligase through a linker e3 ubiquitin ligase can label the target protein as defective or damaged protein by pasting a small protein called ubiquitin on the target protein then the labeled target proteins can be identified and degraded by using the protein crusher i e 26s proteasome sun et al 2019 protacs is expected to realize the targeted elimination of hydrophilic structure units of extracellular proteins in the complex system of was furthermore f d in qcm d analysis could characterize the water holding capacity of eps matrix but shi only reflected the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of constituent molecules of eps in this study pc 1 explained f d and shi with the correlation coefficients of 0 970 and 0 908 respectively the inconsistency of pca correlation coefficient for those two indicators reflected that the water holding capacity of eps matrix was not only controlled by the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of eps but may also depend on the micro spatial distribution of those macromolecular compounds which was reported in our recent publication wu et al 2021 4 conclusions in this paper we are attempting to clarify the influential mechanism of water occurrence states of was from the perspective of the potential linkage between water holding capacity and molecular compositions of eps through the newly developed method based on the equilibrium dialysis with alkaline titration the contents of acidic hydroxylic groups oh represented by carboxylic group were found to increase from 0 04 to 1 48 mmol g toc of b eps with the h2o2 addition rising from 0 to 0 4 g g ds instead the sufficient oh oxidation could effectively decrease the free amino group nh2 levels of b eps below 0 30 mmol g toc fortunately the pearson correlations among the contents of hydrophilic functional groups and shi indicated that the free amino group nh2 rp 0 95 p value 0 01 had the greater impact on the water holding capacity of eps than the acidic hydroxyl groups oh rp 0 80 p value 0 05 with the evolution of functional groups the eps matrix tended to be a dense water repelling system which was reflected by the increasing δf δd of qcm d analysis additionally the free amino group nh2 lactonic group carboxylic group and carbonyl group were found to play more important roles in water occurrence states than chon n cw cho o cw phenolic group and chon o cw however the molecular saturation degree e g dbew and aimod w were more sensitive to the varying h2o2 dosage than the heteroatom classes e g n cw therefore the potential competition for oh between the hydrophilic functional groups and the unsaturated structure units of eps limited the efficiency of aops based sludge treatment it may still remain a challenge for aops to selectively remove hydrophilic groups of eps thus more attention can be paid to some novel biotechnologies e g proteolytic targeting chimera for the targeted lysis of water holding components in was and the selective removal of free amino group nh2 instead of all the hydrophilic functional group could be sufficient for the hydrophobic modification needed by sludge dewaterability improvement moreover the inconsistency of pca interpretive degrees for f d and shi reflected that the water holding capacity of eps matrix was not only controlled by the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of eps macromolecules but also the aggregation state of eps matrix accordingly the joint application of aops and coagulation flocculation should be a promising way for highly efficient sludge dewaterability improvement credit authorship contribution statement dr boran wu set up the core ideas analyzed the

16244,the water occurrence states in waste activated sludge was are crucial to its dewaterability and significantly influenced by the water retaining capacity of extracellular polymeric substances eps matrix accordingly the non selective oh oxidation processes were widely reported for the sludge dewaterability improvement just because it can non selectively destruct complex structure units of eps no matter these structure units are crucial to eps water holding capacity or not but these non selective processes may also require the large consumption of oxidant chemicals which limits their wide application this study specifically focused on the oh induced variation in molecular compositions of eps and the corresponding effects on water occurrence states of was which is expected to lay a foundation for optimizing the efficiency of oxidation based sludge conditioning especially through a novel method based on the equilibrium dialysis with alkaline titration the typical hydrophilic functional groups of eps were quantitatively analyzed the results indicated that the free amino group nh2 had the greater impact on the water holding capacity of eps than the acidic hydroxyl groups oh nevertheless by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms the hydrophilic heteroatom classes e g n cw were found to be less sensitive to the varying oxidant dosage than the molecular saturation degree e g weighted averages of double bond equivalents dbew and aromatic index aimod w oh modified the nitrogen containing or oxygen containing functional groups but could not completely remove these hydrophilic functional groups from eps macromolecules therefore the potential competition for oh between the hydrophilic functional groups and the unsaturated structure units of eps was clarified which guides directions that developing highly efficient sludge conditioning approaches should be based on the selective removal of hydrophilic functional groups instead of improving oh production efficiency graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge dewaterability eps aops ft icr ms 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment is widely applied worldwide for water pollution control due to its high adaptability to influent quality flexible operation mode and stable process performance wu et al 2020b however waste activated sludge was could be generated by microbial metabolism of pollutants during biological wastewater treatment processes and contain various toxic components such as pathogens heavy metals and organic contaminants the management of was residues accounts for almost 50 of the investment of wastewater treatment facilities dewatering can minimize the sludge volume facilitate the transportation and increase the calorific value therefore it is commonly used as the crucial step for highly efficient re utilization of was and even reducing the carbon emission during sludge disposal wu et al 2020b however was is a colloidal aggregate consisting of microorganisms mainly bacteria embedded in a bio polymeric network it is generally difficult to dewater was without conditioning processes because the highly hydrated extracellular polymeric substances eps bind a large volume of water i e bound water within the bio flocs of was wu et al 2021 and the bound water cannot be removed directly by mechanical means according to its interactions with solid compositions bound water is further refined as steric binding water e g interstitial water and chemically bonded water e g vicinal water wu et al 2019 those features of water occurrence states in was are closely related to the water holding capacity of eps matrix and crucial to the water removal efficiency during dewatering process wu et al 2021 the water holding capacity of eps matrix inevitably relies on its chemical compositions therefore many efforts have been devoted to unveil the key compositions or structure units of eps towards hydrophilicity hydrophobicity for instance three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence analysis found that the sludge dewaterability is dominated by the tyrosine tryptophan protein like compounds in eps kim et al 2016 however 3d eem fluorescence is not able to determine the accurate compositions of eps the proteomics was recently introduced to reveal the origin molecular function and related biological processes of extracellular proteins wu et al 2017 but it still cannot provide the molecular information of extracellular polysaccharides and other humic fulvic acid like compounds in term of further analysis on the functional groups x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir were commonly used tools which determined that the n containing functional groups could be the hydrophilic functional groups of eps xiao et al 2018 however it was hard for both xps and ft ir to quantitatively analyze functional groups these insufficiencies in the existing analytical methods limited the accurate identification on the hydrophilic hydrophobic molecular structure of eps as a result various advanced oxidation processes aops were widely reported for improving dewaterability of was because the highly reactive hydroxyl radical oh eo oh h h2o 2 813 vnhe could non selectively destruct the hydrophilic structure of eps buyukkamaci 2004 no matter these structure units are crucial to eps water holding capacity or not however the non selective oxidation may also cause the large consumption of chemicals which limits its wide application on the other hand aops are commonly applied for the advanced treatment of low strength wastewater containing refractory organic compounds there still may be some debates on whether and what extent of oh based oxidation can change the various macromolecules in complex mixture therefore the deep insights into the molecular changes of eps are still demanded accordingly how the oh induced molecule level changes of eps affect its water holding capacity and how these changes are related to the water occurrence states of was can be unveiled which will serve for the efficiency improvement of sludge conditioning process motivated by the facts outlined above this study specifically focused on the influential mechanism of water occurrence states of was from the perspective of the potential linkage between water holding capacity and molecular compositions of eps the typical fenton reactions were run for oh generation in was the oh induced variations in the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and functional groups of eps especially the hydrophilic amino group nh2 and acidic hydroxyl group oh were quantitatively tracked furthermore as the ultrahigh resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is advantageous for providing accurate molecular formulas of individual organics compounds present in mixtures koch and dittmar 2006 this study applied it for the in depth characterization of oh induced changes in eps a variety of molecular fingerprints of eps including atomic compositions aromaticity index and double bond equivalents koch and dittmar 2006 were explored thus the extent of oh based oxidation for affecting the various macromolecules in complex mixture of was could be characterized by the structural saturation degree of contributing molecules zhang et al 2020 finally the correlative analysis between the molecular compositions and the water holding capacity of eps was conducted as a result the influential mechanism of water eps interactions can be expanded to the molecular levels which is believed to provide the theoretical basis for optimizing the consumption of sludge conditioning chemicals by avoiding unnecessary oxidative modification of extracellular macromolecules 2 materials and methods 2 1 was the was samples were collected from the thickener of a municipal wastewater treatment plant using anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process at shanghai china the sampling interval for the triplicate samples was 24 h ph 6 81 0 05 water content 97 68 0 02 wt 23 32 0 20 g l total solid and volatile solid 13 94 0 20 g l of the as collected sludge were determined following american water works association standard methods for the examination of water and sewage apha 2009 the raw sludge samples and all the sludge derived samples e g eps extracts were stored at 4 c before use the analytical experiments were completed within 5 d in order to minimize any possible change of physicochemical properties 2 2 typical procedures for oh based conditioning of was the typical oh based conditioning approach i e fenton reactions were run for sludge dewaterability improvement the protocol was modified according to the previous literature mo et al 2015 the ratio of fe ii and h2o2 was set as 25 mmol fe ii g h2o2 for fenton based conditioning buyukkamaci 2004 wu and chai 2016 typically ph of sludge was first adjusted to the pre determined value by adding 1 5 mol l h2so4 and then 0 025 0 4 g h2o2 g dry solid ds was spiked in sludge samples after fe ii feso4 with the corresponding dosage was added after 30 min reaction under the magnetic agitation 300 rpm the dewaterability of pretreated sludge was evaluated in term of normalized capillary suction time cst which was calculated by dividing the measured cst by the solid concentration of was 2 3 eps extraction the extraction of soluble eps s eps and bound eps b eps using the cation exchange resin cer based method followed the procedures previously reported bo et al 1996 the details are described in text s1 of supplementary materials the total organic carbon toc of extracted eps was measured using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc l japan and shown in table s1 2 4 functional group analysis surface hydrophobicity index shi of eps was measured using 1 anilino naphthalene 8 sulfonate ans as fluorescence probe according to the method reported by haskard et al haskard and ecy 1998 free amino group nh2 refers to the amino group that doesn t form peptide bond its content was determined by the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid tnbs method habeeb 1966 which used the reaction between tnbs and free amino group nh2 to form chromogenic trinitrophenyl derivatives protein carbonylation was quantified according to the method described by wu et al wu et al 2010 which used the reaction of 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine with the carbonyl groups co the acidic hydroxyl groups i e carboxylic lactonic and phenolic groups of the extracted eps were quantified by the modified boehm titration method boehm 1994 the number of acidic sites was determined under the assumptions that naoh neutralizes carboxylic lactonic and phenolic groups that na2co3 neutralizes carboxylic and lactonic groups and that nahco3 neutralizes only carboxylic groups boehm 1994 first the ph of eps extraction solution was adjusted to 6 80 0 05 ph of raw sludge to precipitate fe3 derived from fenton reactions next naoh na2co3 and nahco3 solutions 5 ml and 0 05 mol l were mixed with 10 ml eps extraction solution respectively and then the mixed solutions were separately constrained within a dialysis bag 500 da which was immersed in 150 ml ultrapure water the dialysis experiment was continued for 12 h to make sure that the osmotic pressure difference between the inner and outer sides of the dialysis bag disappeared at the same time naoh na2co3 and nahco3 could be consumed by the acidic groups of eps the residual naoh na2co3 and nahco3 was quantified by hydrochloric acid hcl 0 05 mol l titration using methyl orange and phenolphthalein as indicators to avoid the possible interference of eps on the acidic titration only the solution in the outer side of the dialysis bag was taken to measure the concentrations of residual naoh na2co3 and nahco3 accordingly the amount of consumed base and the corresponding contents of acidic hydroxyl groups could be determined the procedures of acidic titration for naoh na2co3 and nahco3 quantification were as follows 4 drops of phenolphthalein ethanol solution 10 g l was added into 50 ml aqueous sample to turn the solution red the consumed volume of hcl standard solution 0 05 mol l for quenching the red color was recorded as v1 then 4 drops of methyl orange solution 0 5 g l was added into the above sample and hcl solution 0 05 mol l was used to titrate the solution until the color changed from yellow to orange the corresponding volume of consumed hcl standard solution 0 05 mol l was recorded as v2 for the samples only containing co3 2 v1 v2 1 co 3 2 mol l c hcl 2 v 1 v 1000 for the samples only containing hco3 v1 0 2 hco 3 mol l c hcl v 2 v 1000 for the samples only containing oh v2 0 3 o h mol l c hcl v 1 v 1000 where v was the volume of aqueous samples to be measured ml c hcl was the concentration of hcl standard solution 0 05 mol l 2 5 other analytical methods 2 5 1 electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis the capacity of fenton reactions for generate oh in was was confirmed via epr method 0 0625 ml feso4 solution 0 5 mol l fe ii and 0 0075 ml h2o2 solution 30 wt were added into 5 ml was sample as a result 0 025 mol fe ii g h2o2 was obtained the dosage of h2o2 was 0 025 g g ds and the initial ph of was was 3 for the control group fenton reactions in water without organics 0 0625 ml feso4 solution 0 5 mol l fe ii and 0 0075 ml h2o2 solution 30 wt were added into 5 ml water initial ph was also pre adjusted to 3 the 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was selected as a spin trap the epr spectra were recorded on a field modulated epr spectrometer bruker corporation usa the detailed instrument settings can be found in text s2 of supplementary materials 2 5 2 water occurrence state characterized by t2 relaxation time of low field nmr previously the bound water was regarded as the water fixed to solid phase by chemical bindings or physical capture and hard to be removed from the sludge body using mechanical means also due to lowering its thermodynamic activity by the water solid interaction bound water has the capability to resist freezing under low temperatures accordingly the centrifugal separation and thermogravimetric analysis were introduced to quantify the bound water that cannot be removed by mechanical means or cannot be frozen at 20 c lee and hsu 1995 however these methods can only measure the total amount of bound water and the results varied with varying operating parameters e g centrifugation force or freezing temperature attributed to the different affinities with the surrounding environment the transverse relaxation time t2 of protons differs under the radio frequency pulse of low field nmr therefore t2 can be an indicator probing the mobility of water molecules rudi et al 2008 compared with the conventional methods the nmr based measurement may have some advantages because it can be a nondestructive method that in situ enables probing the mobility of protons and simultaneously determines the relative fractions of different water states in this study the collected was samples were further concentrated by gravity settling until the solid liquid interface didn t drop within 15 min the supernatant was then discarded so the relative percentages of water fractions potentially linked with solid phase were increased and the refined bound water states e g vicinal water and interstitial water could be prominent next the concentrated sludge sample was placed in an 18 mm diameter polytetrafluoroethylene cylindrical tube and subjected to measure the transverse relaxation time by low field nmr nmi20 030h 1 nmr system niumag electric corporation shanghai china the detailed instrument setting and data processing can be referred to our previous study wu et al 2019 the area under each peak of t2 spectrum was determined by cumulative integration for the relative quantification of water molecule protons with different mobility 2 5 3 ft icr ms analysis ft icr ms analysis solarix 7 0 t ft icr ms bruker usa was applied to characterize the molecular compositions of eps from fenton treated sludge the water soluble fractions of eps were extracted by solid phase extraction spe c18 500 mg 6 ml spe tube cnw shanghai china to remove inorganic salt interferences prior to analysis the spe retained organic fraction was then eluted in 1 1 methanol acetonitrile analysis was conducted using negative ion electrospray ionization esi which is particularly suitable for polar compounds sleighter and hatcher 2007 detailed spe protocols and instrument settings are listed in text s3 of supplementary materials molecular formulas chons0 3 were considered for matching weighted averages of h cw o cw n cw double bond equivalent dbew and aromatic index aimod w were calculated for each sample according to the methods described previously koch and dittmar 2006 2 5 4 quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d analysis to characterize the water holding capacity of eps matrix the viscoelastic acoustic response of adhering eps layers on aurum crystal was monitored in qcm d analysis the detailed procedures are described in text s4 of supplementary materials 2 6 statistical analysis pearson correlation coefficient rp was used to evaluate the potential relationships among functional groups of eps and water holding capacity of eps matrix where 1 denotes a perfect negative correlation 1 denotes a perfect positive correlation and 0 denotes the absence of relationship the correlations were considered statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval p value 0 05 principle component analysis pca was applied to distinguish the sensitivities of molecular compositions of eps with varying fenton reagents and water occurrence states bro and smilde 2014 the levels of functional groups and the factors obtained by ft icr ms analysis e g dbew aimod w h cw o cw and n cw were analyzed by ibm spss statistics version 24 0 0 0 and converted to two principal uncorrelated variables according to the factors contributions to principal variables thus a pca plot could be formed in which factors distributed according to each of their influence by two dimensions the percentage of how much each variable can be explained by the principal component was also determined 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of sludge conditioning by radical oxidation 3 1 1 sludge dewaterability characterized by cst primarily the performance of fenton treatment for sludge dewaterability improvement was tested generally with the optimal ratio of fe2 and h2o2 reported in our previous study wu and chai 2016 the normalized cst of was decreased constantly with the increasing addition of h2o2 fig 1 a the oh dominated mechanism was widely accepted for fenton based conditioning operations mo et al 2015 in this study the capacity of fenton reagent for generating oh in was was also verified by epr method as anticipated the epr signals from oh captured by dmpo a 1 2 2 1 quartet pattern with a symmetric center at mt value of 323 the typical characteristic of a dmpo oh adduct was detected fig s1 of supplementary materials buettner 1987 however the oh level of fenton reactions in was was lower compared with that of fenton reactions in water which was reflected by the peak to peak height of epr spectra hence it could be inferred that the high concentration organic compositions of was may consume or quench oh faster than oh self quenching neyens and baeyens 2003 zhang et al 2015 on the other hand fe3 or hydroxyl iron oxide could be formed during fenton process su et al 2019 the hydroxyl iron oxide commonly known as fenton iron mud may make bio flocs easier to be separated from water through catching sweeping mechanism the coagulation effect by fe2 fe3 may also facilitate sludge dewatering therefore the control experiments were conducted with acidification and fe ii but without h2o2 fig 1 b however the results of control experiments showed that fe2 addition with acidification didn t decrease the normalized cst which reflected that the coagulation effect of homogenous catalyst had the limited effectiveness in sludge dewaterability improvement on the contrary more attention could be paid to the role of radical oxidation 3 1 2 water states characterized by t2 distribution of low field nmr the water occurrence state in was is crucial to the water removal efficiency of dewatering process thus the performance of radical oxidation in sludge conditioning was also evaluated by the evolution of water occurrence states characterized by t2 spectra of low field nmr as shown in fig 2 the one dominant peak and one minor peak featured the t2 spectrum of raw sludge suggesting the presence of two major states of protons in raw sludge in general a longer t2 time indicates a lower binding energy and higher mobility of water on the contrary the shorter t2 represents a tight linkage between water and surrounding materials rudi et al 2008 therefore the most left peak at 0 2 ms should be assigned as the protons at solid state which had the extremely lower content than the protons of water molecules gussoni et al 2007 and had no substantial variation with the varying dosages of fenton reagents t22 and t23 correspond to the fixed water strongly bound to organic phase through various physiochemical bond and the water physically trapped in bio flocs only by steric hindrance respectively these two water fractions account for the total bound water in was wu et al 2019 according to the data in table s2 the t23 peaks at around 100 ms appeared in the spectra of samples treated by 0 05 0 4 g h2o2 g ds also the fraction of t23 peak area in the total peak area a23 rose constantly with the increasing h2o2 dosage especially another t24 peak at 439 76 ms was observed in the t2 spectrum of the sludge sample with 0 4 g h2o2 g ds and could be assigned as the moderately mobile water wu et al 2019 the phenomenon indicated that the increasing addition of h2o2 shifted the t2 peaks to the longer t2 range which reflected that the radical oxidation weakened the water holding capacity of bio flocs in was similarly the acidification and fe ii addition also left shifted the t2 peaks but no t24 peak was observed and a23 were only 0 011 0 014 therefore it can be inferred that the effect of ferrous ion on water occurrence states of was was more limited than that of radical oxidation 3 2 variations in functional groups of eps with radical oxidation the oh led modification of molecular compositions of eps was primarily investigated in terms of functional groups especially the hydrophilic functional groups e g amino group nh2 acidic hydroxyl group oh and carbonyl group co 3 2 1 free amino group nh2 of eps free amino group nh2 is a typical functional group with a high affinity to water molecules through hydrogen bond generally oh induces the collapse of eps matrix and decreases the average molecule weight of eps zhou et al 2014 the peptide bonds conh in extracellular proteins can be vulnerable under the oxidation stress of oh which increases the exposure of amino acid residue like lysine zhou et al 2014 therefore the increase of free amino group nh2 with the increasing dosage of h2o2 may occur due to the increased exposure of amino acid residue in this study the free amino group contents of s eps showed an increasing trend with increasing addition of h2o2 fig 3 a on the other hand as an electrophile the large amount of oh produced from fenton reactions can also attack the nucleophile amino group brotzel et al 2007 to form nitro group leading to the loss of free amino group nh2 which should positively contribute to the reduction of water holding capacity of eps matrix accordingly the free amino group nh2 content of b eps constantly decreased with the dosage of h2o2 increasing from 0 to 0 4 g g ds fig 3 b 3 2 2 acidic hydroxyl group oh of eps the acidic hydroxyl group oh refers to the hydroxyl group that is contained in the carboxylic group lactonic group and phenolic group and can dissociate under alkaline conditions the carboxylic group is the typical hydrophilic group due to the hydrogen bond acceptor property of carbonyl group the dissociation of acidic hydroxyl group makes it polar and tend to be soluble in water which positively contributes to its water affinity gomari and hamouda 2006 generally carboxylic group could be produced from the oxidation of primary alcohols or aldehydes oxidative cleavage of unsaturated carbon bond and also through the hydrolysis of nitriles esters or amides boehm 1994 as shown in figs 4 a b the fenton oxidation significantly increased the carboxylic group contents of both s eps and b eps but during the oxidation process carbonyl group could be formed initially and subsequently converted into carboxylic carboxylic anhydride or lactonic groups ros et al 2002 thus due to the sufficient production of oh the carboxylic group content of s eps just kept constant with the dosage of h2o2 over 0 2 g g ds fig 4 a a similar rising trend was also observed for the lactonic group content of b eps oxidized by fenton fig 4 d but the lactonic group contents of s eps first rose and then decreased with the dosage of h2o2 increasing from 0 to 0 4 g g ds which may be due to the toc rising caused by the solubilization of b eps table s1 thus the lactonic group contents per unit toc were measured to decrease fig 4 c the contents of phenolic groups of s eps were extremely low below 0 005 mmol g toc and there was no obvious variation in contents of phenolic groups of b eps fig 4 e f these results suggested that aops based oxidation may prefer to react with oxygen containing groups e g carbonyl group or unsaturated carbon bond to form carboxyl groups instead of benzene ring structure to form phenolic groups aranda et al 2010 also the extracellular proteins and polysaccharides have few benzene ring structures more et al 2014 3 2 3 carbonyl group co of eps carbonyl group co is a putative marker of oxidatively modified macromolecules under oxidative stress uchida et al 1998 the results of carbonyl content measurement indicated that the fenton treatment caused a significant increase of carbonyl formation especially the carbonyl group co of b eps constantly increased from 0 70 mmol g toc to 7 34 mmol g toc with the dosage of h2o2 increasing from 0 to 0 4 g g ds fig 5 carbonyl group can act as a hydrophilic functional group due to its property of hydrogen bond acceptor ziao et al 2002 therefore the increase of carbonyl group could negatively affect the reduction in hydrophilicity of porous bio flocs internal external surface 3 3 evolution of molecular composition of eps with radical oxidation 3 3 1 van krevelen plots for chon molecular formulas van krevelen diagrams plotting o c versus h c were used to visualize the variations in molecular composition of eps fig 6 figs s2 s4 of supplementary materials aligning formulas in regions that can be attributed to lipids o c 0 0 2 h c 1 7 2 2 proteins amino sugars o c 0 2 0 6 h c 1 5 2 2 carbohydrates o c 0 6 1 2 h c 1 5 2 2 lignin o c 0 1 0 6 h c 0 6 1 7 tannins o c 0 6 1 2 h c 0 5 1 5 unsaturated hydrocarbons o c 0 0 1 h c 0 7 1 5 and condensed aromatics like formulas o c 0 1 h c 0 3 0 7 antony et al 2014 throughout this paper chon refers to formulas that contain at least 1n atom and cho formulas have no n as shown in figs s2 and s3 most of the chon formulas fell within regions of the plots assigned as protein like formulas carbohydrates and lignins which should be attributed to the lysis of decaying cells zhang et al 2020 while many of the chon1 5 formulas were also enriched in the lipid like regions the diversity of protein like formulas declined with the increasing number of n atoms in addition for the fenton treated sludge the diversity and intensity of protein like and carbohydrate formulas decreased with the increasing h2o2 especially chon16 50 of s eps and b eps figs s2 and s3 however both the diversity and relative contents of chon1 5 in s eps significantly increased with the elevated h2o2 addition obviously the oh induced solubilization of polysaccharide like and protein like macromolecules contributed to the enrichment of tannins and condensed aromatics like formulas in s eps with respect to the cho formulas fig s4 lipid like compounds unsaturated hydrocarbons and condensed aromatics like compounds were the dominant components for both s eps and b eps the lipid like substances comprised various organic compounds including alcohols esters aliphatic hydrocarbons and fatty acids hockaday et al 2009 the lipid like compounds in eps matrix were thought to be associated with the prevalently detected hydrolytic bacteria e g anaerolineaceae which were responsible for degrading organics like saccharides lipids and proteins liang et al 2009 oh based oxidation affected both bulk molecular composition and molecular structure of eps the o containing and n containing groups e g free amino group nh2 both could be the potential attacking sites of oh for the fenton treated sludge fig 7 h cw increased but o cw and n cw decreased with the addition of h2o2 over 0 025 g g ds which was the evidence that eps were more saturated and less oxygenated wu et al 2020a the decrease in dbew of eps was consistent with the observed increase in h cw and decrease in aimod w since one phenyl group would introduce 4 dbe to the molecule and the cleavage of one cyclic alkyl group would subtract 1 dbe from the molecule antony et al 2014 the decrease in dbew and aimod w may also suggest cracking of heterocyclic n compounds of eps wu et al 2020a additional structural insights into eps were gathered by considering the relationship between dbe and numbers of carbon atoms of individual samples with the higher h2o2 dosage the dbe values of chon6 15 components found in s eps had a greater dependence on the number of carbon atoms fig s6 also with the increasing h2o2 addition chon of b eps especially the chon6 15 formula class contained less species with the high dbe of 10 25 and high carbon number of 40 50 fig s7 which indicated that the large molecule b eps with lower degrees of alkylation were more easily cracked by oh 3 4 evolution of water holding capacity of eps with radical oxidation b eps can form a stable gel that prevents water seepage from the pores of bio flocs instead as the soluble fractions s eps could be removed with filtrate thus plays less important role in water holding capacity of bio flocs than b eps li and yang 2007 primarily this study investigated the solid water interactions by tracking the viscoelastic acoustic response of b eps as shown in fig s9 of supplementary materials the injection of eps induced the substantial shift of frequency δf and dissipation δd in qcm d monitoring which should correspond to the thicker eps adsorption layer on the sensor crystal wang et al 2010 with the prolonged injection time 30 min the gradual stabilization of frequency and dissipation indicated the saturation of crystal surface coverage by adhering eps layers by plotting the frequency shift versus the dissipation shift it is possible to compare the energy dissipation caused by per unit mass of the crystal adsorbed macromolecule layer gutman et al 2013 a lower δf δd value indicates buildup of a dissipative soft and fluid film on the qcm d sensor instead a higher δf δd value stands for a more rigid layer gutman et al 2013 accordingly the rigid layer should correspond to the hydrophobicity of eps matrix according to the values of δf δd shown in fig 8 the value of δf δd constantly rose with the increasing addition of h2o2 this trend indicated an increase in the rigidity which was also a sign of a dense water repelling system in another word the oxidation significantly reduced the water holding capacity of eps matrix shi was also used to characterize the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of eps with the varying functional groups as depicted in fig 9 the oh based oxidation slightly decreased shi of s eps but enhanced the hydrophobicity of b eps which was in accordance with the viscoelastic acoustic response of b eps the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity should be jointly controlled by the various types of functional groups shi and δf δd both significantly correlated with the contents of free amino group nh2 carboxylic group lactonic group and carbonyl group co table 1 according to the above analysis on the functional groups of eps the hydrophilic free amino group nh2 was significantly reduced by fenton treatment but some other hydrophilic groups e g oxygen containing functional groups were introduced by oxidation however the absolute values of pearson coefficients between the free amino group nh2 and δf δd rp 0 95 p value 0 01 were higher than that between the total hydroxyl group oh and δf δd rp 0 80 p value 0 05 table 1 therefore the free amino group nh2 should have the greater impact on the water holding capacity of eps than the acidic hydroxyl groups oh eqs 1 3 3 5 mechanism insights into water state transformation resulted from molecular modification of eps the above analysis clearly indicated the significant correlations among water holding capacity and functional groups of eps in order to further clarify the roles of different physiochemical properties of eps in water occurrence states of was pca was conducted using 17 different molecular indicators of eps according to the rotated component matrix of pca table s3 the variables chon h cw free amino group nh2 lactonic group f d chon aimod w chon dbew carboxylic group carbonyl group cho h cw shi cho dbew cho aimod w and chon n cw could be explained by principal component 1 pc 1 with the correlation coefficients of 0 700 0 984 while principal component 2 pc 2 explained chon n cw cho o cw phenolic group and chon o cw with the correlation coefficients of 0 657 0 935 furthermore it was reasonable that h cw was positively explained by pc 1 but the unsaturation coefficients were negatively explained by pc 1 table s3 which corresponded to the fact that h cw negatively correlated with dbew and aimod w korsten 1997 as shown in fig 10 the samples with the high dosage of h2o2 and the low dosage of h2o2 could form the separated clusters in pca plot for example the sludge samples obtained by 0 1 0 4 g h2o2 g ds were closely located at the fourth quadrant the cluster of samples with 0 025 0 05 g h2o2 g ds distributed in the second quadrant the raw sludge was separately located in the third quadrant the phenomenon indicated that the production of oh could significantly affect the macromolecular compositions of eps since the varying dosage of oxidants led to the different sample clusters on the other hand the three samples of the cluster in the fourth quadrant all had t23 peaks in the low field nmr spectra fig 2 but the raw sludge sample in the third quadrant only had t21 and t22 peaks thus the clustering feature of pca analysis also corresponded to the water occurrence states of was basically it could be inferred that the molecular indicators explained by pc 1 e g free amino group nh2 lactonic group carboxylic group and carbonyl group should play more important roles in water occurrence states than those indicators explained by pc 2 including chon n cw cho o cw phenolic group and chon o cw because pc 1 accounted for 77 391 of the total variance whereas pc 2 accounted for only 16 762 of the total variance following the similar principle the molecular saturation degree pc 1 explained indicators e g dbew and aimod w should be more sensitive to the elevating h2o2 dosage than the heteroatom classes pc 2 explained indicators e g n cw and oxygen containing groups in another word the non selective oh was preferentially consumed by unsaturated structure units at most oh modified the nitrogen containing or oxygen containing functional groups but could not completely remove all these hydrophilic functional groups from eps macromolecules accordingly some recently developed medical technologies for targeted degradation of bio macromolecules may be modified and introduced into sludge conditioning process for example proteolysis targeting chimeras protacs connect the ligand of target protein and recruitment ligand of e3 ubiquitin ligase through a linker e3 ubiquitin ligase can label the target protein as defective or damaged protein by pasting a small protein called ubiquitin on the target protein then the labeled target proteins can be identified and degraded by using the protein crusher i e 26s proteasome sun et al 2019 protacs is expected to realize the targeted elimination of hydrophilic structure units of extracellular proteins in the complex system of was furthermore f d in qcm d analysis could characterize the water holding capacity of eps matrix but shi only reflected the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of constituent molecules of eps in this study pc 1 explained f d and shi with the correlation coefficients of 0 970 and 0 908 respectively the inconsistency of pca correlation coefficient for those two indicators reflected that the water holding capacity of eps matrix was not only controlled by the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of eps but may also depend on the micro spatial distribution of those macromolecular compounds which was reported in our recent publication wu et al 2021 4 conclusions in this paper we are attempting to clarify the influential mechanism of water occurrence states of was from the perspective of the potential linkage between water holding capacity and molecular compositions of eps through the newly developed method based on the equilibrium dialysis with alkaline titration the contents of acidic hydroxylic groups oh represented by carboxylic group were found to increase from 0 04 to 1 48 mmol g toc of b eps with the h2o2 addition rising from 0 to 0 4 g g ds instead the sufficient oh oxidation could effectively decrease the free amino group nh2 levels of b eps below 0 30 mmol g toc fortunately the pearson correlations among the contents of hydrophilic functional groups and shi indicated that the free amino group nh2 rp 0 95 p value 0 01 had the greater impact on the water holding capacity of eps than the acidic hydroxyl groups oh rp 0 80 p value 0 05 with the evolution of functional groups the eps matrix tended to be a dense water repelling system which was reflected by the increasing δf δd of qcm d analysis additionally the free amino group nh2 lactonic group carboxylic group and carbonyl group were found to play more important roles in water occurrence states than chon n cw cho o cw phenolic group and chon o cw however the molecular saturation degree e g dbew and aimod w were more sensitive to the varying h2o2 dosage than the heteroatom classes e g n cw therefore the potential competition for oh between the hydrophilic functional groups and the unsaturated structure units of eps limited the efficiency of aops based sludge treatment it may still remain a challenge for aops to selectively remove hydrophilic groups of eps thus more attention can be paid to some novel biotechnologies e g proteolytic targeting chimera for the targeted lysis of water holding components in was and the selective removal of free amino group nh2 instead of all the hydrophilic functional group could be sufficient for the hydrophobic modification needed by sludge dewaterability improvement moreover the inconsistency of pca interpretive degrees for f d and shi reflected that the water holding capacity of eps matrix was not only controlled by the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of eps macromolecules but also the aggregation state of eps matrix accordingly the joint application of aops and coagulation flocculation should be a promising way for highly efficient sludge dewaterability improvement credit authorship contribution statement dr boran wu set up the core ideas analyzed the
