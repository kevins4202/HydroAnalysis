960,the indus ganga brahmaputra river basin igbrb is a trans boundary river basin flowing through four major countries in south asia viz india pakistan bangladesh and nepal contamination of surface water by untreated or inadequately treated wastewater has been a huge problem for pathogenic microorganisms in economies in transition recent studies have reported that sewage surveillance can provide prior information of the outbreak data because faeces can contain the novel coronavirus sars cov 2 shed by infected humans hence in this study we geo spatially mapped the covid 19 hotspots during the peak time in the first and second wave of pandemic to demonstrate the need and usefulness of wastewater surveillance strategy in igbrb during ongoing pandemic further we discussed the status of sanitation health and hand hygiene in the igbrb along with characterization of the challenges posed by the pandemic in achieving the united nations sustainable development goals un sdgs monthly geographical information system gis mapping of covid 19 hotspots in the igbrb showed an increase in the spread along the direct sewage discharge points the social inequalities expose the vulnerabilities of the urban poor in terms of the burden risks and access to water sanitation and hygiene wash needs such an evidence based image of the actual sars cov 2 viral load in the community along the igbrb can provide valuable insights and recommendations to deal with the future waves of covid 19 pandemic in this region that can go a long way in achieving the un sdgs keywords indus ganga brahmaputra river basin sars cov 2 sustainable development goals sanitation health and hygiene 1 introduction southeast asia is in the midst of a resurgence of coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 with alarming outbreaks now consuming serious attention in the region the first and second waves of the pandemic caused drastic reduction in the availability and use of essential public health services in south asia moreover lesser degree of vaccination in south asia can further magnify the likelihood of the virus spiralling in the economies in transition urgent action and steadfast leadership are needed to combat this catastrophe as of may 12 2021 a total of 1 264 164 553 vaccine doses have been administered who 2021 the disease induced by this novel virus has been impacting global ongoing efforts towards achieving united nations sustainable development goals un sdgs atmospheric transmission via aerosol is reported to be the predominant pathway of the sars cov 2 spread van doremalen et al 2020 however latest studies confirmed that sars cov 2 is excreted in faeces stool of infected individuals the presence of sars cov 2 in the stool of infected people was reported worldwide e g in the usa australia france netherlands china gao et al 2020 holshue et al 2020 kitajima et al 2020 wu et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 studies indicate that 48 cheung et al 2020 to 53 xiao et al 2020 of the infected individuals were tested positive for sars cov 2 rna in stool about 23 of patients continued to show positive results in stool samples despite showing negative results in their respiratory samples xiao et al 2020 and only 18 exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms cheung et al 2020 post negative respiratory swabs the duration for viral shedding in faeces were observed to range from 7 days chen et al 2020 to 10 cheung et al 2020 20 days xing et al 2020 up to 33 days wu et al 2020 other researchers demonstrated 18 31 asymptomatic infection of covid 19 mizumoto et al 2020 nishiura et al 2020 treibel et al 2020 the rising circulation of sars cov 2 in communities increases the viral load in the sewer systems and thus increases the viral concentration in sewer water subsequently the potential transmission of sars cov 2 by faecal oral route has gained attention of scientists gormley et al 2020 yuen et al 2020 mostly from the perspective of the possibility for application of wastewater based epidemiology wbe approach for monitoring of the spread of covid 19 among the population wbe is an effective way to provide inexpensive real time and large scale monitoring of community wastewater to understand the infectious disease and resistance spread and to examine the emergence of new disease outbreak at the community level sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 in term of sars cov 2 several research groups have reported detection of this novel coronavirus in wastewater in the usa australia japan france italy spain and the netherlands ahmed et al 2020 haramoto et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 wu et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 the pattern of covid 19 outbreak in paris france was reflected in the sewage samples collected in the region wurtzer et al 2020 in spain in the region of murcia the presence of sars cov 2 in the wastewater was observed before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities highlighting the relevance of wbe as an early warning indicator of the circulation of sars cov 2 within the served population randazzo et al 2020 in southern india the first surveillance of sars cov 2 and organic tracers ots in community wastewater was conducted during partial and post lockdown phases august september 2020 in chennai city tamil nadu chakraborty et al 2021a in this context it may be underlined that wbe approach is especially important in developing countries of south asia wherein passive forms of surveillance have disadvantages that led to underestimation of real risks related to the pandemic one of such vulnerable regions is the indus ganga brahmaputra river basin igbrb wherein about 300 million people live about 60 and 48 2 of the people have no access to improved sanitation in the ganga brahmaputra and indus river basins respectively unep 2008 release of wastewater from treatment plants and other discharge points directly into the riverine environment occur in the entire stretch of river ganga chakraborty et al 2021b in addition this region is subjected to significant fluctuations in the amount of water due to cyclic monsoons consequently the annual floods of igbrb delta can collect sars cov 2 from untreated sewage outlets and could spread them to larger areas hence it is especially important to track the spread of sars cov 2 during monsoonal shower through logged water uncontrolled flow through sewer outlets and wastewater discharge points particularly along the riverine catchment and in the slums or congested areas of the urban and peri urban regions in the igbrb in view of the above and owing to the importance of detecting sars cov 2 not only in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients but also in the municipal wastewater the aim of our study was to map the covid 19 hotspots in the igbrb in relation to the sewer outlets and wastewater discharge points as well as to chart an overall wastewater management strategy in igbrb countries based on our knowledge and available literature this is the first report oriented towards the distribution of the novel coronavirus sars cov 2 in the igbrb in relation to wastewater discharge hotspots as either the potential source of the spread of epidemic or a useful tool to monitor and manage the epidemic propagation our objective is not to focus only on sars cov 2 but to make a good basis for future pandemic proofing of this area due to inadequate monitoring and management of wastewater 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the igbrb is a densely populated trans boundary river basin in south asia the igbrb map is presented in figure 1 with locations of various sewage treatment plants stps and wastewater treatment plants wwtps along the entire basin the igbrb covers an area of 1 12 million km2 supporting 300 million people in pakistan 47 india 39 china 8 and afghanistan 6 the brahmaputra river basin consists of the rivers ganga and brahmaputra and flows through parts of india tibet bhutan nepal and bangladesh the ganga forms the world s largest river delta and is known for its unique biodiversity and highest population density the river ganga bifurcates into two branches the eastern branch flowing through bangladesh as river padma and the western branch flowing through the state of west bengal in india as the bhagirathi regarding wastewater management approaches in india there are 193 common effluent treatment plants cetps and 920 stps discharge of untreated sewage into rivers is a major pollution source because out of 38000 million litres daily mld of sewage only about 12000 mld is treated indicating a big gap between wastewater generation and treatment capacity envis 2019 in nepal the kathmandu valley has five wwtps an activated sludge plant at guheshwori the only functional one non aerated lagoons at kodku and dhobighat and aerated lagoons at sallaghari and hanumanghat adb 2021 green et al 2003 in an ongoing project funded by the asian development bank the wastewater network and treatment facilities in the populous kathmandu valley are being modernized the sewerage network is being rehabilitated and the wastewater management institutions are being strengthened also the capacity of five wwtps is being expanded from around 16 mld to 90 5 mld adb 2021 decentralized wastewater treatment systems like constructed wetlands are also used to treat wastewater in nepal jha and bajracharya 2014 in pakistan eight wwtps primary cater to 388 cities out of which three are in islamabad one is functional karachi has two trickling filters for screening and sedimentation lahore has screening and grit removal systems but not functional and faisalabad has one wwtp primary wastewater treatment is absent in rural pakistan leading to surface water and groundwater pollution murtaza and zia 2012 in bangladesh the capital city of dhaka has only one wwtp with 120 000 m3 day capacity covering 30 of households while the rest use their own septic tanks sharmin 2016 faridpur has one faecal sludge treatment plant which was commissioned in 2017 jahan 2019 2 2 geo spatial mapping the spatial distribution maps of wastewater discharge points wwtps and stps were prepared in gis platform using arcgis software version 10 5 the tabular data on the wastewater discharge points wwtps and stps was converted to a shape file the major rivers of the igbrb were delineated using arc hydro tool of arcgis software the spatial pattern of population of the study area has been mapped with the latest data for the year 2020 the source of data for mapping was taken from the global high resolution population denominators project funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation the resolution of data was 3 arc seconds 90m the projection was geographic coordinate system wgs84 the units were number of people per pixel the mapping approach was random forest based dasymetric redistribution worldpop 2018 lloyd et al 2019 the base map was prepared using esri world imagery the covid 19 hotspots areas have been mapped geospatially for the months of march april may june july august 2020 and april 2021 the coordinates for covid 19 hotspots in india region as of april 2021 is given in supporting information si table s1 2 3 data sources information statistics specific evidences taken from various web based sources apart from scientific articles is given in table s2 summary of water quality parameters in inlet and outlet of stps in covid 19 hotspots regions are given in table s3 s12 2 4 spatial autocorrelation spatial autocorrelation was applied to assess the spatial correlation between variables through matching location similarity and attribute similarity huo et al 2012 global moran s i an index of spatial autocorrelation based on cross products is mathematically expressed as follows i i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x x j x i 1 n x i x where n is the number of regions xi the attribute value at area i x the mean value of the attribute in the study region and wij elements of a spatial lag operator w spatial weights of matrix w the significance of the index is usually tested in a situation of normal distribution mazzulla et al 2012 global moran s i varies between 1 and 1 with a positive value meaning that a point in question is prone to be clustered by adjacent points while a negative value means the opposite values close to 0 indicate that the data are randomly distributed 4 results discussion 3 1 sars cov 2 in wastewater the extended time of incubation and shedding of sars cov 2 from asymptomatic individuals have been observed to be the two main influential parameters for the pandemic spread based on the computer simulation of wastewater from wuhan china milan italy madrid spain tehran iran and the us cities such as new york seattle detroit tempe and new orleans hart and halden 2020 revealed that depending on local conditions one symptomatic asymptomatic infected individual can be detected per 100 to 2 000 000 non infected persons based on the obtained results the authors identified wbe as a potential tool for assessing and managing the novel coronavirus pandemic which needs to be followed by clinical testing they predicted that to monitor approximately 30 of the world s population in terms of coronavirus spread wastewater from 105 600 stps need to be tested unlike sars cov 2 most infectious viruses are transmitted through waterborne routes studies indicate that the waterborne route of infection is relevant for hepatitis e virus hev a positive sense and single stranded rna virus that cause infection in pregnant women and in children with high mortality the hev was detected in untreated wastewater and river water kamar et al 2014 molecular analysis also revealed the prevalence of enterovirus and hepatitis a virus in sewage polluted river water and in drinking water of the three main cities of pakistan lahore islamabad and rawalpindi ahmad et al 2018 another example of water transmitted virus is norovirus a causal agent of several outbreaks in many countries tryfinopoulou et al 2019 hellmér et al 2014 wastewater samples obtained 2 to 3 weeks prior to the actual human infection showed an increased amount of norovirus gii genogroup ii two surrogate coronaviruses transmissible gastroenteritis tgev and mouse hepatitis mhv were found to remain infectious for days to weeks in water and pasteurized settled sewage gundy et al 2008 casanova et al 2009 during the first wave of covid 19 pandemic a study by wurtzer et al 2020 demonstrated the presence of sars cov 2 in the wastewater of paris the authors demonstrated the time course of viral load in wastewater with an average 2 log increase of genome units that was reflected in the peak in the number of new cases in western india presence of three genes specific for sars cov 2 orf1ab nucleocapsid n and spike s have been reported during the earlier phase after the outbreak of pandemic in the wastewater from wwtp of ahmedabad city gujarat kumar et al 2020 the number of gene copies increased ten fold between 8 and 27 may 2020 i e 0 78 102 copies l 1 and 8 05 10 copies l 1 respectively which corresponded to more than the doubling in the number of active covid 19 cases in ahmedabad city i e 4912 and 10674 individuals on 8 and 27 may respectively number of gene copies in this study were found comparable to that reported in the untreated wastewaters of australia china and turkey and lower than that of the usa france and spain a similar study was conducted in hospital wastewater samples as well as from wwtps of jaipur rajasthan which has been a pandemic hotspot red zone since april 2020 arora et al 2020 in this study authors further reported that the presence of sars cov 2 viral genome correlated with the increased number of reported covid 19 positive patients this study reported the presence of sars cov 2 viral genome in wastewater at higher ambient temperature of above 40 c in southern india the first surveillance of sars cov 2 and organic tracers ots in community wastewater showed that caffeine can act as a potential indicator for removal of sars cov 2 in stps and as an effective marker to understand the efficacy of the stps chakraborty et al 2021a untreated sewage containing sars cov 2 excreted from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals can end up in a catchment sinclair et al 2008 xagoraraki and o brien 2020 in pakistan about 27 of wastewater samples collected from the drainage of covid 19 patient quarantine centre in 13 districts showed the presence of sars cov 2 by rt pcr sharif 2020 similarly sequencing data revealed the presence of partial orf 1a of sars cov 2 in the same wastewater from the above mentioned covid 19 quarantine centres sharif 2020 infected individuals may continue to shed sars cov 2 through the faecal matter hindson 2020 with this in mind the informations associated with wastewater direct discharge points or sewage outlets need to be observed and studied in the wider perspective 3 2 covid 19 pandemic vs wastewater management in the igbrb in the igbrb countries india nepal pakistan and bangladesh there are 27354433 people with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and 315732 deaths as on date 18 may 2021 with the most in india followed by pakistan bangladesh and nepal as of may 2021 a total of 190 742 964 vaccine doses have been administered in the four igbrb countries india has administered the highest number of vaccine doses followed by bangladesh pakistan and nepal who 2021 in terms of testing india conducted the maximum number of viral detection tests in the igbrb followed by pakistan bangladesh and nepal the number of people who were tested positive or the positive rate is a very important metric for understanding the pandemic in the igbrb region as of may 2021 the highest positive rate was found in nepal 44 followed by india 19 bangladesh 8 7 and pakistan 7 5 however in a country as vast and densely populated as india many infected people have been reported to go undetected reports suggest that the actual numbers may be much higher due to inadequate testing or vaccination and many unreported cases in the countries in the igbrb region a large number of sars cov 2 patients are asymptomatic with no symptoms and oligosymptomatic with few minor symptoms most of whom are not clinically tested and hence contribute to an inaccurate estimation of the disease burden of covid 19 bhattacharya et al 2021 jahan et al 2020 additionally the wastewater treatment capacity of these four countries are also very dismal with 8 in pakistan murtaza and zia 2012 5 in nepal 17 in bangladesh and 33 in india moreover open defecation contributes to water pollution along the river banks in the igbrb region due to which the situation worsens during monsoons at the same time settlements along the igbrb extensively use the river water as the freshwater source for various purposes like irrigation consumption and other domestic needs mostly without any prior treatment consequently wastewater monitoring to track the spread of sars cov 2 through logged water and uncontrolled flow through sewer outlets and wastewater discharge points along the riverine catchment including slum areas of igbrb is at the same time an opportunity and a big challenge wastewater surveillance not just facilitates the early prevention of the viral spread but can also help to identify areas where current vaccination efforts are inadequate there are several barriers to covid 19 vaccination at present wastewater surveillance may reveal the anthropogeography of unvaccinated communities and help in informed decision making in terms of facilitating interventions like enhancing public awareness generating resources or creating convenient vaccination access points this can speed up the process of achieving mass vaccination goals to attain herd immunity the surveillance study of sars cov 2 of community wastewater in chennai chakraborty et al 2021a offered some interesting insights on the importance of wastewater monitoring the predicted estimated number of covid 19 cases from the study was found to be in line with the available clinical data from the catchments for instance during post lockdown phase the estimated number of infected persons found for a given catchment was in line with the number of actual active covid 19 cases further the study highlighted that the number of infected persons were higher in the densely populated regions especially where sanitation conditions were poor such studies have indicated that wastewater monitoring is an effective tool to monitor and manage the spread of pandemic such wastewater surveillance initiatives can go a long way in controlling the pandemic in the vast and densely populated igbrb region 3 3 geo spatial mapping of pandemic hotspots in the igbrb genetic material can be detected in both viable infectious and non viable or inactivated killed viruses so its detection does not mean the individual is necessarily infected or that the faeces are infectious although sars cov 2 genetic material has been detected in untreated wastewater ahmed et al 2020 medema et al 2020 wu et al 2020 there are no reports of the detection or persistence of viable infectious sars cov 2 in the treated wastewater the covid 19 hotspots areas in the igbrb have been mapped geospatially from march to august 2020 during the first wave and april 2021 after the hit of the second wave of the pandemic figure 2 monthly mapping of covid 19 hotspots in the igbrb showed maximum spread in the highly populated regions from june 2020 onwards with the maximum spread in august 2020 after the post lockdown during the first wave figure 2 mainly along the indus and ganga river basins in the indus river basin pakistan the number of covid 19 cases had spiked in june 2020 followed by the flattening of the curve in august september 2020 and then spiked again in april 2021 figure 3 shows the increasing number of covid 19 hotspots in the igbrb during 2021 after the hit of second wave of pandemic the incidence of covid 19 in the 216 administrative regions around the basin is illustrated in figure 4 depicting the situation as on 30th april 2021 table s13 in the ganga river basin india the number of covid 19 cases spiked dramatically in september 2020 and again during the gigantic second wave during april may 2021 during the second wave about 216 districts geospatially spread around the basin has been severely affected overall there is an exponential growth of covid 19 cases in hotspot regions during lockdown post lockdown phases and beyond from march 2020 to august 2020 in the igbrb figure s1 figure s2 shows the stps located in the covid 19 hotspot regions along the ganga river the spatial correlations of covid 19 epidemics between the 216 administrative regions for covid 19 according to global moran s i calculations is given in figure s3 moran s i and the z score were 0 08353 p 0 00002 0 05 4 229312 respectively indicating that the pattern expressed is randomly distributed indus river basin the indus river system and its tributaries the jhelum the chenab the ravi the sutlej the beas and the kabul rivers act as the main source of freshwater for the population of pakistan sohail et al 2014 local areas along the indus river bank are facing water challenges due to poor sanitation system in slum areas almost everyone is dependent on public toilets which are poorly maintained only a few cities along the river bank have treatment plants but these treatment plants are inappropriately located and receive little or no sewage indiscriminate discharges of wastewater from seven identified discharge points himmat kokaar thoyal faazal shami road army camp ghafar tee and darya khan have been observed to pose a major challenge the sewage drains at shami road are considered as major point sources of pollution in d i khan southern region of khyber pakhtunkhwa pakistan southeast of the indus river muddy water accumulates in agricultural fields there are 22 wastewater discharge locations along the banks of river indus a total of 20 districts of pakistan which belong to the hotspot zone lies at par with these wastewater discharge locations figure 1 ganga river basin according to an assessment by the central pollution control board the main source of pollution in river ganga is untreated domestic sewage contributing to approximately three fourth of discharged wastewater followed by industrial effluents furthermore along the main stem of the river there are 30 million toilets with tanks of mostly inadequate faecal sludge disposal and management systems there are 32 stps along the banks of river ganga figure s2 the ganga river basin generates around 12 000 mld of sewage with a treatment capacity of 4 000 mld in india cities and towns are divided based on population densities class i cities have the highest population density including all the metropolitan cities followed by class ii or developing cities with a rapid growth rate in industrial and allied sectors a total of 36 class i cities and 14 class ii cities discharge their wastewater directly into river ganga 113 class i cities and 18 class ii cities discharge the wastewater into its tributaries while 30 class i cities and 115 class ii cities have land disposal the 179 class i and 147 class ii cities generate about 11000 mld and 1000 mld of wastewater respectively nmcg 2020 a rapid growth of covid 19 cases was observed in hotspot regions from march to august 2020 as illustrated in figure 2 about 75 of the covid 19 hotspot regions are on the river bank there are 138 drains discharging 6087 mld of wastewater into river ganga with 14 drains in uttarakhand 440 mld 45 drains in uttar pradesh 3289 mld 25 drains in bihar 579 mld and 54 in west bengal 1779 mld discharging industrial and domestic wastewater directly or indirectly to the river in most cases in absence of sewerage systems drains are turned into open sewers to carry storm water and sewage into the ganga river basin about 50 of the covid 19 cases in the hotspots are reported from the embankment of river ganga haridwar district has 122 slums out of which 23 are from roorkee it was noticed that the slum regions of roorkee remained under the hotspot category throughout the pandemic months times of india toi 2019 reported that despite haridwar being declared as an open defecation free district the slum colonies near har ki pauri defecate in the open along the banks of river ganga this area also was among the covid 19 hotspots during march to may 2020 figure 2a 2c a slum located on the riverbed of rispana in dehradun falls in the covid 19 hotspot region rajapurwaslum of kanpur district located along the bank of ganga also belongs to vulnerable zone as far as covid 19 is concerned slum areas of rajendra nagar area ramakrishna nagar kankarbagh boring road nala road gandhi maidan are among the covid 19 hotspots locales of patna district during march to august 2020 in west bengal the main source of pollution of river ganga is from four districts hooghly howrah north 24 parganas and kolkata several non functional stps have been previously identified in these districts and were responsible for the release of various organic micropollutants into the river chakraborty et al 2019 the north 24 parganas district has emerged as a covid 19 hotspot recording a greater number of deaths around 10 stps are spatially distributed in north 24 parganas district in hooghly district death toll was high and it remains a vulnerable region a particular slum in howrah district has accounted for numerous covid 19 cases and the area has been marked as a covid 19 risk zone the slum areas are highly vulnerable to covid 19 the open defecation free report by national family health survey nfhs 2015 revealed that the sanitation facilities were not up to the mark in the cities along the bank of river ganga in the states of uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal according to a recent report by the central pollution control board cpcb 2020 there has been no improvement in water quality of river ganga during the lockdown period the water quality showed reduced compliance to the criteria limits from 64 6 to 46 2 which may be attributed to factors such as discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage higher concentrations of pollutants due to negligible dry season flow and lack of freshwater discharges from upstream brahmaputra river basin the key environmental issues of river brahmaputra in assam india are oil pollution lack of stps and disposal of waste directly into the river the town of dibrugarh assam india generates about 75 to 80 metric tons of garbage every day much of which ends up into the river during monsoon garbage flows into river brahmaputra india has planned to dredge the brahmaputra to prevent high flows from inundating its banks which result in floods with an estimated population of about 1 7 million guwahati the biggest city of assam is one of the smart cities under the indian government s smart cities mission neither has sewerage network of pipelines to carry sewage nor any municipal stp to treat the wastewater about 39 drains empty into bahini bharalu river of which 17 are major drains the sewage generation is expected to increase to around 280 mld by 2025 presently there is no sewerage system in guwahati city untreated or semi treated sewage is disposed of into the storm water drains which again ends up into river brahmaputra there are eight wwtps along the border line of river brahmaputra all the covid 19 hotspots in this region surround these wwtps although no death case has been reported in the region the number of confirmed cases stands high in dhubri district located along the bank of brahmaputra kamrup metro district in assam is witnessing an alarming spike in covid 19 spread with the highest death toll in assam being reported from this district the area remained to be a covid 19 hotspot zone all throughout the months of march to july 2020 figure 2a e according to the cpcb an overall improvement in water quality was observed in brahmaputra river basin during lockdown period for the criteria parameters do bod and fc and it showed 100 compliance for all monitored locations for outdoor bathing criteria parameters cpcb 2020 3 4 sanitation health and hygiene in the igbrb in light of the covid 19 pandemic globally around 2 2 billion people lack safe drinking water 4 2 billion people live without access to adequate sanitation and 3 billion people lack basic handwashing facilities at home according the joint monitoring programme jmp report jmp 2019 the practice of frequent hand washing has been suggested for breaking human transmissibility of sars cov 2 however a large number of people out of the 3 billion lacking handwashing facilities live in south asia and sub saharan africa whose population together accounts for 85 of the world s poor wsscc 2020 nearly 40 households 50 schools 900 million children and 40 healthcare facilities worldwide do not have access to soap and water which are the basic hand hygiene services needed during the covid 19 crisis jmp 2019 according to the world health organization and united nations children s fund who unicef joint monitoring programme for water supply sanitation and hygiene jmp in 2020 the national population with basic hygiene facilities with availability of handwashing facility with soap and water at home in igbrb countries were 68 in india 60 urban and 82 rural 62 in nepal 59 urban and 75 rural 58 in bangladesh 54 urban and 66 rural and 80 in pakistan 74 urban and 90 rural between 2015 and 2020 the proportion of the global population with basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home increased from 67 to 71 however in 2020 2 3 billion people still lacked basic hygiene and 670 million lacked any form of handwashing facility jmp 2021 the hygiene scenario in the four igbrb countries bangladesh india nepal and pakistan in terms of availability and access to handwashing facilities have been presented in figure s4 the risks posed to those living in urban slums is higher compared to others considering their workplace exposure lack of access to running water for handwashing inability to maintain social distancing and isolation while living in crammed habitations such social inequalities expose the vulnerabilities of the urban poor in terms of the burden risks and access to water sanitation and hygiene wash needs figure s5 as expected the richest quintile of population has better access to drinking water sanitation and hygiene however the inequity in access to drinking water between the richest and the poorest is lesser compared to sanitation and hygiene there have been no reports yet of faeco oral transmission of the sars cov 2 who 2020 it could however remain infectious in water contaminated with faeces for days to weeks safely managed wash services are also critical during the recovery phase of a disease outbreak to mitigate secondary impacts on community health livelihood and wellbeing the covid 19 situation in the igbrb countries ecdc 2020 is depicted in figures s6 and s7 in pakistan the highest number of deaths was reported in the month of june 2020 the month of august 2020 recorded the highest death toll as far as india is concerned a total of 96 351 deaths have been reported during mid last year in india 6482 in pakistan 481 in nepal and 5193 in bangladesh however there is a need to use the data with caution due to different inclusion criteria and variability in underestimation and delays by various organizations covid 19 pandemic reiterates the need for improvement of wash infrastructure in the low economic settlements in the densely populated south asian countries 5 challenges for the un sdgs for the covid 19 pandemic in the igbrb the water sanitation health nexus the united nations sustainable development goals have been introduced to call for action by all countries poor rich and middle income to promote prosperity while protecting the planet the sdgs through addressing the global challenges constitute a proposal to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all before 2030 at the same time the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic has posed a significant threat to the healthy lives and well being of billions of people worldwide especially in highly vulnerable developing countries ahmed et al 2020 sumner et al 2020 from the perspective of water sanitation health nexus the current covid 19 pandemic in the igbrb influences mostly the following sdgs goal 3 good health and well being goal 6 clean water and sanitation goal 10 reduced inequalities goal 11 sustainable cities and communities the progress of goal 3 good health and well being has been hindered by covid 19 as it poses a global health risk and has shown the critical need for preparedness in the face of covid 19 pandemic the developing countries such as those located in the igbrb struggle with far greater problems than developed countries during pandemic the limited availability of medical services in the igbrb countries seriously affects the health of citizens and may lead to significant delay in achieving the sdg 3 in that area therefore the wastewater surveillance for early detection of sars cov 2 and maintenance of wash infrastructure especially mobile hand washing and sanitation facilities as provided by some governments of igbrb during the current pandemic are crucial to achieve and maintain good health and well being for the people of the region the importance of sanitation hygiene and adequate access to clean water goal 6 clean water sanitation is crucial in fighting with diseases including covid 19 pandemic who indicates handwashing as one of the most effective actions to reduce the spread of pathogens and viruses including the sars cov 2 virus and in this way minimize spread of the disease at the same time worldwide one in three people do not have access to safe drinking water two out of five people do not have a basic hand washing facility with soap and water united nations 2020 in the igbrb the wastewater treatment capacity ranged from 5 in nepal to 33 in india only about 50 and 40 of people in the indus and ganga brahmapura meghna basins respectively have access to improved sanitation facilities unep 2008 indicating the need for further investments but also demonstrating the risk for development and spread of diseases including covid 19 among people living there the implementation of wastewater monitoring could provide a decision platform for countries to adjust their wash services to prevent the spread of sars cov 2 this would include continued support to affected high risk and vulnerable communities to secure wash services and infection control the results of wastewater surveillance can help governments in mobilizing resources and implementing innovative and context appropriate solutions to take timely decisions such wastewater surveillance efforts would not only control the spread of sars cov 2 but will prevent other true waterborne pathogens including bacteria and viruses causing severe gastrointestinal diseases e g shigella salmonella vibrio norovirus also achieving the sdg goal 10 reduced inequalities has been seriously hindered by the covid 19 as far as inequality within and among countries is a persistent cause for concern for the un the covid 19 has deepened existing inequalities hitting the poorest and most vulnerable communities the hardest sars cov 2 does not discriminate but its impacts have exposed deep weaknesses in the delivery of public services and structural inequalities that impede access to them united nations 2020 thus deepening the economic and societal inequities among 300 million people living in the igbrb inhabitants will constitute another challenge for sustainable development in the post pandemic world in term of goal 11 sustainable cities and communities it may be underlined that by 2030 about 60 of the global population will live in the cities and 95 of urban expansion will take place in developing countries such rapid urbanization results in a growing number of slum inhabitants inadequate and overburdened infrastructure and services including waste collection and water and sewage systems the effects of covid 19 are most devastating in poor and densely populated urban areas especially for the 883 million people that live in slums today most of them are found in eastern and south eastern asia where overpopulation hampers not only social distancing and self isolation but also reduced the access to clean water and sanitation endangering public health united nations 2020 it needs to be highlighted that the actual impacts of covid 19 on sdg achievement will be known in the future however as some countries are moving towards recovery coherent actions can put them on a strong trajectory towards achieving many of these sdgs in july 2020 in order to continue achieving the targets of sdgs in the time of covid 19 pandemic the united nations developed the sdg 6 global acceleration framework outlining a better coordinated support to countries to ensure global sustainable management of water and sanitation for all building upon this insight the strategic idea suggested in the following section can contribute during the response and recovery and set a course for achieving the sdgs 6 urgent need for wastewater surveillance the spread of sars cov 2 in highly populated countries in south asia can be curbed only through continuous surveillance to arrest hotspots wbe can be very effective tool in arresting the further waves of the pandemic by way of detecting the coronavirus in sewage long before manifestations of reinfection are witnessed in the community identification of potential chemical and biological markers present in faeces and urine of infected individuals that are released in the wastewater could provide an efficient and prompt way to predict the efficacy of stps in removal of sars cov 2 at this point wastewater treatment using various approaches are analysed and optimized but chlorination ultraviolet uv radiation light and ozone treatment of water are the most promising ones the increasing number of covid 19 cases during the post lockdown phase emphasizes the fact that there is a need to understand the situation in a catchment to prevent other waves of pandemic wbe is a cost effective tool to manage the spread of coronavirus pandemic although we are still not close to finding a fast remedy for covid 19 it can be pragmatic to make a significant contribution which will offer key benefits in areas of critical importance for people and the environment by establishing a system for monitoring of sars cov 2 in the sewage and wastewater treatment plants or discharge points in the indus ganga brahmaputra river basin we will get closer towards the path of fulfilling sdgs this could be of tremendous importance for south asia as it may lead to positive impacts on the water sanitation health nexus further the results of the study are applicable to monitor the spread of other pathogenic microorganisms including antibiotic resistant bacteria and related diseases and epidemics that may be a potential threat to human health in the future declaration of competing interest the

960,the indus ganga brahmaputra river basin igbrb is a trans boundary river basin flowing through four major countries in south asia viz india pakistan bangladesh and nepal contamination of surface water by untreated or inadequately treated wastewater has been a huge problem for pathogenic microorganisms in economies in transition recent studies have reported that sewage surveillance can provide prior information of the outbreak data because faeces can contain the novel coronavirus sars cov 2 shed by infected humans hence in this study we geo spatially mapped the covid 19 hotspots during the peak time in the first and second wave of pandemic to demonstrate the need and usefulness of wastewater surveillance strategy in igbrb during ongoing pandemic further we discussed the status of sanitation health and hand hygiene in the igbrb along with characterization of the challenges posed by the pandemic in achieving the united nations sustainable development goals un sdgs monthly geographical information system gis mapping of covid 19 hotspots in the igbrb showed an increase in the spread along the direct sewage discharge points the social inequalities expose the vulnerabilities of the urban poor in terms of the burden risks and access to water sanitation and hygiene wash needs such an evidence based image of the actual sars cov 2 viral load in the community along the igbrb can provide valuable insights and recommendations to deal with the future waves of covid 19 pandemic in this region that can go a long way in achieving the un sdgs keywords indus ganga brahmaputra river basin sars cov 2 sustainable development goals sanitation health and hygiene 1 introduction southeast asia is in the midst of a resurgence of coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 with alarming outbreaks now consuming serious attention in the region the first and second waves of the pandemic caused drastic reduction in the availability and use of essential public health services in south asia moreover lesser degree of vaccination in south asia can further magnify the likelihood of the virus spiralling in the economies in transition urgent action and steadfast leadership are needed to combat this catastrophe as of may 12 2021 a total of 1 264 164 553 vaccine doses have been administered who 2021 the disease induced by this novel virus has been impacting global ongoing efforts towards achieving united nations sustainable development goals un sdgs atmospheric transmission via aerosol is reported to be the predominant pathway of the sars cov 2 spread van doremalen et al 2020 however latest studies confirmed that sars cov 2 is excreted in faeces stool of infected individuals the presence of sars cov 2 in the stool of infected people was reported worldwide e g in the usa australia france netherlands china gao et al 2020 holshue et al 2020 kitajima et al 2020 wu et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 studies indicate that 48 cheung et al 2020 to 53 xiao et al 2020 of the infected individuals were tested positive for sars cov 2 rna in stool about 23 of patients continued to show positive results in stool samples despite showing negative results in their respiratory samples xiao et al 2020 and only 18 exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms cheung et al 2020 post negative respiratory swabs the duration for viral shedding in faeces were observed to range from 7 days chen et al 2020 to 10 cheung et al 2020 20 days xing et al 2020 up to 33 days wu et al 2020 other researchers demonstrated 18 31 asymptomatic infection of covid 19 mizumoto et al 2020 nishiura et al 2020 treibel et al 2020 the rising circulation of sars cov 2 in communities increases the viral load in the sewer systems and thus increases the viral concentration in sewer water subsequently the potential transmission of sars cov 2 by faecal oral route has gained attention of scientists gormley et al 2020 yuen et al 2020 mostly from the perspective of the possibility for application of wastewater based epidemiology wbe approach for monitoring of the spread of covid 19 among the population wbe is an effective way to provide inexpensive real time and large scale monitoring of community wastewater to understand the infectious disease and resistance spread and to examine the emergence of new disease outbreak at the community level sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 in term of sars cov 2 several research groups have reported detection of this novel coronavirus in wastewater in the usa australia japan france italy spain and the netherlands ahmed et al 2020 haramoto et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 wu et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 the pattern of covid 19 outbreak in paris france was reflected in the sewage samples collected in the region wurtzer et al 2020 in spain in the region of murcia the presence of sars cov 2 in the wastewater was observed before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities highlighting the relevance of wbe as an early warning indicator of the circulation of sars cov 2 within the served population randazzo et al 2020 in southern india the first surveillance of sars cov 2 and organic tracers ots in community wastewater was conducted during partial and post lockdown phases august september 2020 in chennai city tamil nadu chakraborty et al 2021a in this context it may be underlined that wbe approach is especially important in developing countries of south asia wherein passive forms of surveillance have disadvantages that led to underestimation of real risks related to the pandemic one of such vulnerable regions is the indus ganga brahmaputra river basin igbrb wherein about 300 million people live about 60 and 48 2 of the people have no access to improved sanitation in the ganga brahmaputra and indus river basins respectively unep 2008 release of wastewater from treatment plants and other discharge points directly into the riverine environment occur in the entire stretch of river ganga chakraborty et al 2021b in addition this region is subjected to significant fluctuations in the amount of water due to cyclic monsoons consequently the annual floods of igbrb delta can collect sars cov 2 from untreated sewage outlets and could spread them to larger areas hence it is especially important to track the spread of sars cov 2 during monsoonal shower through logged water uncontrolled flow through sewer outlets and wastewater discharge points particularly along the riverine catchment and in the slums or congested areas of the urban and peri urban regions in the igbrb in view of the above and owing to the importance of detecting sars cov 2 not only in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients but also in the municipal wastewater the aim of our study was to map the covid 19 hotspots in the igbrb in relation to the sewer outlets and wastewater discharge points as well as to chart an overall wastewater management strategy in igbrb countries based on our knowledge and available literature this is the first report oriented towards the distribution of the novel coronavirus sars cov 2 in the igbrb in relation to wastewater discharge hotspots as either the potential source of the spread of epidemic or a useful tool to monitor and manage the epidemic propagation our objective is not to focus only on sars cov 2 but to make a good basis for future pandemic proofing of this area due to inadequate monitoring and management of wastewater 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the igbrb is a densely populated trans boundary river basin in south asia the igbrb map is presented in figure 1 with locations of various sewage treatment plants stps and wastewater treatment plants wwtps along the entire basin the igbrb covers an area of 1 12 million km2 supporting 300 million people in pakistan 47 india 39 china 8 and afghanistan 6 the brahmaputra river basin consists of the rivers ganga and brahmaputra and flows through parts of india tibet bhutan nepal and bangladesh the ganga forms the world s largest river delta and is known for its unique biodiversity and highest population density the river ganga bifurcates into two branches the eastern branch flowing through bangladesh as river padma and the western branch flowing through the state of west bengal in india as the bhagirathi regarding wastewater management approaches in india there are 193 common effluent treatment plants cetps and 920 stps discharge of untreated sewage into rivers is a major pollution source because out of 38000 million litres daily mld of sewage only about 12000 mld is treated indicating a big gap between wastewater generation and treatment capacity envis 2019 in nepal the kathmandu valley has five wwtps an activated sludge plant at guheshwori the only functional one non aerated lagoons at kodku and dhobighat and aerated lagoons at sallaghari and hanumanghat adb 2021 green et al 2003 in an ongoing project funded by the asian development bank the wastewater network and treatment facilities in the populous kathmandu valley are being modernized the sewerage network is being rehabilitated and the wastewater management institutions are being strengthened also the capacity of five wwtps is being expanded from around 16 mld to 90 5 mld adb 2021 decentralized wastewater treatment systems like constructed wetlands are also used to treat wastewater in nepal jha and bajracharya 2014 in pakistan eight wwtps primary cater to 388 cities out of which three are in islamabad one is functional karachi has two trickling filters for screening and sedimentation lahore has screening and grit removal systems but not functional and faisalabad has one wwtp primary wastewater treatment is absent in rural pakistan leading to surface water and groundwater pollution murtaza and zia 2012 in bangladesh the capital city of dhaka has only one wwtp with 120 000 m3 day capacity covering 30 of households while the rest use their own septic tanks sharmin 2016 faridpur has one faecal sludge treatment plant which was commissioned in 2017 jahan 2019 2 2 geo spatial mapping the spatial distribution maps of wastewater discharge points wwtps and stps were prepared in gis platform using arcgis software version 10 5 the tabular data on the wastewater discharge points wwtps and stps was converted to a shape file the major rivers of the igbrb were delineated using arc hydro tool of arcgis software the spatial pattern of population of the study area has been mapped with the latest data for the year 2020 the source of data for mapping was taken from the global high resolution population denominators project funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation the resolution of data was 3 arc seconds 90m the projection was geographic coordinate system wgs84 the units were number of people per pixel the mapping approach was random forest based dasymetric redistribution worldpop 2018 lloyd et al 2019 the base map was prepared using esri world imagery the covid 19 hotspots areas have been mapped geospatially for the months of march april may june july august 2020 and april 2021 the coordinates for covid 19 hotspots in india region as of april 2021 is given in supporting information si table s1 2 3 data sources information statistics specific evidences taken from various web based sources apart from scientific articles is given in table s2 summary of water quality parameters in inlet and outlet of stps in covid 19 hotspots regions are given in table s3 s12 2 4 spatial autocorrelation spatial autocorrelation was applied to assess the spatial correlation between variables through matching location similarity and attribute similarity huo et al 2012 global moran s i an index of spatial autocorrelation based on cross products is mathematically expressed as follows i i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x x j x i 1 n x i x where n is the number of regions xi the attribute value at area i x the mean value of the attribute in the study region and wij elements of a spatial lag operator w spatial weights of matrix w the significance of the index is usually tested in a situation of normal distribution mazzulla et al 2012 global moran s i varies between 1 and 1 with a positive value meaning that a point in question is prone to be clustered by adjacent points while a negative value means the opposite values close to 0 indicate that the data are randomly distributed 4 results discussion 3 1 sars cov 2 in wastewater the extended time of incubation and shedding of sars cov 2 from asymptomatic individuals have been observed to be the two main influential parameters for the pandemic spread based on the computer simulation of wastewater from wuhan china milan italy madrid spain tehran iran and the us cities such as new york seattle detroit tempe and new orleans hart and halden 2020 revealed that depending on local conditions one symptomatic asymptomatic infected individual can be detected per 100 to 2 000 000 non infected persons based on the obtained results the authors identified wbe as a potential tool for assessing and managing the novel coronavirus pandemic which needs to be followed by clinical testing they predicted that to monitor approximately 30 of the world s population in terms of coronavirus spread wastewater from 105 600 stps need to be tested unlike sars cov 2 most infectious viruses are transmitted through waterborne routes studies indicate that the waterborne route of infection is relevant for hepatitis e virus hev a positive sense and single stranded rna virus that cause infection in pregnant women and in children with high mortality the hev was detected in untreated wastewater and river water kamar et al 2014 molecular analysis also revealed the prevalence of enterovirus and hepatitis a virus in sewage polluted river water and in drinking water of the three main cities of pakistan lahore islamabad and rawalpindi ahmad et al 2018 another example of water transmitted virus is norovirus a causal agent of several outbreaks in many countries tryfinopoulou et al 2019 hellmér et al 2014 wastewater samples obtained 2 to 3 weeks prior to the actual human infection showed an increased amount of norovirus gii genogroup ii two surrogate coronaviruses transmissible gastroenteritis tgev and mouse hepatitis mhv were found to remain infectious for days to weeks in water and pasteurized settled sewage gundy et al 2008 casanova et al 2009 during the first wave of covid 19 pandemic a study by wurtzer et al 2020 demonstrated the presence of sars cov 2 in the wastewater of paris the authors demonstrated the time course of viral load in wastewater with an average 2 log increase of genome units that was reflected in the peak in the number of new cases in western india presence of three genes specific for sars cov 2 orf1ab nucleocapsid n and spike s have been reported during the earlier phase after the outbreak of pandemic in the wastewater from wwtp of ahmedabad city gujarat kumar et al 2020 the number of gene copies increased ten fold between 8 and 27 may 2020 i e 0 78 102 copies l 1 and 8 05 10 copies l 1 respectively which corresponded to more than the doubling in the number of active covid 19 cases in ahmedabad city i e 4912 and 10674 individuals on 8 and 27 may respectively number of gene copies in this study were found comparable to that reported in the untreated wastewaters of australia china and turkey and lower than that of the usa france and spain a similar study was conducted in hospital wastewater samples as well as from wwtps of jaipur rajasthan which has been a pandemic hotspot red zone since april 2020 arora et al 2020 in this study authors further reported that the presence of sars cov 2 viral genome correlated with the increased number of reported covid 19 positive patients this study reported the presence of sars cov 2 viral genome in wastewater at higher ambient temperature of above 40 c in southern india the first surveillance of sars cov 2 and organic tracers ots in community wastewater showed that caffeine can act as a potential indicator for removal of sars cov 2 in stps and as an effective marker to understand the efficacy of the stps chakraborty et al 2021a untreated sewage containing sars cov 2 excreted from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals can end up in a catchment sinclair et al 2008 xagoraraki and o brien 2020 in pakistan about 27 of wastewater samples collected from the drainage of covid 19 patient quarantine centre in 13 districts showed the presence of sars cov 2 by rt pcr sharif 2020 similarly sequencing data revealed the presence of partial orf 1a of sars cov 2 in the same wastewater from the above mentioned covid 19 quarantine centres sharif 2020 infected individuals may continue to shed sars cov 2 through the faecal matter hindson 2020 with this in mind the informations associated with wastewater direct discharge points or sewage outlets need to be observed and studied in the wider perspective 3 2 covid 19 pandemic vs wastewater management in the igbrb in the igbrb countries india nepal pakistan and bangladesh there are 27354433 people with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and 315732 deaths as on date 18 may 2021 with the most in india followed by pakistan bangladesh and nepal as of may 2021 a total of 190 742 964 vaccine doses have been administered in the four igbrb countries india has administered the highest number of vaccine doses followed by bangladesh pakistan and nepal who 2021 in terms of testing india conducted the maximum number of viral detection tests in the igbrb followed by pakistan bangladesh and nepal the number of people who were tested positive or the positive rate is a very important metric for understanding the pandemic in the igbrb region as of may 2021 the highest positive rate was found in nepal 44 followed by india 19 bangladesh 8 7 and pakistan 7 5 however in a country as vast and densely populated as india many infected people have been reported to go undetected reports suggest that the actual numbers may be much higher due to inadequate testing or vaccination and many unreported cases in the countries in the igbrb region a large number of sars cov 2 patients are asymptomatic with no symptoms and oligosymptomatic with few minor symptoms most of whom are not clinically tested and hence contribute to an inaccurate estimation of the disease burden of covid 19 bhattacharya et al 2021 jahan et al 2020 additionally the wastewater treatment capacity of these four countries are also very dismal with 8 in pakistan murtaza and zia 2012 5 in nepal 17 in bangladesh and 33 in india moreover open defecation contributes to water pollution along the river banks in the igbrb region due to which the situation worsens during monsoons at the same time settlements along the igbrb extensively use the river water as the freshwater source for various purposes like irrigation consumption and other domestic needs mostly without any prior treatment consequently wastewater monitoring to track the spread of sars cov 2 through logged water and uncontrolled flow through sewer outlets and wastewater discharge points along the riverine catchment including slum areas of igbrb is at the same time an opportunity and a big challenge wastewater surveillance not just facilitates the early prevention of the viral spread but can also help to identify areas where current vaccination efforts are inadequate there are several barriers to covid 19 vaccination at present wastewater surveillance may reveal the anthropogeography of unvaccinated communities and help in informed decision making in terms of facilitating interventions like enhancing public awareness generating resources or creating convenient vaccination access points this can speed up the process of achieving mass vaccination goals to attain herd immunity the surveillance study of sars cov 2 of community wastewater in chennai chakraborty et al 2021a offered some interesting insights on the importance of wastewater monitoring the predicted estimated number of covid 19 cases from the study was found to be in line with the available clinical data from the catchments for instance during post lockdown phase the estimated number of infected persons found for a given catchment was in line with the number of actual active covid 19 cases further the study highlighted that the number of infected persons were higher in the densely populated regions especially where sanitation conditions were poor such studies have indicated that wastewater monitoring is an effective tool to monitor and manage the spread of pandemic such wastewater surveillance initiatives can go a long way in controlling the pandemic in the vast and densely populated igbrb region 3 3 geo spatial mapping of pandemic hotspots in the igbrb genetic material can be detected in both viable infectious and non viable or inactivated killed viruses so its detection does not mean the individual is necessarily infected or that the faeces are infectious although sars cov 2 genetic material has been detected in untreated wastewater ahmed et al 2020 medema et al 2020 wu et al 2020 there are no reports of the detection or persistence of viable infectious sars cov 2 in the treated wastewater the covid 19 hotspots areas in the igbrb have been mapped geospatially from march to august 2020 during the first wave and april 2021 after the hit of the second wave of the pandemic figure 2 monthly mapping of covid 19 hotspots in the igbrb showed maximum spread in the highly populated regions from june 2020 onwards with the maximum spread in august 2020 after the post lockdown during the first wave figure 2 mainly along the indus and ganga river basins in the indus river basin pakistan the number of covid 19 cases had spiked in june 2020 followed by the flattening of the curve in august september 2020 and then spiked again in april 2021 figure 3 shows the increasing number of covid 19 hotspots in the igbrb during 2021 after the hit of second wave of pandemic the incidence of covid 19 in the 216 administrative regions around the basin is illustrated in figure 4 depicting the situation as on 30th april 2021 table s13 in the ganga river basin india the number of covid 19 cases spiked dramatically in september 2020 and again during the gigantic second wave during april may 2021 during the second wave about 216 districts geospatially spread around the basin has been severely affected overall there is an exponential growth of covid 19 cases in hotspot regions during lockdown post lockdown phases and beyond from march 2020 to august 2020 in the igbrb figure s1 figure s2 shows the stps located in the covid 19 hotspot regions along the ganga river the spatial correlations of covid 19 epidemics between the 216 administrative regions for covid 19 according to global moran s i calculations is given in figure s3 moran s i and the z score were 0 08353 p 0 00002 0 05 4 229312 respectively indicating that the pattern expressed is randomly distributed indus river basin the indus river system and its tributaries the jhelum the chenab the ravi the sutlej the beas and the kabul rivers act as the main source of freshwater for the population of pakistan sohail et al 2014 local areas along the indus river bank are facing water challenges due to poor sanitation system in slum areas almost everyone is dependent on public toilets which are poorly maintained only a few cities along the river bank have treatment plants but these treatment plants are inappropriately located and receive little or no sewage indiscriminate discharges of wastewater from seven identified discharge points himmat kokaar thoyal faazal shami road army camp ghafar tee and darya khan have been observed to pose a major challenge the sewage drains at shami road are considered as major point sources of pollution in d i khan southern region of khyber pakhtunkhwa pakistan southeast of the indus river muddy water accumulates in agricultural fields there are 22 wastewater discharge locations along the banks of river indus a total of 20 districts of pakistan which belong to the hotspot zone lies at par with these wastewater discharge locations figure 1 ganga river basin according to an assessment by the central pollution control board the main source of pollution in river ganga is untreated domestic sewage contributing to approximately three fourth of discharged wastewater followed by industrial effluents furthermore along the main stem of the river there are 30 million toilets with tanks of mostly inadequate faecal sludge disposal and management systems there are 32 stps along the banks of river ganga figure s2 the ganga river basin generates around 12 000 mld of sewage with a treatment capacity of 4 000 mld in india cities and towns are divided based on population densities class i cities have the highest population density including all the metropolitan cities followed by class ii or developing cities with a rapid growth rate in industrial and allied sectors a total of 36 class i cities and 14 class ii cities discharge their wastewater directly into river ganga 113 class i cities and 18 class ii cities discharge the wastewater into its tributaries while 30 class i cities and 115 class ii cities have land disposal the 179 class i and 147 class ii cities generate about 11000 mld and 1000 mld of wastewater respectively nmcg 2020 a rapid growth of covid 19 cases was observed in hotspot regions from march to august 2020 as illustrated in figure 2 about 75 of the covid 19 hotspot regions are on the river bank there are 138 drains discharging 6087 mld of wastewater into river ganga with 14 drains in uttarakhand 440 mld 45 drains in uttar pradesh 3289 mld 25 drains in bihar 579 mld and 54 in west bengal 1779 mld discharging industrial and domestic wastewater directly or indirectly to the river in most cases in absence of sewerage systems drains are turned into open sewers to carry storm water and sewage into the ganga river basin about 50 of the covid 19 cases in the hotspots are reported from the embankment of river ganga haridwar district has 122 slums out of which 23 are from roorkee it was noticed that the slum regions of roorkee remained under the hotspot category throughout the pandemic months times of india toi 2019 reported that despite haridwar being declared as an open defecation free district the slum colonies near har ki pauri defecate in the open along the banks of river ganga this area also was among the covid 19 hotspots during march to may 2020 figure 2a 2c a slum located on the riverbed of rispana in dehradun falls in the covid 19 hotspot region rajapurwaslum of kanpur district located along the bank of ganga also belongs to vulnerable zone as far as covid 19 is concerned slum areas of rajendra nagar area ramakrishna nagar kankarbagh boring road nala road gandhi maidan are among the covid 19 hotspots locales of patna district during march to august 2020 in west bengal the main source of pollution of river ganga is from four districts hooghly howrah north 24 parganas and kolkata several non functional stps have been previously identified in these districts and were responsible for the release of various organic micropollutants into the river chakraborty et al 2019 the north 24 parganas district has emerged as a covid 19 hotspot recording a greater number of deaths around 10 stps are spatially distributed in north 24 parganas district in hooghly district death toll was high and it remains a vulnerable region a particular slum in howrah district has accounted for numerous covid 19 cases and the area has been marked as a covid 19 risk zone the slum areas are highly vulnerable to covid 19 the open defecation free report by national family health survey nfhs 2015 revealed that the sanitation facilities were not up to the mark in the cities along the bank of river ganga in the states of uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal according to a recent report by the central pollution control board cpcb 2020 there has been no improvement in water quality of river ganga during the lockdown period the water quality showed reduced compliance to the criteria limits from 64 6 to 46 2 which may be attributed to factors such as discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage higher concentrations of pollutants due to negligible dry season flow and lack of freshwater discharges from upstream brahmaputra river basin the key environmental issues of river brahmaputra in assam india are oil pollution lack of stps and disposal of waste directly into the river the town of dibrugarh assam india generates about 75 to 80 metric tons of garbage every day much of which ends up into the river during monsoon garbage flows into river brahmaputra india has planned to dredge the brahmaputra to prevent high flows from inundating its banks which result in floods with an estimated population of about 1 7 million guwahati the biggest city of assam is one of the smart cities under the indian government s smart cities mission neither has sewerage network of pipelines to carry sewage nor any municipal stp to treat the wastewater about 39 drains empty into bahini bharalu river of which 17 are major drains the sewage generation is expected to increase to around 280 mld by 2025 presently there is no sewerage system in guwahati city untreated or semi treated sewage is disposed of into the storm water drains which again ends up into river brahmaputra there are eight wwtps along the border line of river brahmaputra all the covid 19 hotspots in this region surround these wwtps although no death case has been reported in the region the number of confirmed cases stands high in dhubri district located along the bank of brahmaputra kamrup metro district in assam is witnessing an alarming spike in covid 19 spread with the highest death toll in assam being reported from this district the area remained to be a covid 19 hotspot zone all throughout the months of march to july 2020 figure 2a e according to the cpcb an overall improvement in water quality was observed in brahmaputra river basin during lockdown period for the criteria parameters do bod and fc and it showed 100 compliance for all monitored locations for outdoor bathing criteria parameters cpcb 2020 3 4 sanitation health and hygiene in the igbrb in light of the covid 19 pandemic globally around 2 2 billion people lack safe drinking water 4 2 billion people live without access to adequate sanitation and 3 billion people lack basic handwashing facilities at home according the joint monitoring programme jmp report jmp 2019 the practice of frequent hand washing has been suggested for breaking human transmissibility of sars cov 2 however a large number of people out of the 3 billion lacking handwashing facilities live in south asia and sub saharan africa whose population together accounts for 85 of the world s poor wsscc 2020 nearly 40 households 50 schools 900 million children and 40 healthcare facilities worldwide do not have access to soap and water which are the basic hand hygiene services needed during the covid 19 crisis jmp 2019 according to the world health organization and united nations children s fund who unicef joint monitoring programme for water supply sanitation and hygiene jmp in 2020 the national population with basic hygiene facilities with availability of handwashing facility with soap and water at home in igbrb countries were 68 in india 60 urban and 82 rural 62 in nepal 59 urban and 75 rural 58 in bangladesh 54 urban and 66 rural and 80 in pakistan 74 urban and 90 rural between 2015 and 2020 the proportion of the global population with basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home increased from 67 to 71 however in 2020 2 3 billion people still lacked basic hygiene and 670 million lacked any form of handwashing facility jmp 2021 the hygiene scenario in the four igbrb countries bangladesh india nepal and pakistan in terms of availability and access to handwashing facilities have been presented in figure s4 the risks posed to those living in urban slums is higher compared to others considering their workplace exposure lack of access to running water for handwashing inability to maintain social distancing and isolation while living in crammed habitations such social inequalities expose the vulnerabilities of the urban poor in terms of the burden risks and access to water sanitation and hygiene wash needs figure s5 as expected the richest quintile of population has better access to drinking water sanitation and hygiene however the inequity in access to drinking water between the richest and the poorest is lesser compared to sanitation and hygiene there have been no reports yet of faeco oral transmission of the sars cov 2 who 2020 it could however remain infectious in water contaminated with faeces for days to weeks safely managed wash services are also critical during the recovery phase of a disease outbreak to mitigate secondary impacts on community health livelihood and wellbeing the covid 19 situation in the igbrb countries ecdc 2020 is depicted in figures s6 and s7 in pakistan the highest number of deaths was reported in the month of june 2020 the month of august 2020 recorded the highest death toll as far as india is concerned a total of 96 351 deaths have been reported during mid last year in india 6482 in pakistan 481 in nepal and 5193 in bangladesh however there is a need to use the data with caution due to different inclusion criteria and variability in underestimation and delays by various organizations covid 19 pandemic reiterates the need for improvement of wash infrastructure in the low economic settlements in the densely populated south asian countries 5 challenges for the un sdgs for the covid 19 pandemic in the igbrb the water sanitation health nexus the united nations sustainable development goals have been introduced to call for action by all countries poor rich and middle income to promote prosperity while protecting the planet the sdgs through addressing the global challenges constitute a proposal to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all before 2030 at the same time the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic has posed a significant threat to the healthy lives and well being of billions of people worldwide especially in highly vulnerable developing countries ahmed et al 2020 sumner et al 2020 from the perspective of water sanitation health nexus the current covid 19 pandemic in the igbrb influences mostly the following sdgs goal 3 good health and well being goal 6 clean water and sanitation goal 10 reduced inequalities goal 11 sustainable cities and communities the progress of goal 3 good health and well being has been hindered by covid 19 as it poses a global health risk and has shown the critical need for preparedness in the face of covid 19 pandemic the developing countries such as those located in the igbrb struggle with far greater problems than developed countries during pandemic the limited availability of medical services in the igbrb countries seriously affects the health of citizens and may lead to significant delay in achieving the sdg 3 in that area therefore the wastewater surveillance for early detection of sars cov 2 and maintenance of wash infrastructure especially mobile hand washing and sanitation facilities as provided by some governments of igbrb during the current pandemic are crucial to achieve and maintain good health and well being for the people of the region the importance of sanitation hygiene and adequate access to clean water goal 6 clean water sanitation is crucial in fighting with diseases including covid 19 pandemic who indicates handwashing as one of the most effective actions to reduce the spread of pathogens and viruses including the sars cov 2 virus and in this way minimize spread of the disease at the same time worldwide one in three people do not have access to safe drinking water two out of five people do not have a basic hand washing facility with soap and water united nations 2020 in the igbrb the wastewater treatment capacity ranged from 5 in nepal to 33 in india only about 50 and 40 of people in the indus and ganga brahmapura meghna basins respectively have access to improved sanitation facilities unep 2008 indicating the need for further investments but also demonstrating the risk for development and spread of diseases including covid 19 among people living there the implementation of wastewater monitoring could provide a decision platform for countries to adjust their wash services to prevent the spread of sars cov 2 this would include continued support to affected high risk and vulnerable communities to secure wash services and infection control the results of wastewater surveillance can help governments in mobilizing resources and implementing innovative and context appropriate solutions to take timely decisions such wastewater surveillance efforts would not only control the spread of sars cov 2 but will prevent other true waterborne pathogens including bacteria and viruses causing severe gastrointestinal diseases e g shigella salmonella vibrio norovirus also achieving the sdg goal 10 reduced inequalities has been seriously hindered by the covid 19 as far as inequality within and among countries is a persistent cause for concern for the un the covid 19 has deepened existing inequalities hitting the poorest and most vulnerable communities the hardest sars cov 2 does not discriminate but its impacts have exposed deep weaknesses in the delivery of public services and structural inequalities that impede access to them united nations 2020 thus deepening the economic and societal inequities among 300 million people living in the igbrb inhabitants will constitute another challenge for sustainable development in the post pandemic world in term of goal 11 sustainable cities and communities it may be underlined that by 2030 about 60 of the global population will live in the cities and 95 of urban expansion will take place in developing countries such rapid urbanization results in a growing number of slum inhabitants inadequate and overburdened infrastructure and services including waste collection and water and sewage systems the effects of covid 19 are most devastating in poor and densely populated urban areas especially for the 883 million people that live in slums today most of them are found in eastern and south eastern asia where overpopulation hampers not only social distancing and self isolation but also reduced the access to clean water and sanitation endangering public health united nations 2020 it needs to be highlighted that the actual impacts of covid 19 on sdg achievement will be known in the future however as some countries are moving towards recovery coherent actions can put them on a strong trajectory towards achieving many of these sdgs in july 2020 in order to continue achieving the targets of sdgs in the time of covid 19 pandemic the united nations developed the sdg 6 global acceleration framework outlining a better coordinated support to countries to ensure global sustainable management of water and sanitation for all building upon this insight the strategic idea suggested in the following section can contribute during the response and recovery and set a course for achieving the sdgs 6 urgent need for wastewater surveillance the spread of sars cov 2 in highly populated countries in south asia can be curbed only through continuous surveillance to arrest hotspots wbe can be very effective tool in arresting the further waves of the pandemic by way of detecting the coronavirus in sewage long before manifestations of reinfection are witnessed in the community identification of potential chemical and biological markers present in faeces and urine of infected individuals that are released in the wastewater could provide an efficient and prompt way to predict the efficacy of stps in removal of sars cov 2 at this point wastewater treatment using various approaches are analysed and optimized but chlorination ultraviolet uv radiation light and ozone treatment of water are the most promising ones the increasing number of covid 19 cases during the post lockdown phase emphasizes the fact that there is a need to understand the situation in a catchment to prevent other waves of pandemic wbe is a cost effective tool to manage the spread of coronavirus pandemic although we are still not close to finding a fast remedy for covid 19 it can be pragmatic to make a significant contribution which will offer key benefits in areas of critical importance for people and the environment by establishing a system for monitoring of sars cov 2 in the sewage and wastewater treatment plants or discharge points in the indus ganga brahmaputra river basin we will get closer towards the path of fulfilling sdgs this could be of tremendous importance for south asia as it may lead to positive impacts on the water sanitation health nexus further the results of the study are applicable to monitor the spread of other pathogenic microorganisms including antibiotic resistant bacteria and related diseases and epidemics that may be a potential threat to human health in the future declaration of competing interest the

961,an inventory of anthropogenic barriers to longitudinal river connectivity in greece is presented based on an extensive literature review we mapped greece s 275 major dams and developed an ongoing inventory of 661 other barriers compiled from various sources we further summarized future dam barriers as published in greece s river basin area management plans environmental professionals and engineers were also interviewed to investigate perceptions and preferences concerning longitudinal river connectivity fish were given priority as reference organisms in questionnaire responses the reviewed literature and relevant legislation but other biodiversity elements were rarely addressed dams prevail as the most prominent perceived barrier pressures while most respondents seem to recognize problems with other barrier types as well however mention of small barrier infrastructure in the literature or legislation is very scarce and there is no systematic inventory of in stream infrastructure barriers fish passes or other barrier mitigation or restoration interventions recommendations for particular unmet needs and opportunities for restoration of a variety of barrier types are addressed it is crucial that attention for preservation and restoration measures involving lotic waters connectivity issues be introduced in the country s eu inspired water body management and within protected areas in particular keywords river fragmentation fish dams restoration fish passes mediterranean rivers 1 introduction rivers have been characterized as biodiversity hotlines being networks of linearly connected ecosystems décamps 2011 river corridor networks are also considered socio ecological systems that provide humans with a multitude of ecosystem services jafary et al 2018 kourtis and tsihrintzis 2017 nava lópez et al 2016 tsihrintzis et al 1995 vörösmarty et al 2010 weigelhofer et al 2021 however river ecosystems have been extensively altered by humans and they now face a global environmental crisis dudgeon 2019 reid et al 2019 human induced flow alteration habitat degradation and loss of connectivity are principal impacts which affect biodiversity in rivers worldwide gonzález del tánago et al 2016 palmer and ruhi 2019 the importance of longitudinal connectivity in particular was realized rather late in river conservation science pringle 2006 but its prominence in assessment and restoration today is paramount duarte et al 2021 seliger and zeiringer 2018 longitudinal connectivity sustains many ecosystem processes such as species movements ecological succession genetic exchange material and energy flows and riparian zone resources and conditions bueno et al 1995 campbell grant et al 2007 fuller et al 2015 naiman et al 2005 olaya marín et al 2012 anthropogenic loss of longitudinal connectivity refers to the artificial breaks in natural continuity created by a variety of artificial structures such as dams weirs sluices ramps road crossings culverts and various river engineering works including anti erosion and flood risk reduction engineering works currently only about one third of the world s rivers longer than 1000 km remain free flowing over their entire length grill et al 2019 while in europe more than one million artificial barriers have been recorded amber consortium 2020 belletti et al 2020 moreover over half of the length of the continent s river networks is considered impaired for diadromous fish species duarte et al 2021 especially in areas where severe water stress fragments streams due to artificial desiccation such as in the mediterranean basin connectivity problems are often accentuated various types of dam structures especially for small hydropower are increasing the numbers of barriers to fish movement throughout the mediterranean basin and especially in the balkans freyhof et al 2020 furthermore the percentage of fragmented streams is enlarged if we account for small in stream infrastructures which are often overlooked belletti et al 2020 garcia de leaniz 2020 there is poor documentation of many in stream infrastructure barriers documenting and assessing impacts is difficult because of their small size high frequency of occurrence and poorly studied effects on the biota and ecosystem integrity branco et al 2017 fullerton et al 2010 januchowski hartley et al 2020 the result has been a rapid recent decline in river longitudinal connectivity and integrity this issue has gained broad relevance in policy driven water management and restoration in recent years amber consortium 2020 carvajal quintero et al 2017 river connectivity restoration is currently an important target in eu environment policy including the water framework directive 2000 60 ec hereafter wfd and the recently drafted biodiversity strategy for 2030 european commission 2020 to achieve good ecological status which is the main goal of the wfd the re establishment of the system s longitudinal connectivity should be seen as a prime restoration concern mader and maier 2008 the eu biodiversity strategy strives to put europe on the path to ecological recovery by 2030 proposing the restoration of at least 25 000 km of eu rivers to a free flowing state i e without longitudinal barriers effective fish and wildlife passage and undisturbed fish migration is principally a component for restoring and sustainably managing watersheds papadaki et al 2020 barrier removal is a recent and common practice to improve river connectivity and it can also boost the river engineering sector and local socioeconomic development amber consortium 2020 however efforts targeting restoration in mediterranean rivers have lagged behind and there are many difficulties specific to mediterranean climate rivers kondolf et al 2013 skoulikidis et al 2017 in terms of the implementation of restoration investments knowledge and experience in connectivity assessment and restoration is lacking in most mediterranean countries often restoration actions are blocked by insufficient funding for specific actions conflicting interests among different stakeholders and low political priority given to restoration cortina segarra et al 2021 fishes are potentially good indicators of longitudinal connectivity rodeles et al 2020 rodeles et al 2021 wolter et al 2021 they have been chosen as an organism for prioritizing barrier removal and many restoration projects bednarek 2001 branco et al 2014 fitzpatrick et al 2021 kemp and o hanley 2010 lin et al 2019 mader and maier 2008 migratory freshwater fish populations offer many ecosystem services lynch et al 2016 many of these are appreciated differently by different cultures and societal groups efforts to ensure fish assemblage integrity and population maintenance even in the face of development include many fish passage mechanisms and connectivity enhancement projects hydroelectric power plants large scale water abstraction and water transfers can act as environmental filters strongly selecting functional traits of the ichthyofauna causing decline of fish populations and diversity erős et al 2018 hermoso et al 2018 oliveira et al 2018 greece typically faces many longitudinal connectivity problems which are also widespread in the balkans and the european mediterranean countries but there has been little reference to river barrier problems for conservation kagalou and latinopoulos 2020 tachos et al 2021 zogaris et al 2017 besides very few references on the effects of large dams on threatened fish species stoumboudi et al 2019 little is ever mentioned about small sized instream barriers restoration proposals have largely overlooked river barrier problems since greece has lagged behind other european countries in river water body monitoring and restoration economou et al 2016 kanakoudis et al 2015 and effective protected area management kati et al 2021 vlami et al 2021 zogaris et al 2017 the aims of the present study were a document knowledge and resources available with concern for lotic longitudinal connectivity in greece and provide an initial inventory b identify knowledge gaps and c provide initial recommendations for policy relevant research and technical developments we hope that through this screening level review we can establish a framework for inquiry into artificial barriers in river basins in greece 2 materials and methods 2 1 barrier maps the barrier inventory in the present study focused on dams but it also provides the first preliminary compilation of smaller longitudinal barriers based on the international commission on large dams a dam is defined as large when the height between the lowest foundation and the crest is greater than 15 m or when the height is between 5 and 15 m and the impounding is more than 3 106 m3 icold 2011 for the present effort the registry of greek large dams in operation provided by the greek committee on large dams greek committee on large dams 2013 was used after validation and update and after including large dams under construction additionally the registry of small dams and artificial reservoirs of the ministry of rural development and food of greece hellenic ministry of rural development and food 2006 and the on line registry of land reclamation projects of ministry of rural development and food of greece hellenic ministry of rural development and food 2020 were reviewed it should be noted that in some cases details concerning the technical characteristics height and capacity of the structures were missing in the available archives and online databases in such cases the dams were classified as small data on other in stream barriers or smaller fragmentation structures were compiled utilizing amber barrier tracking atlas which is a eu wide citizen science platform amber consortium 2020 and ongoing efforts to compile in stream barriers at the hellenic centre for marine research hcmr the methodology and format for the inventory is developed using a geographical information system platform arcgis as described in mentzafou et al 2019 our inventory of non dam barriers is an ongoing work in progress and we provide a snapshot of the compilation as of writing july 2021 2 2 literature review and patterns in publication activity a systematic literature review to identify studies that investigate river connectivity in greece was performed web of science and google scholar were reviewed in both english and greek languages for all studies published till the end of 2020 using selected relevant keywords we used google scholar for grey literature and isi web of knowledge for scientific papers a combination of keywords was employed a ts river connectivity or river continuum or dam or fish pass or fish pass or fish ladder and greece or hellas or greek or eastern mediterranean and the same words in the greek language see tables a1 and a2 in appendix for specific word combinations used the papers and documents from the initial search were screened in terms of their abstract contents as a general rule if the abstract was unclear or any uncertainty surrounded its inclusion it was included for the next stage of screening the next stage included full text screening all articles generated by this strategy were exported into an excel database finally we reviewed the first edition of greece s river basin management plans rbmps 2009 2015 updated and published in 2017 http wfdver ypeka gr en home en for all 14 rbmp districts table a3 in appendix future dam projects are mapped within the 14 rbmp districts 2 3 questionnaire survey a survey was conducted using a questionnaire that was based on a study exploring professional attitudes towards dams and reservoirs within the eu h2020 project adaptive management of barriers in european rivers amber 2017 ue 16 amber 689682 the questionnaire was designed to capture perceptions of specialists and special interest stakeholders who have experience and interest in river science they included relevant post graduate students environmental scientists engineers environmental non governmental organization professionals and other relevant practitioners and conservationists rather than striving for a representative sample of the wider population the questionnaire was distributed to participants in a workshop organized by the hcmr and the world fish migration foundation river conservation actions national amber meeting may 8th 2019 athens and also to national technical university of athens ntua water resources and environmental engineering msc students on march 10th 2020 a total of 70 subjects responded in particular the aims of the questionnaire were to investigate the attitudes of respondents on i the benefits of dams to different kind of services ii the impacts of the establishment of dams and different forms of barriers and iii the need of mitigation plans for dam impacts the questionnaire consisted of 12 fix response questions and basic demographic data of the respondents was also collected gender age educational level occupation each questionnaire item was measured using a five level likert scale where score 1 corresponded to totally disagree and 5 to totally agree descriptive analysis of the responses was compiled in tables or bar graphs nonparametric analysis and specifically the spearman correlation coefficient was carried out to check association between the questions internal consistency and reliability of the questionnaire were assessed using cronbach s alpha coefficient i e values of more than 0 7 indicate good internal consistency bolarinwa 2015 tavakol and dennick 2011 graphical and statistical analyses were conducted in microsoft excel and r r core team 2020 the questionnaire is provided in the appendix table a4 3 results 3 1 status of river connectivity in greece the initial map of dams provides data for 111 small dams and 164 large dams in the hellenic territory some high dams are created for water storage on small islands and are usually storage basins on non perennial streams i e intermittent and ephemerally flowing streams most high dams have been constructed in western and northern greece while many small dams are located in northeastern greece fig 1 the latter are in many cases very small reservoirs interest in tracking and assessing barriers other than dams is very recent and poorly developed in greece this is shown by participation in the amber project s barrier tracker application that assisted in the development of our ongoing non dam barrier inventory fig 2 the initial map of non dam barriers includes only 208 contributions from the barrier tracker citizen science platform 661 mapped in total most of these are registered by scientists from hcmr and there is a biased concentration of barriers in some parts of greece such as in eastern central greece where recent hcmr projects are exploring barrier assessments this map is obviously grossly incomplete in showing the current state of non dam barriers but it is an indicative snapshot of current efforts to track barriers greece currently has 14 river basins districts rbds designated in 2010 while the national monitoring network according to the wfd provisions was established in 2011 hellenic parliament 2011 many proposed dams and other water storage structures are officially planned by the government for water management especially high dam numbers target western and north central greece fig 3 table a3 in appendix 3 2 literature review a lack of data on dams and other barriers was evident from the literature review grey literature studies were scarce n 96 fig 4 the review in the greek language compiled 36 theses bsc and msc dissertations of which the majority have a limited reference to river connectivity usually only with a short notice one or few paragraphs about the impacts of dams on the environment and or the ichthyofauna only two phd dissertations make a more substantial contribution with respect to the diptych dam fish but only in a wider context of fish morphology and genetics in a river with strong presence of large dams nestos river sapounidis 2014 and environmental flows papadaki 2018 eight technical reports and the 14 rbmp were grouped together in the category technical reports most of technical reports 6 of 8 were written by hcmr researchers and they used the definition of longitudinal connectivity and its value in fish movements an abbreviated synopsis for the country s rbmp is given in the appendix most relevant conference papers refer to dam and small hydropower plant construction and to fish pass technical designs there is a record in a conference paper in which authors only exalt the large hydropower projects and state that flora and fauna could be enhanced by this kind of project stefanakos et al 2013 recent popular articles mostly by ngos a few individual researchers and citizen groups highlight the risk of loss of connectivity in biodiversity and river integrity others results fig 4 of the grey literature review mainly include environmental impact studies university lecture notes etc scientific papers and other peer reviewed publications were similarly limited to a small number n 40 with a slight increase in recent years fig 4 crivelli et al 1995 first mentioned the negative effects on fish diversity and disappearance of eels and wels catfish after the 1982 construction of a new higher dam at kerkini reservoir strymonas river greece after that sparse works were published often with obscure and uncertain relation to barriers and their impacts five recent papers engage other organisms especially macroinvertebrates others referred to different types of connectivity e g lateral or to different kind of impacts of dams e g sedimentation others refer to different causes for loss of connectivity e g drought others to environmental flows and or technical fish pass design finally we should note that we did not find a widespread generic term for longitudinal barrier in the greek language the term φραγμός was introduced for such barriers during an eu amber project collaboration with the co authors of this paper in 2019 3 3 questionnaire survey 3 3 1 demographic profile according to the sample analyzed 70 respondents 36 were female 51 4 and 34 male 48 6 table 1 as regards to the educational level of respondents 94 66 respondents were highly educated and only 5 7 4 respondents were of upper educational level table 1 3 3 2 benefits and services from dams services that respondents considered beneficial from dam reservoirs were ranked based on five classes of assigned importance fig 5 water storage water transfer was the service perceived to be the most beneficial by damming with scores higher than 4 79 agriculture and livestock flood control and economic development followed with percentages 64 59 and 51 respectively on the contrary lower beneficial values had the categories faunal and floral biodiversity natural environment sport fishing and tourism and recreation with 70 69 46 and 44 negative responses scores 1 and 2 cultural heritage was also considered as less beneficial 63 with many respondents undecided 27 3 3 3 impacts perceived the perceptions of respondents about the impacts of dams and barriers all forms weir sluice road fords etc to biodiversity and hydromorphology are depicted in fig 6 firstly critical impacts score 5 are recognized in all the categories the majority of responses 4 and 5 scores highlighted fish as the most negatively affected element of biodiversity secondly hydromorphological conditions and habitats were also identified as sustaining significant pressures by dams and barriers other aquatic fauna and plants vegetation followed terrestrial fauna was evaluated as the biodiversity element with the slight or nearly no negative impacts results between dams and barriers all forms followed a similar pattern 3 3 4 opinion about dams and reservoirs more than half of the respondents 55 believe that dams and associated reservoirs benefit people in multiple ways and a similar portion of them 49 agree that they are necessary fig 7 the majority perceive that anthropogenic pressures dams and reservoirs negatively impact the environment while dams 53 of the respondents and barriers of all kinds 56 are considered one of the most significant pressure for greek river ecological integrity a high percentage of respondents 80 noted that migration of aquatic species is blocked by barriers dams and all forms included despite the fact that some of them 41 find them aesthetically pleasing however according to 65 of respondents the subject remains a source of conflict more than half 58 are not convinced of the usefulness of environmental flows and fish passes as mitigation measures whereas they are divided about the significance of a measure like removing dams barriers only 32 deemed dam removal as a positive or potential prospect in greece moreover 66 admit that designation of protected areas could be an effective management measure spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate the dependence between the different questions the produced correlation matrix which contains the correlation coefficients was plotted visually using a correlogram fig 8 as depicted in the correlogram the strongest correlation appeared between the questions 5 and 7 p 0 76 reflecting the solid accordance that both dams and barriers all forms are both considered significant anthropogenic pressures significant positive correlation p 0 5 is conspicuous between questions 2b and 2c 2b and 5 2b and 7 2c and 5 2c and 7 medium negative correlation p 0 4 is noted between the questions 2c and 9 suggesting that the majority of respondents who believe that river fauna migration is blocked by dams disagree with the opinion that the issue of removing dams barriers in greece is insignificant compared to other environmental problems despite subjects being exposed to different questions about potential impacts of damming and restoration measures the survey reflected adequately the respondent s opinion until the end of the questionnaire concordance between the answers in questions with positive and negative statements was observed cronbach s alpha was calculated at 0 78 which indicates good internal consistency this questionnaire structure can thus be considered reliable for understanding the social attitudes towards dams and reservoirs 4 discussion 4 1 interpreting review results artificial barrier inventory and assessment in running waters is a challenging task this is difficult in a country with many small and seasonally dry river basins river basin areas smaller than 700 km2 cover about half of the greek territory most large dams are concentrated in greece s larger basins while many recently created dam like water storage structures such as irrigation reservoirs in the islands are on non perennially flowing river networks thus differing from typical river barrier dams athanasopoulos et al 2006 moreover there are many dams on four of the five transboundary large river basins shared by greece and its balkan neighbours of these only the aoos vjose does not have many high dams yet but there are new dam proposals in the albanian section of this river the maps of dam and other barriers produced in our compilation are indicative but this may not do justice to the large number of other small longitudinal barriers to natural connectivity there is evidence that there are many other small infrastructure barriers in greece chatzinikolaou et al 2011 however there is no completed nation wide inventory the respondents to our survey were well aware of general dam impacts to connectivity and this included small barrier impacts as well in fact responses for dams and all forms of barriers closely parallel each other showing that even non dam barriers were perceived to have similar negative impacts to connectivity as do large dams by the group of relevant professionals surveyed in contrast the perceived services and benefits provided by dams and their reservoirs to people were lower than expected in the questionnaire responses the dam reservoir values for faunal or floral biodiversity and cultural heritage were perceived at the lowest position in the benefits hierarchy by the survey respondents in our opinion this may have to do with polarization due to recent dam building controversies in greece modern dam construction for hydropower and water transfers has produced significant environmental conflict in greece tyralis et al 2017 of course there are well known positive values such as the tourism values of certain dams reservoirs in greece namely plastiras dam reservoir and doxa reservoir sargentis et al 2021 the issue of the cultural values of free flowing rivers versus dammed rivers is still poorly explored andreopoulos et al 2015 vlami et al 2021 despite a potentially polarized view i e for or against dams a very low percentage of the respondents referred to a positive potential for dam removal in greece we attribute this to inexperience and low awareness of the opportunities and prospects of dam removal to our knowledge there has never been a demolition of a dam weir or other longitudinal barrier for ecological restoration purposes in greece 4 2 insights into impacts of artificial barriers in greece dams and or barriers have been identified as evidence based anthropogenic pressures rather recently particularly with concern for in stream biota koutrakis et al 2019 skoulikidis et al 2009 zogaris et al 2018 hydrology and hydromorphology ioannou et al 2009 coastal processes sylaios and kamidis 2017 sylaios et al 2012 2010 and riparian zones zaimes and iakovoglou 2021 it is widely recognized in greece that for several fish species there are serious problems with movements and migration due to barriers barbieri et al 2015 bobori et al 2001 cheimonopoulou et al 2011 kokkinakis 2007 leonardos 2015 sapounidis et al 2019 natural connectivity is important not just for migratory fish but fish dispersal and re colonization mechanisms after prolonged drought impacts vardakas et al 2017 however even within ichthyological research references are scant compared to other european countries and besides fish little work has been done on effects on other biota or at the ecosystem landscape or basin coastal zone scale in greece furthermore it is well known that disruption of longitudinal connectivity can affect many other organisms including mammals scorpio et al 2016 sonkar and gaurav 2020 amphibians dare et al 2020 peek et al 2018 macroinvertebrates hamstead et al 2019 leiva et al 2017 plants and vegetation patterns johansson et al 1996 merritt and wohl 2006 birds lacko et al 2018 and coastal marine fish and invertebrates drinkwater and frank 1994 mediterranean rivers are remarkably heterogeneous and show extreme flow variability often naturally disconnected due to drought and desiccation during part of the year rincón et al 2017 the effects of dams and other barriers on mediterranean climate area rivers may be very different from other temperate climate areas kondolf et al 2013 this is therefore an understudied topic in greece identifying barriers to connectivity and assessing impacts is not straightforward brismar 2004 especially if barriers are not particularly targeted in assessment and monitoring schemes in greece barriers as hydromorphological degradation have only recently been assessed within standard survey protocols especially using on site assessment methods chatzinikolaou et al 2006 vlami et al 2019 zaimes and iakovoglou 2021 transverse structures are commonly recorded using the spanish qbr protocol in greece despite the very short longitudinal distance of on site survey segments chatzinikolaou et al 2011 latsiou et al 2021 however the assessment of the importance of barriers as degradation to river corridors varies a recent country wide review found that small in stream infrastructure modifications including barriers appear to play a lesser role in the morphological impacts recorded on site based river surveys using the river habitat survey protocol hereafter rhs in greece stefanidis et al 2020 rhs applications using 500 m long river survey segments may not adequately assess connectivity decline over the wider basin in contrast records of barriers especially those downstream of fish sampling sites are prevalent in nation wide fish based assessments with reference to barrier impacts at river segment and basin scales zogaris et al 2018 in our opinion ichthyological surveys may be more sensitive in recording longitudinal barriers since they presumably impact fish communities however many small barriers may be under reported and perhaps under appreciated in other monitoring protocols recent reviews show that barrier under reporting appears very high across eastern europe and the balkans 76 98 underreporting and also in greece 97 garcia de leaniz 2020 hydropower development is a very important water management issue in recent years a very large number of small hydroelectric power projects are planned in greece rae 2021 the number of proposals is akin to a development boom in the renewable resources sector as a whole kati et al 2021 although initially promoted as an environmentally friendly solution malesios and arabatzis 2010 small hydropower locations are sometimes controversial serious impacts are often revealed especially where there are large numbers of projects being developed within formerly wild areas or within protected areas lange et al 2019 weiss et al 2018 renewable resource development particularly through small hydro and wind power also promote an increase in roads and this situation creates additive and synergistic negative impacts for fragmentation of riverine corridors at the landscape scale often even within protected areas kati et al 2020 the current situation in greece echoes other areas with dense concentrations of proposed small hydropower couto and olden 2018 and these may be a cause for an outstanding increase in the number of new artificial barriers in the coming years weiss et al 2018 fishways fish passes or fish ladders management techniques providing passage through a barrier have a long history with a growing interest in recent years katopodis and williams 2012 silva et al 2018 however there are still technical limitations and knowledge gaps about management success of fish passes in general celestino et al 2020 kemp 2016 lennox et al 2019 lira et al 2017 pelicice et al 2020 silva et al 2018 in eastern mediterranean inland waters fish passes in cyprinid rivers are still very scarce sanz ronda et al 2019 other mitigation approaches such as human assisted transportation of fishes upstream of dam barriers have been attempted in greece and in our opinion this requires further monitoring koutrakis et al 2007 our review confirms that in greece there is no inventory of fish passes while a very few recent studies have been conducted on the technical design of fishways and for fish related management e g mitsopoulos et al 2020 stamou et al 2018 on an anecdotal note the authors have observed fish passes that are not maintained and do not function properly in several occasions in greece finally barriers may produce impacts that may influence other aspects of river corridors and their landscapes including ecosystem services kagalou and latinopoulos 2020 development of specific reviews or indicators is still poorly applied in greece e g vlami et al 2021 furthermore in our opinion citizen science is also poorly developed in greece and barrier tracking amber consortium 2020 is not yet widely practiced by non professionals 4 3 barriers in river basin management and restoration planning in greece the 14 river basins districts rbds and national monitoring networks have been in place just over a decade our review suggests that the issue of barriers especially small barriers is often overlooked or is intentionally sidelined within the scope of promoting small hydroelectric developments often specifically published within official regional river basin management plans indicative of this is that only five of the 14 rbds mention specific restoration or mitigation measures for dams i e fish passes in particular see appendix table a3 kanakoudis et al 2015 stress weaknesses with regards to qualitative assessment of greece s rbmps which should better document and promote the prioritization of the programme of measures other researchers mention the need of a scientific framework for developing measures that pay closer attention to biodiversity and ecological restoration zogaris et al 2017 and support ecosystems services as well kagalou and latinopoulos 2020 in greece restoration action for rivers and running waters in general has lagged behind other eu states zogaris et al 2017 modern methods for assessing hydromorphological degradation and prescribing specific ecological restoration have only begun recently dimitriou and stavroulaki 2018 mentzafou et al 2016 ourloglou et al 2020 zogaris et al 2018 recommendations or plans for dismantling in stream infrastructure for fish movements are still scarce very few studies have promoted specific barrier removal guidelines or proposals dimitriou et al 2015 moreover with regards to climate change preparation forecasting and adaptation with respect to issues of infrastructural barriers on rivers most focus has been on declines or changes in flow with very scarce mention of biota and the compounding effects of barriers e g kokkoris et al 2019 papadaki et al 2016 drastic changes in natural flow regime resulting from water abstraction and water retention by dams have become challenging concerns and are augmented by climate warming trends especially in the mediterranean basin feio et al 2021 finally as in several other accounts abroad in greece climate change prospects may also function as drivers to design and build more dams and water storage facilities in the near future oki and kanae 2006 rincón et al 2017 we are certain that conflicts related to water storage and barriers to longitudinal connectivity will continue to increase in the near future in greece 4 4 recommendations the importance of inventory and registering barriers and assessing impacts is paramount there have been calls for this in recent publications januchowski hartley et al 2020 king et al 2017 segurado et al 2013 fishways and fish ladders should not be seen as absolute technological fixes they may not always be adequate for mitigation and movement of fish or other biota helfman 2007 rincón et al 2017 the removal of artificial barriers that no longer provide human benefits or provide particular services should be considered as a sustainable solution that also restores wider ecosystem connectivity an important aspect of ecological restoration seliger and zeiringer 2018 planning for and prioritizing barrier removal should be promoted in greece as has begun in other mediterranean climate areas branco et al 2014 restoration opportunities should be developed as best practice examples especially within protected areas such as within the eu natura 2000 network hermoso et al 2019 adjusting and applying new river engineering methods and nature based solutions is critically important in greece especially where developments occur within sensitive protected areas efforts to change traditional designs and operation methods when building bridges culverts ramps embankments and anti erosion measures olden and naiman 2010 should be widely promoted in order to preserve and restore connectivity and to facilitate the dispersal of organisms and fluxes of water and sediment that create and maintain natural conditions within in stream and riparian habitats biodiversity and natural history knowledge should better inform river management gilman et al 2004 the effects of barriers vary greatly in space and time poff and hart 2002 and in many cases simple actions such as small infrastructure removal have shown remarkable changes birnie gauvin et al 2018 in summary we recommend the following actions a national inventory of artificial barriers in all inland waters concentrating on lotic drainages but also in lakes wetlands and transitional waters assessment surveys of all established fish passes and other such works in an effort to improve poorly functioning fish passage works new protocols and new technology development should be used to assess fish passability of barriers and to design infrastructure that limits connectivity loss specific research on the migratory and movement dispersal requirements of endemic range restricted and threatened fish and aquatic invertebrate species small and large barrier removal should be designed and promoted within wfd restoration and biodiversity conservation in rivers and other waterways exclusion zones for dam and barrier development should be set up in order to preserve rivers that provide outstanding natural and cultural heritage values including wild and scenic rivers an increase in relevant scientific research focusing on longitudinal barriers their impact and practical solutions finally among the primary conclusions drawn in this review is the necessity of additional public education and awareness regarding barriers and their assessment as anthropogenic pressures an important issue is communication and sensitization of a variety of stakeholders barriers are still a poorly charted issue in greece participatory approaches such as citizen science and specialized on site training through the use of rapid assessment protocols could promote a wider participation and sensitization of both the public and management practitioners twardek et al 2020 outreach and education efforts to bring about a wider river barrier literacy among the public and stakeholders should be widely promoted 5 conclusions the purpose of this paper was to establish a framework for inquiry into artificial barriers in river basins in greece within data scarce conditions specific inroads were made including a review of scientific and relevant gray literature including wfd policy applications in 14 river basin districts b survey via questionnaire with a set of specialists and c specific recommendations for action solutions to restoring longitudinal connectivity in rivers must not be simply technological or relegated to protected areas they require ecological understanding of river ecosystems and sustained social cultural and political engagement we recommend that experts from different research fields i e engineering biology ecology geology agriculture science ecohydraulics social sciences pull together in order to promote the investigation of longitudinal barriers and respective conservation and restoration measures declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported acknowledgments the authors would like to thank pao fernandes garrido of the world fish migration foundation for all her advice and continued support and for providing the amber project s initial questionnaire draft at an early stage of this work in early 2019 the communication with the researchers in the original amber questionnaire eduardo vicente dopico rodrigues and eva garcia vazques universidad de oviedo spain is also appreciated 
961,an inventory of anthropogenic barriers to longitudinal river connectivity in greece is presented based on an extensive literature review we mapped greece s 275 major dams and developed an ongoing inventory of 661 other barriers compiled from various sources we further summarized future dam barriers as published in greece s river basin area management plans environmental professionals and engineers were also interviewed to investigate perceptions and preferences concerning longitudinal river connectivity fish were given priority as reference organisms in questionnaire responses the reviewed literature and relevant legislation but other biodiversity elements were rarely addressed dams prevail as the most prominent perceived barrier pressures while most respondents seem to recognize problems with other barrier types as well however mention of small barrier infrastructure in the literature or legislation is very scarce and there is no systematic inventory of in stream infrastructure barriers fish passes or other barrier mitigation or restoration interventions recommendations for particular unmet needs and opportunities for restoration of a variety of barrier types are addressed it is crucial that attention for preservation and restoration measures involving lotic waters connectivity issues be introduced in the country s eu inspired water body management and within protected areas in particular keywords river fragmentation fish dams restoration fish passes mediterranean rivers 1 introduction rivers have been characterized as biodiversity hotlines being networks of linearly connected ecosystems décamps 2011 river corridor networks are also considered socio ecological systems that provide humans with a multitude of ecosystem services jafary et al 2018 kourtis and tsihrintzis 2017 nava lópez et al 2016 tsihrintzis et al 1995 vörösmarty et al 2010 weigelhofer et al 2021 however river ecosystems have been extensively altered by humans and they now face a global environmental crisis dudgeon 2019 reid et al 2019 human induced flow alteration habitat degradation and loss of connectivity are principal impacts which affect biodiversity in rivers worldwide gonzález del tánago et al 2016 palmer and ruhi 2019 the importance of longitudinal connectivity in particular was realized rather late in river conservation science pringle 2006 but its prominence in assessment and restoration today is paramount duarte et al 2021 seliger and zeiringer 2018 longitudinal connectivity sustains many ecosystem processes such as species movements ecological succession genetic exchange material and energy flows and riparian zone resources and conditions bueno et al 1995 campbell grant et al 2007 fuller et al 2015 naiman et al 2005 olaya marín et al 2012 anthropogenic loss of longitudinal connectivity refers to the artificial breaks in natural continuity created by a variety of artificial structures such as dams weirs sluices ramps road crossings culverts and various river engineering works including anti erosion and flood risk reduction engineering works currently only about one third of the world s rivers longer than 1000 km remain free flowing over their entire length grill et al 2019 while in europe more than one million artificial barriers have been recorded amber consortium 2020 belletti et al 2020 moreover over half of the length of the continent s river networks is considered impaired for diadromous fish species duarte et al 2021 especially in areas where severe water stress fragments streams due to artificial desiccation such as in the mediterranean basin connectivity problems are often accentuated various types of dam structures especially for small hydropower are increasing the numbers of barriers to fish movement throughout the mediterranean basin and especially in the balkans freyhof et al 2020 furthermore the percentage of fragmented streams is enlarged if we account for small in stream infrastructures which are often overlooked belletti et al 2020 garcia de leaniz 2020 there is poor documentation of many in stream infrastructure barriers documenting and assessing impacts is difficult because of their small size high frequency of occurrence and poorly studied effects on the biota and ecosystem integrity branco et al 2017 fullerton et al 2010 januchowski hartley et al 2020 the result has been a rapid recent decline in river longitudinal connectivity and integrity this issue has gained broad relevance in policy driven water management and restoration in recent years amber consortium 2020 carvajal quintero et al 2017 river connectivity restoration is currently an important target in eu environment policy including the water framework directive 2000 60 ec hereafter wfd and the recently drafted biodiversity strategy for 2030 european commission 2020 to achieve good ecological status which is the main goal of the wfd the re establishment of the system s longitudinal connectivity should be seen as a prime restoration concern mader and maier 2008 the eu biodiversity strategy strives to put europe on the path to ecological recovery by 2030 proposing the restoration of at least 25 000 km of eu rivers to a free flowing state i e without longitudinal barriers effective fish and wildlife passage and undisturbed fish migration is principally a component for restoring and sustainably managing watersheds papadaki et al 2020 barrier removal is a recent and common practice to improve river connectivity and it can also boost the river engineering sector and local socioeconomic development amber consortium 2020 however efforts targeting restoration in mediterranean rivers have lagged behind and there are many difficulties specific to mediterranean climate rivers kondolf et al 2013 skoulikidis et al 2017 in terms of the implementation of restoration investments knowledge and experience in connectivity assessment and restoration is lacking in most mediterranean countries often restoration actions are blocked by insufficient funding for specific actions conflicting interests among different stakeholders and low political priority given to restoration cortina segarra et al 2021 fishes are potentially good indicators of longitudinal connectivity rodeles et al 2020 rodeles et al 2021 wolter et al 2021 they have been chosen as an organism

fish populations offer many ecosystem services lynch et al 2016 many of these are appreciated differently by different cultures and societal groups efforts to ensure fish assemblage integrity and population maintenance even in the face of development include many fish passage mechanisms and connectivity enhancement projects hydroelectric power plants large scale water abstraction and water transfers can act as environmental filters strongly selecting functional traits of the ichthyofauna causing decline of fish populations and diversity erős et al 2018 hermoso et al 2018 oliveira et al 2018 greece typically faces many longitudinal connectivity problems which are also widespread in the balkans and the european mediterranean countries but there has been little reference to river barrier problems for conservation kagalou and latinopoulos 2020 tachos et al 2021 zogaris et al 2017 besides very few references on the effects of large dams on threatened fish species stoumboudi et al 2019 little is ever mentioned about small sized instream barriers restoration proposals have largely overlooked river barrier problems since greece has lagged behind other european countries in river water body monitoring and restoration economou et al 2016 kanakoudis et al 2015 and effective protected area management kati et al 2021 vlami et al 2021 zogaris et al 2017 the aims of the present study were a document knowledge and resources available with concern for lotic longitudinal connectivity in greece and provide an initial inventory b identify knowledge gaps and c provide initial recommendations for policy relevant research and technical developments we hope that through this screening level review we can establish a framework for inquiry into artificial barriers in river basins in greece 2 materials and methods 2 1 barrier maps the barrier inventory in the present study focused on dams but it also provides the first preliminary compilation of smaller longitudinal barriers based on the international commission on large dams a dam is defined as large when the height between the lowest foundation and the crest is greater than 15 m or when the height is between 5 and 15 m and the impounding is more than 3 106 m3 icold 2011 for the present effort the registry of greek large dams in operation provided by the greek committee on large dams greek committee on large dams 2013 was used after validation and update and after including large dams under construction additionally the registry of small dams and artificial reservoirs of the ministry of rural development and food of greece hellenic ministry of rural development and food 2006 and the on line registry of land reclamation projects of ministry of rural development and food of greece hellenic ministry of rural development and food 2020 were reviewed it should be noted that in some cases details concerning the technical characteristics height and capacity of the structures were missing in the available archives and online databases in such cases the dams were classified as small data on other in stream barriers or smaller fragmentation structures were compiled utilizing amber barrier tracking atlas which is a eu wide citizen science platform amber consortium 2020 and ongoing efforts to compile in stream barriers at the hellenic centre for marine research hcmr the methodology and format for the inventory is developed using a geographical information system platform arcgis as described in mentzafou et al 2019 our inventory of non dam barriers is an ongoing work in progress and we provide a snapshot of the compilation as of writing july 2021 2 2 literature review and patterns in publication activity a systematic literature review to identify studies that investigate river connectivity in greece was performed web of science and google scholar were reviewed in both english and greek languages for all studies published till the end of 2020 using selected relevant keywords we used google scholar for grey literature and isi web of knowledge for scientific papers a combination of keywords was employed a ts river connectivity or river continuum or dam or fish pass or fish pass or fish ladder and greece or hellas or greek or eastern mediterranean and the same words in the greek language see tables a1 and a2 in appendix for specific word combinations used the papers and documents from the initial search were screened in terms of their abstract contents as a general rule if the abstract was unclear or any uncertainty surrounded its inclusion it was included for the next stage of screening the next stage included full text screening all articles generated by this strategy were exported into an excel database finally we reviewed the first edition of greece s river basin management plans rbmps 2009 2015 updated and published in 2017 http wfdver ypeka gr en home en for all 14 rbmp districts table a3 in appendix future dam projects are mapped within the 14 rbmp districts 2 3 questionnaire survey a survey was conducted using a questionnaire that was based on a study exploring professional attitudes towards dams and reservoirs within the eu h2020 project adaptive management of barriers in european rivers amber 2017 ue 16 amber 689682 the questionnaire was designed to capture perceptions of specialists and special interest stakeholders who have experience and interest in river science they included relevant post graduate students environmental scientists engineers environmental non governmental organization professionals and other relevant practitioners and conservationists rather than striving for a representative sample of the wider population the questionnaire was distributed to participants in a workshop organized by the hcmr and the world fish migration foundation river conservation actions national amber meeting may 8th 2019 athens and also to national technical university of athens ntua water resources and environmental engineering msc students on march 10th 2020 a total of 70 subjects responded in particular the aims of the questionnaire were to investigate the attitudes of respondents on i the benefits of dams to different kind of services ii the impacts of the establishment of dams and different forms of barriers and iii the need of mitigation plans for dam impacts the questionnaire consisted of 12 fix response questions and basic demographic data of the respondents was also collected gender age educational level occupation each questionnaire item was measured using a five level likert scale where score 1 corresponded to totally disagree and 5 to totally agree descriptive analysis of the responses was compiled in tables or bar graphs nonparametric analysis and specifically the spearman correlation coefficient was carried out to check association between the questions internal consistency and reliability of the questionnaire were assessed using cronbach s alpha coefficient i e values of more than 0 7 indicate good internal consistency bolarinwa 2015 tavakol and dennick 2011 graphical and statistical analyses were conducted in microsoft excel and r r core team 2020 the questionnaire is provided in the appendix table a4 3 results 3 1 status of river connectivity in greece the initial map of dams provides data for 111 small dams and 164 large dams in the hellenic territory some high dams are created for water storage on small islands and are usually storage basins on non perennial streams i e intermittent and ephemerally flowing streams most high dams have been constructed in western and northern greece while many small dams are located in northeastern greece fig 1 the latter are in many cases very small reservoirs interest in tracking and assessing barriers other than dams is very recent and poorly developed in greece this is shown by participation in the amber project s barrier tracker application that assisted in the development of our ongoing non dam barrier inventory fig 2 the initial map of non dam barriers includes only 208 contributions from the barrier tracker citizen science platform 661 mapped in total most of these are registered by scientists from hcmr and there is a biased concentration of barriers in some parts of greece such as in eastern central greece where recent hcmr projects are exploring barrier assessments this map is obviously grossly incomplete in showing the current state of non dam barriers but it is an indicative snapshot of current efforts to track barriers greece currently has 14 river basins districts rbds designated in 2010 while the national monitoring network according to the wfd provisions was established in 2011 hellenic parliament 2011 many proposed dams and other water storage structures are officially planned by the government for water management especially high dam numbers target western and north central greece fig 3 table a3 in appendix 3 2 literature review a lack of data on dams and other barriers was evident from the literature review grey literature studies were scarce n 96 fig 4 the review in the greek language compiled 36 theses bsc and msc dissertations of which the majority have a limited reference to river connectivity usually only with a short notice one or few paragraphs about the impacts of dams on the environment and or the ichthyofauna only two phd dissertations make a more substantial contribution with respect to the diptych dam fish but only in a wider context of fish morphology and genetics in a river with strong presence of large dams nestos river sapounidis 2014 and environmental flows papadaki 2018 eight technical reports and the 14 rbmp were grouped together in the category technical reports most of technical reports 6 of 8 were written by hcmr researchers and they used the definition of longitudinal connectivity and its value in fish movements an abbreviated synopsis for the country s rbmp is given in the appendix most relevant conference papers refer to dam and small hydropower plant construction and to fish pass technical designs there is a record in a conference paper in which authors only exalt the large hydropower projects and state that flora and fauna could be enhanced by this kind of project stefanakos et al 2013 recent popular articles mostly by ngos a few individual researchers and citizen groups highlight the risk of loss of connectivity in biodiversity and river integrity others results fig 4 of the grey literature review mainly include environmental impact studies university lecture notes etc scientific papers and other peer reviewed publications were similarly limited to a small number n 40 with a slight increase in recent years fig 4 crivelli et al 1995 first mentioned the negative effects on fish diversity and disappearance of eels and wels catfish after the 1982 construction of a new higher dam at kerkini reservoir strymonas river greece after that sparse works were published often with obscure and uncertain relation to barriers and their impacts five recent papers engage other organisms especially macroinvertebrates others referred to different types of connectivity e g lateral or to different kind of impacts of dams e g sedimentation others refer to different causes for loss of connectivity e g drought others to environmental flows and or technical fish pass design finally we should note that we did not find a widespread generic term for longitudinal barrier in the greek language the term φραγμός was introduced for such barriers during an eu amber project collaboration with the co authors of this paper in 2019 3 3 questionnaire survey 3 3 1 demographic profile according to the sample analyzed 70 respondents 36 were female 51 4 and 34 male 48 6 table 1 as regards to the educational level of respondents 94 66 respondents were highly educated and only 5 7 4 respondents were of upper educational level table 1 3 3 2 benefits and services from dams services that respondents considered beneficial from dam reservoirs were ranked based on five classes of assigned importance fig 5 water storage water transfer was the service perceived to be the most beneficial by damming with scores higher than 4 79 agriculture and livestock flood control and economic development followed with percentages 64 59 and 51 respectively on the contrary lower beneficial values had the categories faunal and floral biodiversity natural environment sport fishing and tourism and recreation with 70 69 46 and 44 negative responses scores 1 and 2 cultural heritage was also considered as less beneficial 63 with many respondents undecided 27 3 3 3 impacts perceived the perceptions of respondents about the impacts of dams and barriers all forms weir sluice road fords etc to biodiversity and hydromorphology are depicted in fig 6 firstly critical impacts score 5 are recognized in all the categories the majority of responses 4 and 5 scores highlighted fish as the most negatively affected element of biodiversity secondly hydromorphological conditions and habitats were also identified as sustaining significant pressures by dams and barriers other aquatic fauna and plants vegetation followed terrestrial fauna was evaluated as the biodiversity element with the slight or nearly no negative impacts results between dams and barriers all forms followed a similar pattern 3 3 4 opinion about dams and reservoirs more than half of the respondents 55 believe that dams and associated reservoirs benefit people in multiple ways and a similar portion of them 49 agree that they are necessary fig 7 the majority perceive that anthropogenic pressures dams and reservoirs negatively impact the environment while dams 53 of the respondents and barriers of all kinds 56 are considered one of the most significant pressure for greek river ecological integrity a high percentage of respondents 80 noted that migration of aquatic species is blocked by barriers dams and all forms included despite the fact that some of them 41 find them aesthetically pleasing however according to 65 of respondents the subject remains a source of conflict more than half 58 are not convinced of the usefulness of environmental flows and fish passes as mitigation measures whereas they are divided about the significance of a measure like removing dams barriers only 32 deemed dam removal as a positive or potential prospect in greece moreover 66 admit that designation of protected areas could be an effective management measure spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate the dependence between the different questions the produced correlation matrix which contains the correlation coefficients was plotted visually using a correlogram fig 8 as depicted in the correlogram the strongest correlation appeared between the questions 5 and 7 p 0 76 reflecting the solid accordance that both dams and barriers all forms are both considered significant anthropogenic pressures significant positive correlation p 0 5 is conspicuous between questions 2b and 2c 2b and 5 2b and 7 2c and 5 2c and 7 medium negative correlation p 0 4 is noted between the questions 2c and 9 suggesting that the majority of respondents who believe that river fauna migration is blocked by dams disagree with the opinion that the issue of removing dams barriers in greece is insignificant compared to other environmental problems despite subjects being exposed to different questions about potential impacts of damming and restoration measures the survey reflected adequately the respondent s opinion until the end of the questionnaire concordance between the answers in questions with positive and negative statements was observed cronbach s alpha was calculated at 0 78 which indicates good internal consistency this questionnaire structure can thus be considered reliable for understanding the social attitudes towards dams and reservoirs 4 discussion 4 1 interpreting review results artificial barrier inventory and assessment in running waters is a challenging task this is difficult in a country with many small and seasonally dry river basins river basin areas smaller than 700 km2 cover about half of the greek territory most large dams are concentrated in greece s larger basins while many recently created dam like water storage structures such as irrigation reservoirs in the islands are on non perennially flowing river networks thus differing from typical river barrier dams athanasopoulos et al 2006 moreover there are many dams on four of the five transboundary large river basins shared by greece and its balkan neighbours of these only the aoos vjose does not have many high dams yet but there are new dam proposals in the albanian section of this river the maps of dam and other barriers produced in our compilation are indicative but this may not do justice to the large number of other small longitudinal barriers to natural connectivity there is evidence that there are many other small infrastructure barriers in greece chatzinikolaou et al 2011 however there is no completed nation wide inventory the respondents to our survey were well aware of general dam impacts to connectivity and this included small barrier impacts as well in fact responses for dams and all forms of barriers closely parallel each other showing that even non dam barriers were perceived to have similar negative impacts to connectivity as do large dams by the group of relevant professionals surveyed in contrast the perceived services and benefits provided by dams and their reservoirs to people were lower than expected in the questionnaire responses the dam reservoir values for faunal or floral biodiversity and cultural heritage were perceived at the lowest position in the benefits hierarchy by the survey respondents in our opinion this may have to do with polarization due to recent dam building controversies in greece modern dam construction for hydropower and water transfers has produced significant environmental conflict in greece tyralis et al 2017 of course there are well known positive values such as the tourism values of certain dams reservoirs in greece namely plastiras dam reservoir and doxa reservoir sargentis et al 2021 the issue of the cultural values of free flowing rivers versus dammed rivers is still poorly explored andreopoulos et al 2015 vlami et al 2021 despite a potentially polarized view i e for or against dams a very low percentage of the respondents referred to a positive potential for dam removal in greece we attribute this to inexperience and low awareness of the opportunities and prospects of dam removal to our knowledge there has never been a demolition of a dam weir or other longitudinal barrier for ecological restoration purposes in greece 4 2 insights into impacts of artificial barriers in greece dams and or barriers have been identified as evidence based anthropogenic pressures rather recently particularly with concern for in stream biota koutrakis et al 2019 skoulikidis et al 2009 zogaris et al 2018 hydrology and hydromorphology ioannou et al 2009 coastal processes sylaios and kamidis 2017 sylaios et al 2012 2010 and riparian zones zaimes and iakovoglou 2021 it is widely recognized in greece that for several fish species there are serious problems with movements and migration due to barriers barbieri et al 2015 bobori et al 2001 cheimonopoulou et al 2011 kokkinakis 2007 leonardos 2015 sapounidis et al 2019 natural connectivity is important not just for migratory fish but fish dispersal and re colonization mechanisms after prolonged drought impacts vardakas et al 2017 however even within ichthyological research references are scant compared to other european countries and besides fish little work has been done on effects on other biota or at the ecosystem landscape or basin coastal zone scale in greece furthermore it is well known that disruption of longitudinal connectivity can affect many other organisms including mammals scorpio et al 2016 sonkar and gaurav 2020 amphibians dare et al 2020 peek et al 2018 macroinvertebrates hamstead et al 2019 leiva et al 2017 plants and vegetation patterns johansson et al 1996 merritt and wohl 2006 birds lacko et al 2018 and coastal marine fish and invertebrates drinkwater and frank 1994 mediterranean rivers are remarkably heterogeneous and show extreme flow variability often naturally disconnected due to drought and desiccation during part of the year rincón et al 2017 the effects of dams and other barriers on mediterranean climate area rivers may be very different from other temperate climate areas kondolf et al 2013 this is therefore an understudied topic in greece identifying barriers to connectivity and assessing impacts is not straightforward brismar 2004 especially if barriers are not particularly targeted in assessment and monitoring schemes in greece barriers as hydromorphological degradation have only recently been assessed within standard survey protocols especially using on site assessment methods chatzinikolaou et al 2006 vlami et al 2019 zaimes and iakovoglou 2021 transverse structures are commonly recorded using the spanish qbr protocol in greece despite the very short longitudinal distance of on site survey segments chatzinikolaou et al 2011 latsiou et al 2021 however the assessment of the importance of barriers as degradation to river corridors varies a recent country wide review found that small in stream infrastructure modifications including barriers appear to play a lesser role in the morphological impacts recorded on site based river surveys using the river habitat survey protocol hereafter rhs in greece stefanidis et al 2020 rhs applications using 500 m long river survey segments may not adequately assess connectivity decline over the wider basin in contrast records of barriers especially those downstream of fish sampling sites are prevalent in nation wide fish based assessments with reference to barrier impacts at river segment and basin scales zogaris et al 2018 in our opinion ichthyological surveys may be more sensitive in recording longitudinal barriers since they presumably impact fish communities however many small barriers may be under reported and perhaps under appreciated in other monitoring protocols recent reviews show that barrier under reporting appears very high across eastern europe and the balkans 76 98 underreporting and also in greece 97 garcia de leaniz 2020 hydropower development is a very important water management issue in recent years a very large number of small hydroelectric power projects are planned in greece rae 2021 the number of proposals is akin to a development boom in the renewable resources sector as a whole kati et al 2021 although initially promoted as an environmentally friendly solution malesios and arabatzis 2010 small hydropower locations are sometimes controversial serious impacts are often revealed especially where there are large numbers of projects being developed within formerly wild areas or within protected areas lange et al 2019 weiss et al 2018 renewable resource development particularly through small hydro and wind power also promote an increase in roads and this situation creates additive and synergistic negative impacts for fragmentation of riverine corridors at the landscape scale often even within protected areas kati et al 2020 the current situation in greece echoes other areas with dense concentrations of proposed small hydropower couto and olden 2018 and these may be a cause for an outstanding increase in the number of new artificial barriers in the coming years weiss et al 2018 fishways fish passes or fish ladders management techniques providing passage through a barrier have a long history with a growing interest in recent years katopodis and williams 2012 silva et al 2018 however there are still technical limitations and knowledge gaps about management success of fish passes in general celestino et al 2020 kemp 2016 lennox et al 2019 lira et al 2017 pelicice et al 2020 silva et al 2018 in eastern mediterranean inland waters fish passes in cyprinid rivers are still very scarce sanz ronda et al 2019 other mitigation approaches such as human assisted transportation of fishes upstream of dam barriers have been attempted in greece and in our opinion this requires further monitoring koutrakis et al 2007 our review confirms that in greece there is no inventory of fish passes while a very few recent studies have been conducted on the technical design of fishways and for fish related management e g mitsopoulos et al 2020 stamou et al 2018 on an anecdotal note the authors have observed fish passes that are not maintained and do not function properly in several occasions in greece finally barriers may produce impacts that may influence other aspects of river corridors and their landscapes including ecosystem services kagalou and latinopoulos 2020 development of specific reviews or indicators is still poorly applied in greece e g vlami et al 2021 furthermore in our opinion citizen science is also poorly developed in greece and barrier tracking amber consortium 2020 is not yet widely practiced by non professionals 4 3 barriers in river basin management and restoration planning in greece the 14 river basins districts rbds and national monitoring networks have been in place just over a decade our review suggests that the issue of barriers especially small barriers is often overlooked or is intentionally sidelined within the scope of promoting small hydroelectric developments often specifically published within official regional river basin management plans indicative of this is that only five of the 14 rbds mention specific restoration or mitigation measures for dams i e fish passes in particular see appendix table a3 kanakoudis et al 2015 stress weaknesses with regards to qualitative assessment of greece s rbmps which should better document and promote the prioritization of the programme of measures other researchers mention the need of a scientific framework for developing measures that pay closer attention to biodiversity and ecological restoration zogaris et al 2017 and support ecosystems services as well kagalou and latinopoulos 2020 in greece restoration action for rivers and running waters in general has lagged behind other eu states zogaris et al 2017 modern methods for assessing hydromorphological degradation and prescribing specific ecological restoration have only begun recently dimitriou and stavroulaki 2018 mentzafou et al 2016 ourloglou et al 2020 zogaris et al 2018 recommendations or plans for dismantling in stream infrastructure for fish movements are still scarce very few studies have promoted specific barrier removal guidelines or proposals dimitriou et al 2015 moreover with regards to climate change preparation forecasting and adaptation with respect to issues of infrastructural barriers on rivers most focus has been on declines or changes in flow with very scarce mention of biota and the compounding effects of barriers e g kokkoris et al 2019 papadaki et al 2016 drastic changes in natural flow regime resulting from water abstraction and water retention by dams have become challenging concerns and are augmented by climate warming trends especially in the mediterranean basin feio et al 2021 finally as in several other accounts abroad in greece climate change prospects may also function as drivers to design and build more dams and water storage facilities in the near future oki and kanae 2006 rincón et al 2017 we are certain that conflicts related to water storage and barriers to longitudinal connectivity will continue to increase in the near future in greece 4 4 recommendations the importance of inventory and registering barriers and assessing impacts is paramount there have been calls for this in recent publications januchowski hartley et al 2020 king et al 2017 segurado et al 2013 fishways and fish ladders should not be seen as absolute technological fixes they may not always be adequate for mitigation and movement of fish or other biota helfman 2007 rincón et al 2017 the removal of artificial barriers that no longer provide human benefits or provide particular services should be considered as a sustainable solution that also restores wider ecosystem connectivity an important aspect of ecological restoration seliger and zeiringer 2018 planning for and prioritizing barrier removal should be promoted in greece as has begun in other mediterranean climate areas branco et al 2014 restoration opportunities should be developed as best practice examples especially within protected areas such as within the eu natura 2000 network hermoso et al 2019 adjusting and applying new river engineering methods and nature based solutions is critically important in greece especially where developments occur within sensitive protected areas efforts to change traditional designs and operation methods when building bridges culverts ramps embankments and anti erosion measures olden and naiman 2010 should be widely promoted in order to preserve and restore connectivity and to facilitate the dispersal of organisms and fluxes of water and sediment that create and maintain natural conditions within in stream and riparian habitats biodiversity and natural history knowledge should better inform river management gilman et al 2004 the effects of barriers vary greatly in space and time poff and hart 2002 and in many cases simple actions such as small infrastructure removal have shown remarkable changes birnie gauvin et al 2018 in summary we recommend the following actions a national inventory of artificial barriers in all inland waters concentrating on lotic drainages but also in lakes wetlands and transitional waters assessment surveys of all established fish passes and other such works in an effort to improve poorly functioning fish passage works new protocols and new technology development should be used to assess fish passability of barriers and to design infrastructure that limits connectivity loss specific research on the migratory and movement dispersal requirements of endemic range restricted and threatened fish and aquatic invertebrate species small and large barrier removal should be designed and promoted within wfd restoration and biodiversity conservation in rivers and other waterways exclusion zones for dam and barrier development should be set up in order to preserve rivers that provide outstanding natural and cultural heritage values including wild and scenic rivers an increase in relevant scientific research focusing on longitudinal barriers their impact and practical solutions finally among the primary conclusions drawn in this review is the necessity of additional public education and awareness regarding barriers and their assessment as anthropogenic pressures an important issue is communication and sensitization of a variety of stakeholders barriers are still a poorly charted issue in greece participatory approaches such as citizen science and specialized on site training through the use of rapid assessment protocols could promote a wider participation and sensitization of both the public and management practitioners twardek et al 2020 outreach and education efforts to bring about a wider river barrier literacy among the public and stakeholders should be widely promoted 5 conclusions the purpose of this paper was to establish a framework for inquiry into artificial barriers in river basins in greece within data scarce conditions specific inroads were made including a review of scientific and relevant gray literature including wfd policy applications in 14 river basin districts b survey via questionnaire with a set of specialists and c specific recommendations for action solutions to restoring longitudinal connectivity in rivers must not be simply technological or relegated to protected areas they require ecological understanding of river ecosystems and sustained social cultural and political engagement we recommend that experts from different research fields i e engineering biology ecology geology agriculture science ecohydraulics social sciences pull together in order to promote the investigation of longitudinal barriers and respective conservation and restoration measures declaration of

962,in arid semiarid regions understanding the mechanisms by which vegetation change and climate change affect the regional water balance is important for the development of effective measures and for guiding vegetation restoration and adapting to climate change in this study we utilize the budyko equation and dual source evapotranspiration models to assess the impacts of vegetation change and climate change on the runoff in china s yellow river basin yrb the aims of the study are as follows 1 apply a well formulated budyko framework dual source evapotranspiration model to explore the eco hydrological controls of the regional water balance 2 precisely assess the contribution of vegetation change precipitation change temperature change wind speed change the relative humidity change and radiation change to the decreased runoff the results indicated that vegetation change was the dominant factor affecting the reduction of runoff in the upper reaches above lanzhou toudaoguai longmen sanmenxia and huayuankou and the contributions were 80 4 58 4 52 5 46 9 39 7 and 41 6 respectively in lanzhou taodaoguai longmen and sanmenxia the precipitation change was the second affecting factor and the contributions were 20 8 31 6 30 0 and 35 2 respectively in huayuankou and lijin the relative humidity change was the second affecting factor and the contributions were 26 8 and 35 0 respectively 3 as the vegetation coverage or the leaf area index lai increased the runoff decreased linearly keywords vegetation change climate change runoff change yellow river basin 1 introduction the interactions between vegetation climate and hydrology are very complicated numerous efforts have been made to study the impacts of climate change on runoff sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 zheng et al 2009 ma et al 2010 an increase in precipitation can directly increase the amounts of runoff while other climate factors such as temperature wind speed and relative humidity affect water resources by increasing or decreasing the amount of evapotranspiration mu et al 2017 zhou et al 2006 the investigation of the impact of vegetation coverage changes on hydrology is also an area of significant research interest over the last 50 years important studies regarding of the impact of vegetation change on runoff have been conducted and some researchers bosch et al 1982 yu et al 1989 farley et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 have proposed that evapotranspiration increases as the vegetation coverage increases and thus runoff decreases however other researchers sun et al 2001 liu et al 2002 have proposed different outcomes and they have suggested runoff increases with vegetation coverage increases zhou et al 2001 and wang et al 2004 reported that the scale of the study area is an important factor that causes variations in the calculation results they noted that on a smaller scale there is a large proportion of vegetation transpiration but deforestation decreases the amount of transpiration and enhances runoff however on a larger scale deforestation decreases the flood regulation effect of the forest and causes a decrease in the common runoff period several researchers have quantified the impact of climate variability and human activities on runoff liang et al 2015a reported the impacts of climate change and ecological restoration on streamflow changes the leaf area index lai is also an important factor in runoff processes cao et al 2018 reported that as the lai increases the runoff decreases luo et al 2020 reported that the increases in vegetation coverage have led to runoff reductions of 48 0 33 2 and 20 2 in global arid semi arid and sub humid regions respectively which were larger than climate change induced runoff changes in these three regions gao et al 2019 selected the wei river basin in the loess plateau to study the vegetation change influence on runoff and the results suggested that vegetation restoration was the dominant factor affecting variation in runoff the budyko framework is an empirical relation among evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration and precipitation observed across a variety of landscapes and biomes around the world it was first established in 1974 and since then the budyko curve has been gradually used by many researchers to explore the ecohydrological controls of the soil water balance fu et al 1981 milly et al 1994 zhang et al 1999 2001 yang et al 2006 2007 donohue et al 2007 yang et al 2008 arora 2002 proposed a function to assess the response of runoff to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet and the viability of the equation in the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin was verified by guo et al 2015 and huang et al 2016 the prediction error was 4 to 25 but the arora equation did not contain a vegetation parameter so it cannot be used to directly determine the impacts of vegetation change on runoff choudhury 1999 developed an equation and used a parameter named n in the equation to represent the catchment characteristics but the parameter n is caused by several factors such as the soil properties slope vegetation cover and climate seasonality so it is difficult to estimate using the budyko curve gentine et al 2012 studied the ecohydrological controls of the soil water balance of more than 300 catchments the results showed the budyko equation could be used to constrain land surface parameterizations in ungauged basins or general circulation models bi et al 2020 analyzed the contribution of vegetation change human activities and climate change impact on runoff in the kuye basin of the yrb using the budyko hypothesis the results showed the contribution of the vegetation change was 84 9 and that of climate change and human activities was 9 3 and 5 8 respectively based on the budyko hypothesis li and xia 2018 reported that precipitation and vegetation change were the primary influence factors that resulted in a runoff reduction in the zhujiang basin li et al 2020 chose three tributary sub catchments of the yellow river to attribute runoff variations to climate change and human activities by improving the budyko elasticity model and the results suggested that vegetation change accounted for 92 of the decline in runoff to summarize what has been mentioned above there have been several papers quantifying human activities vegetation change and climate change impact on runoff changes in various basins of the world and some of them have reported on the contribution of vegetation change and climate change to runoff decline in the yellow river basin in these papers the affecting factors on runoff were only simply divided into two parts vegetation change climate change or human activities and climate change for quantifying the contribution to the decreased runoff however no studies have precisely assessed the contribution of all the factors including vegetation coverage lai precipitation temperature wind speed relative humidity and radiation and there is no unified understanding regarding the impact of vegetation change on runoff hence further studies need to be conducted in this study the yellow river basin yrb was selected to quantify the impacts of climate change and vegetation change on the runoff by using the budyko framework combined with the dual source evapotranspiration model the novelty of our research consists of the following aims 1 apply a well formulated budyko framework dual source evapotranspiration model to explore the eco hydrological controls of the regional water balance 2 precisely assess the contribution of vegetation coverage lai precipitation temperature wind speed the relative humidity and radiation to the decreased runoff 3 investigate the impacts of vegetation coverage lai precipitation and temperature on regional runoff change 2 study area and study period 2 1 study area the yrb is in northern china fig 1 the study area is approximately 5 400 km long with a drainage area of 795 2 103 km2 and over 70 of the total area is in an arid semiarid region mcvicar et al 2007 the average precipitation is approximately 444 13 mm and primarily occurs from june to september with 60 70 of the annual total rainfall occurring in the form of high intensity rainstorms there are approximately 2 555 hours of sunshine per year the average temperature is 5 62 c the average relative humidity is 54 8 and the average wind speed is 5 4 m s 1 soil erosion is the primary ecological problem in the yrb since the 1950s the chinese government has implemented a series of ecological restoration projects to prevent further severe soil erosion ran et al 2000 in 1999 a large scale conservation campaign the grain for green gfg project was implemented by converting farmland into forest and grassland liang et al 2015b the vegetation coverage fr and lai underwent noticeable changes in the yrb because the land surface conditions and climate conditions have changed obviously the runoff in the yrb has significantly decreased in the last 50 years mu et al 2010 therefore it is necessary to assess its effects on the water resources of the area in this study the sub catchment of the yrb that consists of the upper reaches above lanzhou toudaoguai longmen sanmenxia huayuankou and lijin were selected to quantify the impacts of climate and vegetation change on water resource changes the details of these catchments and changes in their hydrometeorological variables are presented in table 1 2 2 data the annual runoff natural river flow q data from 1966 to 2015 were

surface either from transpiration pt or from soil water in the root zone pe is one of the key inputs in hydrological modeling the pet is not only controlled by the meteorological parameters but it also changes due to vegetation changes the dual source evapotranspiration model eqs 1 3 and the monthly meteorological data were used as input in this study and these have been widely used to measure the pet since it can clearly reveal the variations in the pet due to dynamic changes in the vegetation the models are expressed yang et al 2012 guan et al 2009 as 1 pet pe pt 2 pe δ a s 1 f r ρ c p d

3 3 decomposition method we divided the total change in q q into two parts liang et al 2015a one part was caused by climate change q cc and the other was caused by vegetation change qvc q can be estimated as the average annual q during period 2 i e 1991 2015 minus the average annual q during period 1 i e 1966 1990 this relationship can be expressed as follows 33 δ q δ q c c δ q v c similarly q cc can be decomposed in parts such as change caused by the precipitation change qpc change caused by the temperature change qtc change caused by the wind speed change quc change caused by the relative humidity change qrhc and change caused by the radiation change qrc it can be estimated as follows 34 δ q c c δ q p c δ q t c δ q u c δ q r h c δ q r c first we used the dual source evapotranspiration model eqs 1 27 to evaluate the potential evapotranspiration pet and then we used the penman model to validate it second we used the budyko framework eqs 28 32 to evaluate the total change in q q and the natural river flow to validate it third we held the climate variables p t u rh and r n constant and evaluated the qvc using eqs 1 33 fourth we held the vegetation variables lai and fr constant and evaluated the qcc similarly using eqs 1 34 we held lai fr t u rh and r n constant and evaluated qpc we then held lai fr p u rh and r n constant and evaluated qtc we held lai fr p t rh and r n constant and evaluated q uc we held lai fr p t u and r n constant and evaluated q rhc finally we held lai fr p t rh and u constant and evaluated q rc 3 4 reference evapotranspiration in this study the reference evapotranspiration ret mm was used to validate the accuracy of the equations in estimating the potential evapotranspiration pet the ret was estimated allen et al 1998 as 35

w and z w have the same meanings as in eq 20 4 results 4 1 changes in the climate hydrometeorological and vegetation variables as is shown in table 2 the annual lai and fr from 1982 2015 significantly increased the rates of change of the lai and fr were 0 01 0 009 0 008 0 008 0 006 and 0 006 m2 m 2 yr 1 and 0 70 0 70 0 70 0 90 0 80 and 0 80 yr 1 in lanzhou toudaoguai longmen sanmenxia huayuankou and lijin respectively the precipitation over the 6 catchments decreased from 0 11 mm yr 1 to 0 35 mm yr 1 during 1966 2015 during the same period rh significantly decreased in longmen sanmenxia huayuankou and lijin and u significantly decreased in lanzhou toudaoguai longmen sanmenxia and huayuankou the annual q significantly decreased from 1 3 to 3 8 108 m3 yr 1 t increased from 0 01 to 0 02 c yr 1 with a significant increase in lijin 4 2 validation of the dual source evapotranspiration model and the budyko framework by applying eqs 1 27 to the monthly data sets the annual pet values for 1966 2015 in lanzhou toudaoguai longmen sanmenxia huayuankou and lijin were estimated we used eqs 35 36 to estimate the ret as is shown in fig 2 the pet and ret have a good relationship but the pet is larger than the ret at the six catchments this is primarily because the pet estimated using eqs 1 27 includes two parts the substrate evaporation pe and the vegetation transpiration pt but the ret only includes the vegetation transpiration pt the q estimated q estimated using eqs 28 32 was validated using the sites natural river flow q nature for 1966 2015 the validation sites included six hydrological stations lanzhou taodaoguai longmen sanmenxia huayuankou and lijin fig 1 the q nature was calculated using eq 37 and data provided by the china yellow river conservancy commission using eqs 28 32 we estimated the runoff changes q estimated in lanzhou taodaoguai longmen sanmenxia huayuankou and lijin a comparison of the q estimated and q nature values of the six validation sites is shown in table 3 in general the estimated runoff agrees well with the natural river flow q nature and the relative error for each site was less than 5 the q nature is estimated using q observed added to q consumption and q reservoir storage change so it could eliminate the influence of q consumption and q reservoir storage change on the decreased runoff 37 q nature q observed q consumption q reservoir storage change where q nature is the natural river flow q observed is the observed runoff at the hydrological station q consumption is the runoff consumed in the catchment above the hydrological station and q reservoir storage change is the runoff intercepted by the dams above the hydrological station which can be estimated as the reservoir storage at the end of the year minus the beginning the data of the q consumption and q reservoir storage change from 1966 to 1999 were provided by the china yellow river conservancy commission the data of the q consumption and q reservoir storage change from 2000 to 2015 were downloaded from http www yrcc gov cn zwzc gzgb gb szygb we distinguished two sub periods before and after 1990 this was because 1 the δ variation in eqs 28 32 refers to large spatial scales and longtime scales we used 25 years and guo et al 2015 also used 25 years such that changes in the subsurface storage of water and energy could be neglected arora 2002 guo et al 2015 and 2 the fr and lai underwent noticeable changes table 4 as shown in table 3 the q observed q observed period 1 is larger than q nature q nature period 1 this is because the runoff of the yrb is also highly influenced by other human activities such as the interception of the reservoirs and the consumption by humans in the catchments in this paper our purpose was to quantify the contribution of vegetation change and climate change to the decreased runoff using the dual source evapotranspiration model and the budyko framework hence we used q nature rather than q observed for attributing the runoff change for the following reasons 1 a decrease in q observed is primarily caused by climate change vegetation change q consumption and q reservoir storage change and in which vegetation change q consumption and q reservoir storage change are caused by human activities as shown in eqs 1 37 the dual source evapotranspiration model and budyko framework can clearly assess the impacts of climate change and vegetation change on decreased runoff but it cannot evaluate the influence of q consumption and q reservoir storage change 2 as shown in eq 37 the q nature has eliminated the influence of q consumption and q reservoir storage change hence we can conveniently use the evapotranspiration model and the budyko framework in other words q consumption and q reservoir storage change caused a reduction in q observed but it did not cause a reduction in q nature as q nature is estimated using q observed added to q consumption and q reservoir storage change eq 37 therefore if we use q nature we can assess the impacts of climate change and vegetation change without considering the effects of q consumption and q reservoir storage change the evaporation from the reservoirs was estimated using eq 2 4 3 quantitative contributions to a decrease in q as was described in section 3 3 the total q can simply be divided into the change in q caused by climate change qcc and the change in q caused by vegetation change qvc the climate change variables i e the precipitation change p and temperature change t and the vegetation change parameters fr and lai are all key variables that influence a change in runoff we used the following steps to quantify the contributions of the changes in the climate and vegetation variables to a decrease in q first we held the climate variables constant and used eqs 1 33 to estimate the change in q caused by the vegetation change qvc second we held the lai vegetation coverage fr and all the climate parameters except for the precipitation constant and used the eqs 1 34 to estimate the change in q caused by the precipitation change qpc third we held all the vegetation variables and all the climate parameters except for the temperature constant and estimated the change in q caused by temperature change qtc in the same way we held the other variables constant we estimated the change in q caused by the q uc q rhc and q rc fig 3 illustrates the contributions of vegetation change precipitation change temperature change relative humidity change wind speed change and radiation change to runoff change the vegetation change was the dominant factor leading to decreases in q in lanzhou taodaoguai longmen sanmenxia huayuankou and lijin and the contributions were 80 4 58 4 52 5 46 9 39 7 and 41 6 respectively in lanzhou taodaoguai longmen and sanmenxia the precipitation change was the second factor that caused a decrease in q and the contributions were 20 8 31 6 30 0 and 35 2 respectively whereas in huayuankou and lijin the relative humidity change was the second factor we also studied the relationship of temperature and precipitation r 0 04 and the change in temperature had no obvious influence on precipitation in yrb in this study we used the net radiation r n to evaluate the evapotranspiration and the changes in albedo was an important parameter used to calculate the change in r n liu et al 2006 therefore we considered the albedo changes and its contribution to evapotranspiration changes using the change in r n 4 4 impacts of climate change on runoff we assumed precipitation decreases of 10 60 compared to period 1 and held the lai vegetation coverage fr all the other climate variables constant then we estimated changes in q caused by precipitation change qpc for the six assumed levels using eqs 1 34 similarly we assumed temperature increases of 10 60 compared to period 1 and estimated the change in q caused by temperature change qtc for the six assumed levels fig 4 shows the increase in the runoff change with increasing temperature as the temperature increases the pet increases therefore according to the eq 28 the runoff should decrease liu et al 2017 gao et al 2017 fig 5 shows that the change in runoff decreases as precipitation increases gao et al 2017 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of vegetation change on runoff eqs 28 30 indicate that the pet and precipitation are the key factors that affect runoff liu et al 2016 li et al 2018 pet is closely related to vegetation change and therefore the vegetation parameters are also very important factors that influence changes in runoff feng et al 2017 cao et al 2018 li et al 2019 bi et al 2020 in this study first we assumed that the lai and vegetation coverage fr increased by 10 80 compared to period 1 and we held all the climate parameters constant then we evaluated the change in runoff using the dual source evapotranspiration model and the budyko framework finally we established an empirical equation that relates the runoff change lai and vegetation coverage fig 6 shows that greater lai and vegetation coverage fr values resulted in a greater change in runoff the regression analysis revealed that for the same vegetation coverage as the lai increases the runoff increases linearly p 0 01 table s1 the slope of the regression models between the lai and runoff changes increases with increasing vegetation coverage this suggests that for the same lai change the range of the runoff variation is greater when the vegetation coverage is greater table s2 shows the relationship between the runoff change and the vegetation coverage for different lai levels the regression analysis indicated that the runoff changes increase linearly with increasing vegetation coverage p 0 01 we compared the slopes of the linear regression models and we found that the greater the lai the greater the slope of the linear model this result indicates that the runoff is more sensitive to vegetation coverage at higher lai levels than at lower lai levels the restoration of the vegetation increased the pt but it decreased the pe however because the increase in the pt was greater than the decrease in the pe the total evapotranspiration of the catchments increased thus according to eq 28 the runoff should decrease similar findings have been reported previously zhou et al 2001 liu et al 2016 we also analyzed the relationships between the vegetation coverage lai and precipitation the increases in vegetation coverage and the lai had no obvious influence on precipitation zhou et al 1996 also reported the same results thus as the vegetation coverage and lai increased the degree of drought in the yrb increased liu et al 2017 and liu et al 2016 reported that in semi arid areas runoff will decrease when the forest and grass vegetation increases and the more arid the climate the more the runoff will decrease which is consistent with the results of this study 5 2 limitations and uncertainties the dual source evapotranspiration model predicted a highly accurate pet for the yellow river basin when the monthly meteorological data was used as input with the predicted pet and precipitation as input the budyko framework reflected accurate runoff variation as that found at a series of observation stations over the basin the model parameters were in their physical ranges despite the direct results of the water balance in the yrb there were still some limitations and uncertainties in the models and the study results 1 our study region is in arid zone or semiarid zone and it is unclear in the humid region whether the accuracy of the budyko framework and the dual source evapotranspiration model is still accurate and if the effects of the vegetation change and climate change on the changing hydrological cycle are positive or negative 2 the dual source evapotranspiration model parameter h c was simply set as 5 0 in this study and this should be used in a distributed way and related to the vegetation type and vegetation phenology 3 the δ variation in arora s equation arora 2002 eqs 28 30 refers to large spatial scales and longtime scales we used 1966 2015 but because of the lack of ndvi data for 1961 1981 we assumed the ndvi for 1961 1981 was equal to the value for 1982 and this may affect the accuracy of the results of the study 6 conclusions in this study we used the dual source evapotranspiration model and the budyko framework to examine the contributions of climate change and vegetation change to changes in the annual runoff in the yrb in china and to reveal the characteristics of and mechanisms by which the vegetation change and climate change impact the regional water balance in lanzhou taodaoguai longmen sanmenxia huayuankou and lijin the vegetation change was the dominant factor causing a decrease in runoff and the contributions were 80 4 58 4 52 5 46 9 39 7 and 41 6 respectively in lanzhou taodaoguai longmen and sanmenxia the change in precipitation was the second affecting factor with contributions of 20 8 31 6 30 0 and 35 2 respectively whereas in huayuankou and lijin the relative humidity change was the second affecting factor as the lai and

962,in arid semiarid regions understanding the mechanisms by which vegetation change and climate change affect the regional water balance is important for the development of effective measures and for guiding vegetation restoration and adapting to climate change in this study we utilize the budyko equation and dual source evapotranspiration models to assess the impacts of vegetation change and climate change on the runoff in china s yellow river basin yrb the aims of the study are as follows 1 apply a well formulated budyko framework dual source evapotranspiration model to explore the eco hydrological controls of the regional water balance 2 precisely assess the contribution of vegetation change precipitation change temperature change wind speed change the relative humidity change and radiation change to the decreased runoff the results indicated that vegetation change was the dominant factor affecting the reduction of runoff in the upper reaches above lanzhou toudaoguai longmen sanmenxia and huayuankou and the contributions were 80 4 58 4 52 5 46 9 39 7 and 41 6 respectively in lanzhou taodaoguai longmen and sanmenxia the precipitation change was the second affecting factor and the contributions were 20 8 31 6 30 0 and 35 2 respectively in huayuankou and lijin the relative humidity change was the second affecting factor and the contributions were 26 8 and 35 0 respectively 3 as the vegetation coverage or the leaf area index lai increased the runoff decreased linearly keywords vegetation change climate change runoff change yellow river basin 1 introduction the interactions between vegetation climate and hydrology are very complicated numerous efforts have been made to study the impacts of climate change on runoff sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 zheng et al 2009 ma et al 2010 an increase in precipitation can directly increase the amounts of runoff while other climate factors such as temperature wind speed and relative humidity affect water resources by increasing or decreasing the amount of evapotranspiration mu et al 2017 zhou et al 2006 the investigation of the impact of vegetation coverage changes on hydrology is also an area of significant research interest over the last 50 years important studies regarding of the impact of vegetation change on runoff have been conducted and some researchers bosch et al 1982 yu et al 1989 farley et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 have proposed that evapotranspiration increases as the vegetation coverage increases and thus runoff decreases however other researchers sun et al 2001 liu et al 2002 have proposed different outcomes and they have suggested runoff increases with vegetation coverage increases zhou et al 2001 and wang et al 2004 reported that the scale of the study area is an important factor that causes variations in the calculation results they noted that on a smaller scale there is a large proportion of vegetation transpiration but deforestation decreases the amount of transpiration and enhances runoff however on a larger scale deforestation decreases the flood regulation effect of the forest and causes a decrease in the common runoff period several researchers have quantified the impact of climate variability and human activities on runoff liang et al 2015a reported the impacts of climate change and ecological restoration on streamflow changes the leaf area index lai is also an important factor in runoff processes cao et al 2018 reported that as the lai increases the runoff decreases luo et al 2020 reported that the increases in vegetation coverage have led to runoff reductions of 48 0 33 2 and 20 2 in global arid semi arid and sub humid regions respectively which were larger than climate change induced runoff changes in these three regions gao et al 2019 selected the wei river basin in the loess plateau to study the vegetation change influence on runoff and the results suggested that vegetation restoration was the dominant factor affecting variation in runoff the budyko framework is an empirical relation among evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration and precipitation observed across a variety of landscapes and biomes around the world it was first established in 1974 and since then the budyko curve has been gradually used by many researchers to explore the ecohydrological controls of the soil water balance fu et al 1981 milly et al 1994 zhang et al 1999 2001 yang et al 2006 2007 donohue et al 2007 yang et al 2008 arora 2002 proposed a function to assess the response of runoff to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet and the viability of the equation in the yangtze river basin and the yellow river basin was verified by guo et al 2015 and huang et al 2016 the prediction error was 4 to 25 but the arora equation did not contain a vegetation parameter so it cannot be used to directly determine the impacts of vegetation change on runoff choudhury 1999 developed an equation and used a parameter named n in the equation to represent the catchment characteristics but the parameter n is caused by several factors such as the soil properties slope vegetation cover and climate seasonality so it is difficult to estimate using the budyko curve gentine et al 2012 studied the ecohydrological controls of the soil water balance of more than 300 catchments the results showed the budyko equation could be used to constrain land surface parameterizations in ungauged basins or general circulation models bi et al 2020 analyzed the contribution of vegetation change human activities and climate change impact on runoff in the kuye basin of the yrb using the budyko hypothesis the results showed the contribution of the vegetation change was 84 9 and that of climate change and human activities was 9 3 and 5 8 respectively based on the budyko hypothesis li and xia 2018 reported that precipitation and vegetation change were the primary influence factors that resulted in a runoff reduction in the zhujiang basin li et al 2020 chose three tributary sub catchments of the yellow river to attribute runoff variations to climate change and human activities by improving the budyko elasticity model and the results suggested that vegetation change accounted for 92 of the decline in runoff to summarize what has been mentioned above there have been several papers quantifying human activities vegetation change and climate change impact on runoff changes in various basins of the world and some of them have reported on the contribution of vegetation change and climate change to runoff decline in the yellow river basin in these papers the affecting factors on runoff were only simply divided into two parts vegetation change climate change or human activities and climate change for quantifying the contribution to the decreased runoff however no studies have precisely assessed the contribution of all the factors including vegetation coverage lai precipitation temperature wind speed relative humidity and radiation and there is no unified understanding regarding the impact of vegetation change on runoff hence further studies need to be conducted in this study the yellow river basin yrb was selected to quantify the impacts of climate change and vegetation change on the runoff by using the budyko framework combined with the dual source evapotranspiration model the novelty of our research consists of the following aims 1 apply a well formulated budyko framework dual source evapotranspiration model to explore the eco hydrological controls of the regional water balance 2 precisely assess the contribution of vegetation coverage lai precipitation temperature wind speed the relative humidity and radiation to the decreased runoff 3 investigate the impacts of vegetation coverage lai precipitation and temperature on regional runoff change 2 study area and study period 2 1 study area the yrb is in northern china fig 1 the study area is approximately 5 400 km long with a drainage area of 795 2 103 km2 and over 70 of the total area is in an arid semiarid region mcvicar et al 2007 the average precipitation is approximately 444 13 mm and primarily occurs from june to september with 60 70 of the annual total rainfall occurring in the form of high intensity rainstorms there are approximately 2 555 hours of sunshine per year the average temperature is 5 62 c the average relative humidity is 54 8 and the average wind speed is 5 4 m s 1 soil erosion is the primary ecological problem in the yrb since the 1950s the chinese government has implemented a series of ecological restoration projects to prevent further severe soil erosion ran et al 2000 in 1999 a large scale conservation campaign the grain for green gfg project was implemented by converting farmland into forest and grassland liang et al 2015b the vegetation coverage fr and lai underwent noticeable changes in the yrb because the land surface conditions and climate conditions have changed obviously the runoff in the yrb has significantly decreased in the last 50 years mu et al 2010 therefore it is necessary to assess its effects on the water resources of the area in this study the sub catchment of the yrb that consists of the upper reaches above lanzhou toudaoguai longmen sanmenxia huayuankou and lijin were selected to quantify the impacts of climate and vegetation change on water resource changes the details of these catchments and changes in their hydrometeorological variables are presented in table 1 2 2 data the annual runoff natural river flow q data from 1966 to 2015 were

surface either from transpiration pt or from soil water in the root zone pe is one of the key inputs in hydrological modeling the pet is not only controlled by the meteorological parameters but it also changes due to vegetation changes the dual source evapotranspiration model eqs 1 3 and the monthly meteorological data were used as input in this study and these have been widely used to measure the pet since it can clearly reveal the variations in the pet due to dynamic changes in the vegetation the models are expressed yang et al 2012 guan et al 2009 as 1 pet pe pt 2 pe δ a s 1 f r ρ c p d

3 3 decomposition method we divided the total change in q q into two parts liang et al 2015a one part was caused by climate change q cc and the other was caused by vegetation change qvc q can be estimated as the average annual q during period 2 i e 1991 2015 minus the average annual q during period 1 i e 1966 1990 this relationship can be expressed as follows 33 δ q δ q c c δ q v c similarly q cc can be decomposed in parts such as change caused by the precipitation change qpc change caused by the temperature change qtc change caused by the wind speed change quc change caused by the relative humidity change qrhc and change caused by the radiation change qrc it can be estimated as follows 34 δ q c c δ q p c δ q t c δ q u c δ q r h c δ q r c first we used the dual source evapotranspiration model eqs 1 27 to evaluate the potential evapotranspiration pet and then we used the penman model to validate it second we used the budyko framework eqs 28 32 to evaluate the total change in q q and the natural river flow to validate it third we held the climate variables p t u rh and r n constant and evaluated the qvc using eqs 1 33 fourth we held the vegetation variables lai

huayuankou and lijin and u significantly decreased in lanzhou toudaoguai longmen sanmenxia and huayuankou the annual q significantly decreased from 1 3 to 3 8 108 m3 yr 1 t increased from 0 01 to 0 02

1966 2015 in lanzhou toudaoguai longmen sanmenxia huayuankou and lijin were estimated we used eqs 35 36 to estimate the ret as is shown in fig 2 the pet and ret have a good relationship but the pet is larger than the ret at the six catchments this is primarily because the pet estimated using eqs 1 27 includes two parts the substrate evaporation pe and the vegetation transpiration pt but the ret only includes the vegetation transpiration pt the q estimated q estimated using eqs 28 32 was validated using the sites natural river flow q nature for 1966 2015 the validation sites included six hydrological stations lanzhou taodaoguai longmen sanmenxia huayuankou and lijin fig 1 the q nature was calculated using eq 37 and data provided by the china yellow river conservancy commission using eqs 28 32 we estimated the runoff changes q estimated in lanzhou taodaoguai longmen sanmenxia huayuankou and lijin a comparison of the q estimated and q nature values of the six validation sites is shown in table 3 in general the estimated runoff agrees well with the natural river flow q nature and the relative error for each site was less than 5 the q nature is estimated using q observed added to q consumption and q reservoir storage change so it could eliminate the influence of q consumption and q reservoir storage change on the decreased runoff 37 q nature q observed q consumption q reservoir storage change where q nature is the natural river flow q observed is the observed runoff at the hydrological station q consumption is the runoff consumed in the catchment above the hydrological station and q reservoir storage change is the runoff intercepted by the dams above the hydrological station which can be estimated as the reservoir storage at the end of the year minus the beginning the data of the q consumption and q reservoir storage change from 1966 to 1999 were provided by the china yellow river conservancy commission the data of the q consumption and q reservoir storage change from 2000 to 2015 were downloaded from http www yrcc gov cn zwzc gzgb gb szygb we distinguished two sub periods before and after 1990 this was because 1 the δ variation in eqs 28 32 refers to large spatial scales and longtime scales we used 25 years and guo et al 2015 also used 25 years such that changes in the subsurface storage of water and energy could be neglected arora 2002 guo et al 2015 and 2 the fr and lai underwent noticeable changes table 4 as shown in table 3 the q observed q observed period 1 is larger than q nature q nature period 1 this is because the runoff of the yrb is also highly influenced by other human activities such as the interception of the reservoirs and the consumption by humans in the catchments in this paper our purpose was to quantify the contribution of vegetation change and climate change to the decreased runoff using the dual source evapotranspiration model and the budyko framework hence we used q nature rather than q observed for attributing the runoff change for the following reasons 1 a decrease in q observed is primarily caused by climate change vegetation change q consumption and q reservoir storage change and in which vegetation change q consumption and q reservoir storage change are caused by human activities as shown in eqs 1 37 the dual source evapotranspiration model and budyko framework can clearly assess the impacts of climate change and vegetation change on decreased runoff but it cannot evaluate the influence of q consumption and q reservoir storage change 2 as shown in eq 37 the q nature has eliminated the influence of q consumption and q reservoir storage change hence we can conveniently use the evapotranspiration model and the budyko framework in other words q consumption and q reservoir storage change caused a reduction in q observed but it did not cause a reduction in q nature as q nature is estimated using q observed added to q consumption and q reservoir storage change eq 37 therefore if we use q nature we can assess the impacts of climate change and vegetation change without considering the effects of q consumption and q reservoir storage change the evaporation from the reservoirs was estimated using eq 2 4 3 quantitative contributions to a decrease in q as was described in section 3 3 the total q can simply be divided into the change in q caused by climate change qcc and the change in q caused by vegetation change qvc the climate change variables i e the precipitation change p and temperature change t and the vegetation change parameters fr and lai are all key variables that influence a change in runoff we used the following steps to quantify the contributions of the changes in the climate and vegetation variables to a decrease in q first we held the climate variables constant and used eqs 1 33 to estimate the change in q caused by the vegetation change qvc second we held the lai vegetation coverage fr and all the climate parameters except for the precipitation constant and used the eqs 1 34 to estimate the change in q caused by the precipitation change qpc third we held all the vegetation variables and all the climate parameters except for the temperature constant and estimated the change in q caused by temperature change qtc in the same way we held the other variables constant we estimated the change in q caused by the q uc q rhc and q rc fig 3 illustrates the contributions of vegetation change precipitation change temperature change relative humidity change wind speed change and radiation change to runoff change the vegetation change was the dominant factor leading to decreases in q in lanzhou taodaoguai longmen sanmenxia huayuankou and lijin and the contributions were 80 4 58 4 52 5 46 9 39 7 and 41 6 respectively in lanzhou taodaoguai longmen and sanmenxia the precipitation change was the second factor that caused a decrease in q and the contributions were 20 8 31 6 30 0 and 35 2 respectively whereas in huayuankou and lijin the relative humidity change was the second factor we also studied the relationship of temperature and precipitation r 0 04 and the change in temperature had no obvious influence on precipitation in yrb in this study we used the net radiation r n to evaluate the evapotranspiration and the changes in albedo was an important parameter used to calculate the change in r n liu et al 2006 therefore we considered the albedo changes and its contribution to evapotranspiration changes using the change in r n 4 4 impacts of climate change on runoff we assumed precipitation decreases of 10 60 compared to period 1 and held the lai vegetation coverage fr all the other climate variables constant then we estimated changes in q caused by precipitation change qpc for the six assumed levels using eqs 1 34 similarly we assumed temperature increases of 10 60 compared to period 1 and estimated the change in q caused by temperature change qtc for the six assumed levels fig 4 shows the increase in the runoff change with increasing temperature as the temperature increases the pet increases therefore according to the eq 28 the runoff should decrease liu et al 2017 gao et al 2017 fig 5 shows that the change in runoff decreases as precipitation increases gao et al 2017 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of vegetation change on runoff eqs 28 30 indicate that the pet and precipitation are the key factors that affect runoff liu et al 2016 li et al 2018 pet is closely related to vegetation change and therefore the vegetation parameters are also very important factors that influence changes in runoff feng et al 2017 cao et al 2018 li et al 2019 bi et al 2020 in this study first we assumed that the lai and vegetation coverage fr increased by 10 80 compared to period 1 and we held all the climate parameters constant then we evaluated the change in runoff using the dual source evapotranspiration model and the budyko framework finally we established an empirical equation that relates the runoff change lai and vegetation coverage fig 6 shows that greater lai and vegetation coverage fr values resulted in a greater change in runoff the regression analysis revealed that for the same vegetation coverage as the lai increases the runoff increases linearly p 0 01 table s1 the slope of the regression models between the lai and runoff changes increases with increasing vegetation coverage this suggests that for the same lai change the range of the runoff variation is greater when the vegetation coverage is greater table s2 shows the relationship between the runoff change and the vegetation coverage for different lai levels the regression analysis indicated that the runoff changes increase linearly with increasing vegetation coverage p 0 01 we compared the slopes of the linear regression models and we found that the greater the lai the greater the slope of the linear model this result indicates that the runoff is more sensitive to vegetation coverage at higher lai levels than at lower lai levels the restoration of the vegetation increased the pt but it decreased the pe however because the increase in the pt was greater than the decrease in the pe the total evapotranspiration of the catchments increased thus according to eq 28 the runoff should decrease similar findings have been reported previously zhou et al 2001 liu et al 2016 we also analyzed the relationships between the vegetation coverage lai and precipitation the increases in vegetation coverage and the lai had no obvious influence on precipitation zhou et al 1996 also reported the same results thus as the vegetation coverage and lai increased the degree of drought in the yrb increased liu et al 2017 and liu et al 2016 reported that in semi arid areas runoff will decrease when the forest and grass vegetation increases and the more arid the climate the more the runoff will decrease which is consistent with the results of this study 5 2 limitations and uncertainties the dual source evapotranspiration model predicted a highly accurate pet for the yellow river basin when the monthly meteorological data was used as input with the predicted pet and precipitation as input the budyko framework reflected accurate runoff variation as that found at a series of observation stations over the basin the model parameters were in their physical ranges despite the direct results of the water balance in the yrb there were still some limitations and uncertainties in the models and the study results 1 our study region is in arid zone or semiarid zone and it is unclear in the humid region whether the accuracy of the budyko framework and the dual source evapotranspiration model is still accurate and if the effects of the vegetation change and climate change on the changing hydrological cycle are positive or negative 2 the dual source evapotranspiration model parameter h c was simply set as 5 0 in this study and this should be used in a distributed way and related to the vegetation type and vegetation phenology 3 the δ variation in arora s equation arora 2002 eqs 28 30 refers to large spatial scales and longtime scales we used 1966 2015 but because of the lack of ndvi data for 1961 1981 we assumed the ndvi for 1961 1981 was equal to the value for 1982 and this may affect the accuracy of the results of the study 6 conclusions in this study we used the dual source evapotranspiration model and the budyko framework to examine the contributions of climate change and vegetation change to changes in the annual runoff in the yrb in china and to reveal the characteristics of and mechanisms by which the vegetation change and climate change impact the regional water balance in lanzhou taodaoguai longmen sanmenxia huayuankou and lijin the vegetation change was the dominant factor causing a decrease in runoff and the contributions were 80 4 58 4 52 5 46 9 39 7 and 41 6 respectively in lanzhou taodaoguai longmen and sanmenxia the change in precipitation was the second affecting factor with contributions of 20 8 31 6 30 0 and 35 2 respectively whereas in huayuankou and lijin the relative humidity change was the second affecting factor as the lai and vegetation coverage fr increased the annual runoff decreased linearly declaration of competing interest we the authors declare that we have no known competing financial interests or personal

963,flux observations are important for understanding the basic processes of carbon and water cycling in an ecosystem in 2020 1 january 2020 to 31 december 2020 we continuously monitored the surface energy fluxes of a shrub ecosystem using an eddy covariance system additionally meteorological variables such as temperature and rainfall were measured the study site was located in chunhua of china which is a gully region of the chinese loess plateau the diurnal and seasonal dynamic changes in the energy balance of this region were analysed bowen and energy balance ratios were calculated and environmental factors affecting the variations in latent le and sensible heat fluxes h were explored the results showed that the annual net radiation rn le h and soil heat flux g were 2385 6 1059 1 787 6 and 48 3 mj m2 respectively with 490 58 mj m2 energy remaining undetected the main part of the annual energy of the shrub ecosystem was latent heat accounting for 44 4 of rn a seasonal variation in each energy component was evident and the diurnal variation showed a single peak curve le in the growing season was dominant and the proportion of le and h in the net radiation in the non growing season showed little difference the bowen ratio changed monthly and significantly fluctuated from 0 2 in july to 4 0 in december it was high in winter and low in summer with little fluctuation the annual energy balance ratio was 0 8 the energy balance closure in the non growing season was greater than that in the growing season both h and le were significantly correlated with net radiation and h was negatively correlated with rainfall soil moisture and soil temperature unlike h le was significantly positively correlated with soil temperature in addition le was positively correlated with air

to increase window sizes to ensure there were enough data points could be used for filling gaps hu and lei 2021 2 3 energy balance closure the surface energy balance expression is as follows 1 r n g s h l e where rn is the net radiant flux w m2 g is the ground heat flux w m2 s is the heat storage of vegetation and atmosphere w m2 h is the sensible heat flux w m2 and le is the latent heat flux w m2 as the term s is small and often ignored the expression is simplified as follows 2 r n g h l e when the available energy rn g is equal to the turbulent energy h le energy is considered to be closed else energy is considered to be not closed energy balance ratio ebr and ordinary linear regression olr are commonly used for assessing the energy balance closure the ebr method refers to the ratio of the turbulence to the available energy directly measured by the ec system which is calculated as follows 3 e b r l e h r n g ideally the ebr is equal to 1 implying that the energy is completely closed the olr method fits a linear regression to the data of the available energy and the turbulent fluxes h le ideally when the energy is completely closed the slope of the regression line is 1 with the intercept being 0 3 results 3 1 daily variation characteristics of energy flux due to different vegetation types and underlying surface conditions the heat and water vapour exchange capacities of terrestrial ecosystems and atmosphere are different resulting in different distribution ratios of energy flux in different ecosystems by averaging the energy flux values for the same time of a year the daily scale changes in each energy flux were analysed and the dynamic change process of the seasonal scale energy flux was subsequently evaluated the diurnal curve of each energy flux of the chunhua shrub ecosystem in the gully region of the clp was a single peak quadratic curve fig 4 a which was smaller in the morning and evening and larger at noon the maximum daily rn appeared at 12 30pm with the value reaching 364 6 w m2 after which it gradually decreased and changed little after 19 30 compared to the daily dynamic curve of rn the daily dynamic curves of g h and le were similar with the variation range being smaller h reached the peak value of 142 6 w m2 at 12 00 the peak value of 86 0 w m2 for le appeared earlier at 11 30 and the daily dynamic curve of g reached the peak value of 39 0 w m2 at 14 00 the energy distribution was mainly based on h and g with the energy distribution ratios being h rn g rn le rn 0 00 3 00 and 20 00 23 00 and h rn le rn g rn 9 00 16 00 fig 4b at 7 00 8 00 and 18 00 19 00 the energy distribution ratio curve fluctuated sharply before and after sunrise the troughs of h rn and g rn and the peaks of le rn realised complementarity and the peaks of h rn and troughs of g rn and le rn realised complementarity before and after sunset this was because the heat source of the shrub ecosystem transformed between the atmosphere and soil the directions and magnitudes of the energy components changed during these time periods which abruptly changed the energy distribution ratio curve during sunrise and sunset compared to other time periods when large peaks or troughs were observed in the interval on one hand after water vapour condensation at night at sunrise the soil moisture was found to be relatively high and a relatively high relative air humidity most of the energy was used in water vapour transmission with h being higher on the other hand rn changed from negative to positive during this time rn was weak and significantly lesser than the supply of evapotranspiration energy by g at this time the value of le was approximately equal to the sum of rn and g such that le rn was greater than 1 which suddenly changed the energy distribution ratio curve and complementary peaks and valleys in the curve appeared yan et al 2015 the bowen ratio describes the stability of air characterises atmosphere surface energy exchange characteristics and reflects the distribution ratio of rn absorbed by the shrub ecosystems in h and le the daily dynamic change curve of the bowen ratio showed a single peak change 0 00 7 30 and 18 00 23 00 with the ratio being negative fig 4c the bowen ratio was greater than 1 9 30 to 16 00 and reached a peak value of 1 7 at 12 00 indicating that during this period h was the main distribution of rn which was consistent with the situation reflected by the energy distribution ratio curve to better characterise the seasonal changes in the energy balance of the shrub ecosystem the monthly average data of energy flux for march spring june summer september autumn and december winter with simultaneous typical seasonality were processed to analyse the daily dynamic process of energy flux in different seasons fig 5 shows that all energy components of the representative months in typical seasons were based on rn showing a unimodal curve change the daily maximum value of rn occurred 12 30 13 30 as shown in table 1 the representative months of the typical seasons the daily maximum and average values of rn were different respectively in spring rn became positive at 8 30 which indicated that energy began to enter the shrub as an income item at 13 00 rn reached a daily maximum and turned negative from 18 30 onward energy began to be expended by the shrub ecosystem the average value of rn greater than 0 in a day was found to be 247 3 w m2 in summer rn became positive at 7 00 reached a daily maximum value of 419 0 w m2 at 13 30 and became negative at 19 30 the average value of rn greater than 0 in a day was found to be 263 1 w m2 with the daily average value being 117 0 w m2 in autumn rn became positive at 8 00 reached a daily maximum value of 414 4 w m2 at 12 30 and became negative at 18 30 the average value of rn greater than 0 in a day was found to be 259 2 w m2 with the daily average value being 90 0 w m2 in winter rn became positive at 9 00 reached the daily maximum value of 235 3 w m2 at 13 00 and became negative at 17 00 the average value of rn greater than 0 in a day was 149 3 w m2 with the daily average value being 18 4 w m2 the diurnal variations in h le and rn showed similar unimodal curve changes in spring as rn significantly increased the ground surface vegetation did not start growing with the underlying surface specific heat being relatively large resulting in a relatively large h during this period with a daily maximum value of 235 8 w m2 le was closely related to plant transpiration and was affected by the surface temperature soil moisture and saturated vapour pressure of the underlying surface in summer there was more rainfall and sufficient sunlight plant transpiration was strong and air humidity was high most of the energy was used for water vapour transmission le was larger in summer with an average value of 64 4 w m2 and smaller in winter with an average value of 4 3 w m2 g smoothly changed in winter with an average value of 37 1 w m2 and a standard deviation of 2 0 w m2 and was closely related to rn rn increased in spring with the surface being relatively bare soil thermal conductivity being good and g significantly varying from 30 1 to 70 8 w m2 in different seasons soil properties soil water content levels and vegetation coverage were different and g exhibited large temporal and spatial variations 3 2 seasonal changes in energy flux at monthly time scale rn h le and g of the shrub ecosystem in the gully region of the clp were similar to the diurnal variation in the energy flux exhibiting a single peak change as shown in fig 6 the maximum and minimum value of rn for the chunhua shrub ecosystem appeared in may 349 8 mj m2 and december 49 2 mj m2 respectively the total annual rn was 2385 6 mj m2 higher than that of the semi arid grassland of the clp 2269 0 mj m2 and lower than that of the shennongjia dajiu lake peat wetland of china 3146 9 mj m2 yue et al 2011 the change in h was observed to be synchronised with rn the maximum and minimum value of h appeared in april 128 4 mj m2 and july 27 7 mj m2 respectively the total annual h was 787 6 mj m2 accounting for 33 0 of the annual rn le is the evapotranspiration heat consumption which gradually increased with the heat of water evaporation during the same period from january to july after reaching a peak value of 186 3 mj m2 in july it gradually decreased to the minimum value of 11 2 mj m2 december the total annual le was 1059 1 mj m2 accounting for 44 4 of the annual rn the total le was greater and less than the total h from may to october and other months respectively the energy distribution characteristic of the entire year showed that le was greater than h g was numerically smaller than other energy components by one to two orders of magnitude g was positive from february to july with the maximum and minimum values reaching 37 0 mj m2 in may and 99 1 mj m2 in december respectively and the annual total being 48 3 mj m2 this indicated that soil acted as a heat source to release heat from deep soil to soil surface or atmosphere and g only accounted for 2 0 of the total rn 3 3 energy flux distribution characteristics and bowen ratio the energy flux of the chunhua shrub ecosystem in 2020 was divided into growing april to july and non growing seasons august to march and the relationship between the energy components in the study area was analysed as shown in table 2 le accounted for 44 1 of rn in the growing season which was greater than the proportion of h and g indicating its domination in the energy of the ecosystem in the growing season the total h and rn in the non growing season were 482 7 and 1146 3 mj m2 respectively with h accounting for 42 1 of rn the total le was 513 1 mj m2 accounting for 44 8 of rn the annual energy budget ratio was le rn h rn g rn in the chunhua shrub ecosystem the monthly change in the bowen ratio over the entire year was approximately u shaped with large fluctuations fig 7 the bowen ratio was observed to be high in winter and low in summer with small fluctuation its maximum and minimum values were 4 0 in december and 0 2 in july respectively h was less and greater than le from june to november and other months respectively the monthly average bowen ratio was 1 6 with the annual ratio being 0 8 3 4 energy balance analysis the closure of turbulence energy h le and available energy rn g measured by the ec method was analysed using the ebr method as shown in fig 8 obvious monthly changes were observed in the ebr with the maximum 1 2 and minimum 0 4 values appearing in february and december respectively from january to march the energy balance closure was significantly large and the ebr value was greater than 1 the remaining months were energy unclosed with the annual ebr being 0 8 indicating that the residuals of the energy balance closure was 20 the closure for the growing and non growing seasons were 0 74 and 0 78 respectively with the energy balance closure in the non growing season being better a linear regression analysis of the energy balance of the chunhua shrub ecosystem was performed for every month of the year the closed linear regression analysis results of the balance of the annual turbulent energy h le and available energy rn g are shown in fig 9 where regression coefficient intercept and correlation coefficient r2 of the regression equation obtained by fitting the annual turbulent energy h le and available energy rn g were 0 7 9 5 and 0 8 respectively the slope of the daily scale regression analysis ranged from 0 7 to 1 1 with the annual average of 0 9 the intercept varied from 60 9 to 7 6 w m2 with the annual average of 23 9 w m2 the correlation coefficient varied from 0 4 to 0 9 with the annual average of 0 8 at the time scale of 30 min table 3 shows the monthly linear regression parameters of the chunhua shrub ecosystem in the gully region of the clp the range of the regression coefficient was 0 6 0 8 with the annual average of 0 7 the range of the intercept was 6 7 14 1 w m2 with the annual average of 7 0 w m2 the correlation coefficient changed from 0 6 to 0 8 with the annual average of 0 8 theoretically energy balance closure was established but regardless of the properties of the underlying surface an energy unclosed phenomenon will remain the parameter ranges for the energy balance closed regression equation for flux observatories worldwide are regression coefficient varying from 0 53 to 0 99 with the average value of 0 8 intercept varying from 32 9 to 36 9 w m2 with the average value of 0 7 w m2 and correlation coefficient varying from 0 64 to 0 96 with the average value of 0 9 in the flux observation stations of china the regression coefficient varied from 0 5 to 0 8 with the average value of 0 7 intercept varied from 10 8 to 79 9 w m2 with the average value of 28 9 w m2 and the correlation coefficient varied from 0 5 to 0 9 with the average value of 0 8 the results of this study were consistent with those of other related studies wilson et al 2002 3 5 factors affecting latent and sensible heat fluxes 3 5 1 monthly change characteristics of the meteorological factors fig 10 a shows that the monthly rainfall in the gully regions of the clp presented a single peak variation with an annual rainfall of 511 3 mm rainfall was mainly concentrated from may to august accounting for 70 9 of the annual rainfall the maximum and minimum monthly rainfalls were 119 5 and 3 4 mm in june and december respectively in the months with heavy rainfall the volumetric water content of the soil also significantly increased fig 10b the volumetric water content at different soil depths responded differently to the rainfall a soil water content of 20 cm was more sensitive to the changes in rainfall with the increase in soil depth the response of the soil volumetric water content to rainfall was delayed and the change in amplitude was smaller than that of the shallow soil 3 5 2 correlationship of le and h to environmental factors net radiation rn air humidity gradient h water vapour pressure difference vpd rainfall p soil moisture ms and soil temperature ts were used for representing the environmental factors the correlation between h le and various environmental factors was analysed table 4 and the response relationship between water and energy flux and environmental factors was explored the air temperature and humidity gradients were expressed by the difference between the heights at 2 and 4 m soil humidity and temperature were measured at a depth of 20 cm the latent heat flux and sensible heat flux from 9 00 to 16 00 and the average values of various environmental factors were selected for the correlation analysis table 4 shows that both h and le had a significant positive correlation with rn and the positive correlation between le and rn was stronger than that between h and rn h was negatively correlated with rainfall soil moisture and soil temperature contrary to h le was significantly positively correlated with soil temperature in addition le was significantly positively correlated with air humidity gradient and water vapour pressure difference because when the soil temperature was high the evapotranspiration of soil water increased and air humidity was high the energy was mainly used for the evapotranspiration heat consumption of the ecosystem and turbulent energy was dominated by le with sufficient soil moisture and high soil humidity plant transpiration will be evident transpiration heat absorption will reduce the heat transported to the atmosphere thus decreasing h resulting in soil moisture and h being negatively correlated wu et al 2013 4 discussion the annual energy distribution of le was greater than that of h with the annual bowen ratios being slightly lower than that of the semi arid grassland of the clp 1 1 and slightly higher than that of the subtropical bamboo forest ecosystem 0 4 and shennongjia dajiu lake peat wetland of china 0 5 yue et al 2011 sun et al 2015 the annual ebr of the shrub ecosystem in the chunhua gully region calculated using the energy balance ratio method was 0 8 lower than the lucky hills shrubland of usa 0 96 scott 2009 the energy balance at most surface atmosphere flux research sites remains unclosed recent reviews have identified exchange processes and turbulent motions at large spatial and temporal scales in heterogeneous landscapes as the primary cause of the lack of energy balance closure at some researched sites li et al 2015 stoy et al 2013 while unmeasured storage terms eshonkulov et al 2019 haverd et al 2007 heusinkveld et al 2003 liu et al 2017 different correction approaches goncalves et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 mismatch of eddy cvariance and net radiation measurements baldocchi and dennis 2015 baldocchi et al 2000 kohsiek et al 2007 kustas et al 2000 large scale circulations eder et al 2015 and the importance of good practice including site selection when making flux measurements should not be discounted the main reasons for the residuals of the energy balance closure are as follows 1 turbulence effect the measurement of the ec system requires the turbulence at the underlying surface to be relatively violent however the turbulence is weak at night which lowers the observed value of energy than the real value wang et al 2019 2 condition of underlying surface the measurement of the ec system requires the underlying surface to be flat and homogeneous but the actual underlying surface is complex and contains different terrain or vegetation types thus meeting the assumption that the horizontal flux is zero is difficult which affects the accuracy of the turbulent flux measurement to a certain extent 3 weather conditions affected by different weather conditions the variation characteristics of the surface energy are significantly different on sunny days the surface energy component is single peaked cloudy days greatly impact radiation disturbance and fluctuations in cloud size make the surface energy flux become multimodal with frequent alternating peaks and valleys rainfall affects atmospheric transparency reduces temperature and increases the soil moisture content if the weather is clear after rain the cloud cover and turbidity will be low the rn intensity will be high and soil evaporation and plant transpiration will be intense thus increasing le and decreasing h when vegetation withers in winter snow changes the ground surface reflectance and thermal properties which affects the energy balance 4 neglecting other energies while calculating the energy balance equation the soil heat flux not only contains the heat flux measured by the soil heat flux plate but also the soil heat storage from the soil heat flux plate to the surface other studies have shown that the degree of closure is significantly improved when energy budget considers the 0 5 cm soil heat storage yue et al 2011 5 out of sync energy the energy components in the energy balance are usually not measured at the same plane thus the observations are not synchronised with the main reason being g not being synchronised studies have shown that the peak appearance time of g is approximately 2 5 h later than that of rn compared to the diurnal variation of le the phase is shifted back by 0 5 1 h when the energy balance components are synchronised and the phase of g is shifted forward by 1 h the surface energy balance closure and correlation coefficient will be significantly improved wang et al 2005 the study on surface energy fluxes of the shrub ecosystem in the chinese loess plateau is seldom reported in the literature mu us sand land is on the north of the loess plateau huang 2020 studied the typical shrub ecosystem of artemisia ordosica on mu us sand land and found that the energy balance of the shrub ecosystem was not closed from 2012 to 2018 the overall linear regression line for 7 years had a slope of 0 64 and the ebr is 0 82 the sensible heat flux was the main energy component that consumed net radiation on both of the annual and seasonal scales in this study we found that latent heat dominated the annual energy distribution of shrub ecosystem in the gully region of the loess plateau in 2020 the climate of the ecosystem in mu us sandy land belongs to the typical semi arid continental climate the annual precipitation there is only 287 mm the annual net radiation is 2660 mj m2 and the sunshine is abundant the average annual potential evaporation is 2 024 mm which is much higher than the annual precipitation and the water resource is scarce the soil water capacity of the sand land is very small in most of the time the soil is very dry and the water in the soil to evaporate is very limited therefore the latent heat flux is small and sensible heat flux is the dominant the mu us sandy land ecosystem is a typical arid and semi arid climate transition zone and the vegetation coverage is relatively low while the chunhua shrub ecosystem has a relatively high vegetation coverage and the vegetation transpiration is relatively strong the annual precipitation in the chunhua shrub ecosystem is 511 3mm the annual net radiation is 2385 6 mj m2 the soil water capacity of loess soil is very large and most of the rainfall is stored in the soil in the process of transpiration and heat absorption the heat transferred to the atmosphere is reduced resulting in the decrease of sensible heat flux wu et al 2013 at the same time rainfall events can reduce temperature increase soil moisture content and increase soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration resulting in increased latent heat flux and decreased sensible heat flux gong et al 2015 these reasons lead to significant differences in energy budget distribution between the two ecosystems 5 conclusion the annual rn of the chunhua shrub ecosystem in the gully region of the clp was 2385 6 mj m2 with le h and g being 1059 1 787 6 and 48 3 mj m2 respectively indicating that the energy of the ecosystem was mainly exchanged in the form of le each energy component changed in a unimodal curve on both daily and seasonal scales the energy distribution was dominated by le on a daily scale h and g were the main energy components with the energy distribution ratio being h rn g rn le rn 0 00 3 00 and 20 00 23 30 and h rn le rn g rn 9 00 to 16 00 compared with the daily dynamic curves of rn g le and h had the same changing trend but a smaller changing range the daily dynamic curve of the bowen ratio showed a single peak change reaching a peak of 1 69 at 12 00 on an annual scale the bowen ratios were higher and lower in winter and summer respectively the bowen ratio was 0 2 in july and 4 0 in december the monthly average bowen ratio was 1 6 and the annual bowen ratio was 0 8 the monthly ebr value of the shrub ecosystem calculated by the energy balance ratio method varied from 0 4 to 1 2 with the annual value of 0 8 the regression and correlation coefficients in the linear regression equation of the shrub ecosystem were at an average level indicating that the flux data obtained using the ec technology to observe the shrub ecosystem was reliable the calculation of soil heat flux in this study did not consider surface heat storage and the energy balance closure still requires further observation and research land ecosystem network observation based on the ec technology has become an important method for studying the relationship between global change and land ecosystems reflecting the energy change process at different time scales and revealing the characteristics of energy balance between atmosphere soil and vegetation this study only analysed the energy flux characteristics of the shrub ecosystem in one year discussed the energy balance of the ecosystem and performed correlation analysis between the environmental factors and water and heat

963,flux observations are important for understanding the basic processes of carbon and water cycling in an ecosystem in 2020 1 january 2020 to 31 december 2020 we continuously monitored the surface energy fluxes of a shrub ecosystem using an eddy covariance system additionally meteorological variables such as temperature and rainfall were measured the study site was located in chunhua of china which is a gully region of the chinese loess plateau the diurnal and seasonal dynamic changes in the energy balance of this region were analysed bowen and energy balance ratios were calculated and environmental factors affecting the variations in latent le and sensible heat fluxes h were explored the results showed that the annual net radiation rn le h and soil heat flux g were 2385 6 1059 1 787 6 and 48 3 mj m2 respectively with 490 58 mj m2 energy remaining undetected the main part of the annual energy of the shrub ecosystem was latent heat accounting for 44 4 of rn a seasonal variation in each energy component was evident and the diurnal variation showed a single peak curve le in the growing season was dominant and the proportion of le and h in the net radiation in the non growing season showed little difference the bowen ratio changed monthly and significantly fluctuated from 0 2 in july to 4 0 in december it was high in winter and low in summer with little fluctuation the annual energy balance ratio was 0 8 the energy balance closure in the non growing season was greater than that in the growing season both h and le were significantly correlated with net radiation and h was negatively correlated with rainfall soil moisture and soil temperature unlike h le was significantly positively correlated with soil temperature in addition le was positively correlated with air

h l e where rn is the net radiant flux w m2 g is the ground heat flux w m2 s is the heat storage of vegetation and atmosphere w m2 h is the sensible heat flux w m2 and le is the latent heat flux w m2 as the term s is small and often ignored the expression is simplified as follows 2 r n g h l e when the available energy rn g is equal to the turbulent energy h le energy is considered to be closed else energy is considered to be not closed energy balance ratio ebr and ordinary linear regression olr are commonly used for assessing the energy balance closure the ebr method refers to the ratio of the turbulence to the available energy directly measured by the ec system which is calculated as follows 3 e b r l e h r n g ideally the ebr is equal to 1 implying that the energy is completely closed the olr method fits a linear regression to the data of the available energy and the turbulent fluxes h le ideally when the energy is completely closed the slope of the regression line is 1 with the intercept being 0 3 results 3 1 daily variation characteristics of energy flux due to different vegetation types and underlying surface conditions the heat and water vapour exchange capacities of terrestrial ecosystems and atmosphere are different resulting in different distribution ratios of energy flux in different ecosystems by averaging the energy flux values for the same time of a year the daily scale changes in each energy flux were analysed and the dynamic change process of the seasonal scale energy flux was subsequently evaluated the diurnal curve of each energy flux of the chunhua shrub ecosystem in the gully region of the clp was a single peak quadratic curve fig 4 a which was smaller in the morning and evening and larger at noon the maximum daily rn appeared at 12 30pm with the value reaching 364 6 w m2 after which it gradually decreased and changed little after 19 30 compared to the daily dynamic curve of rn the daily dynamic curves of g h and le were similar with the variation range being smaller h reached the peak value of 142 6 w m2 at 12 00 the peak value of 86 0 w m2 for le appeared earlier at 11 30 and the daily dynamic curve of g reached the peak value of 39 0 w m2 at 14 00 the energy distribution was mainly based on h and g with the energy distribution ratios being h rn g rn le rn 0 00 3 00 and 20 00 23 00 and h rn le rn g rn 9 00 16 00 fig 4b at 7 00 8 00 and 18 00 19 00 the energy distribution ratio curve fluctuated sharply before and after sunrise the troughs of h rn and g rn and the peaks of le rn realised complementarity and the peaks of h rn and troughs of g rn and le rn realised complementarity before and after sunset this was because the heat source of the shrub ecosystem transformed between the atmosphere and soil the directions and magnitudes of the energy components changed during these time periods which abruptly changed the energy distribution ratio curve during sunrise and sunset compared to other time periods when large peaks or troughs were observed in the interval on one hand after water vapour condensation at night at sunrise the soil moisture was found to be relatively high and a relatively high relative air humidity most of the energy was used in water vapour transmission with h being higher on the other hand rn changed from negative to positive during this time rn was weak and significantly lesser than the supply of evapotranspiration energy by g at this time the value of le was approximately equal to the sum of rn and g such that le rn was greater than 1 which suddenly changed the energy distribution ratio curve and complementary peaks and valleys in the curve appeared yan et al 2015 the bowen ratio describes the stability of air characterises atmosphere surface energy exchange characteristics and reflects the distribution ratio of rn absorbed by the shrub ecosystems in h and le the daily dynamic change curve of the bowen ratio showed a single peak change 0 00 7 30 and 18 00 23 00 with the ratio being negative fig 4c the bowen ratio was greater than 1 9 30 to 16 00 and reached a peak value of 1 7 at 12 00 indicating that during this period h was the main distribution of rn which was consistent with the situation reflected by the energy distribution ratio curve to better characterise the seasonal changes in the energy balance of the shrub ecosystem the monthly average data of energy flux for march spring june summer september autumn and december winter with simultaneous typical seasonality were processed to analyse the daily dynamic process of energy flux in different seasons fig 5 shows that all energy components of the representative months in typical seasons were based on rn showing a unimodal curve change the daily maximum value of rn occurred 12 30 13 30 as shown in table 1 the representative months of the typical seasons the daily maximum and average values of rn were different respectively in spring rn became positive at 8 30 which indicated that energy began to enter the shrub as an income item at 13 00 rn reached a daily maximum and turned negative from 18 30 onward energy began to be expended by the shrub ecosystem the average value of rn greater than 0 in a day was found to be 247 3 w m2 in summer rn became positive at 7 00 reached a daily maximum value of 419 0 w m2 at 13 30 and became negative at 19 30 the average value of rn greater than 0 in a day was found to be 263 1 w m2 with the daily average value being 117 0 w m2 in autumn rn became positive at 8 00 reached a daily maximum value of 414 4 w m2 at 12 30 and became negative at 18 30 the average value of rn greater than 0 in a day was found to be 259 2 w m2 with the daily average value being 90 0 w m2 in winter rn became positive at 9 00 reached the daily maximum value of 235 3 w m2 at 13 00 and became negative at 17 00 the average value of rn greater than 0 in a day was 149 3 w m2 with the daily average value being 18 4 w m2 the diurnal variations in h le and rn showed similar unimodal curve changes in spring as rn significantly increased the ground surface vegetation did not start growing with the underlying surface specific heat being relatively large resulting in a relatively large h during this period with a daily maximum value of 235 8 w m2 le was closely related to plant transpiration and was affected by the surface temperature soil moisture and saturated vapour pressure of the underlying surface in summer there was more rainfall and sufficient sunlight plant transpiration was strong and air humidity was high most of the energy was used for water vapour transmission le was larger in summer with an average value of 64 4 w m2 and smaller in winter with an average value of 4 3 w m2 g smoothly changed in winter with an average value of 37 1 w m2 and a standard deviation of 2 0 w m2 and was closely related to rn rn increased in spring with the surface being relatively bare soil thermal conductivity being good and g significantly varying from 30 1 to 70 8 w m2 in different seasons soil properties soil water content levels and vegetation coverage were different and g exhibited large temporal and spatial variations 3 2 seasonal changes in energy flux at monthly time scale rn h le and g of the shrub ecosystem in the gully region of the clp were similar to the diurnal variation in the energy flux exhibiting a single peak change as shown in fig 6 the maximum and minimum value of rn for the chunhua shrub ecosystem appeared in may 349 8 mj m2 and december 49 2 mj m2 respectively the total annual rn was 2385 6 mj m2 higher than that of the semi arid grassland of the clp 2269 0 mj m2 and lower than that of the shennongjia dajiu lake peat wetland of china 3146 9 mj m2 yue et al 2011 the change in h was observed to be synchronised with rn the maximum and minimum value of h appeared in april 128 4 mj m2 and july 27 7 mj m2 respectively the total annual h was 787 6 mj m2 accounting for 33 0 of the annual rn le is the evapotranspiration heat consumption which gradually increased with the heat of water evaporation during the same period from january to july after reaching a peak value of 186 3 mj m2 in july it gradually decreased to the minimum value of 11 2 mj m2 december the total annual le was 1059 1 mj m2 accounting for 44 4 of the annual rn the total le was greater and less than the total h from may to october and other months respectively the energy distribution characteristic of the entire year showed that le was greater than h g was numerically smaller than other energy components by one to two orders of magnitude g was positive from february to july with the maximum and minimum values reaching 37 0 mj m2 in may and 99 1 mj m2 in december respectively and the annual total being 48 3 mj m2 this indicated that soil acted as a heat source to release heat from deep soil to soil surface or atmosphere and g only accounted for 2 0 of the total rn 3 3 energy flux distribution characteristics and bowen ratio the energy flux of the chunhua shrub ecosystem in 2020 was divided into growing april to july and non growing seasons august to march and the relationship between the energy components in the study area was analysed as shown in table 2 le accounted for 44 1 of rn in the growing season which was greater than the proportion of h and g indicating its domination in the energy of the ecosystem in the growing season the total h and rn in the non growing season were 482 7 and 1146 3 mj m2 respectively with h accounting for 42 1 of rn the total le was 513 1 mj m2 accounting for 44 8 of rn the annual energy budget ratio was le rn h rn g rn in the chunhua shrub ecosystem the monthly change in the bowen ratio over the entire year was approximately u shaped with large fluctuations fig 7 the bowen ratio was observed to be high in winter and low in summer with small fluctuation its maximum and minimum values were 4 0 in december and 0 2 in july respectively h was less and greater than le from june to november and other months respectively the monthly average bowen ratio was 1 6 with the annual ratio being 0 8 3 4 energy balance analysis the closure of turbulence energy h le and available energy rn g measured by the ec method was analysed using the ebr method as shown in fig 8 obvious monthly changes were observed in the ebr with the maximum 1 2 and minimum 0 4 values appearing in february and december respectively from january to march the energy balance closure was significantly large and the ebr value was greater than 1 the remaining months were energy unclosed with the annual ebr being 0 8 indicating that the residuals of the energy balance closure was 20 the closure for the growing and non growing seasons were 0 74 and 0 78 respectively with the energy balance closure in the non growing season being better a linear regression analysis of the energy balance of the chunhua shrub ecosystem was performed for every month of the year the closed linear regression analysis results of the balance of the annual turbulent energy h le and available energy rn g are shown in fig 9 where regression coefficient intercept and correlation coefficient r2 of the regression equation obtained by fitting the annual turbulent energy h le and available energy rn g were 0 7 9 5 and 0 8 respectively the slope of the daily scale regression analysis ranged from 0 7 to 1 1 with the annual average of 0 9 the intercept varied from 60 9 to 7 6 w m2 with the annual average of 23 9 w m2 the correlation coefficient varied from 0 4 to 0 9 with the annual average of 0 8 at the time scale of 30 min table 3 shows the monthly linear regression parameters of the chunhua shrub ecosystem in the gully region of the clp the range of the regression coefficient was 0 6 0 8 with the annual average of 0 7 the range of the intercept was 6 7 14 1 w m2 with the annual average of 7 0 w m2 the correlation coefficient changed from 0 6 to 0 8 with the annual average of 0 8 theoretically energy balance closure was established but regardless of the properties of the underlying surface an energy unclosed phenomenon will remain the parameter ranges for the energy balance closed regression equation for flux observatories worldwide are regression coefficient varying from 0 53 to 0 99 with the average value of 0 8 intercept varying from 32 9 to 36 9 w m2 with the average value of 0 7 w m2 and correlation coefficient varying from 0 64 to 0 96 with the average value of 0 9 in the flux observation stations of china the regression coefficient varied from 0 5 to 0 8 with the average value of 0 7 intercept varied from 10 8 to 79 9 w m2 with the average value of 28 9 w m2 and the correlation coefficient varied from 0 5 to 0 9 with the average value of 0 8 the results of this study were consistent with those of other related studies wilson et al 2002 3 5 factors affecting latent and sensible heat fluxes 3 5 1 monthly change characteristics of the meteorological factors fig 10 a shows that the monthly rainfall in the gully regions of the clp presented a single peak variation with an annual rainfall of 511 3 mm rainfall was mainly concentrated from may to august accounting for 70 9 of the annual rainfall the maximum and minimum monthly rainfalls were 119 5 and 3 4 mm in june and december respectively in the months with heavy rainfall the volumetric water content of the soil also significantly increased fig 10b the volumetric water content at different soil depths responded differently to the rainfall a soil water content of 20 cm was more sensitive to the changes in rainfall with the increase in soil depth the response of the soil volumetric water content to rainfall was delayed and the change in amplitude was smaller than that of the shallow soil 3 5 2 correlationship of le and h to environmental factors net radiation rn air humidity gradient h water vapour pressure difference vpd rainfall p soil moisture ms and soil temperature ts were used for representing the environmental factors the correlation between h le and various environmental factors was analysed table 4 and the response relationship between water and energy flux and environmental factors was explored the air temperature and humidity gradients were expressed by the difference between the heights at 2 and 4 m soil humidity and temperature were measured at a depth of 20 cm the latent heat flux and sensible heat flux from 9 00 to 16 00 and the average values of various environmental factors were selected for the correlation analysis table 4 shows that both h and le had a significant positive correlation with rn and the positive correlation between le and rn was stronger than that between h and rn h was negatively correlated with rainfall soil moisture and soil temperature contrary to h le was significantly positively correlated with soil temperature in addition le was significantly positively correlated with air humidity gradient and water vapour pressure difference because when the soil temperature was high the evapotranspiration of soil water increased and air humidity was high the energy was mainly used for the evapotranspiration heat consumption of the ecosystem and turbulent energy was dominated by le with sufficient soil moisture and high soil humidity plant transpiration will be evident transpiration heat absorption will reduce the heat transported to the atmosphere thus decreasing h resulting in soil moisture and h being negatively correlated wu et al 2013 4 discussion the annual energy distribution of le was greater than that of h with the annual bowen ratios being slightly lower than that of the semi arid grassland of the clp 1 1 and slightly higher than that of the subtropical bamboo forest ecosystem 0 4 and shennongjia dajiu lake peat wetland of china 0 5 yue et al 2011 sun et al 2015 the annual ebr of the shrub ecosystem in the chunhua gully region calculated using the energy balance ratio method was 0 8 lower than the lucky hills shrubland of usa 0 96 scott 2009 the energy balance at most surface atmosphere flux research sites remains unclosed recent reviews have identified exchange processes and turbulent motions at large spatial and temporal scales in heterogeneous landscapes as the primary cause of the lack of energy balance closure at some researched sites li et al 2015 stoy et al 2013 while unmeasured storage terms eshonkulov et al 2019 haverd et al 2007 heusinkveld et al 2003 liu et al 2017 different correction approaches goncalves et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 mismatch of eddy cvariance and net radiation measurements baldocchi and dennis 2015 baldocchi et al 2000 kohsiek et al 2007 kustas et al 2000 large scale circulations eder et al 2015 and the importance of good practice including site selection when making flux measurements should not be discounted the main reasons for the residuals of the energy balance closure are as follows 1 turbulence effect the measurement of the ec system requires the turbulence at the underlying surface to be relatively violent however the turbulence is weak at night which lowers the observed value of energy than the real value wang et al 2019 2 condition of underlying surface the measurement of the ec system requires the underlying surface to be flat and homogeneous but the actual underlying surface is complex and contains different terrain or vegetation types thus meeting the assumption that the horizontal flux is zero is difficult which affects the accuracy of the turbulent flux measurement to a certain extent 3 weather conditions affected by different weather conditions the variation characteristics of the surface energy are significantly different on sunny days the surface energy component is single peaked cloudy days greatly impact radiation disturbance and fluctuations in cloud size make the surface energy flux become multimodal with frequent alternating peaks and valleys rainfall affects atmospheric transparency reduces temperature and increases the soil moisture content if the weather is clear after rain the cloud cover and turbidity will be low the rn intensity will be high and soil evaporation and plant transpiration will be intense thus increasing le and decreasing h when vegetation withers in winter snow changes the ground surface reflectance and thermal properties which affects the energy balance 4 neglecting other energies while calculating the energy balance equation the soil heat flux not only contains the heat flux measured by the soil heat flux plate but also the soil heat storage from the soil heat flux plate to the surface other studies have shown that the degree of closure is significantly improved when energy budget considers the 0 5 cm soil heat storage yue et al 2011 5 out of sync energy the energy components in the energy balance are usually not measured at the same plane thus the observations are not synchronised with the main reason being g not being synchronised studies have shown that the peak appearance time of g is approximately 2 5 h later than that of rn compared to the diurnal variation of le the phase is shifted back by 0 5 1 h when the energy balance components are synchronised and the phase of g is shifted forward by 1 h the surface energy balance closure and correlation coefficient will be significantly improved wang et al 2005 the study on surface energy fluxes of the shrub ecosystem in the chinese loess plateau is seldom reported in the literature mu us sand land is on the north of the loess plateau huang 2020 studied the typical shrub ecosystem of artemisia ordosica on mu us sand land and found that the energy balance of the shrub ecosystem was not closed from 2012 to 2018 the overall linear regression line for 7 years had a slope of 0 64 and the ebr is 0 82 the sensible heat flux was the main energy component that consumed net radiation on both of the annual and seasonal scales in this study we found that latent heat dominated the annual energy distribution of shrub ecosystem in the gully region of the loess plateau in 2020 the climate of the ecosystem in mu us sandy land belongs to the typical semi arid continental climate the annual precipitation there is only 287 mm the annual net radiation is 2660 mj m2 and the sunshine is abundant the average annual potential evaporation is 2 024 mm which is much higher than the annual precipitation and the water resource is scarce the soil water capacity of the sand land is very small in most of the time the soil is very dry and the water in the soil to evaporate is very limited therefore the latent heat flux is small and sensible heat flux is the dominant the mu us sandy land ecosystem is a typical arid and semi arid climate transition zone and the vegetation coverage is relatively low while the chunhua shrub ecosystem has a relatively high vegetation coverage and the vegetation transpiration is relatively strong the annual precipitation in the chunhua shrub ecosystem is 511 3mm the annual net radiation is 2385 6 mj m2 the soil water capacity of loess soil is very large and most of the rainfall is stored in the soil in the process of transpiration and heat absorption the heat transferred to the atmosphere is reduced resulting in the decrease of sensible heat flux wu et al 2013 at the same time rainfall events can reduce temperature increase soil moisture content and increase soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration resulting in increased latent heat flux and decreased sensible heat flux gong et al 2015 these reasons lead to significant differences in energy budget distribution between the two ecosystems 5 conclusion the annual rn of the chunhua shrub ecosystem in the gully region of the clp was 2385 6 mj m2 with le h and g being 1059 1 787 6 and 48 3 mj m2 respectively indicating that the energy of the ecosystem was mainly exchanged in the form of le each energy component changed in a unimodal curve on both daily and seasonal scales the energy distribution was dominated by le on a daily scale h and g were the main energy components with the energy distribution ratio being h rn g rn le rn 0 00 3 00 and 20 00 23 30 and h rn le rn g rn 9 00 to 16 00 compared with the daily dynamic curves of rn g le and h had the same changing trend but a smaller changing range the daily dynamic curve of the bowen ratio showed a single peak change reaching a peak of 1 69 at 12 00 on an annual scale the bowen ratios were higher and lower in winter and summer respectively the bowen ratio was 0 2 in july and 4 0 in december the monthly average bowen ratio was 1 6 and the annual bowen ratio was 0 8 the monthly ebr value of the shrub ecosystem calculated by the energy balance ratio method varied from 0 4 to 1 2 with the annual value of 0 8 the regression and correlation coefficients in the linear regression equation of the shrub ecosystem were at an average level indicating that the flux data obtained using the ec technology to observe the shrub ecosystem was reliable the calculation of soil heat flux in this study did not consider surface heat storage and the energy balance closure still requires further observation and research land ecosystem network observation based on the ec technology has become an important method for studying the relationship between global change and land ecosystems reflecting the energy change process at different time scales and revealing the characteristics of energy balance between atmosphere soil and vegetation this study only analysed the energy flux characteristics of the shrub ecosystem in one year discussed the energy balance of the ecosystem and performed correlation analysis between the environmental factors and water and heat fluxes in future research the observation of vegetation index and phenology will be incorporated to study the multi scale multi objective and multi process exploration of the energy flux balance and

964,a problem characteristic of the modern anthropogenic era is pollution of the environment with xenobiotics the continual development of industry and the use of insufficiently balanced waste management results in increasing amounts of pollutants entering surface waters particularly xenobiotic substances these substances such as dyes pharmaceuticals and personal care products endocrine active compounds pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have a negative impact on biodiversity their main routes of transfer to aquatic ecosystems include industrial and municipal wastewater discharges and waste from households industry and agriculture as such there is a great need to identify xenobiotics in the environment define transfer and transformation pathways assess the impact of these substances on individual levels of the trophic chain and characterize their potential toxicity in response to legal regulations such as directive 2000 60 ec of the european parliament and of the council and the act of 20 july 2017 on the water law aimed at organizing the management of these substances increasing attention is being paid to the improvement of existing low cost remediation methods and the development of new ones such new approaches include ecohydrological biotechnology and nature based solutions nbs intended for the removal of xenobiotics from surface water this is extremely important for surface water resources in europe where a significant number of 70 of surface water bodies were classified as worse than good ecological condition by the european environment agency in 2015 key words xenobiotics ecohydrology toxicology surface water contamination 1 introduction the rapid development of the industry and the growing demand for an ever expanding range of consumer products have led to global degradation of the environment it is estimated that as many pollutants entered the natural environment in the years 2000 2010 as during the preceding 70 years stepnowski et al 2010 about one million products are produced annually in the world of which 100 000 are chemical compounds of these 15 thousand are potential xenobiotic substances kucherenko et al 2021 the european environmental agency defines a xenobiotic as a toxic substance that does not occur naturally in the environment european environmental agency accessed on 06 08 2021 one important group of xenobiotics comprises those of anthropogenic origin i e with an artificial chemical structure their accumulation in both the environment and organisms makes them a great threat to the functioning of entire ecosystems greń 2012 dobrzański et al 2017 kumar et al 2017 xenobiotic pollution presents a particular threat to surface waters these being inland and marine waters which can be subdivided into transitional waters partially closed bays and estuaries and coastal waters constituting the waters of the open sea up to one mile from the shore zabłocka godlewska przystaś 2016 ciećko panek 2019 a number of studies have reported the presence of xenobiotic compounds in surface waters throughout the world kim et al 2009 kumar et al 2012 including those in europe feo et al 2010 sablayrolles et al 2011 masiá et al 2013 milić et al 2018 and poland pawełczyk 2013 kiedrzyńska et al 2014a and even in the arctic lehmann konera et al 2020 and antarctica hernández et al 2019 not only are xenobiotic compounds characterized by poor degradability some may undergo partial decomposition which can result in the production of substances with a higher toxic potential than the original compound xenobiotic compounds can also bioaccumulate in organisms resulting in their concentrations increasing significantly in the tissues of animals as they are translocated up the levels of the trophic chain a process called biomagnification dubey et al 2014 the exposure of aquatic organisms to xenobiotic substances creates not only presents a constant threat but also entails an urgent need to monitor the threats they pose and to identify modern methods of remediation of polluted ecosystems fernando et al 2019 mishra et al 2019 tonelli tonelli 2020 pinto et al 2021 to provide an overview of this complex and important issue this article reviews the present state of knowledge in the field of surface water contamination with xenobiotics it identifies the most common routes of transfer of these substances to aquatic ecosystems and attempts to determine their impact on organisms from different levels of the trophic pyramid and human health it also characterizes methods in the field of ecohydrological biotechnology and nature based solutions eh nbs for the remediation of surface water resources contaminated with xenobiotics 2 characteristics of xenobiotics the production of xenobiotic compounds is primarily related to human activities particularly industrial ones many compounds are employed in the chemical and petrochemical industry or are distributed through the environment in the form of pesticides fig 1 kozak włodarczyk makuła 2016 debroux et al 2012 in addition to having an adverse effect on the health of living organisms dobrzański et al 2017 xenobiotics are also particularly damaging to aquatic ecosystems these are particularly vulnerable due to the fact that many reservoirs are used as discharge sites not only for sewage and stormwater from urbanized areas but also contaminated water from agricultural and industrial areas these are often a source of toxic xenobiotics including petroleum hydrocarbons polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps pesticides dyes polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and phenolic compounds dordio carvalho 2013 a range of hydrocarbons are found in the environment and these can be derived from both anthropogenic and natural origins biogenic hydrocarbons are synthesized by bacteria algae algae or cyanobacteria while pyrogenic hydrocarbons are formed by the incomplete combustion of organic carbon compounds petroleum hydrocarbons or petrogenic hydrocarbons have a particularly negative impact on the environment fabisiak 2008 they represent the main source of energy for many industries and hence represent a major source of land contamination such complex fuels include a range of monoaromatic volatile compounds benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which are known to be highly toxic and have been found to cause mutagenesis and carcinogenesis cook hesterberg 2013 unfortunately large complex hydrocarbon molecules do not degrade easily and can persist as health hazards al hawash et al 2018 one group of petroleum hydrocarbons is the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs containing more than one aromatic ring in their structure they are predominantly formed by pyrolysis and pyrosynthesis and their most important sources include incomplete combustion and pyrolysis of coal oil wood and petroleum products dat chang 2017 concerns regarding the release of pahs into the aquatic environment are related to their high toxicitypahs have the ability to bioaccumulate in tissues and organs where they act as mutagens and carcinogens kubiak 2013 helcom 2021 this group includes primarily benzene derivatives including chlorinated and brominated derivatives petroleum hydrocarbons herbicides and dyes dordio carvalho 2013 the biodegradability of pahs is closely related to their structure compounds with a greater number of aromatic rings not only require more complex biodegredation but the process is also much slower indeed the presence of various functional groups in compounds is of great importance in decomposition processes zabłocka godlewska przystaś 2016 it is believed that the biodegradability of a molecule is influenced by the number of its functional groups due to the number of enzymatic attacks that must occur in order to split the groups wackett ellis 1999 furthermore as individual microorganisms are only able to metabolize a limited range of substrates a consortium of microorganisms is needed for complete mineralization of a complex compound ghazali et al 2004 apart from pahs one of the largest groups of xenobiotic environmental pollutants is that of pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene products ppcps these compounds find their way into ecosystems both as metabolites and in their unprocessed form bester et al 2008 regarding the latter painkillers antibiotics harnisz et al 2020 steroids and antidepressants often enter the environment unprocessed debroux et al 2012 easy access to pharmaceutical substances such as vitamins dietary supplements and over the counter drugs and their improper disposal result in these compounds being present in large amounts in wastewater wontorska wąsowski 2018 although pharmacologically active compounds are processed in sewage treatment plants with the wastewater the removal process is not efficient and they are often detected in treated wastewater chander et al 2016 and in surface waters dai et al 2015 the pharmaceuticals most frequently detected in the aquatic environment include non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids fibrates β blockers azoles antibiotics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris the presence of such active pharmaceuticals in water reservoirs negatively affects the species occurring in them due to stress induction and exerting adverse effects on reproduction and enzyme function burkina et al 2015 however effects of these substances will depend on their concentrations physicochemical properties efficiency of wastewater treatment plants and environmental conditions endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs of exogenous origin also demonstrate toxic effects via their ability to disrupt the functioning of the endocrine system in addition they demonstrate considerable durability and the ability to bioaccumulate in organisms debroux et al 2012 kim et al 2017 steroid based edcs e g 17 α ethinylestradiol are used in medications and oral contraception phenolic compounds e g bisphenol a nonylphenol also acting as hormonal modulators are widely used in the production of polycarbonate plastics epoxy resins agricultural and household industries and the production of antioxidants wang et al 2018 the main sources of edcs include sewage from households and industrial and agricultural sources again due to the often low efficiency of wastewater treatment the edcs are only partially eliminated and high levels can be observed in treated wastewater discharged into the aquatic environment mnif et al 2010 one significant group of edcs are pesticides kim et al 2017 pesticides are xenobiotics deliberately introduced into the environment to protect plants and animals by combating harmful and undesirable pests weeds and plant diseases these compounds may be of artificial or natural origin the toxic nature of pesticides is related to their bioaccumulation in cells and the possibility of affecting dna and hormone functioning rzeszutek et al 2014 pesticides can enter surface waters through the groundwater from here they can pose a threat to the fish birds and mammals inhabiting the area including humans maurya malik 2016 many coloring substances are also classified as edcs al sharabati et al 2021 many colorants have been developed to higher color stability or resistance to environmental factors as such the entry of dyes into surface waters along with untreated sewage poses a great threat to aquatic ecosystems zabłocka godlewska przystaś 2016 of these aromatic dyes are least susceptible to biodegradation as a result unprocessed or slightly degraded compounds often end up in the aquatic environment and these can limit access to light for many plants and autotrophic microorganisms this drastically reduces biological activity especially the processes based on photosynthesis resulting in a reduction in oxygen concentration rehman et al 2015 another group of compounds that negatively affect the hormonal balance are polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs they belong to the group of dioxins which are known to demonstrate toxic and carcinogenic properties moreover exposure to pcbs is known to weaken reproductive and immune processes and induce changes in the genotype of organisms they largely enter the aquatic environment from sewage treatment plants urbaniak kiedrzyńska 2015 due to the fact that they are sparingly soluble in water pcbs bind to mineral and organic particles thus facilitating their transport in river environments as well as their deposition and sedimentation urbaniak et al 2019 polychlorinated dibenzodioxins pcdds and polychlorinated dibenzofurans pcdfs also have similar effects on living organisms these compounds also tend to accumulate in food chains thus posing a direct threat to the health of both animals and humans urbaniak et al 2014a urbaniak et al 2014b with the tendency to bioaccumulate in living organisms their presence can result in damage to inter alia neurological and hormonal systems and can cause tumor formation kiedrzyńska et al 2017 the pharmaceutical petrochemical or dyeing industries also widely use phenolic compounds tian et al 2020 these are present in a range of products used in households and agriculture including emulsifiers detergents or moisturizers and dispersants ahmad et al 2020 many have endocrine disrupting properties with the best known example being bisphenol a bpa used in the production of plastic and epoxy resins wang et al 2015 ashrap et al 2017 in addition triclosan a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent widely used in personal care products is also known to demonstrate estrogenic activity in living organisms as does benzophenone 3 bp 3 which is used in cosmetics with a uv filter wang et al 2015 another group of phenolic compounds widely used as ingredients in detergents paints cleaners cosmetics and pesticides are nonylphenols nps due to the lipophilic properties of nps they can accumulate in adipose tissue and affect the functioning of food chains the main routes of exposure to nps are skin contact ingestion and inhalation with the organs most exposed to them being the eyes skin digestive system respiratory system liver brain thyroid pancreas kidneys bladder and reproductive organs noorimotlagh et al 2017 3 transfer of xenobiotics into the environment in the 1960s the main sources of xenobiotics in the surface and groundwater of western europe were the chemical coal and steel industries however both the number and types of xenobiotic sources have considerably frown due to the continual development of industry in response strict regulations have been placed on industrial emissions of toxic substances as a result most environmental contamination is caused by the deposition of everyday products with hygiene products paints heavy metals and pahs being most frequently detected in wastewater as well as chemicals derived from building materials textiles or plastics bester et al 2008 xenobiotics can be transferred to the environment both indirectly fig 2 via the entry of a xenobiotic modified as a result of a biological process srivastava et al 2016 and directly based on the direct emission of xenobiotic compounds the latter route is associated with improper sewage treatment incorrect waste management policy heavy shipping traffic and port activity as well as accidental pollution spills precipitation and atmospheric deposition arya haq 2019 de oliveira et al 2020 the dynamic development of the pharmaceutical industry since the 1860s has resulted in the increased production and consumption of pharmaceuticals including hormonal drugs antidepressants and substances used in the treatment of cancer as a result steroid hormones can be found not only in the wastewater flowing into the treatment plant but also in the water discharged from the treatment plant into the environment žižlavská hlavínek 2020 de oliveira et al 2020 define three key groups of chemical pharmaceutical residue generators large generators such as pharmaceutical companies small generators such as hospitals research centers and educational institutions and microgenerators such as houses and farms studies of potential pharmaceutical transport processes from surface waters contaminated with wastewater have shown that pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole infiltrate shallow groundwater layers and occur in concentrations of over 20 ng l up to 6 m away from the source of pollution resulting in contamination of the environment itself bradley et al 2014 numerous studies have also indicated the presence of xenobiotics such as pharmaceuticals in drinking water most drugs are only present in water in the form of micropollutants such pharmaceuticals can also undergo numerous changes in response to environmental conditions leading to the formation of conjugates or cometabolites žižlavská hlavínek 2020 4 transformation of xenobiotics in the environment xenobiotics not only undergo numerous transformations in the environment fig 3 but also accumulate in the tissues of aquatic invertebrates in the midwater and are passed on to the higher levels of the trophic chain i e fish amphibians reptiles and mammals embrandiri et al 2016 maurya malik 2016 one of the processes influencing the fate of xenobiotics in the environment is adsorption the occurrence of which affects their transport and bioavailability chemicals with strong sorption properties are usually less mobile and have a lower leaching potential nevertheless such compounds are more likely to penetrate into groundwater sui et al 2015 in the environment xenobiotics e g pesticides undergo chemical hydrolysis oxidation reduction reactions physical and biological changes cometabolism and mineralization many compounds are also photodegradable resulting in a shorter half life in sunlight in the case of direct photodegradation compounds that absorb light in the visible spectrum are broken down or rearranged to form a new stable product by the absorption of photons however during indirect photodegradation a photosensitive molecule absorbs light and produces a number of reactive forms that can degrade the target xenobiotic compound remucal 2014 typically compounds undergo only partial degradation resulting in the formation of other less complex and usually less toxic substances arora 2020 as individual microorganisms are only able to metabolize a limited amount of substrates the biodegradation of complex compounds such as hydrocarbons requires the cooperation of several species a process known as cometabolism in such activities the final mineralization products are obtained by mixed population groups with increased enzymatic capacity nevertheless during the cometabolism of complex substances such as crude oil individual strains present in a given consortium play an individual role in the processes of transformation and degradation ghazali 2004 while the products of cometabolism are metabolites with greater solubility and lower toxicity than the parent compounds mineralization processes typically generate carbon dioxide and water however depending on the nature of the processes taking place and the structure of the molecule the products can also be ammonia methane and various types of inorganic components maurya malik 2016 kumar 2017 arora 2020 in aquatic organisms such as fish the biotransformation of harmful substances is a two step process timbrell marrs 2009 during phase i catalyzed by inter alia cytochrome p450 enzymes oxygenases hydrolytic enzymes oxidation reduction and hydrolysis reactions take place at this stage a polar functional group oh nh2 sh cooh is introduced to the substance when phase i metabolites are soluble in water they are excreted during detoxification in phase ii biochemical conjugation takes place during this process liver enzymes attach molecules such as glycine or sulfates to the toxicant methylation and acetylation also take place with the aim of weakening the biological activity of the xenobiotic phase ii products are compounds that are easily soluble in water and are devoid of toxic effects burkina et al 2015 nevertheless some xenobiotics are resistant to biodegradation processes and moreover the complex interactions between these substances lead to the formation of products that are often more toxic than the substrate hlavínek žižlavská 2015 5 analysis of xenobiotic toxicity in aquatic organisms due to the fact that xenobiotics are easily transported over long distances can be deposited in the natural environment where they can undergo numerous transformations reactions and interactions it is usually extremely difficult to assess the ecotoxic effects of these substances dordio carvalho 2013 the effects of a substance on a living organisms are typically evaluated by toxicological methods and an integration of both positive and negative effects of a substance on the growth and development of the organism the biological methods used in toxicology to assess environmental pollution are divided into bioanalytics which consists of biosensors biotests and biomonitoring based on the analysis of passive samples of living matter and the observation of bioindicators traczewska 2008 in aquatic ecosystems the harmful effects of chemicals are determined by water toxicology whose purpose is to assess the impact of pollutants on aquatic organisms traczewska 2011 toxic substances can have direct or indirect effects on the biocenosis of aquatic ecosystems direct toxicity occurring when the concentration of a toxicant exceeds the mean harmful concentration value as determined by a range of toxicological tests indirect action resulting from changes in environmental parameters under the influence of the introduced pollution thus causing harmful effects to the biocenosis traczewska 2011 assessment of the harmfulness of chemical substances occurring among others in surface water sewage leachate or drinking water it is performed using acute toxicity tests typically changes in the number and condition of bioindicator organisms are observed within 96 hours after a single dose of the test substance in addition chronic toxicity tests can not only be used to assess the adverse effects of a toxicant on individuals but also on entire populations during long term toxicity tests organisms are exposed to at least five concentrations of test substance throughout an entire life cycle the main toxicity parameter is the dose which is the amount of the substance administered taken or absorbed by the body causing specific effects table 1 kozak włodarczyk makuła 2016 biological methods used in the analysis of water quality not only demonstrate higher sensitivity and precision than chemical methods but also do not require specialized equipment and are cheaper in addition by avoiding the use of chemicals other than the tested toxicant they are safe for the environment moreover they allow the effects of xenobiotics entering an ecosystem to be predicted goncharuk 2014 however the large number and variety of toxic substances make the analysis of harmful compounds not only time consuming and costly but also problematic in terms of toxicity assessment kaza et al 2007 the ecotoxicological risk of a composite environmental sample depends not only on its chemical composition but also varies depending on the individual sensitivity of organisms to its individual components richter et al 2015 however it is possible to make comprehensive assessments of the risk posed by all chemicals occurring in a medium such as treated wastewater and to determine their additive antagonistic and synergistic action by using a battery of biotests based on representatives of various trophic levels szklarek et al 2021 5 1 tests using producers as algae are sensitive to low concentrations of toxic substances they are widely used in toxicology tests such tests are typically based on the use of multi generational cultivation of organisms with diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria being most commonly used in standardized biotests kosakowska król 2009 one of the bioindicators used to assess water quality are algae of the genus chlorella many studies have found that synchronous cultures of chlorella vulgaris provide accurate determinations of the effects of test substances on cells in their individual stages of life resulting in a more precise assessment of impact of a contaminant on the test organisms czaplicka kotas lodowska 2014 other biotests have used pseudokirchneriella subcapitata tetraselmis suecica selenastrum capricornutum or desmodesmus subspicatus diatoms such as ditylum brightwellii or skeletonema costatum and dinoflagellate such as prorocentrum minimum or cochlodinium polykrikoides jung et al 2020 ebenezer ki 2016 kuczyńska et al 2003 ebenezer ki 2012 biotests based on algae indicate can yield data on toxicants based on changes in culture density growth rate the degree of growth inhibition chlorophyll a and b content and cell size in addition it the ctivity of enzymatic markers such as superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat can also provide useful information calderón delgado et al 2019 aquatic vegetation such as duckweed is also used in bioassays methods recommended by the international organization for standardization iso and the organization for economic co operation and development oecd using the genus lemna are useful for identifying toxicants found in both wastewater and surface waters despite their simplicity of breeding small size rapid reproduction rate high surface to volume ratio and genetically uniform colonies only lemna minor and lemna gibba are used in toxicology studies ziegler et al 2016 l minor was used among others in studies assessing the pollution of the italian river sarno with heavy metals the organisms placed in bags immersed in the river for seven days and the effects of contamination were assessed based on morphological changes the results showed that compared to single element controls exposure of cells to a mixture of heavy metals resulted in their complete destruction basile et al 2015 5 2 tests using consumers ecotoxicological assessments of waters are often based on the use of shellfish with the most popular representative being the water flea daphnia magna its high sensitivity to xenobiotics in water derives from the fact that it filters very large amounts of water in some european countries and in the usa biotests using daphnia as indicator organisms are a mandatory method for water quality control zagrebin et al 2016 daphnia magna crustaceans have been used in the assessment of acute toxicity of 4 nonylphenol np bisphenol a bpa and heavy metals cd hg and pb after 48 hours of exposure to the tested compounds the daphnia demonstrated reduced mobility and lowered mrna expression of antioxidant enzymes kim et al 2017 other tests measure water pollution based on the chlorophyll fluorescence of algae consumed by the water flea the concentration of algae in the samples is correlated with the rate of food intake by the test organisms matorin et al 2009 daphnia spp have also been used in estimating the level of soil contamination in the italian sarno river with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides arienzo et al 2015 in addition daphnia have been used to determine the toxicity of hormonal compounds such as estriol progesterone and estradiol in a river in sao paulo torres et al 2015 szklarek et al 2021 also describe the use of the crustacean thamnocephalus platyurus as an element of the biotest battery for the ecotoxicological evaluation of treated sewage and river waters of the pilica catchment located in poland in this case mortality was used to determine the response to water samples among the consumers fish can also be used to assess water quality fish can be divided into freshwater and salt water species they owe their popularity in such analyses to their strong behavioral and physiological reactions when exposed to small amounts of pollutants the most commonly used organisms in bioassays are zebrafish brachydanio rerio minnows pimephales promelas catfish ictaluros punctatus carp cyprinus carpio rice fish oryzias latipes rainbow trout oncorhyncus mykissatus and guppy fish lebistes reticulatus traczewska 2011 fish are used among others for research on substances that are components of everyday products such as triclocarban salierno et al 2016 the parameters assessed in bioassays are mortality the effect on the development of young animals the influence of the toxicant on the stimulation of the immune system fish muscle activity survivability larval and embryo larval growth salierno et al 2016 traczewska 2011 khabbazi et al 2015 further information on toxicology can be obtained based on differences in the levels of rna proteins and metabolites some of the danio rerio tests are based on embryos which are used interchangeably for adult toxicity studies huang et al 2016 there is now an increased emphasis on performing acute cytotoxicity tests using fish cell lines this significantly reduces the number of animals used in toxicology studies kolarova et al 2021 fish have been used to test the toxicity of various xenobiotics including acetaminophen apap diphenhydramine dh carbamazepine cbz fluoxetine flx bisphenol a bpa triiodothyronine t3 perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos refined merichem rm triclosan tcs pendimethalin pendimethalin pnd huang et al 2016 huang et al 2017 ahmad ahmad 2015 danio rerio embryos have been used to evaluate the toxicity of tcs in which significant changes in the levels of urea citric acid d galactose d glucose stearic acid l proline phenylalanine and l glutamic acid were observed fu et al 2019 fish based tests cichia spp have also been used to evaluate the toxicity of heavy metals in the java and formoso rivers with the analyzed parameters being the level of genotoxic and biochemical biomarkers such as serum glucose concentration aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase the study also examined histopathological changes of the liver nuclear hypertrophy and vacuolization were observed after exposure to xenobiotics de lima et al 2018 5 3 tests using decomposers biological tests can also be used to assess the influence of xenobiotics on organisms from the trophic level of decomposers with bacteria often used as decomposers their use in analyses is primarily related to the possibility of estimating the mutagenic properties of xenobiotic substances bacterial tests are divided into tests detecting progressive mutations tests detecting reverse mutations and tests intended to detect the repair of dna damage in toxicology the most commonly used bacteria are salmonella spp and escherichia spp and luminescent bacteria traczewska 2011 among the luminescent microorganisms aliivibrio fischeri and vibrio harveyi are most often used pogorzelec piekarska 2013 their use in the assessment of water soil and bottom sediment pollution is primarily related to their ability to emit light by the oxidization of luciferase ahtiainen 2002 one such tests is microtox containing the freeze dried form of a fischeri in which the intensity of emitted light is used to determine the metabolic changes taking place in microorganisms jakubus tatuśko 2015 it has been used e g in the study of the toxicity of wastewater zadorozhnaya et al 2015 in contrast the mutatox test uses mutants of luminescent bacteria that do not have the ability to emit light during the interaction of cells with genotoxic substances the bacteria undergo mutation aversion resulting in luminescence abbas et al 2018 the use of v harveyi as a bioindicator of mutagenic pollutants is associated with their common occurrence in marine waters tolerance to a wide spectrum of salinity and high sensitivity to toxic compounds these bacteria are used e g in a test based on the detection of neomycin resistant mutants colonies that appear after contact with mutagens the development of this test greatly facilitated the detection of mutagenic compounds in salt waters podgórska węgrzyn 2006 riuz et al 2013 among the genus salmonella salmonella typhimurium is the species most frequently used in the genotoxicity assessment of chemical compounds such as xenobiotics nałęcz jawecki et al 2012 they can be used to analyze the toxicity of xenobiotics e g imidacloprid and sulfentrazone and environmental tests for the presence of these compounds e g bottom sediments bianchi et al 2015 liu et al 2015 two tests that use salmonella spp are the umu test and the ames test the umu test acts by the analysis of dna damage inducing sos repair based on s typhimurium ta1535 strains bonisławska et al 2008 nałęcz jawecki et al 2012 zutterling et al 2018 the bioindicators contain a plasmid that includes a combination of a gene belonging to the sos system and a structural gene of β galactosidase lacz nałęcz jawecki et al 2012 the genotoxicity of the tested compound provokes an increase in β galactosidase activity due to the expression of genes involved in sos repair bonisławska et al 2008 the ames test analyses reverse mutations in nutritional mutants of s typhimurium with the allowing the recovery of the ability to synthesize amino acids traczewska 2011 briefly strains of salmonella bacteria have mutations that prevent them from synthesizing histidine thus inhibiting their growth on his selective medium exposure to a genotoxic test substance leads to a change of a single nucleotide base that converts the mutated gene sequence into a sequence that allows the bacteria to grow on the medium zeiger 2019 in addition escherichia coli can also be used in the ames test but the mutants are devoid of the ability to synthesize tryptophan zeiger 2019 e coli bacteria are also used as indicator organisms in another analysis based on the sos repair system briefly the sos chromotest bioassay determines the activity of β galactosidase in the bacteria after incubation with a xenobiotic the result reflects the response to the level of induction of the lacz gene and those involved in sos repair bonisławska et al 2008 6 the xenobiotic contamination of aquatic ecosystems in europe and in the world surface and groundwater contamination resulting from the improper use and storage or accidental release of chemicals to the environment can be divided into area linear or point sources with regard to their source of origin area contamination is derived from large territories such as forests industrial or urban areas linear contamination from waterways or transport and point contamination from inter alia treated sewage outlets from sewage treatment plants kiedrzyńska et al 2014a leaks from tanks or sewage disposal installations dordio carvalho 2013 cybulski et al 2019 agricultural sources of pollution are primarily related to the losses of fertilizer components mainly nitrogen used on agricultural land and their surface runoff from rural areas erosion and deposition with precipitation kiedrzyńska et al 2014b other significant sources of agricultural point pollution in water include animal production and incorrect disposal of animal excrement which can often contain pharmaceutical substances intended for veterinary use as well as inadequately used septic tanks pajewski 2016 the treated sewage entering an ecosystem often contains cosmetics sun creams fragrances prescription and over the counter drugs drug metabolites and their transformation products fatta kassinos et al 2011 in addition high levels of polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxins pcdds polychlorinated dibenzofurans pcdfs and dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls dl pcb can also be detected in rivers studies of the pilica river poland have shown that up to 59 09 μq toxic equivalents of pcdd pcdf and dl pcb can enter the river from wastewater treatment plants per day depending on the water flow urbaniak et al 2014a urbaniak et al 2014b urbaniak et al 2015 moreover ecotoxicological analysis of pilica river water found it to inhibit the growth of pseudokirchinella subcapitata algae in 100 of the studied population szklarek et al 2021 in addition pcb and pesticide contamination have also been noted in wrocław intakes with levels of 451 96 ng l and 73 53 ng l pawełczyk 2013 it has been estimated that treated wastewater accounts for around 10 of river flows in europe however this level can rise to 30 to even 100 of the volume of receiving water in cities such as berlin bester et al 2008 tests of water discharged into the hron river in slovakia showed that although it met the quality criteria for purified water based on physicochemical indicators toxicological tests indicate the presence of xenobiotics hybská et al 2020 moreover xenobiotic testing of purified water showed the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in samples from france up to 0 39 µg l and greece up to 0 39 µg l polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in samples from finland up to 0 12 µg l and canada up to 0 42 µg l nonylphenol ethoxylates in swiss purified wastewater up to 0 28 µg l and estradiol in samples from france up to 8 6 ng l and the netherlands 12 ng l in addition xenobiotic substances have also been determined in raw sewage roof water rainwater groundwater and runoff water in samples from germany china hungary macedonia norway and poland sablayrolles et al 2011 moreover edcs have been identified in long term studies of the chaobai underground aquifer china where recovered water is the main water source wang et al 2019 various endocrine active substances have also been identified in the surface waters of the chinese bahe river octylphenol 126 ng l nonylphenol 634 8 ng l bisphenol a 1573 1 ng l estrone 55 9 ng l 17b estradiol 23 9 mg l 17α ethinyl estradiol 31 5 ng l and estriol 5 2 ng l wang et al 2018 additionally 21 xenobiotics belonging to ppcp were identified in surface water up to 7 mg l drinking water 100 ng l and in bottom sediments up to 0 85 ng g of the turia river basin in valencia these included among others ibuprofen naproxen propylparaben salicylic acid and tetrahydrocannabinol thc carmona et al 2014 in addition to xenobiotics heavy metals also pose a threat to the environment significant amounts of which have been detected in the waters of the baltic sea it is estimated that in 2014 alone the sea received 15 tons of cadmium 1 2 tons of mercury and 264 tons of lead along with river water of which the largest source was russia helcom 2018a the threat to the baltic sea is largely related to the size of its catchment area which amounts to 1 729 500 km2 four times the surface area of the sea itself the baltic catchment area is inhabited by over 84 million people with a number of urban areas characterized by intensive industrial activity and large populations which act as significant point sources of pollution helcom 2019 in addition the baltic is subject to frequent crude oil spills either accidentally from ships or as illegal discharges into the sea about 540 such leaks were detected between 2010 and 2013 helcom 2013 helcom 2014 the baltic marine environment protection commission helcom has established a list of hazardous substances used as indicators of pollution of the baltic water environment these include among others hexabromocyclo dodecane hbcdd polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs dioxins furans polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and their metabolites heavy metals tributyltin tbt or diclofenac helcom 2018b the presence of xenobiotics in catchments of two luxembourg rivers were attributed to faulty sanitary connections and ineffective recycling of wastewater from wastewater treatment plants krein et al 2013 other studies have found changes in the accumulation of xenobiotics in ecosystems to be determined by weather conditions of these flood periods are of particular importance during floods large loads of xenobiotics can be flushed from urbanized and agricultural areas as well as loads from sewage treatment plants mainly small ones these are released together with active sludge when the treatment plant is overfilled with stormwater krein et al 2012 kiedrzyńska et al 2014a urbaniak et al 2014b urbaniak et al 2015 urbaniak et al 2017 kiedrzyńska et al 2017 contamination with xenobiotics can also be observed on other continents the presence of pharmaceuticals has been recorded in water from rivers wells and lakes in hyderabad india as well as in some drinking water sources in the us chander et al 2016 another study conducted in california us showed the presence of trihalomethanes thm in drinking water the maximum concentration of which in 2014 2015 was 229 mg l oehha 2018 trimethoprim norfloxacin ofloxacin and spectinomycin have been detected in water sediment and aquatic organisms collected from the pearl river delta in china additionally ibuprofen approximately 562 ng g mass and ketoprofen up to 267 ng g mass were detected in the organisms used for ecotoxic analysis ostrea gigas mimachlamys nobilis mytilus edulis bufonaria perelegans epinephelus awoara ephippus orbis culter alburnus xie et al 2019 7 the influence of xenobiotics on humans and other vertebrates despite the implementation of measures and regulations to reduce environmental pollution by xenobiotic compounds they continue to accumulate in aquatic food webs with serious effects on ecosystems jepson et al 2016 edcs enter fish through the gills the digestive tract and the skin and thus accumulate at the top of the aquatic food chain jia et al 2017 posing a threat to human health the presence of edcs has been confirmed in wild freshwater fish caught in the xiangjiang river in china among the accumulated compounds were bisphenol a bpa in muscles and gonads and 4 n nonylphenol in the liver it was estimated that the amount of edcs contained in the studied species parabramis pekinensis cyprinus carpio and siniperca chuatsi exceeded their acceptable daily consumption zhou et al 2019 contamination with xenobiotics has also been detected in four commonly consumed smoked fish sold in markets in southern nigeria among the tested organisms scomber scombrus was characterized by the highest pah content in addition high concentrations of benzo α pyrene were observed in clarias gariepinus and ethmalosa fimbriata resulting in the recommended daily intake 0 05 mg kg being exceeded tongo et al 2017 in addition high levels of nonylphenol linear alkylbenzene sulfonate and diethylhexyl phthalate were observed in aquatic organisms in the bohai area in china these being the most harmful of the tested substances alkylbenzene sulfonate nonylphenol diethylhexyl phthalate norfloxacin sulfamethoxazole erythromycin bisphenol a ofloxacin carbamazepine naproxen atenolol and metoprolol among the analyzed groups of organisms nonylphenol and bisphenol a pose the greatest threat to fish while antibiotics are the most harmful to algae zhang et al 2017 by imitating or antagonizing endogenous hormones edcs disturb the functioning of organisms czarny et al 2017 in addition to having a negative effect on the metabolism transport and synthesis of hormones they also disrupt the synthesis of their receptors kahn et al 2020 thus exposure is associated with negative effects in many organs and tissues tab 2 wee aris 2017 it is believed that maternal exposure to endocrine active compounds not only adversely affects the activity of placental enzymes but also the adaptation of the fetus to ectopic functioning obesity and the risk of cardiovascular disease myllynen et al 2007 kahn et al 2020 one phenolic compound and endocrine active substance bisphenol a can accumulate in adipose tissue during fetal development thanks to its lipophilic properties in addition it can negatively affect the development of its organs and other tissues this compound is particularly dangerous due to its common presence in packaging and in drinking water wee aris 2017 exposure to bisphenol a and other xenobiotics including dioxins pcbs and phthalates has also been correlated with a risk of developing diabetes yilmaz et al 2020 women exposed to dibenzofurans and pcbs in 1979 by consumption of contaminated oil in taiwan were found to demonstrate an increased risk of diabetes wang et al 2008 the biomagnification of pcbs through trophic levels generates the risk of cancer atherosclerosis and damage to the nervous system petriello et al 2014 the human body is also negatively affected by pesticides high concentrations of which have been found in the dirty dozen of fruit and vegetables peaches apples peppers celery nectarines strawberries cherries kale lettuce grapes carrots and pears these compounds have an unfavorable effect on humans especially in the period of fetal maturation and adolescence asghar et al 2016 some edc pesticides such as azole fungicides and atrazine prolong the gestation period and adversely affect the level of steroid hormones in fetuses and mothers bossi et al 2013 a correlation has also been demonstrated between fungicides detected in umbilical cord blood and a reduction in the birth weight of the newborn wickerham et al 2012 in addition it has been proven that the widespread use of organophosphorus and organochlorine compounds inhibits the activity of acetylcholinesterase in the synapses of the somatic autonomic and central systems thus disrupting the functioning of the nervous system this can increase the risk of developing alzheimer s disease and may increase the onset of dementia hayden et al 2010 in addition studies show that pesticides such as rotenone and paraquat may hasten the onset of parkinson s disease by disrupting the action of dopaminergic neurons qi et al 2014 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs can also enter the human body with food these compounds are considered carcinogens and teratogens for animals as demonstrated in studies on mussels amphibians and echinoderms balcıoğlu 2016 in addition organisms are also exposed to pahs through the respiratory tract prenatal exposure to pahs was found to adversely affect cognitive development and learning ability in children in new york moreover pah exposure is known to result in anxiety depression and attention problems in humans perera et al 2012 particularly mechanics miners refinery and metalworkers and drivers this may also be used to the presence of pahs in exhaust fumes abdel shafy mansour 2016 8 legal regulations on xenobiotics in response to the high levels of xenobiotic pollution observed in the environment a number of legal regulations have been introduced concerning the methods of maintaining water ecosystems in a good condition the core document of the european strategy for the protection of surface waters is the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec as adopted by the european union directive 2000 60 ec in addition in 2007 the european commission established environmental quality standards eqs in terms of pollution with priority substances the list of which was attached to the wfd as there is an urgent need to monitor substances classified as persistent bioaccumulative toxic substances pbts among others polychlorinated biphenyls polybrominated diphenyl ethers organochlorine pesticides such as ddt standards have also been approved to establish a list of priority hazardous substances control of pbts is carried out by unep un program for the environment which was established in 2001 by the stockholm convention hlavínek žižlavská 2015 bonito et al 2016 according to the water directive 2000 60 ec good condition of surface waters is defined as a condition in which the concentrations of pollutants do not exceed the environmental quality standards each member state is required to perform the following analyses of the characteristics of river basin districts economic analyses of river basin water usage analyses of the impact of human activity on the condition of both surface and groundwater directive 2000 60 ec substances and pollutants specific to river basins are assessed under the chemical status classification and each has an environmental quality standard specifying the limit value for good status in the case of the ecological status assessment the physicochemical elements are classified into three quality classes class i is very good class ii is good and class iii is all conditions below class ii in the case of biological elements in addition to class i and ii there are also class iii moderate condition iv poor condition and class v bad condition ciećko panek 2019 due to the urgent need to control the environment the obligations of the member states regarding the wfd also include the creation of water status monitoring programs in the case of surface waters these activities include the observation of the water table level or the flow rate in terms of ecological and chemical status while for groundwater this is based around the monitoring of the quantitative and chemical status of water directive 2000 60 ec the emission limit values and environmental quality standards are presented in the following directives mercury discharges directive 82 176 eec cadmium discharges directive 83 513 eec mercury discharges directive 84 156 eec hexachlorocyclohexane discharge directive 84 491 eec directive on discharges of dangerous substances 86 280 eec directive 2000 60 ec the main groups of pollutants affected by legal regulations are priority substances understood as substances constituting chemical pollutants of surface waters and constituting a threat that can cause broadly understood toxicity to aquatic organisms substances particularly harmful to the aquatic environment which are toxic persistent bioaccumulable compounds as well as substances with alarming levels pollutants i e compounds that may cause pollution journal of laws 2017 the key aquatic pollutants requiring emission limit values include organochlorine organophosphorus organotin compounds persistent and bioaccumulative hydrocarbons toxic organic compounds cyanides metals arsenic plant protection products and biocides eutrophication inducing substances such as nitrates and phosphates substances affecting the oxygen balance and substances with proven carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic properties council directive 96 61 ec in the case of poland a list of substances particularly harmful to the environment along with their maximum permissible values table 3 are included in the regulation on maritime economy and inland navigation regulation of the minister of maritime economy and inland navigation of 12 july 2019 an important element of the control of environmental xenobiotics pollution is the analysis of the biodegradability of toxicants according to regulation ec 648 2004 of the european parliament and of the council only substances meeting the conditions for complete aerobic biodegradation may be placed on the market if a compound after analysis in accordance with iso or oecd standards is not sufficiently biodegradable appropriate proceedings are initiated regulation ec no 648 2004 moreover the risk assessment takes into account the potential effects on aquatic ecosystems bottom land and air sediments and the effects of compound accumulation in the food chain regulation ec no 1907 2006 according to the commission regulation ec no 440 2008 of 30 may 2008 these potentially harmful substances must be subjected to a battery of tests determining their toxicity and health effects such as acute and chronic toxicity testing mutagenicity skin sensitization carcinogenicity subchronic toxicity and phototoxicity and neurotoxicity council regulation ec no 440 2008 9 ecohydrological biotechnologies and nature based solutions for the remediation of xenobiotic pollution the effectiveness of removing individual xenobiotics from the environment depends not only on the concentration of the toxicant present in water but also on the correct selection of the technique for its removal which is chosen based on the properties of individual compounds chang et al 2009 pollutant oxidation methods based on the induction of radicals with high chemical activity and high oxidizing potential seem to offer promise in wastewater treatment the reactive radicals in the mixture degrade the pahs or dyes by attacking their chemical bonds one such reactions is the photo fenton reaction which is a photochemical reaction involving electromagnetic radiation ferrous salt and hydrogen peroxide the reaction increases the susceptibility of compounds to biodegradation and promotes mineralization with hydroxyl radicals being produced de luna et al 2014 krzywicka kwarciak kozłowska 2015 in addition it is possible to determine the photochemical kinetic changes taking place in surface waters using the apex aqueous photochemistry of environmentally occurring xenobiotics program in this case the reaction kinetics are predicted on the basis of the photoreactivity parameters the chemical composition of water nitrates nitrites bicarbonates carbonates bromides and dissolved carbon and the optical path length of the sun s rays in water bodrato vione 2014 other methods based on adsorption oxidation reverse osmosis flotation and coagulation processes are also used to eliminate xenobiotics from the aquatic environment unfortunately despite offering many advantages such physicochemical processes are energy consuming and expensive and conventional separation techniques e g coagulation precipitation or flocculation are not effective in removing low molecular weight xenobiotics from the environment despite this advanced processes such as membrane filtration and ion exchange are more effective being estimated to demonstrate around 95 effectiveness depending on the compounds tested tiwari et al 2017 chang et al 2009 another technique is electrocoagulation ec which is based on the same principles as coagulation and flocculation during the ec procedure coagulants are used to form aggregates and thus effectively eliminate of xenobiotic compounds from polluted water hakizimana et al 2017 ahmad et al 2020 one of the most effective physicochemical methods is adsorption which is used to separate the liquid and solid phases tiwari et al 2017 porous carbon obtained by the pyrolysis of organometallic skeletons demonstrates a high ability to adsorb xenobiotic compounds particularly pharmaceuticals and personal care products and has been used to effectively remove ibuprofen and diclofenac an et al 2018 it is estimated that diffuse sources of pollution may constitute up to 50 of the biogenic loads reaching reservoirs and coastal zones from rivers and uncontrolled wastewater discharges zalewski 2015 the use of advanced and cost intensive hydroengineering projects can only slightly improve water quality therefore high hopes are placed on ecohydrological and nature based solutions nbs which act by the regulation of interaction processes between biocenoses and water zalewski et al 2020 nbss are a class of biotechnology tools based on ecohydrology principles intended to increase the potential for sustainable development they use processes naturally occurring in ecosystems and their properties zalewski 2021 nbs are used for the protection or restoration of natural ecosystems and the enhancement or creation of natural processes in artificial or modified ecosystems these solutions can be used both in the micro scale e g in the areas of individual households and in the macro scale e g in the scale of the entire landscape in addition to supporting the circular economy and promoting recycling and reducing waste generation nbs also support green economy concepts based on the sustainable use of natural resources wwap 2018 nature based solutions are divided into methods aimed at minimizing the effects of intensive agricultural activity creation of buffer zones to control diffuse pollution designing denitrification walls to protect groundwater control of water shortages in agriculture reducing the impact of flood control drainage and irrigation infrastructure fcdi water purification using specially designed wetlands sohel et al 2015 improving water retention e g construction of retention reservoirs zalewski et al 2019 solutions favoring the protection of aquatic ecosystems using natural geochemical processes occurring in the catchment area between land and water are called ecohydrological biotechnologies izydorczyk et al 2015 example technologies include sedimentation and biofiltration systems zalewski et al 2020 and ecotones zalewski 2013 water and coastal plants which not only modify the flow but also the circulation of components have a significant impact on the quality of the water deposited in the water phase zalewski 2015 in one study the zones of biogenic emissions i e those responsible for eutrophication to the pilica catchment area and the sulejowski reservoir poland were analyzed using the swat model soil water assessment tool based on the results a list of targeted mitigation measures was generated with the aim of ensuring complementarity between good agricultural practices and the implementation of nbs solutions finally it was recommended to implement buffer zones izydorczyk et al 2019 these were supplemented with denitrification beds or biogenic barriers to increase the efficiency of nutrient elimination by plants growing in the zones zalewski et al 2020 buffer zones act as ecotone transition zones between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems the main purpose of which is the filtration of pollutants between the systems they are distinguished by a wide range of biophysical conditions ecological processes and biological diversity izydorczyk et al 2015 the buffer zones are characterized by a number of processes such as the assimilation of inorganic compounds by plants and their conversion into biomass the activity of various biogeochemical processes including denitrification and mineralization induced by microorganisms and the sorption and sedimentation of soil particles limiting its erosion izydorczyk et al 2013a the use of highly efficient ecotone zones as a form of ecohydrological biotechnology was developed during the ecotones for the reduction of diffuse pollution ekorob project frątczak et al 2013 their design exploits the biogeochemical processes taking place in the naturally formed plant systems that create buffer zones in this case the activity of natural processes were intensified with structures such as biogeochemical barriers based on limestone izydorczyk et al 2013b in addition to the creation of ecotone zones that intensify the processes of self cleaning of water reservoirs increasing numbers of retention reservoirs are being constructed these reservoirs created in natural depressions of the land not only stabilize the water flow and flatten flood waves but also capture biogenic compounds support self purification processes and provide habitats for aquatic and terrestrial organisms zalewski et al 2019 this type of reservoir designed by the european regional center for ecohydrology of the polish academy of sciences has recently been used in the city of łask in the case of the grabia river catchment kiedrzyńska et al 2021 the aim of the project was to adapt the reservoir to the natural landscape by doing so it was intended to preserve the natural course of the river bed increase water retention in the river valley and ensure a high level of biodiversity this was supported with an automatic system that would analyze the quality of river water and regulate the inflow of biogenic compounds and pollutants to the reservoir thus eliminating the risk of algae bloom kiedrzyńska et al 2021 in addition the creation of wetlands and restoration of coastal zones improves water quality and enables the control of river flow thus increasing water infiltration and protecting it from the inflow of anthropogenic pollutants in sewage in addition to supporting water purification wetlands serve as excellent ecosystems for organisms and with the increase in their surface area and the presence of aquatic macrophytes the number and diversity of flora and fauna increases hsu et al 2011 one example solution based on the construction of artificial wetlands was used in naivasha lake kenya in this case the wetlands were used to accumulate untreated wastewater released from horticultural businesses before entering the lake wanjala et al 2018 another promising biofiltration technique for wastewater treatment from biogenic and xenobiotic substances is the use of a hybrid sequential biofiltration system hsbs kiedrzyńska et al 2017 hsbss have been tested for their ability to remove primary polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs from wastewater a hybrid hsbs consisting of a geochemical barrier filtration beds with limestone coal and sawdust demonstrated a 21 reduction of pcb equivalency pcb eq in contrast a biological barrier wetlands with macrophytes i e glyceria acorus typha phragmites demonstrated a 43 reduction for wastewater discharged from a treatment plant kiedrzyńska et al 2017 the anticipated further development of ecohydrological biotechnologies is based inter alia on the optimization and improvement of individual elements of existing ecosystems one new method involves the use of ceramic aggregate coated with a biopolymer bioker such barriers are light allowing them to be replaced after saturation but still demonstrate effective sorption potential in periods of intense contamination it is possible to supplement natural limestone with for example lanthanum compounds once the contamination is captured it can be removed from the surface by liquefactionthe polymer coatings and the barrier can be reused zalewski et al 2019 the primary advantages of biological methods of environmental remediation are their high efficiency low costs and environmental friendliness the processes are divided into ex situ methods including bioreactors biofilters proper soil cultivation and composting in situ methods including bio deaeration bio evaporation bio stimulation fluid delivery systems and several composting methods tiwari et al 2017 ex situ methods consist of transporting a contaminated element of the ecosystem to the site where the treatment is planned while in situ bioremediation is used directly at the site of contamination the most effective in situ methods include phytoremediation based on the use of plant and algae to remove contaminants arya haq 2019 one particularly effective organism for removing xenobiotics including insecticides such as diazinon appears to be chlorella vulgaris which were able to eliminate as much as 94 of the xenobiotic used at a concentration of 20 mg l kurade et al 2016 duckweed can also be successfully used to rehabilitate sewage and polluted water reservoirs the advantages of these plants are their size ease of cultivation and rapid growth ziegler et al 2016 aquatic macrophytes such as the members of the lemnaceae family are recognized as one of the most effective organisms in the rehabilitation of wastewater and water areas lemna minor is successfully used to remove heavy metals e g chromium nickel cobalt lead pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps agrochemicals organic compounds dyes nanoparticles and other toxic substances sasmaz et al 2016 alexan 2020 ubuza et al 2020 invasive plants such as japanese knotweed reynoutria japonica are also used in phytoremediation indeed japanese knotweed can be transformed into a carbon absorbent and used inter alia in the absorption of paracetamol or diclofenac koutník 2020 cultivated cucumbers and courgettes are also effective in removing impurities from sediments their use resulted in a reduction in the concentration of polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxins pcdds polychlorinated dibenzofurans pcdfs and dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls dl pcbs in soil mixed with sewage sludge 64 for cucumber and 69 for courgette respectively and soil associated with river sediment 52 for cucumber and 51 for courgette respectively urbaniak et al 2019 willow communities may also play an important role in controlling the level of pollution in coastal zones it has been suggested that salicetum triandro viminalis occupying almost 30 ha of the coastal zone of the pilica river may be responsible for the assimilation of large amounts of pcbs a 49 loss of these compounds was observed in sediments collected from the lower sections of the river compared to the upper parts skłodowski et al 2014 in addition when used in combination with the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae sarcocornia fruticosa demonstrates high efficiency in reducing metals from a contaminated environment said et al 2019 10 summary progressive urbanization combined with a constantly growing population has resulted in the release of increasing amounts of chemicals into the aquatic environment understanding the threat of xenobiotics is an integral part of maintaining surface waters in good condition due to the detrimental effects of xenobiotics on living organisms their accumulation in the environment and their transfer between the levels of the trophic chain there is a pressing need to discuss strategies for the elimination of toxic compounds from the environment and to limit their use in industry it is hence not only vital to understand the chemical properties of the test substances but also to characterize their toxicity and assess their short and long term impact on organisms from different levels of the trophic chain effective treatment of stormwater from urban areas and sewage treatment plants these being the main sources of xenobiotic emissions plays a key role in minimizing such pollution of aquatic ecosystems such activities must be supported by legislation aimed at protecting aquatic ecosystems improving the existing ones and designing new techniques for remediation to this end ecohydrological biotechnologies and nature based solutions represent promising effective and low cost solutions offering the potential for non invasive and efficient removal of

964,a problem characteristic of the modern anthropogenic era is pollution of the environment with xenobiotics the continual development of industry and the use of insufficiently balanced waste management results in increasing amounts of pollutants entering surface waters particularly xenobiotic substances these substances such as dyes pharmaceuticals and personal care products endocrine active compounds pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have a negative impact on biodiversity their main routes of transfer to aquatic ecosystems include industrial and municipal wastewater discharges and waste from households industry and agriculture as such there is a great need to identify xenobiotics in the environment define transfer and transformation pathways assess the impact of these substances on individual levels of the trophic chain and characterize their potential toxicity in response to legal regulations such as directive 2000 60 ec of the european parliament and of the council and the act of 20 july 2017 on the water law aimed at organizing the management of these substances increasing attention is being paid to the improvement of existing low cost remediation methods and the development of new ones such new approaches include ecohydrological biotechnology and nature based solutions nbs intended for the removal of xenobiotics from surface water this is extremely important for surface water resources in europe where a significant number of 70 of surface water bodies were classified as worse than good ecological condition by the european environment agency in 2015 key words xenobiotics ecohydrology toxicology surface water contamination 1 introduction the rapid development of the industry and the growing demand for an ever expanding range of consumer products have led to global degradation of the environment it is estimated that as many pollutants entered the natural environment in the years 2000 2010 as during the preceding 70 years stepnowski et al 2010 about one million products are produced annually in the world of which 100 000 are chemical compounds of these 15 thousand are potential xenobiotic substances kucherenko et al 2021 the european environmental agency defines a xenobiotic as a toxic substance that does not occur naturally in the environment european environmental agency accessed on 06 08 2021 one important group of xenobiotics comprises those of anthropogenic origin i e with an artificial chemical structure their accumulation in both the environment and organisms makes them a great threat to the functioning of entire ecosystems greń 2012 dobrzański et al 2017 kumar et al 2017 xenobiotic pollution presents a particular threat to surface waters these being inland and marine waters which can be subdivided into transitional waters partially closed bays and estuaries and coastal waters constituting the waters of the open sea up to one mile from the shore zabłocka godlewska przystaś 2016 ciećko panek 2019 a number of studies have reported the presence of xenobiotic compounds in surface waters throughout the world kim et al 2009 kumar et al 2012 including those in europe feo et al 2010 sablayrolles et al 2011 masiá et al 2013 milić et al 2018 and poland pawełczyk 2013 kiedrzyńska et al 2014a and even in the arctic lehmann konera et al 2020 and antarctica hernández et al 2019 not only are xenobiotic compounds characterized by poor degradability some may undergo partial decomposition which can result in the production of substances with a higher toxic potential than the original compound xenobiotic compounds can also bioaccumulate in organisms resulting in their concentrations increasing significantly in the tissues of animals as they are translocated up the levels of the trophic chain a process called biomagnification dubey et al 2014 the exposure of aquatic organisms to xenobiotic substances creates not only presents a constant threat but also entails an urgent need to monitor the threats they pose and to identify modern methods of remediation of polluted ecosystems fernando et al 2019 mishra et al 2019 tonelli tonelli 2020 pinto et al 2021 to provide an overview of this complex and important issue this article reviews the present state of knowledge in the field of surface water contamination with xenobiotics it identifies the most common routes of transfer of these substances to aquatic ecosystems and attempts to determine their impact on organisms from different levels of the trophic pyramid and human health it also characterizes methods in the field of ecohydrological biotechnology and nature based solutions eh nbs for the remediation of surface water resources contaminated with xenobiotics 2 characteristics of xenobiotics the production of xenobiotic compounds is primarily related to human activities particularly industrial ones many compounds are employed in the chemical and petrochemical industry or are distributed through the environment in the form of pesticides fig 1 kozak włodarczyk makuła 2016 debroux et al 2012 in addition to having an adverse effect on the health of living organisms dobrzański et al 2017 xenobiotics are also particularly damaging to aquatic ecosystems these are particularly vulnerable due to the fact that many reservoirs are used as discharge sites not only for sewage and stormwater from urbanized areas but also contaminated water from agricultural and industrial areas these are often a source of toxic xenobiotics including petroleum hydrocarbons polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps pesticides dyes polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and phenolic compounds dordio carvalho 2013 a range of hydrocarbons are found in the environment and these can be derived from both anthropogenic and natural origins biogenic hydrocarbons are synthesized by bacteria algae algae or cyanobacteria while pyrogenic hydrocarbons are formed by the incomplete combustion of organic carbon compounds petroleum hydrocarbons or petrogenic hydrocarbons have a particularly negative impact on the environment fabisiak 2008 they represent the main source of energy for many industries and hence represent a major source of land contamination such complex fuels include a range of monoaromatic volatile compounds benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which are known to be highly toxic and have been found to cause mutagenesis and carcinogenesis cook hesterberg 2013 unfortunately large complex hydrocarbon molecules do not degrade easily and can persist as health hazards al hawash et al 2018 one group of petroleum hydrocarbons is the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs containing more than one aromatic ring in their structure they are predominantly formed by pyrolysis and pyrosynthesis and their most important sources include incomplete combustion and pyrolysis of coal oil wood and petroleum products dat chang 2017 concerns regarding the release of pahs into the aquatic environment are related to their high toxicitypahs have the ability to bioaccumulate in tissues and organs where they act as mutagens and carcinogens kubiak 2013 helcom 2021 this group includes primarily benzene derivatives including chlorinated and brominated derivatives petroleum hydrocarbons herbicides and dyes dordio carvalho 2013 the biodegradability of pahs is closely related to their structure compounds with a greater number of aromatic rings not only require more complex biodegredation but the process is also much slower indeed the presence of various functional groups in compounds is of great importance in decomposition processes zabłocka godlewska przystaś 2016 it is believed that the biodegradability of a molecule is influenced by the number of its functional groups due to the number of enzymatic attacks that must occur in order to split the groups wackett ellis 1999 furthermore as individual microorganisms are only able to metabolize a limited range of substrates a consortium of microorganisms is needed for complete mineralization of a complex compound ghazali et al 2004 apart from pahs one of the largest groups of xenobiotic environmental pollutants is that of pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene products ppcps these compounds find their way into ecosystems both as metabolites and in their unprocessed form bester et al 2008 regarding the latter painkillers antibiotics harnisz et al 2020 steroids and antidepressants often enter the environment unprocessed debroux et al 2012 easy access to pharmaceutical substances such as vitamins dietary supplements and over the counter drugs and their improper disposal result in these compounds being present in large amounts in wastewater wontorska wąsowski 2018 although pharmacologically active compounds are processed in sewage treatment plants with the wastewater the removal process is not efficient and they are often detected in treated wastewater chander et al 2016 and in surface waters dai et al 2015 the pharmaceuticals most frequently detected in the aquatic environment include non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids fibrates β blockers azoles antibiotics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris the presence of such active pharmaceuticals in water reservoirs negatively affects the species occurring in them due to stress induction and exerting adverse effects on reproduction and enzyme function burkina et al 2015 however effects of these substances will depend on their concentrations physicochemical properties efficiency of wastewater treatment plants and environmental conditions endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs of exogenous origin also demonstrate toxic effects via their ability to disrupt the functioning of the endocrine system in addition they demonstrate considerable durability and the ability to bioaccumulate in organisms debroux et al 2012 kim et al 2017 steroid based edcs e g 17 α ethinylestradiol are used in medications and oral contraception phenolic compounds e g bisphenol a nonylphenol also acting as hormonal modulators are widely used in the production of polycarbonate plastics epoxy resins agricultural and household industries and the production of antioxidants wang et al 2018 the main sources of edcs include sewage from households and industrial and agricultural sources again due to the often low efficiency of wastewater treatment the edcs are only partially eliminated and high levels can be observed in treated wastewater discharged into the aquatic environment mnif et al 2010 one significant group of edcs are pesticides kim et al 2017 pesticides are xenobiotics deliberately introduced into the environment to protect plants and animals by combating harmful and undesirable pests weeds and plant diseases these compounds may be of artificial or natural origin the toxic nature of pesticides is related to their bioaccumulation in cells and the possibility of affecting dna and hormone functioning rzeszutek et al 2014 pesticides can enter surface waters through the groundwater from here they can pose a threat to the fish birds and mammals inhabiting the area including humans maurya malik 2016 many coloring substances are also classified as edcs al sharabati et al 2021 many colorants have been developed to higher color stability or resistance to environmental factors as such the entry of dyes into surface waters along with untreated sewage poses a great threat to aquatic ecosystems zabłocka godlewska przystaś 2016 of these aromatic dyes are least susceptible to biodegradation as a result unprocessed or slightly degraded compounds often end up in the aquatic environment and these can limit access to light for many plants and autotrophic microorganisms this drastically reduces biological activity especially the processes based on photosynthesis resulting in a reduction in oxygen concentration rehman et al 2015 another group of compounds that negatively affect the hormonal balance are polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs they belong to the group of dioxins which are known to demonstrate toxic and carcinogenic properties moreover exposure to pcbs is known to weaken reproductive and immune processes and induce changes in the genotype of organisms they largely enter the aquatic environment from sewage treatment plants urbaniak kiedrzyńska 2015 due to the fact that they are sparingly soluble in water pcbs bind to mineral and organic particles thus facilitating their transport in river environments as well as their deposition and sedimentation urbaniak et al 2019 polychlorinated dibenzodioxins pcdds and polychlorinated dibenzofurans pcdfs also have similar effects on living organisms these compounds also tend to accumulate in food chains thus posing a direct threat to the health of both animals and humans urbaniak et al 2014a urbaniak et al 2014b with the tendency to bioaccumulate in living organisms their presence can result in damage to inter alia neurological and hormonal systems and can cause tumor formation kiedrzyńska et al 2017 the pharmaceutical petrochemical or dyeing industries also widely use phenolic compounds tian et al 2020 these are present in a range of products used in households and agriculture including emulsifiers detergents or moisturizers and dispersants ahmad et al 2020 many have endocrine disrupting properties with the best known example being bisphenol a bpa used in the production of plastic and epoxy resins wang et al 2015 ashrap et al 2017 in addition triclosan a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent widely used in personal care products is also known to demonstrate estrogenic activity in living organisms as does benzophenone 3 bp 3 which is used in cosmetics with a uv filter wang et al 2015 another group of phenolic compounds widely used as ingredients in detergents paints cleaners cosmetics and pesticides are nonylphenols nps due to the lipophilic properties of nps they can accumulate in adipose tissue and affect the functioning of food chains the main routes of exposure to nps are skin contact ingestion and inhalation with the organs most exposed to them being the eyes skin digestive system respiratory system liver brain thyroid pancreas kidneys bladder and reproductive organs noorimotlagh et al 2017 3 transfer of xenobiotics into the environment in the 1960s the main sources of xenobiotics in the surface and groundwater of western europe were the chemical coal and steel industries however both the number and types of xenobiotic sources have considerably frown due to the continual development of industry in response strict regulations have been placed on industrial emissions of toxic substances as a result most environmental contamination is caused by the deposition of everyday products with hygiene products paints heavy metals and pahs being most frequently detected in wastewater as well as chemicals derived from building materials textiles or plastics bester et al 2008 xenobiotics can be transferred to the environment both indirectly fig 2 via the entry of a xenobiotic modified as a result of a biological process srivastava et al 2016 and directly based on the direct emission of xenobiotic compounds the latter route is associated with improper sewage treatment incorrect waste management policy heavy shipping traffic and port activity as well as accidental pollution spills precipitation and atmospheric deposition arya haq 2019 de oliveira et al 2020 the dynamic development of the pharmaceutical industry since the 1860s has resulted in the increased production and consumption of pharmaceuticals including hormonal drugs antidepressants and substances used in the treatment of cancer as a result steroid hormones can be found not only in the wastewater flowing into the treatment plant but also in the water discharged from the treatment plant into the environment žižlavská hlavínek 2020 de oliveira et al 2020 define three key groups of chemical pharmaceutical residue generators large generators such as pharmaceutical companies small generators such as hospitals research centers and educational institutions and microgenerators such as houses and farms studies of potential pharmaceutical transport processes from surface waters contaminated with wastewater have shown that pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole infiltrate shallow groundwater layers and occur in concentrations of over 20 ng l up to 6 m away from the source of pollution resulting in contamination of the environment itself bradley et al 2014 numerous studies have also indicated the presence of xenobiotics such as pharmaceuticals in drinking water most drugs are only present in water in the form of micropollutants such pharmaceuticals can also undergo numerous changes in response to environmental conditions leading to the formation of conjugates or cometabolites žižlavská hlavínek 2020 4 transformation of xenobiotics in the environment xenobiotics not only undergo numerous transformations in the environment fig 3 but also accumulate in the tissues of aquatic invertebrates in the midwater and are passed on to the higher levels of the trophic chain i e fish amphibians reptiles and mammals embrandiri et al 2016 maurya malik 2016 one of the processes influencing the fate of xenobiotics in the environment is adsorption the occurrence of which affects their transport and bioavailability chemicals with strong sorption properties are usually less mobile and have a lower leaching potential nevertheless such compounds are more likely to penetrate into groundwater sui et al 2015 in the environment xenobiotics e g pesticides undergo chemical hydrolysis oxidation reduction reactions physical and biological changes cometabolism and mineralization many compounds are also photodegradable resulting in a shorter half life in sunlight in the case of direct photodegradation compounds that absorb light in the visible spectrum are broken down or rearranged to form a new stable product by the absorption of photons however during indirect photodegradation a photosensitive molecule absorbs light and produces a number of reactive forms that can degrade the target xenobiotic compound remucal 2014 typically compounds undergo only partial degradation resulting in the formation of other less complex and usually less toxic substances arora 2020 as individual microorganisms are only able to metabolize a limited amount of substrates the biodegradation of complex compounds such as hydrocarbons requires the cooperation of several species a process known as cometabolism in such activities the final mineralization products are obtained by mixed population groups with increased enzymatic capacity nevertheless during the cometabolism of complex substances such as crude oil individual strains present in a given consortium play an individual role in the processes of transformation and degradation ghazali 2004 while the products of cometabolism are metabolites with greater solubility and lower toxicity than the parent compounds mineralization processes typically generate carbon dioxide and water however depending on the nature of the processes taking place and the structure of the molecule the products can also be ammonia methane and various types of inorganic components maurya malik 2016 kumar 2017 arora 2020 in aquatic organisms such as fish the biotransformation of harmful substances is a two step process timbrell marrs 2009 during phase i catalyzed by inter alia cytochrome p450 enzymes oxygenases hydrolytic enzymes oxidation reduction and hydrolysis reactions take place at this stage a polar functional group oh nh2 sh cooh is introduced to the substance when phase i metabolites are soluble in water they are excreted during detoxification in phase ii biochemical conjugation takes place during this process liver enzymes attach molecules such as glycine or sulfates to the toxicant methylation and acetylation also take place with the aim of weakening the biological activity of the xenobiotic phase ii products are compounds that are easily soluble in water and are devoid of toxic effects burkina et al 2015 nevertheless some xenobiotics are resistant to biodegradation processes and moreover the complex interactions between these substances lead to the formation of products that are often more toxic than the substrate hlavínek žižlavská 2015 5 analysis of xenobiotic toxicity in aquatic organisms due to the fact that xenobiotics are easily transported over long distances can be deposited in the natural environment where they can undergo numerous transformations reactions and interactions it is usually extremely difficult to assess the ecotoxic effects of these substances dordio carvalho 2013 the effects of a substance on a living organisms are typically evaluated by toxicological methods and an integration of both positive and negative effects of a substance on the growth and development of the organism the biological methods used in toxicology to assess environmental pollution are divided into bioanalytics which consists of biosensors biotests and biomonitoring based on the analysis of passive samples of living matter and the observation of bioindicators traczewska 2008 in aquatic ecosystems the harmful effects of chemicals are determined by water toxicology whose purpose is to assess the impact of pollutants on aquatic organisms traczewska 2011 toxic substances can have direct or indirect effects on the biocenosis of aquatic ecosystems direct toxicity occurring when the concentration of a toxicant exceeds the mean harmful concentration value as determined by a range of toxicological tests indirect action resulting from changes in environmental parameters under the influence of the introduced pollution thus causing harmful effects to the biocenosis traczewska 2011 assessment of the harmfulness of chemical substances occurring among others in surface water sewage leachate or drinking water it is performed using acute toxicity tests typically changes in the number and condition of bioindicator organisms are observed within 96 hours after a single dose of the test substance in addition chronic toxicity tests can not only be used to assess the adverse effects of a toxicant on individuals but also on entire populations during long term toxicity tests organisms are exposed to at least five concentrations of test substance throughout an entire life cycle the main toxicity parameter is the dose which is the amount of the substance administered taken or absorbed by the body causing specific effects table 1 kozak włodarczyk makuła 2016 biological methods used in the analysis of water quality not only demonstrate higher sensitivity and precision than chemical methods but also do not require specialized equipment and are cheaper in addition by avoiding the use of chemicals other than the tested toxicant they are safe for the environment moreover they allow the effects of xenobiotics entering an ecosystem to be predicted goncharuk 2014 however the large number and variety of toxic substances make the analysis of harmful compounds not only time consuming and costly but also problematic in terms of toxicity assessment kaza et al 2007 the ecotoxicological risk of a composite environmental sample depends not only on its chemical composition but also varies depending on the individual sensitivity of organisms to its individual components richter et al 2015 however it is possible to make comprehensive assessments of the risk posed by all chemicals occurring in a medium such as treated wastewater and to determine their additive antagonistic and synergistic action by using a battery of biotests based on representatives of various trophic levels szklarek et al 2021 5 1 tests using producers as algae are sensitive to low concentrations of toxic substances they are widely used in toxicology tests such tests are typically based on the use of multi generational cultivation of organisms with diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria being most commonly used in standardized biotests kosakowska król 2009 one of the bioindicators used to assess water quality are algae of the genus chlorella many studies have found that synchronous cultures of chlorella vulgaris provide accurate determinations of the effects of test substances on cells in their individual stages of life resulting in a more precise assessment of impact of a contaminant on the test organisms czaplicka kotas lodowska 2014 other biotests have used pseudokirchneriella subcapitata tetraselmis suecica selenastrum capricornutum or desmodesmus subspicatus diatoms such as ditylum brightwellii or skeletonema costatum and dinoflagellate such as prorocentrum minimum or cochlodinium polykrikoides jung et al 2020 ebenezer ki 2016 kuczyńska et al 2003 ebenezer ki 2012 biotests based on algae indicate can yield data on toxicants based on changes in culture density growth rate the degree of growth inhibition chlorophyll a and b content and cell size in addition it the ctivity of enzymatic markers such as superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat can also provide useful information calderón delgado et al 2019 aquatic vegetation such as duckweed is also used in bioassays methods recommended by the international organization for standardization iso and the organization for economic co operation and development oecd using the genus lemna are useful for identifying toxicants found in both wastewater and surface waters despite their simplicity of breeding small size rapid reproduction rate high surface to volume ratio and genetically uniform colonies only lemna minor and lemna gibba are used in toxicology studies ziegler et al 2016 l minor was used among others in studies assessing the pollution of the italian river sarno with heavy metals the organisms placed in bags immersed in the river for seven days and the effects of contamination were assessed based on morphological changes the results showed that compared to single element controls exposure of cells to a mixture of heavy metals resulted in their complete destruction basile et al 2015 5 2 tests using consumers ecotoxicological assessments of waters are often based on the use of shellfish with the most popular representative being the water flea daphnia magna its high sensitivity to xenobiotics in water derives from the fact that it filters very large amounts of water in some european countries and in the usa biotests using daphnia as indicator organisms are a mandatory method for water quality control zagrebin et al 2016 daphnia magna crustaceans have been used in the assessment of acute toxicity of 4 nonylphenol np bisphenol a bpa and heavy metals cd hg and pb after 48 hours of exposure to the tested compounds the daphnia demonstrated reduced mobility and lowered mrna expression of antioxidant enzymes kim et al 2017 other tests measure water pollution based on the chlorophyll fluorescence of algae consumed by the water flea the concentration of algae in the samples is correlated with the rate of food intake by the test organisms matorin et al 2009 daphnia spp have also been used in estimating the level of soil contamination in the italian sarno river with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides arienzo et al 2015 in addition daphnia have been used to determine the toxicity of hormonal compounds such as estriol progesterone and estradiol in a river in sao paulo torres et al 2015 szklarek et al 2021 also describe the use of the crustacean thamnocephalus platyurus as an element of the biotest battery for the ecotoxicological evaluation of treated sewage and river waters of the pilica catchment located in poland in this case mortality was used to determine the response to water samples among the consumers fish can also be used to assess water quality fish can be divided into freshwater and salt water species they owe their popularity in such analyses to their strong behavioral and physiological reactions when exposed to small amounts of pollutants the most commonly used organisms in bioassays are zebrafish brachydanio rerio minnows pimephales promelas catfish ictaluros punctatus carp cyprinus carpio rice fish oryzias latipes rainbow trout oncorhyncus mykissatus and guppy fish lebistes reticulatus traczewska 2011 fish are used among others for research on substances that are components of everyday products such as triclocarban salierno et al 2016 the parameters assessed in bioassays are mortality the effect on the development of young animals the influence of the toxicant on the stimulation of the immune system fish muscle activity survivability larval and embryo larval growth salierno et al 2016 traczewska 2011 khabbazi et al 2015 further information on toxicology can be obtained based on differences in the levels of rna proteins and metabolites some of the danio rerio tests are based on embryos which are used interchangeably for adult toxicity studies huang et al 2016 there is now an increased emphasis on performing acute cytotoxicity tests using fish cell lines this significantly reduces the number of animals used in toxicology studies kolarova et al 2021 fish have been used to test the toxicity of various xenobiotics including acetaminophen apap diphenhydramine dh carbamazepine cbz fluoxetine flx bisphenol a bpa triiodothyronine t3 perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos refined merichem rm triclosan tcs pendimethalin pendimethalin pnd huang et al 2016 huang et al 2017 ahmad ahmad 2015 danio rerio embryos have been used to evaluate the toxicity of tcs in which significant changes in the levels of urea citric acid d galactose d glucose stearic acid l proline phenylalanine and l glutamic acid were observed fu et al 2019 fish based tests cichia spp have also been used to evaluate the toxicity of heavy metals in the java and formoso rivers with the analyzed parameters being the level of genotoxic and biochemical biomarkers such as serum glucose concentration aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase the study also examined histopathological changes of the liver nuclear hypertrophy and vacuolization were observed after exposure to xenobiotics de lima et al 2018 5 3 tests using decomposers biological tests can also be used to assess the influence of xenobiotics on organisms from the trophic level of decomposers with bacteria often used as decomposers their use in analyses is primarily related to the possibility of estimating the mutagenic properties of xenobiotic substances bacterial tests are divided into tests detecting progressive mutations tests detecting reverse mutations and tests intended to detect the repair of dna damage in toxicology the most commonly used bacteria are salmonella spp and escherichia spp and luminescent bacteria traczewska 2011 among the luminescent microorganisms aliivibrio fischeri and vibrio harveyi are most often used pogorzelec piekarska 2013 their use in the assessment of water soil and bottom sediment pollution is primarily related to their ability to emit light by the oxidization of luciferase ahtiainen 2002 one such tests is microtox containing the freeze dried form of a fischeri in which the intensity of emitted light is used to determine the metabolic changes taking place in microorganisms jakubus tatuśko 2015 it has been used e g in the study of the toxicity of wastewater zadorozhnaya et al 2015 in contrast the mutatox test uses mutants of luminescent bacteria that do not have the ability to emit light during the interaction of cells with genotoxic substances the bacteria undergo mutation aversion resulting in luminescence abbas et al 2018 the use of v harveyi as a bioindicator of mutagenic pollutants is associated with their common occurrence in marine waters tolerance to a wide spectrum of salinity and high sensitivity to toxic compounds these bacteria are used e g in a test based on the detection of neomycin resistant mutants colonies that appear after contact with mutagens the development of this test greatly facilitated the detection of mutagenic compounds in salt waters podgórska węgrzyn 2006 riuz et al 2013 among the genus salmonella salmonella typhimurium is the species most frequently used in the genotoxicity assessment of chemical compounds such as xenobiotics nałęcz jawecki et al 2012 they can be used to analyze the toxicity of xenobiotics e g imidacloprid and sulfentrazone and environmental tests for the presence of these compounds e g bottom sediments bianchi et al 2015 liu et al 2015 two tests that use salmonella spp are the umu test and the ames test the umu test acts by the analysis of dna damage inducing sos repair based on s typhimurium ta1535 strains bonisławska et al 2008 nałęcz jawecki et al 2012 zutterling et al 2018 the bioindicators contain a plasmid that includes a combination of a gene belonging to the sos system and a structural gene of β galactosidase lacz nałęcz jawecki et al 2012 the genotoxicity of the tested compound provokes an increase in β galactosidase activity due to the expression of genes involved in sos repair bonisławska et al 2008 the ames test analyses reverse mutations in nutritional mutants of s typhimurium with the allowing the recovery of the ability to synthesize amino acids traczewska 2011 briefly strains of salmonella bacteria have mutations that prevent them from synthesizing histidine thus inhibiting their growth on his selective medium exposure to a genotoxic test substance leads to a change of a single nucleotide base that converts the mutated gene sequence into a sequence that allows the bacteria to grow on the medium zeiger 2019 in addition escherichia coli can also be used in the ames test but the mutants are devoid of the ability to synthesize tryptophan zeiger 2019 e coli bacteria are also used as indicator organisms in another analysis based on the sos repair system briefly the sos chromotest bioassay determines the activity of β galactosidase in the bacteria after incubation with a xenobiotic the result reflects the response to the level of induction of the lacz gene and those involved in sos repair bonisławska et al 2008 6 the xenobiotic contamination of aquatic ecosystems in europe and in the world surface and groundwater contamination resulting from the improper use and storage or accidental release of chemicals to the environment can be divided into area linear or point sources with regard to their source of origin area contamination is derived from large territories such as forests industrial or urban areas linear contamination from waterways or transport and point contamination from inter alia treated sewage outlets from sewage treatment plants kiedrzyńska et al 2014a leaks from tanks or sewage disposal installations dordio carvalho 2013 cybulski et al 2019 agricultural sources of pollution are primarily related to the losses of fertilizer components mainly nitrogen used on agricultural land and their surface runoff from rural areas erosion and deposition with precipitation kiedrzyńska et al 2014b other significant sources of agricultural point pollution in water include animal production and incorrect disposal of animal excrement which can often contain pharmaceutical substances intended for veterinary use as well as inadequately used septic tanks pajewski 2016 the treated sewage entering an ecosystem often contains cosmetics sun creams fragrances prescription and over the counter drugs drug metabolites and their transformation products fatta kassinos et al 2011 in addition high levels of polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxins pcdds polychlorinated dibenzofurans pcdfs and dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls dl pcb can also be detected in rivers studies of the pilica river poland have shown that up to 59 09 μq toxic equivalents of pcdd pcdf and dl pcb can enter the river from wastewater treatment plants per day depending on the water flow urbaniak et al 2014a urbaniak et al 2014b urbaniak et al 2015 moreover ecotoxicological analysis of pilica river water found it to inhibit the growth of pseudokirchinella subcapitata algae in 100 of the studied population szklarek et al 2021 in addition pcb and pesticide contamination have also been noted in wrocław intakes with levels of 451 96 ng l and 73 53 ng l pawełczyk 2013 it has been estimated that treated wastewater accounts for around 10 of river flows in europe however this level can rise to 30 to even 100 of the volume of receiving water in cities such as berlin bester et al 2008 tests of water discharged into the hron river in slovakia showed that although it met the quality criteria for purified water based on physicochemical indicators toxicological tests indicate the presence of xenobiotics hybská et al 2020 moreover xenobiotic testing of purified water showed the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in samples from france up to 0 39 µg l and greece up to 0 39 µg l polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in samples from finland up to 0 12 µg l and canada up

basin in valencia these included among others ibuprofen naproxen propylparaben salicylic acid and tetrahydrocannabinol thc carmona et al 2014 in addition to xenobiotics heavy metals also pose a threat to the environment significant amounts of which have been detected in the waters of the baltic sea it is estimated that in 2014 alone the sea received 15 tons of cadmium 1 2 tons of mercury and 264 tons of lead along with river water of which the largest source was russia helcom 2018a the threat to the baltic sea is largely related to the size of its catchment area which amounts to 1 729 500 km2 four times the surface area of the sea itself the baltic catchment area is inhabited by over 84 million people with a number of urban areas characterized by intensive industrial activity and large populations which act as significant point sources of pollution helcom 2019 in addition the baltic is subject to frequent crude oil spills either accidentally from ships or as illegal discharges into the sea about 540 such leaks were detected between 2010 and 2013 helcom 2013 helcom 2014 the baltic marine environment protection commission helcom has established a list of hazardous substances used as indicators of pollution of the baltic water environment these include among others hexabromocyclo dodecane hbcdd polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs dioxins furans polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and their metabolites heavy metals tributyltin tbt or diclofenac helcom 2018b the presence of xenobiotics in catchments of two luxembourg rivers were attributed to faulty sanitary connections and ineffective recycling of wastewater from wastewater treatment plants krein et al 2013 other studies have found changes in the accumulation of xenobiotics in ecosystems to be determined by weather conditions of these flood periods are of particular importance during floods large loads of xenobiotics can be flushed from urbanized and agricultural areas as well as loads from sewage treatment plants mainly small ones these are released together with active sludge when the treatment plant is overfilled with stormwater krein et al 2012 kiedrzyńska et al 2014a urbaniak et al 2014b urbaniak et al 2015 urbaniak et al 2017 kiedrzyńska et al 2017 contamination with xenobiotics can also be observed on other continents the presence of pharmaceuticals has been recorded in water from rivers wells and lakes in hyderabad india as well as in some drinking water sources in the us chander et al 2016 another study conducted in california us showed the presence of trihalomethanes thm in drinking water the maximum concentration of which in 2014 2015 was 229 mg l oehha 2018 trimethoprim norfloxacin ofloxacin and spectinomycin have been detected in water sediment and aquatic organisms collected from the pearl river delta in china additionally ibuprofen approximately 562 ng g mass and ketoprofen up to 267 ng g mass were detected in the organisms used for ecotoxic analysis ostrea gigas mimachlamys nobilis mytilus edulis bufonaria perelegans epinephelus awoara ephippus orbis culter alburnus xie et al 2019 7 the influence of xenobiotics on humans and other vertebrates despite the implementation of measures and regulations to reduce environmental pollution by xenobiotic compounds they continue to accumulate in aquatic food webs with serious effects on ecosystems jepson et al 2016 edcs enter fish through the gills the digestive tract and the skin and thus accumulate at the top of the aquatic food chain jia et al 2017 posing a threat to human health the presence of edcs has been confirmed in wild freshwater fish caught in the xiangjiang river in china among the accumulated compounds were bisphenol a bpa in muscles and gonads and 4 n nonylphenol in the liver it was estimated that the amount of edcs contained in the studied species parabramis pekinensis cyprinus carpio and siniperca chuatsi exceeded their acceptable daily consumption zhou et al 2019 contamination with xenobiotics has also been detected in four commonly consumed smoked fish sold in markets in southern nigeria among the tested organisms scomber scombrus was characterized by the highest pah content in addition high concentrations of benzo α pyrene were observed in clarias gariepinus and ethmalosa fimbriata resulting in the recommended daily intake 0 05 mg kg being exceeded tongo et al 2017 in addition high levels of nonylphenol linear alkylbenzene sulfonate and diethylhexyl phthalate were observed in aquatic organisms in the bohai area in china these being the most harmful of the tested substances alkylbenzene sulfonate nonylphenol diethylhexyl phthalate norfloxacin sulfamethoxazole erythromycin bisphenol a ofloxacin carbamazepine naproxen atenolol and metoprolol among the analyzed groups of organisms nonylphenol and bisphenol a pose the greatest threat to fish while antibiotics are the most harmful to algae zhang et al 2017 by imitating or antagonizing endogenous hormones edcs disturb the functioning of organisms czarny et al 2017 in addition to having a negative effect on the metabolism transport and synthesis of hormones they also disrupt the synthesis of their receptors kahn et al 2020 thus exposure is associated with negative effects in many organs and tissues tab 2 wee aris 2017 it is believed that maternal exposure to endocrine active compounds not only adversely affects the activity of placental enzymes but also the adaptation of the fetus to ectopic functioning obesity and the risk of cardiovascular disease myllynen et al 2007 kahn et al 2020 one phenolic compound and endocrine active substance bisphenol a can accumulate in adipose tissue during fetal development thanks to its lipophilic properties in addition it can negatively affect the development of its organs and other tissues this compound is particularly dangerous due to its common presence in packaging and in drinking water wee aris 2017 exposure to bisphenol a and other xenobiotics including dioxins pcbs and phthalates has also been correlated with a risk of developing diabetes yilmaz et al 2020 women exposed to dibenzofurans and pcbs in 1979 by consumption of contaminated oil in taiwan were found to demonstrate an increased risk of diabetes wang et al 2008 the biomagnification of pcbs through trophic levels generates the risk of cancer atherosclerosis and damage to the nervous system petriello et al 2014 the human body is also negatively affected by pesticides high concentrations of which have been found in the dirty dozen of fruit and vegetables peaches apples peppers celery nectarines strawberries cherries kale lettuce grapes carrots and pears these compounds have an unfavorable effect on humans especially in the period of fetal maturation and adolescence asghar et al 2016 some edc pesticides such as azole fungicides and atrazine prolong the gestation period and adversely affect the level of steroid hormones in fetuses and mothers bossi et al 2013 a correlation has also been demonstrated between fungicides detected in umbilical cord blood and a reduction in the birth weight of the newborn wickerham et al 2012 in addition it has been proven that the widespread use of organophosphorus and organochlorine compounds inhibits the activity of acetylcholinesterase in the synapses of the somatic autonomic and central systems thus disrupting the functioning of the nervous system this can increase the risk of developing alzheimer s disease and may increase the onset of dementia hayden et al 2010 in addition studies show that pesticides such as rotenone and paraquat may hasten the onset of parkinson s disease by disrupting the action of dopaminergic neurons qi et al 2014 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs can also enter the human body with food these compounds are considered carcinogens and teratogens for animals as demonstrated in studies on mussels amphibians and echinoderms balcıoğlu 2016 in addition organisms are also exposed to pahs through the respiratory tract prenatal exposure to pahs was found to adversely affect cognitive development and learning ability in children in new york moreover pah exposure is known to result in anxiety depression and attention problems in humans perera et al 2012 particularly mechanics miners refinery and metalworkers and drivers this may also be used to the presence of pahs in exhaust fumes abdel shafy mansour 2016 8 legal regulations on xenobiotics in response to the high levels of xenobiotic pollution observed in the environment a number of legal regulations have been introduced concerning the methods of maintaining water ecosystems in a good condition the core document of the european strategy for the protection of surface waters is the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec as adopted by the european union directive 2000 60 ec in addition in 2007 the european commission established environmental quality standards eqs in terms of pollution with priority substances the list of which was attached to the wfd as there is an urgent need to monitor substances classified as persistent bioaccumulative toxic substances pbts among others polychlorinated biphenyls polybrominated diphenyl ethers organochlorine pesticides such as ddt standards have also been approved to establish a list of priority hazardous substances control of pbts is carried out by unep un program for the environment which was established in 2001 by the stockholm convention hlavínek žižlavská 2015 bonito et al 2016 according to the water directive 2000 60 ec good condition of surface waters is defined as a condition in which the concentrations of pollutants do not exceed the environmental quality standards each member state is required to perform the following analyses of the characteristics of river basin districts economic analyses of river basin water usage analyses of the impact of human activity on the condition of both surface and groundwater directive 2000 60 ec substances and pollutants specific to river basins are assessed under the chemical status classification and each has an environmental quality standard specifying the limit value for good status in the case of the ecological status assessment the physicochemical elements are classified into three quality classes class i is very good class ii is good and class iii is all conditions below class ii in the case of biological elements in addition to class i and ii there are also class iii moderate condition iv poor condition and class v bad condition ciećko panek 2019 due to the urgent need to control the environment the obligations of the member states regarding the wfd also include the creation of water status monitoring programs in the case of surface waters these activities include the observation of the water table level or the flow rate in terms of ecological and chemical status while for groundwater this is based around the monitoring of the quantitative and chemical status of water directive 2000 60 ec the emission limit values and environmental quality standards are presented in the following directives mercury discharges directive 82 176 eec cadmium discharges directive 83 513 eec mercury discharges directive 84 156 eec hexachlorocyclohexane discharge directive 84 491 eec directive on discharges of dangerous substances 86 280 eec directive 2000 60 ec the main groups of pollutants affected by legal regulations are priority substances understood as substances constituting chemical pollutants of surface waters and constituting a threat that can cause broadly understood toxicity to aquatic organisms substances particularly harmful to the aquatic environment which are toxic persistent bioaccumulable compounds as well as substances with alarming levels pollutants i e compounds that may cause pollution journal of laws 2017 the key aquatic pollutants requiring emission limit values include organochlorine organophosphorus organotin compounds persistent and bioaccumulative hydrocarbons toxic organic compounds cyanides metals arsenic plant protection products and biocides eutrophication inducing substances such as nitrates and phosphates substances affecting the oxygen balance and substances with proven carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic properties council directive 96 61 ec in the case of poland a list of substances particularly harmful to the environment along with their maximum permissible values table 3 are included in the regulation on maritime economy and inland navigation regulation of the minister of maritime economy and inland navigation of 12 july 2019 an important element of the control of environmental xenobiotics pollution is the analysis of the biodegradability of toxicants according to regulation ec 648 2004 of the european parliament and of the council only substances meeting the conditions for complete aerobic biodegradation may be placed on the market if a compound after analysis in accordance with iso or oecd standards is not sufficiently biodegradable appropriate proceedings are initiated regulation ec no 648 2004 moreover the risk assessment takes into account the potential effects on aquatic ecosystems bottom land and air sediments and the effects of compound accumulation in the food chain regulation ec no 1907 2006 according to the commission regulation ec no 440 2008 of 30 may 2008 these potentially harmful substances must be subjected to a battery of tests determining their toxicity and health effects such as acute and chronic toxicity testing mutagenicity skin sensitization carcinogenicity subchronic toxicity and phototoxicity and neurotoxicity council regulation ec no 440 2008 9 ecohydrological biotechnologies and nature based solutions for the remediation of xenobiotic pollution the effectiveness of removing individual xenobiotics from the environment depends not only on the concentration of the toxicant present in water but also on the correct selection of the technique for its removal which is chosen based on the properties of individual compounds chang et al 2009 pollutant oxidation methods based on the induction of radicals with high chemical activity and high oxidizing potential seem to offer promise in wastewater treatment the reactive radicals in the mixture degrade the pahs or dyes by attacking their chemical bonds one such reactions is the photo fenton reaction which is a photochemical reaction involving electromagnetic radiation ferrous salt and hydrogen peroxide the reaction increases the susceptibility of compounds to biodegradation and promotes mineralization with hydroxyl radicals being produced de luna et al 2014 krzywicka kwarciak kozłowska 2015 in addition it is possible to determine the photochemical kinetic changes taking place in surface waters using the apex aqueous photochemistry of environmentally occurring xenobiotics program in this case the reaction kinetics are predicted on the basis of the photoreactivity parameters the chemical composition of water nitrates nitrites bicarbonates carbonates bromides and dissolved carbon and the optical path length of the sun s rays in water bodrato vione 2014 other methods based on adsorption oxidation reverse osmosis flotation and coagulation processes are also used to eliminate xenobiotics from the aquatic environment unfortunately despite offering many advantages such physicochemical processes are energy consuming and expensive and conventional separation techniques e g coagulation precipitation or flocculation are not effective in removing low molecular weight xenobiotics from the environment despite this advanced processes such as membrane filtration and ion exchange are more effective being estimated to demonstrate around 95 effectiveness depending on the compounds tested tiwari et al 2017 chang et al 2009 another technique is electrocoagulation ec which is based on the same principles as coagulation and flocculation during the ec procedure coagulants are used to form aggregates and thus effectively eliminate of xenobiotic compounds from polluted water hakizimana et al 2017 ahmad et al 2020 one of the most effective physicochemical methods is adsorption which is used to separate the liquid and solid phases tiwari et al 2017 porous carbon obtained by the pyrolysis of organometallic skeletons demonstrates a high ability to adsorb xenobiotic compounds particularly pharmaceuticals and personal care products and has been used to effectively remove ibuprofen and diclofenac an et al 2018 it is estimated that diffuse sources of pollution may constitute up to 50 of the biogenic loads reaching reservoirs and coastal zones from rivers and uncontrolled wastewater discharges zalewski 2015 the use of advanced and cost intensive hydroengineering projects can only slightly improve water quality therefore high hopes are placed on ecohydrological and nature based solutions nbs which act by the regulation of interaction processes between biocenoses and water zalewski et al 2020 nbss are a class of biotechnology tools based on ecohydrology principles intended to increase the potential for sustainable development they use processes naturally occurring in ecosystems and their properties zalewski 2021 nbs are used for the protection or restoration of natural ecosystems and the enhancement or creation of natural processes in artificial or modified ecosystems these solutions can be used both in the micro scale e g in the areas of individual households and in the macro scale e g in the scale of the entire landscape in addition to supporting the circular economy and promoting recycling and reducing waste generation nbs also support green economy concepts based on the sustainable use of natural resources wwap 2018 nature based solutions are divided into methods aimed at minimizing the effects of intensive agricultural activity creation of buffer zones to control diffuse pollution designing denitrification walls to protect groundwater control of water shortages in agriculture reducing the impact of flood control drainage and irrigation infrastructure fcdi water purification using specially designed wetlands sohel et al 2015 improving water retention e g construction of retention reservoirs zalewski et al 2019 solutions favoring the protection of aquatic ecosystems using natural geochemical processes occurring in the catchment area between land and water are called ecohydrological biotechnologies izydorczyk et al 2015 example technologies include sedimentation and biofiltration systems zalewski et al 2020 and ecotones zalewski 2013 water and coastal plants which not only modify the flow but also the circulation of components have a significant impact on the quality of the water deposited in the water phase zalewski 2015 in one study the zones of biogenic emissions i e those responsible for eutrophication to the pilica catchment area and the sulejowski reservoir poland were analyzed using the swat model soil water assessment tool based on the results a list of targeted mitigation measures was generated with the aim of ensuring complementarity between good agricultural practices and the implementation of nbs solutions finally it was recommended to implement buffer zones izydorczyk et al 2019 these were supplemented with denitrification beds or biogenic barriers to increase the efficiency of nutrient elimination by plants growing in the zones zalewski et al 2020 buffer zones act as ecotone transition zones between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems the main purpose of which is the filtration of pollutants between the systems they are distinguished by a wide range of biophysical conditions ecological processes and biological diversity izydorczyk et al 2015 the buffer zones are characterized by a number of processes such as the assimilation of inorganic compounds by plants and their conversion into biomass the activity of various biogeochemical processes including denitrification and mineralization induced by microorganisms and the sorption and sedimentation of soil particles limiting its erosion izydorczyk et al 2013a the use of highly efficient ecotone zones as a form of ecohydrological biotechnology was developed during the ecotones for the reduction of diffuse pollution ekorob project frątczak et al 2013 their design exploits the biogeochemical processes taking place in the naturally formed plant systems that create buffer zones in this case the activity of natural processes were intensified with structures such as biogeochemical barriers based on limestone izydorczyk et al 2013b in addition to the creation of ecotone zones that intensify the processes of self cleaning of water reservoirs increasing numbers of retention reservoirs are being constructed these reservoirs created in natural depressions of the land not only stabilize the water flow and flatten flood waves but also capture biogenic compounds support self purification processes and provide habitats for aquatic and terrestrial organisms zalewski et al 2019 this type of reservoir designed by the european regional center for ecohydrology of the polish academy of sciences has recently been used in the city of łask in the case of the grabia river catchment kiedrzyńska et al 2021 the aim of the project was to adapt the reservoir to the natural landscape by doing so it was intended to preserve the natural course of the river bed increase water retention in the river valley and ensure a high level of biodiversity this was supported with an automatic system that would analyze the quality of river water and regulate the inflow of biogenic compounds and pollutants to the reservoir thus eliminating the risk of algae bloom kiedrzyńska et al 2021 in addition the creation of wetlands and restoration of coastal zones improves water quality and enables the control of river flow thus increasing water infiltration and protecting it from the inflow of anthropogenic pollutants in sewage in addition to supporting water purification wetlands serve as excellent ecosystems for organisms and with the increase in their surface area and the presence of aquatic macrophytes the number and diversity of flora and fauna increases hsu et al 2011 one example solution based on the construction of artificial wetlands was used in naivasha lake kenya in this case the wetlands were used to accumulate untreated wastewater released from horticultural businesses before entering the lake wanjala et al 2018 another promising biofiltration technique for wastewater treatment from biogenic and xenobiotic substances is the use of a hybrid sequential biofiltration system hsbs kiedrzyńska et al 2017 hsbss have been tested for their ability to remove primary polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs from wastewater a hybrid hsbs consisting of a geochemical barrier filtration beds with limestone coal and sawdust demonstrated a 21 reduction of pcb equivalency pcb eq in contrast a biological barrier wetlands with macrophytes i e glyceria acorus typha phragmites demonstrated a 43 reduction for wastewater discharged from a treatment plant kiedrzyńska et al 2017 the anticipated further development of ecohydrological biotechnologies is based inter alia on the optimization and improvement of individual elements of existing ecosystems one new method involves the use of ceramic aggregate coated with a biopolymer bioker such barriers are light allowing them to be replaced after saturation but still demonstrate effective sorption potential in periods of intense contamination it is possible to supplement natural limestone with for example lanthanum compounds once the contamination is captured it can be removed from the surface by liquefactionthe polymer coatings and the barrier can be reused zalewski et al 2019 the primary advantages of biological methods of environmental remediation are their high efficiency low costs and environmental friendliness the processes are divided into ex situ methods including bioreactors biofilters proper soil cultivation and composting in situ methods including bio deaeration bio evaporation bio stimulation fluid delivery systems and several composting methods tiwari et al 2017 ex situ methods consist of transporting a contaminated element of the ecosystem to the site where the treatment is planned while in situ bioremediation is used directly at the site of contamination the most effective in situ methods include phytoremediation based on the use of plant and algae to remove contaminants arya haq 2019 one particularly effective organism for removing xenobiotics including insecticides such as diazinon appears to be chlorella vulgaris which were able to eliminate as much as 94 of the xenobiotic used at a concentration of 20 mg l kurade et al 2016 duckweed can also be successfully used to rehabilitate sewage and polluted water reservoirs the advantages of these plants are their size ease of cultivation and rapid growth ziegler et al 2016 aquatic macrophytes such as the members of the lemnaceae family are recognized as one of the most effective organisms in the rehabilitation of wastewater and water areas lemna minor is successfully used to remove heavy metals e g chromium nickel cobalt lead pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps agrochemicals organic compounds dyes nanoparticles and other toxic substances sasmaz et al 2016 alexan 2020 ubuza et al 2020 invasive plants such as japanese knotweed reynoutria japonica are also used in phytoremediation indeed japanese knotweed can be transformed into a carbon absorbent and used inter alia in the absorption of paracetamol or diclofenac koutník 2020 cultivated cucumbers and courgettes are also effective in removing impurities from sediments their use resulted in a reduction in the concentration of polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxins pcdds polychlorinated dibenzofurans pcdfs and dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls dl pcbs in soil mixed with sewage sludge 64 for cucumber and 69 for courgette respectively and soil associated with river sediment 52 for cucumber and 51 for courgette respectively urbaniak et al 2019 willow communities may also play an important role in controlling the level of pollution in coastal zones it has been suggested that salicetum triandro viminalis occupying almost 30 ha of the coastal zone of the pilica river may be responsible for the assimilation of large amounts of pcbs a 49 loss of these compounds was observed in sediments collected from the lower sections of the river compared to the upper parts skłodowski et al 2014 in addition when used in combination with the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae sarcocornia fruticosa demonstrates high efficiency in reducing metals from a contaminated environment said et al 2019 10 summary progressive urbanization combined with a constantly growing population has resulted in the release of increasing amounts of chemicals into the aquatic environment understanding the threat of xenobiotics is an integral part of maintaining surface waters in good condition due to the detrimental effects of xenobiotics on living organisms their accumulation in the environment and their transfer between the levels of the trophic chain there is a pressing need to discuss strategies for the elimination of toxic compounds from the environment and to limit their use in industry it is hence not only vital to understand the chemical properties of the test substances but also to characterize their toxicity and assess their short and long term impact on organisms from different levels of the trophic chain effective treatment of stormwater from urban areas and sewage treatment plants these being the main sources of xenobiotic emissions plays a key role in minimizing such pollution of aquatic ecosystems such activities must be supported by legislation aimed at protecting aquatic ecosystems improving the existing ones and designing new techniques for remediation to this end ecohydrological biotechnologies and nature based solutions represent promising effective and low cost solutions offering the potential for non invasive and efficient removal of the effects of anthropogenization of the environment and ensuring the protection of aquatic ecosystems against pollution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
