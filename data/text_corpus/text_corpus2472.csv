12360,groundwater contamination and vulnerability in urbanised areas are of major concern and require greater attention in cameroon as in most developing african countries people in urban and peri urban areas do not have easy access to pipe borne water the vast majority of the people have groundwater as main source of water supply the main objective of this work is to study shallow aquifers in the foumban locality by applying the drastic and god models coupled with the multivariate statistical analysis in order to efficiently assess the vulnerability of these aquifers this locality is located in a crystalline and crystallophyllian basement zone where two types of aquifers are developed namely the subsurface and the fractured aquifers to that effect the depth to water table recharge lithology of the aquifer soil media topography vadose zone and the hydraulic conductivity were prepared classified weighed and integrated in a geographic information system based on the drastic model the result showed that the study area is weak and moderately vulnerable with regard to the god method vulnerability maps indicated three levels of vulnerability index to pollution inconsiderable low and moderate vulnerability for both methods areas lying mainly between weak vulnerability and moderate vulnerability categories extend along the three experimental watersheds in the study area the sensitivity analysis and the multivariate statistical tests show that the depth to water table and the impact of vadose zone were the most significant parameters in the vulnerability assessment the modelling results were approved by comparing them with nitrate concentration in the groundwater among all analysed samples the borehole f401 has nitrate concentrations that exceed the who standard for the water intended for human consumption according to this study the groundwater vulnerability maps provide important preliminary information which could greatly help in the protection of local water resources graphical abstract fx1 keywords foumban western cameroon alterites aquifer vulnerability drastic and god models 1 introduction water resources could be contaminated as a result of natural and anthropogenic factors degradation of groundwater quality due to anthropogenic activities is of serious concern as nearly half of the world s population depends on groundwater sources for drinking water supply and other uses brindha and elango 2015 akenji et al 2015 it is important to protect water resources from pollution for a sustainable management groundwater vulnerability mapping was largely used as a means of determining the sensitivity of aquifer systems to surface pollution aller et al 1987 chenini et al 2015 the aquifer vulnerability mapping as a means of evaluating groundwater resources and assessing groundwater sensitivity to surface pollution has been used since the 80 s robins et al 2006 several methods can also be used to evaluate the groundwater vulnerability such as the drastic god sintacs pi si cop etc aller et al 1987 foster et al 1987 armengol et al 2014 iqbal et al 2014 kaliraj et al 2014 anjali singh srivastav et al 2015 the sintacs model derived from drastic and was developed in italy by napolitano and fabbri 1996 it adapts to mapping on a larger scale given the great hydrogeological diversity of this country mohamed et al 2007 the parameters used in this approach are the same as those for the drastic method the susceptibility index model si is a specific vertical vulnerability method developed in portugal mohamed et al 2007 this method takes into account the behaviour of pollutants of agricultural origin mainly nitrates it takes into consideration five parameters the depth to water table d the effective recharge of the aquifer r the aquifer media a the topography t and the land use os the first four parameters are those used in the drastic method with regard to the cop model it was developed under the cost action 620 programme of the european union to assess the intrinsic vulnerability of carbonate aquifers vias et al 2006 the acronym cop stands for the initials of the three factors used as parameters for the assessment of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability such as the concentration of flow the overlying layers above the water table and the precipitation over the aquifer daly et al 2002 vias et al 2006 twana et al 2016 finally the pi method is another approach of mapping the vulnerability of groundwater to contamination with special consideration of karst aquifers the p factor indicates the effectiveness of the protective cover as a function of the thickness and hydraulic properties of all the strata between the ground surface and the groundwater table soil subsoil non karstic bedrock and unsaturated zone of the karstic bedrock hölting et al 1995 the i factor infiltration conditions indicates the degree to which the protective cover is bypassed by surface and near surface flow especially if it occurs within the catchment area of a sinking stream it takes into account the properties of the soil land use and vegetation the slope and above all the locations of karst features that allow surface water to rapidly enter the groundwater hölting et al 1995 in most developing african countries including cameroon people in rural and even in urban areas do not have easy access to pipe borne water according to dhundi and akira 2009 mfonka et al 2015 this situation could be attributed to the illegal occupation of land rural exodus a growing population lack of investment in the water sector including its treatment and distribution added to the current climate change and variability which is the cause of the frequent water storages in households of most towns across the country dhundi and akira 2009 shanshan et al 2015 ndam ngoupayou et al 2016 the foumban locality has not been spared this metropolis is the second most densely populated of west cameroon with an urbanisation rate of about 60 quite above the national average 48 8 it has a density close to that of the region 123 8 inhabitants km2 bucrep 2010 similarly it is counted among the six cities of cameroon and the only one in the western region having a size between 75 000 99 999 inhabitants with regard to water supply in this city the water distribution company cde camwater has equipment dating as far back as 1975 it produced only 2520 m3 day representing 1 5 of the demand for an estimated population of 83 522 inhabitants bucrep 2010 4670 taps were implanted with 3925 subscribers mfonka et al 2015 a great majority of the population use groundwater from wells and springs for their daily water needs these water resources are generally of doubtful quality causing many waterborne diseases such as cholera diarrhoea dysentery and typhoid thus leading to the poor health of the population from a socio economic point of view atiqur 2008 these hydro systems which supply more than 70 of the population of foumban town during the dry season are confronted to various pollutions especially urban waste edet 2014 since the locality does not yet have industrial companies in charge of the disposal of waste in the environment which in turn further affects the quality of groundwater resources this situation shows the importance of the control of groundwater vulnerability once groundwater has been contaminated it is difficult to remedy the situation consequently protection from contamination is a primary strategy for groundwater quality management antonino et al 2015 this investigation was carried out to evaluate aquifer vulnerability using the drastic and god methods coupled with multivariate statistical analysis msa in three experimental watersheds in the foumban urban area the main objective was to determine the susceptible zone for groundwater pollution by integrating hydrogeological maps such as depth to water table recharge aquifer media soil media topography vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity in geographic information system gis the mfomchout 1 387 km2 ngâ 0 942 km2 and lompit 1 16 km2 experimental watersheds selected for the present study are located in the foumban urban area in the noun division west cameroon figs 1 and 2 with altitudes ranging between 1033 5 and 1231 5 m the area is characterized by a tropical mountainous climate with two contrasting seasons consisting of a long rainy season of nine months and a short dry season of three months the average annual rainfall and the average temperature are about 1855 203 mm and 21 c respectively its vegetation consists of woody savannah 2 materials and methods 2 1 geological settings the study area is based on precambrian crystalline crystallophyllian bedrock weeksteen 1957 njonfang et al 2006 tchakounté et al 2017 this substratum is composed of plutonic anatexic and syntectonic granite and or metamorphic orthogneiss mylonite biotite and amphibole gneiss rocks on which volcanic outflows consisting mostly of plateau basalts dated from 51 to 11 million years moundi 2004 moundi et al 2007 these are the so called transitional basalts olivine basalt and olivine free basalts with local presence of rhyolites rhyolite tuffs and andesites moundi 2004 njonfang et al 2006 moundi et al 2007 okomo atouba et al 2016 ziem et al 2017 fig 3 the rocks described above are surmounted by several types of thick red and or yellow lateritic soils which are the most represented in the study area the poorly developed soils which develop on the mountainous slopes with steep slopes and constituted by a thin humus horizon and finally the hydromorphic soils encountered in the lowlands and talwegs lateritic soils show from bottom to top several types of materials whose voluminal extensions depend largely on the topography these are alteration materials saprolite variegated clay materials spotted clays indurated ferruginous materials and brightly coloured homogeneous clay materials which could be either red or yellow tardy 1993 segalen 1967 njoya 2007 nkalih mefire 2016 2 2 hydrogeological setting based on some well logs obtained from water supply boreholes realized in the foumban locality and its surroundings by public authorities and development partners world bank european union two major aquifers are identified as everywhere else in cameroon and africa djeuda tchapnga et al 1999 courtois et al 2009 mfonka et al 2015 lachassagne et al 2015 bon et al 2016 alterite and fractured aquifers the first aquifer which is much sought by the population plays a capacitive role they occur at the surface in alterites with a sandy clay texture and consist of some duricrusts they have a significant porosity and a relatively low permeability ranged between 4 18 10 5 m s k 7 16 10 5 m s obtained by the porchet test these values correspond to a semi permeable material this permeability is of the same order of magnitude as those obtained by tabue youmbi 2013 bon et al 2016 in the centre region of cameroon 1 87 10 6 and 9 46 10 5 close to the ground surface this aquifer reacts to variations in climatic conditions and to natural and or human surface contaminants the second aquifer plays a conductive role it has a fissural porosity in the study area the fractured zones are located at about 20 m depth and could even extend up to 100 m djeuda tchapnga et al 1999 this aquifer is found between the fresh impermeable rock and the surface alterites the two identified aquifers operate in a two layer system lachassagne and wyns 2005 courtois et al 2009 lachassagne et al 2011 2015 the flows rate obtained through a pumping test in some boreholes situated in the foumban locality and its surroundings varied between 0 7 and 20 m3 h with a mean tendency around 2 00 m3 h whatever the nature of the aquiferous rock these correspond to the specific flows which vary between 0 108 m3 h m and 7 594 m3 h m the transmissivities vary between 1 150 10 5 and 2 033 10 3 m2 s these values are of the same order of magnitude as those obtained in the crystallophyllian basement zone 8 10 6 m2 s t 1 151 10 3 m2 s made up of metamorphic rocks in central region of cameroon by anaba onana et al 2017 2 3 data base and methodology 2 3 1 criteria for choosing drastic and god methods the drastic and god models were chosen as the most appropriate for this study because a they are simple and take into account several parameters of the natural environment which control the contamination process of the aquifers b they include a high number of layers of input data that limits the impacts of errors of the individual parameters on the final result c these parameters are in general available for their evaluation and d these methods are better adapted to the porous aquifers foster et al 1987 jamrah et al 2008 akenji et al 2015 many authors have evaluated the vulnerability rate of aquifers using these two methods and establishing good correlations between them for example nerantzis kazakis and konstantinos voudouris 2011 compared the two models in alluvial aquifer of florina basin greece using linear regression analysis the result indicates that the god method has a stronger correlation with the drastic and avi methods and the three models produced comparable vulnerability maps according to polemio et al 2009 the god method is useful for mapping large areas with high vulnerability contrasts whereas the drastic is useful for any type of aquifer in ranchi district jharkhand india ighbal et al 2014 compared a gis based fuzzy pattern recognition model modified drastic model with a standard drastic model the two models present similar points 2 3 2 description of the methods the drastic model was developed by us epa and extensively used to assess pollution potentials in the united states and other countries around the world bai et al 2012 aniekan 2013 elham et al 2013 el hanini et al 2013 aminreza neshat et al 2014 dipankar and fakhre 2014 elfarrak et al 2014 this model uses seven physical and hydrodynamic parameters of the natural environment to assess the vulnerability of the aquifer such as depth to water table recharge aquifer media soil media topography vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity the index of this method is often used to standardize the evaluation of groundwater pollution potential within various hydrogeological settings its calculation assumes that 1 the contaminant is introduced at the ground surface 2 the contaminant is flushed into the groundwater by precipitation 3 the contaminant has the mobility of water and 4 the area evaluated is 0 4 km2 or larger aller et al 1987 bartzas et al 2015 for the realization of the final vulnerability maps each of the seven parameters is classified in a range of values or according to the type of dominating medium it reflects its impact on the aquifer vulnerability each parameter has been assigned a rating between 1 and 10 corresponding to low and high potential of contamination respectively table 1 to obtain drastic index the rating of each parameter is combined with its weight and this for all the sectors of the study area the drastic index is finally computed by implying linear combinations of the products of rating and weights eq 1 for each factor as follows aller et al 1987 1 drastic index di d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w the index r corresponds to the rating and the index w to the weight the higher drastic index corresponds to the high potential contamination and vice versa this index is a relative value without dimension allowing a comparison between the sites the result can vary between 23 and 230 these extreme values are rarely reached the computed values generally vary between 50 and 200 alassane 2004 the scale of vulnerability is as follows drastic index 100 weak vulnerability drastic index ranging between 100 and 150 moderate vulnerability drastic index 150 high vulnerability the god method is a vulnerability assessment method which was developed in the united kingdom by foster 1987 it is another parametric method which uses few parameters as compared to the drastic method this method was experimented by several authors feumba 2015 ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 the name of the method refers to the english acronym groundwater in terms of the standard of aquifer overall aquifer class which corresponds to the characteristic of the aquifer in terms of lithology and porosity and depth to water table the god index can be divided into six categories table 2 going from 0 to 1 foster 1987 ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 the god parameter indexes groundwater confinement overlying strata and depth to groundwater were created as described for the drastic model the index of vulnerability is given according to the following formula eq 2 2 vi cg co cd where cg is the dimension of the aquifer co the dimension of lithology and cd the dimension allotted to the depth to water table each of the seven drastic parameters and three god parameters are mapped and classified either into ranges or into significant media types which have an impact on pollution potential the information about the drastic and god layers for each model was provided through geographic information system gis the software was used to create an interactive geodata base compile the geospatial data compute the drastic and god indexes and to generate the final vulnerability maps for both drastic and god methods the geostatistical analyst extension with kriging interpolation algorithm was used to support the distribution analysis antonino et al 2015 each parameter is converted into a layer with the module grid interpolate extension spatial analyst the spatial maps of the various parameters are established and the ratings are submitted in the reclassify module the intersection indexes of the different layers through the module mapcalculator will help to establish the drastic and god vulnerability maps this crossing is performed according to the arithmetic system with the addition operator for the drastic method and multiplication for the god method according to the formulas for each method the two procedures are presented in fig 4 2 4 sensitivity analysis many specialists in hydrogeology argue that groundwater contamination vulnerability may be worked out without using all the parameters of the drastic model merchant 1994 akenji et al 2015 bartzas et al 2015 others napolitano and fabbri 1996 have argued that weights and ratings used in the model are subjective and there is no reason not to doubt the accuracy of the vulnerability index moreover some may doubt the results of this model in the absence of supporting experimental evidence atiqur 2008 in order to clear all these doubts sensitivity analysis of the model and groundwater contamination analysis are carried out in the first instance the rated parameters of the model have been examined for interdependence and variability as a high degree of interdependence of the parameters may lead to the risk of misadjustment babiker et al 2005 atikur 2008 they carried out two sensitivity tests the map removal sensitivity analysis and the single parameter sensitivity analysis in this study the sensitivity analyses have been tested only on the drastic model the map removal sensitivity analysis test was for the first time experimented by lodwick monson and svoboda 1990 these two tests are also used by many other authors babiker et al 2005 kaliraj et al 2014 this test identifies the sensitivity of vulnerability map by removing one or more layer maps and is worked out using the following formula eq 3 3 s v n v n v 100 where s sensitivity measure v unperturbed vulnerability index actual index obtained by using all seven parameters v perturbed vulnerability index vulnerability index calculated using a lower number of parameters and n and n number of data layers used to compute v and v the single parameter sensitivity analysis was introduced by napolitano and fabbri 1996 it was carried out to assess the influence of each of the seven parameters of the model on the vulnerability measure in this analysis the real or effective weight of each parameter was compared with its assigned or theoretical weight the effective weight of a parameter in a sub area was calculated by using the following equation eq 4 4 w p r p w v 100 w refers to the effective weight of each parameter pr and pw are the rating value and weight of each parameter and v is the overall vulnerability index 2 4 1 multivariate statistical analysis in order to establish the correlation and similarity dissimilarity between the drastic parameters multivariate statistical tests correlation matrix and agglomerative hierarchical clustering were performed between parameters such as theoretical weight effective weight theoretical weight and the drastic index of each parameter w r the correlation coefficient matrix measures how well the variance of each constituent can be explained based on their relationships with each other liu et al 2003 rakotondrabe et al 2017b the pearson s correlation coefficient was used to show the inter relationship and coherence pattern among drastic parameters considering the specificity of the present study the strong value of correlation matrix is 0 94 because it takes into account only seven parameters cluster analysis given by agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc is a family of multivariate techniques designed to uncover and classify naturally occurring subgroups within a dataset based on similarities between the observations ahc seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters and can also be applied to compositional data that are log transformed 2 4 2 water sampling and analysis four shallow wells p102 p314 p401 and p501 two springs s301 and s401 and one borehole f401 fig 5 were selected and sampled for chemical analysis during the hydrological year 2013 2014 depending on their use by the population and their representativeness in the study area samples were collected in 1 5 l polyethylene bottles that had previously been washed with ultrapure acid and rinsed with distilled water and then with milliq deionized water for chemical analysis before a sample was collected the bottle was rinsed three times with the water to be sampled in accordance with standard procedures rodier 2009 mfonka et al 2015 ndam ngoupayou et al 2016 rakotondrabe et al 2017a 2017b the analyses were performed in the geochemical laboratory at nkolbisson cameroon using high performance liquid chromatography hplc the other water samples were filtered with cellulose acetate 0 45 µm membranes using a polycarbonate millipore filtration unit and were determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc technic 3 results and discussions 3 1 drastic and god vulnerability index the vulnerability map was gotten by cumulating the individual rating maps depth to water table during the two seasons recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity figs 6 7 and 8 the drastic vulnerability indexes were presented in table 3 according to this method the range of vulnerability index vi is between 70 and 158 for simplicity and visibility the vulnerability index values were divided into two classis i e low vi 100 and moderate 100 vi 150 vulnerable aquifer areas fig 9 which cover about 55 and 45 of the study area respectively moderate vulnerability zone was observed around p102 p310 p311 f401 p402 p403 p404 p501 p506 and p503 identified in the mfomchout ngâ and lompit basins these vulnerability indices are slightly lower than those obtained by feumba 2015 115 vi 164 and akenji et al 2015 120 vi 199 in the city of douala in cameroon edet 2014 in calabar nigeria 124 vi 170 which are all located in sedimentary environments however they are of the same order of magnitude as those obtained by al adamat et al 2003 92 vi 139 and prasad et al 2010 95 vi 159 respectively in the catchment area of azraq in jordan and in the nalgonda in india district in the basement area this difference between the vulnerability indices in basement and sedimentary environments should be related to the characteristics of the drastic parameters which vary considerably in these two environments the statistical summary of the drastic index parameters table 4 reveals that the highest contribution to the vulnerability index is made by the depth to water table mean 34 closely followed by impact of vadose zone mean 30 the third ranked contribution is recharge mean 21 6 followed by hydraulic conductivity mean 14 4 soil media mean 8 aquifer media mean value 6 the least significant is topography mean 5 6 contributing lowest to the vulnerability index according to the drastic method the various areas of vulnerability hardly change during the dry and rainy seasons however as regards the god method the range of vi is between 0 1 and 0 3 for the rainy and dry seasons these values were divided into three classes i e vi 0 1 0 1 vi 0 3 and 0 3 vi 0 5 which correspond respectively to inconsiderable vulnerability low vulnerability and moderate vulnerability fig 10 these vulnerability indices are slightly equal and lower than those obtained by ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 in abarkooh plain in india 0 12 iv 0 57 it s important to note that a dominance of the moderate vulnerability class can be observed in august thus representing the rainy season and weak vulnerability and february representing the dry period this variation according to the god model is mainly due to the depth to water table because the two layers representing overlying strata and groundwater confinement do not vary temporarily 3 2 sensitivity analysis results the sensitivity analysis single parameter sensitivity map removal sensitivity and statistical analysis correlation matrix and agglomerative hierarchical clustering were realized exclusively with the drastic parameters depth to water table net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone hydraulic conductivity effective weights effective weights in percentage and theoretical weights 3 2 1 map removal sensitivity analysis the depth to water table and impact of vadose zone parameters have been assigned with higher theoretical weight than the other layers which represent the sensitivity of individual layers towards vulnerability the analysis indicated that the removal of depth to water table and impact of vadose zone layers resulted in high variation in the vulnerability index due to the high weight assigned to these layers the vulnerability variation index value seems to be least sensitive to the removal of the hydraulic conductivity and the topography layers this is because these layers are theoretically less considerable weights 3 and 1 respectively and an assessment presenting a relatively moderate potential to contaminate the aquifer table 5 the computation of the variation vulnerability index has provided adequate information on the most effective parameter involved in the vulnerability assessment 3 2 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis the results of the single parameter sensitivity analysis showed that there is a deviation in the effective weights of the drastic parameters from theoretical weights table 6 in the vulnerability assessment depth to water table and impact of vadose zone were the most important parameters as their effective weight 30 37 30 49 respectively exceeded the theoretical weight 21 74 and 21 74 respectively these results were in accordance with those obtained with the statistical summary of the drastic index parameters in table 4 the effective weight of topography hydraulic conductivity and soil media were sensibly the same values the aquifer media represent low effective weights as compared to their theoretical weights according to these results we can note that the effective weights depend on the variability of each drastic parameter theoretical weight and rating if the same rating value is chosen for one of the parameters over the entire area its effective weight will vary as a function of the rating values of other parameters hence for each case it is essential to know the effective weights that results from the theoretical ones gogu and dassargues 2000 the effective weights are not equal to the theoretical weights generally the effective weights are significantly related to the single parameter value related to values chosen for other parameters in this study parameter d has a strong influence on the vulnerability the influence is due to the combined influence of the different theoretical weights therefore the application of effective weights is very useful to revise the weight factors such that drastic vulnerability method can be used to solve local groundwater pollution issues gogu and dassargues 2000 edet 2014 3 3 multivariate statistical analysis results 3 3 1 correlation matrix each input parameters of different layers for drastic model has been correlated with final output of drastic model using gis as given in table 7 the result of correlation matrix implies that among the drastic layer depth to water table recharge impact of vadose zone topography and hydraulic conductivity thickness shows a very good correlation of 0 96 0 97 0 99 and 0 94 respectively soil media topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity thickness shows equally a very good correlation of 0 93 0 90 0 98 respectively however less correlation has been observed in the remaining parameters 3 3 2 agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc visual examination of the dendrogram suggests the presence of two strongly distinct clusters and two sub clusters fig 11 cluster i groups the depth to water table and the impact of vadose zone this combination reflects the significant affinity between the two parameters as well as their high sensitivity to the transfer of pollutants to the groundwater cluster ia regroups the topography the hydraulic conductivity and the soil media while cluster 2b groups the net recharge and the aquifer media these parameters have a lower sensibility compared to the depth to water table and the impact of vadoze zone definitely the statistical tests obtained through the correlation matrix and ahc lead to the conclusion that there is indeed interdependence between these parameters of the natural environment used to assess the degree of vulnerability of the groundwater 3 4 comparison between the drastic and god models the groundwater vulnerability maps obtained using the drastic and god models show two vulnerability classes for the first model and three for the second respectively according to the drastic model the two groundwater vulnerability maps present great similarity this is due to the fact that this method takes into account several parameters which vary slightly spatially and temporarily in the study area on the contrary the maps created with the god model in the rainy and dry seasons are different the god method indicates higher vulnerable zones to contamination by pollutants in the rainy season august than in the dry season february this difference is probably linked to the variation of the depth to water table this is the only one out of the three parameters of the god model which varies considerably in the study area feumba 2015 ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 indicate that the god model is more generalized and adapted for the assessment of aquifer vulnerability at a large scale this same conclusion was done by nerantzis kazakis and konstantinos voudouris 2011 in alluvial aquifer of florina basin greece they used linear regression analysis to establish correlations between drastic and god methods they indicate that the god method has a stronger correlation with the drastic methods and the two models produced comparable vulnerability maps 3 5 validation of the vulnerability maps validation refers to some independent procedure that can help verify the results of the vulnerability analysis verification of vulnerability assessment can be done through different analyses the most common approach particularly for verification of assessments using overlay and index methods is to compare the vulnerability map with the actual occurrence of some common pollutants in groundwater typical pollutants used are nitrate pesticides and bacteriological parameters which have the anthropogenic origin such as agricultural and other anthropogenic activities in this study the nitrate analysis was done the summary of nitrate concentration was presented in table 8 the spatial distribution of these pollution indicative parameters in the study area shows that f401 p314 s401 and p501 have nitrate contents between 17 and 69 64 mg l these concentrations particularly in f401 are sometimes higher than the standards prescribed by who 2011 for water intended for human consumption it is important to know that the presence in the wells and borehole of these pollutants is related to several factors the presence of the septic tanks which extend to great depths uncontrolled landfill wastewater discharges the insufficient cleaning of the town and the water drawing techniques besides physicochemical results show that wells and borehole with high concentrations of nitrate correspond to zones with high susceptibility to pollution according to drastic and god vulnerability maps however the borehole which contains a high concentration of nitrate has a depth of 61 m and ought not to have been contaminated by surface sources this borehole would capture both the fractured and subsurface aquifers or these wells could have been in contact with the subsurface area given its position at the level of the piezometric depression which is the receptacle of all the undesirable products drainage and soil leaching during the precipitations this issue makes the hypothesis of deep boreholes always as bearers of very good quality water to be questionable in contrast to shallow wells this remark brings in the necessity for the entire environmental protection of groundwater which is an important water source for the inhabitants the same analyses were carried out by several authors to validate the vulnerability maps carried out elsewhere in the world this is the case of edet and worden 2009 in three parts of calabar in nigeria these authors present the correlation between nitrate concentration in hand dug wells and boreholes and vulnerability zones identified using the drastic method the result show that the shallow wells in the high vulnerability zone southern part have average nitrate concentration of 49 07 mg l the medium vulnerability zone central part has average nitrate value of 32 96 m l and the low vulnerability zone northern part has an average nitrate concentration of 11 75 mg l according to the previous results several factors express the degrees of vulnerability of the alterites aquifer in various sectors of the study zone the same study was carried out by dipankar and fakhre 2014 in the intense agriculture area of the gangetic plains of india the aquifer vulnerability map obtained was compared with no3 concentration in groundwater the spatial distribution revealed a strong concentration of no3 in five zones thus broadly in line with higher vulnerable areas as exposed by drastic 4 conclusion this study has attempted to assess groundwater vulnerability in the three experimental watersheds in the foumban urban area where groundwater is highly demanded for multiple household uses by households these groundwater resources are confined in two types of superimposed aquifers that function as a bi layer system an upper continuous alteritic aquifer developed on the saprolite usually between the topographic surface up to 20 m deep and the discontinuous fissured aquifers of the basement usually n20 m deep to this effect the drastic and god models which use physical and hydrodynamic parameters of aquifers was applied in a gis environment coupled with the multivariate statistical analysis according to the drastic model the vulnerable risk zones are grouped into two i e low and moderate zones and do not vary between the dry and rainy seasons for a god model the vulnerable risk zones are grouped into three i e inconsiderable low and moderate zones which vary considerably from one season to another contrary to the drasrtic model sensitivity analysis has revealed the important role of depth to water table and impact of vadose zone as most significant parameters in vulnerability assessment emphasizing that the data regarding these two parameters should be representative and accurate multivariate statistical tests show that there is indeed interdependence between some parameters of the natural environment used to assess the degree of vulnerability of the groundwater the aquifer vulnerability maps were compared with no3 concentrations in groundwater the spatial distribution revealed a strong concentration of no3 confined in the moderate vulnerability zone thus clearly coinciding with higher vulnerable areas as exposed by drastic and god however the exception observed around the p102 well may explain the weakness of the model the results of this study constitute first an important baseline data and the decision making tool for the protection of foumban s highly demanding underground water resources but also for the different types of water projects for development as well as sustainable development of the foumban locality acknowledgements this work was supported by the european union through the pafroid educational grant program grant no hdp2a

12360,groundwater contamination and vulnerability in urbanised areas are of major concern and require greater attention in cameroon as in most developing african countries people in urban and peri urban areas do not have easy access to pipe borne water the vast majority of the people have groundwater as main source of water supply the main objective of this work is to study shallow aquifers in the foumban locality by applying the drastic and god models coupled with the multivariate statistical analysis in order to efficiently assess the vulnerability of these aquifers this locality is located in a crystalline and crystallophyllian basement zone where two types of aquifers are developed namely the subsurface and the fractured aquifers to that effect the depth to water table recharge lithology of the aquifer soil media topography vadose zone and the hydraulic conductivity were prepared classified weighed and integrated in a geographic information system based on the drastic model the result showed that the study area is weak and moderately vulnerable with regard to the god method vulnerability maps indicated three levels of vulnerability index to pollution inconsiderable low and moderate vulnerability for both methods areas lying mainly between weak vulnerability and moderate vulnerability categories extend along the three experimental watersheds in the study area the sensitivity analysis and the multivariate statistical tests show that the depth to water table and the impact of vadose zone were the most significant parameters in the vulnerability assessment the modelling results were approved by comparing them with nitrate concentration in the groundwater among all analysed samples the borehole f401 has nitrate concentrations that exceed the who standard for the water intended for human consumption according to this study the groundwater vulnerability maps provide important preliminary information which could greatly help in the protection of local water resources graphical abstract fx1 keywords foumban western cameroon alterites aquifer vulnerability drastic and god models 1 introduction water resources could be contaminated as a result of natural and anthropogenic factors degradation of groundwater quality due to anthropogenic activities is of serious concern as nearly half of the world s population depends on groundwater sources for drinking water supply and other uses brindha and elango 2015 akenji et al 2015 it is important to protect water resources from pollution for a sustainable management groundwater vulnerability mapping was largely used as a means of determining the sensitivity of aquifer systems to surface pollution aller et al 1987 chenini et al 2015 the aquifer vulnerability mapping as a means of evaluating groundwater resources and assessing groundwater sensitivity to surface pollution has been used since the 80 s robins et al 2006 several methods can also be used to evaluate the groundwater vulnerability such as the drastic god sintacs pi si cop etc aller et al 1987 foster et al 1987 armengol et al 2014 iqbal et al 2014 kaliraj et al 2014 anjali singh srivastav et al 2015 the sintacs model derived from drastic and was developed in italy by napolitano and fabbri 1996 it adapts to mapping on a larger scale given the great hydrogeological diversity of this country mohamed et al 2007 the parameters used in this approach are the same as those for the drastic method the susceptibility index model si is a specific vertical vulnerability method developed in portugal mohamed et al 2007 this method takes into account the behaviour of pollutants of agricultural origin mainly nitrates it takes into consideration five parameters the depth to water table d the effective recharge of the aquifer r the aquifer media a the topography t and the land use os the first four parameters are those used in the drastic method with regard to the cop model it was developed under the cost action 620 programme of the european union to assess the intrinsic vulnerability of carbonate aquifers vias et al 2006 the acronym cop stands for the initials of the three factors used as parameters for the assessment of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability such as the concentration of flow the overlying layers above the water table and the precipitation over the aquifer daly et al 2002 vias et al 2006 twana et al 2016 finally the pi method is another approach of mapping the vulnerability of groundwater to contamination with special consideration of karst aquifers the p factor indicates the effectiveness of the protective cover as a function of the thickness and hydraulic properties of all the strata between the ground surface and the groundwater table soil subsoil non karstic bedrock and unsaturated zone of the karstic bedrock hölting et al 1995 the i factor infiltration conditions indicates the degree to which the protective cover is bypassed by surface and near surface flow especially if it occurs within the catchment area of a sinking stream it takes into account the properties of the soil land use and vegetation the slope and above all the locations of karst features that allow surface water to rapidly enter the groundwater hölting et al 1995 in most developing african countries including cameroon people in rural and even in urban areas do not have easy access to pipe borne water according to dhundi and akira 2009 mfonka et al 2015 this situation could be attributed to the illegal occupation of land rural exodus a growing population lack of investment in the water sector including its treatment and distribution added to the current climate change and variability which is the cause of the frequent water storages in households of most towns across the country dhundi and akira 2009 shanshan et al 2015 ndam ngoupayou et al 2016 the foumban locality has not been spared this metropolis is the second most densely populated of west cameroon with an urbanisation rate of about 60 quite above the national average 48 8 it has a density close to that of the region 123 8 inhabitants km2 bucrep 2010 similarly it is counted among the six cities of cameroon and the only one in the western region having a size between 75 000 99 999 inhabitants with regard to water supply in this city the water distribution company cde camwater has equipment dating as far back as 1975 it produced only 2520 m3 day representing 1 5 of the demand for an estimated population of 83 522 inhabitants bucrep 2010 4670 taps were implanted with 3925 subscribers mfonka et al 2015 a great majority of the population use groundwater from wells and springs for their daily water needs these water resources are generally of doubtful quality causing many waterborne diseases such as cholera diarrhoea dysentery and typhoid thus leading to the poor health of the population from a socio economic point of view atiqur 2008 these hydro systems which supply more than 70 of the population of foumban town during the dry season are confronted to various pollutions especially urban waste edet 2014 since the locality does not yet have industrial companies in charge of the disposal of waste in the environment which in turn further affects the quality of groundwater resources this situation shows the importance of the control of groundwater vulnerability once groundwater has been contaminated it is difficult to remedy the situation consequently protection from contamination is a primary strategy for groundwater quality management antonino et al 2015 this investigation was carried out to evaluate aquifer vulnerability using the drastic and god methods coupled with multivariate statistical analysis msa in three experimental watersheds in the foumban urban area the main objective was to determine the susceptible zone for groundwater pollution by integrating hydrogeological maps such as depth to water table recharge aquifer media soil media topography vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity in geographic information system gis the mfomchout 1 387 km2 ngâ 0 942 km2 and lompit 1 16 km2 experimental watersheds selected for the present study are located in the

and its surroundings by public authorities and development partners world bank european union two major aquifers are identified as everywhere else in cameroon and africa djeuda tchapnga et al 1999 courtois et al 2009 mfonka et al 2015 lachassagne et al 2015 bon et al 2016 alterite and fractured aquifers the first aquifer which is much sought by the population plays a capacitive role they occur at the surface in alterites with a sandy clay texture and consist of some duricrusts they have a significant porosity and a relatively low permeability ranged between 4 18 10 5 m s k 7 16 10 5 m s obtained by the porchet test these values correspond to a semi permeable material this permeability is of the same order of magnitude as those obtained by tabue youmbi 2013 bon et al 2016 in the centre region of cameroon 1 87 10 6 and 9 46 10 5 close to the ground surface this aquifer reacts to variations in climatic conditions and to natural and or human surface contaminants the second aquifer plays a conductive role it has a fissural porosity in the study area the fractured zones are located at about 20 m depth and could even extend up to 100 m djeuda tchapnga et al 1999 this aquifer is found between the fresh impermeable rock and the surface alterites the two identified aquifers operate in a two layer system lachassagne and wyns 2005 courtois et al 2009 lachassagne et al 2011 2015 the flows rate obtained through a pumping test in some boreholes situated in the foumban locality and its surroundings varied between 0 7 and 20 m3 h with a mean tendency around 2 00 m3 h whatever the nature of the aquiferous rock these correspond to the specific flows which vary between 0 108 m3 h m and 7 594 m3 h m the transmissivities vary between 1 150 10 5 and 2 033 10 3 m2 s

anaba onana et al 2017 2 3 data base and methodology 2 3 1 criteria for choosing drastic and god methods the drastic and god models were chosen as the most appropriate for this study because a they are simple and take into account several parameters of the natural environment which control the contamination process of the aquifers b they include a high number of layers of input data that limits the impacts of errors of the individual parameters on the final result c these parameters are in general available for their evaluation and d these methods are better adapted to the porous aquifers foster et al 1987 jamrah et al 2008 akenji et al 2015 many authors have evaluated the vulnerability rate of aquifers using these two methods and establishing good correlations between them for example nerantzis kazakis and konstantinos voudouris 2011 compared the two models in alluvial aquifer of florina basin greece using linear regression analysis the result indicates that the god method has a stronger correlation with the drastic and avi methods and the three models produced comparable vulnerability maps according to polemio et al 2009 the god method is useful for mapping large areas with high vulnerability contrasts whereas the drastic is useful for any type of aquifer in ranchi district jharkhand india ighbal et al 2014 compared a gis based fuzzy pattern recognition model modified drastic model with a standard drastic model the two models present similar points 2 3 2 description of the methods the drastic model was developed by us epa and extensively used to assess pollution potentials in the united states and other countries around the world bai et al 2012 aniekan 2013 elham et al 2013 el hanini et al 2013 aminreza neshat et al 2014 dipankar and fakhre 2014 elfarrak et al 2014 this model uses seven physical and hydrodynamic parameters of the natural environment to assess the vulnerability of the aquifer such as depth to water table recharge aquifer media soil media topography vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity the index of this method is often used to standardize the evaluation of groundwater pollution potential within various hydrogeological settings its calculation assumes that 1 the contaminant is introduced at the ground surface 2 the contaminant is flushed into the groundwater by precipitation 3 the contaminant has the mobility of water and 4 the area evaluated is 0 4 km2 or larger aller et al 1987 bartzas et al 2015 for the realization of the final vulnerability maps each of the seven parameters is classified in a range of values or according to the type of dominating medium it reflects its impact on the aquifer vulnerability each parameter has been assigned a rating between 1 and 10 corresponding to low and high potential of contamination respectively table 1 to obtain drastic index the rating of each parameter is combined with its weight and this for all the sectors of the study area the drastic index is finally computed by implying linear combinations of the products of rating and weights eq 1 for each factor as follows aller et al 1987 1 drastic index di d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w the index r corresponds to the rating and the index w to the weight the higher drastic index corresponds to the high potential contamination and vice versa this index is a relative value without dimension allowing a comparison between the sites the result can vary between 23 and 230 these extreme values are rarely reached the computed values generally vary between 50 and 200 alassane 2004 the scale of vulnerability is as follows drastic index 100 weak vulnerability drastic index ranging between 100 and 150 moderate vulnerability drastic index 150 high vulnerability the god method is a vulnerability assessment method which was developed in the united kingdom by foster 1987 it is another parametric method which uses few parameters as compared to the drastic method this method was experimented by several authors feumba 2015 ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 the name of the method refers to the english acronym groundwater in terms of the standard of aquifer overall aquifer class which corresponds to the characteristic of the aquifer in terms of lithology and porosity and depth to water table the god index can be divided into six categories table 2 going from 0 to 1 foster 1987 ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 the god parameter indexes groundwater confinement overlying strata and depth to groundwater were created as described for the drastic model the index of vulnerability is given according to the following formula eq 2 2 vi cg co cd where cg is the dimension of the aquifer co the dimension of lithology and cd the dimension allotted to the depth to water table each of the seven drastic parameters and three god parameters are mapped and classified either into ranges or into significant media types which have an impact on pollution potential the information about the drastic and god layers for each model was provided through geographic information system gis the software was used to create an interactive geodata base compile the geospatial data compute the drastic and god indexes and to generate the final vulnerability maps for both drastic and god methods the geostatistical analyst extension with kriging interpolation algorithm was used to support the distribution analysis antonino et al 2015 each parameter is converted into a layer with the module grid interpolate extension spatial analyst the spatial maps of the various parameters are established and the ratings are submitted in the reclassify module the intersection indexes of the different layers through the module mapcalculator will help to establish the drastic and god vulnerability maps this crossing is performed according to the arithmetic system with the addition operator for the drastic method and multiplication for the god method according to the formulas for each method the two procedures are presented in fig 4 2 4 sensitivity analysis many specialists in hydrogeology argue that groundwater contamination vulnerability may be worked out without using all the parameters of the drastic model merchant 1994 akenji et al 2015 bartzas et al 2015 others napolitano and fabbri 1996 have argued that weights and ratings used in the model are subjective and there is no reason not to doubt the accuracy of the vulnerability index moreover some may doubt the results of this model in the absence of supporting experimental evidence atiqur 2008 in order to clear all these doubts sensitivity analysis of the model and groundwater contamination analysis are carried out in the first instance the rated parameters of the model have been examined for interdependence and variability as a high degree of interdependence of the parameters may lead to the risk of misadjustment babiker et al 2005 atikur 2008 they carried out two sensitivity tests the map removal sensitivity analysis and the single parameter sensitivity analysis in this study the sensitivity analyses have been tested only on the drastic model the map removal sensitivity analysis test was for the first time experimented by lodwick monson and svoboda 1990 these two tests are also used by many other authors babiker et al 2005 kaliraj et al 2014 this test identifies the sensitivity of vulnerability map by removing one or more layer maps and is worked out using the following formula eq 3 3 s v n v n v 100 where s sensitivity measure v unperturbed vulnerability index actual index obtained by using all seven parameters v perturbed vulnerability index vulnerability index calculated using a lower number of parameters and n and n number of data layers used to compute v and v the single parameter sensitivity analysis was introduced by napolitano and fabbri 1996 it was carried out to assess the influence of each of the seven parameters of the model on the vulnerability measure in this analysis the real or effective weight of each parameter was compared with its assigned or theoretical weight the effective weight of a parameter in a sub area was calculated by using the following equation eq 4 4 w p r p w v 100 w refers to the effective weight of each parameter pr and pw are the rating value and weight of each parameter and v is the overall vulnerability index 2 4 1 multivariate statistical analysis in order to establish the correlation and similarity dissimilarity between the drastic parameters multivariate statistical tests correlation matrix and agglomerative hierarchical clustering were performed between parameters such as theoretical weight effective weight theoretical weight and the drastic index of each parameter w r the correlation coefficient matrix measures how well the variance of each constituent can be explained based on their relationships with each other liu et al 2003 rakotondrabe et al 2017b the pearson s correlation coefficient was used to show the inter relationship and coherence pattern among drastic parameters considering the specificity of the present study the strong value of correlation matrix is 0 94 because it takes into account only seven parameters cluster analysis given by agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc is a family of multivariate techniques designed to uncover and classify naturally occurring subgroups within a dataset based on similarities between the observations ahc seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters and can also be applied to compositional data that are log transformed 2 4 2 water sampling and analysis four shallow wells p102 p314 p401 and p501 two springs s301 and s401 and one borehole f401 fig 5 were selected and sampled for chemical analysis during the hydrological year 2013 2014 depending on their use by the population and their representativeness in the study area samples were collected in 1 5 l polyethylene bottles that had previously been washed with ultrapure acid and rinsed with distilled water and then with milliq deionized water for chemical analysis before a sample was collected the bottle was rinsed three times with the water to be sampled in accordance with standard procedures rodier 2009 mfonka et al 2015 ndam ngoupayou et al 2016 rakotondrabe et al 2017a 2017b the analyses were performed in the geochemical laboratory at nkolbisson cameroon using high performance liquid chromatography hplc the other water samples were filtered with cellulose acetate 0 45 µm membranes using a polycarbonate millipore filtration unit and were determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc technic 3 results and discussions 3 1 drastic and god vulnerability index the vulnerability map was gotten by cumulating the individual rating maps depth to water table during the two seasons recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity figs 6 7 and 8 the drastic vulnerability indexes were presented in table 3 according to this method the range of vulnerability index vi is between 70 and 158 for simplicity and visibility the vulnerability index values were divided into two classis i e low vi 100 and moderate 100 vi 150 vulnerable aquifer areas fig 9 which cover about 55 and 45 of the study area respectively moderate vulnerability zone was observed around p102 p310 p311 f401 p402 p403 p404 p501 p506 and p503 identified in the mfomchout ngâ and lompit basins these vulnerability indices are slightly lower than those obtained by feumba 2015 115 vi 164 and akenji et al 2015 120 vi 199 in the city of douala in cameroon edet 2014 in calabar nigeria 124 vi 170 which are all located in sedimentary environments however they are of the same order of magnitude as those obtained by al adamat et al 2003 92 vi 139 and prasad et al 2010 95 vi 159 respectively in the catchment area of azraq in jordan and in the nalgonda in india district in the basement area this difference between the vulnerability indices in basement and sedimentary environments should be related to the characteristics of the drastic parameters which vary considerably in these two environments the statistical summary of the drastic index parameters table 4 reveals that the highest contribution to the vulnerability index is made by the depth to water table mean 34 closely followed by impact of vadose zone mean 30 the third ranked contribution is recharge mean 21 6 followed by hydraulic conductivity mean 14 4 soil media mean 8 aquifer media mean value 6 the least significant is topography mean 5 6 contributing lowest to the vulnerability index according to the drastic method the various areas of vulnerability hardly change during the dry and rainy seasons however as regards the god method the range of vi is between 0 1 and 0 3 for the rainy and dry seasons these values were divided into three classes i e vi 0 1 0 1 vi 0 3 and 0 3 vi 0 5 which correspond respectively to inconsiderable vulnerability low vulnerability and moderate vulnerability fig 10 these vulnerability indices are slightly equal and lower than those obtained by ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 in abarkooh plain in india 0 12 iv 0 57 it s important to note that a dominance of the moderate vulnerability class can be observed in august thus representing the rainy season and weak vulnerability and february representing the dry period this variation according to the god model is mainly due to the depth to water table because the two layers representing overlying strata and groundwater confinement do not vary temporarily 3 2 sensitivity analysis results the sensitivity analysis single parameter sensitivity map removal sensitivity and statistical analysis correlation matrix and agglomerative hierarchical clustering were realized exclusively with the drastic parameters depth to water table net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone hydraulic conductivity effective weights effective weights in percentage and theoretical weights 3 2 1 map removal sensitivity analysis the depth to water table and impact of vadose zone parameters have been assigned with higher theoretical weight than the other layers which represent the sensitivity of individual layers towards vulnerability the analysis indicated that the removal of depth to water table and impact of vadose zone layers resulted in high variation in the vulnerability index due to the high weight assigned to these layers the vulnerability variation index value seems to be least sensitive to the removal of the hydraulic conductivity and the topography layers this is because these layers are theoretically less considerable weights 3 and 1 respectively and an assessment presenting a relatively moderate potential to contaminate the aquifer table 5 the computation of the variation vulnerability index has provided adequate information on the most effective parameter involved in the vulnerability assessment 3 2 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis the results of the single parameter sensitivity analysis showed that there is a deviation in the effective weights of the drastic parameters from theoretical weights table 6 in the vulnerability assessment depth to water table and impact of vadose zone were the most important parameters as their effective weight 30 37 30 49 respectively exceeded the theoretical weight 21 74 and 21 74 respectively these results were in accordance with those obtained with the statistical summary of the drastic index parameters in table 4 the effective weight of topography hydraulic conductivity and soil media were sensibly the same values the aquifer media represent low effective weights as compared to their theoretical weights according to these results we can note that the effective weights depend on the variability of each drastic parameter theoretical weight and rating if the same rating value is chosen for one of the parameters over the entire area its effective weight will vary as a function of the rating values of other parameters hence for each case it is essential to know the effective weights that results from the theoretical ones gogu and dassargues 2000 the effective weights are not equal to the theoretical weights generally the effective weights are significantly related to the single parameter value related to values chosen for other parameters in this study parameter d has a strong influence on the vulnerability the influence is due to the combined influence of the different theoretical weights therefore the application of effective weights is very useful to revise the weight factors such that drastic vulnerability method can be used to solve local groundwater pollution issues gogu and dassargues 2000 edet 2014 3 3 multivariate statistical analysis results 3 3 1 correlation matrix each input parameters of different layers for drastic model has been correlated with final output of drastic model using gis as given in table 7 the result of correlation matrix implies that among the drastic layer depth to water table recharge impact of vadose zone topography and hydraulic conductivity thickness shows a very good correlation of 0 96 0 97 0 99 and 0 94 respectively soil media topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity thickness shows equally a very good correlation of 0 93 0 90 0 98 respectively however less correlation has been observed in the remaining parameters 3 3 2 agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc visual examination of the dendrogram suggests the presence of two strongly distinct clusters and two sub clusters fig 11 cluster i groups the depth to water table and the impact of vadose zone this combination reflects the significant affinity between the two parameters as well as their high sensitivity to the transfer of pollutants to the groundwater cluster ia regroups the topography the hydraulic conductivity and the soil media while cluster 2b groups the net recharge and the aquifer media these parameters have a lower sensibility compared to the depth to water table and the impact of vadoze zone definitely the statistical tests obtained through the correlation matrix and ahc lead to the conclusion that there is indeed interdependence between these parameters of the natural environment used to assess the degree of vulnerability of the groundwater 3 4 comparison between the drastic and god models the groundwater vulnerability maps obtained using the drastic and god models show two vulnerability classes for the first model and three for the second respectively according to the drastic model the two groundwater vulnerability maps present great similarity this is due to the fact that this method takes into account several parameters which vary slightly spatially and temporarily in the study area on the contrary the maps created with the god model in the rainy and dry seasons are different the god method indicates higher vulnerable zones to contamination by pollutants in the rainy season august than in the dry season february this difference is probably linked to the variation of the depth to water table this is the only one out of the three parameters of the god model which varies considerably in the study area feumba 2015 ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 indicate that the god model is more generalized and adapted for the assessment of aquifer vulnerability at a large scale this same conclusion was done by nerantzis kazakis and konstantinos voudouris 2011 in alluvial aquifer of florina basin greece they used linear regression analysis to establish correlations between drastic and god methods they indicate that the god method has a stronger correlation with the drastic methods and the two models produced comparable vulnerability maps 3 5 validation of the vulnerability maps validation refers to some independent procedure that can help verify the results of the vulnerability analysis verification of vulnerability assessment can be done through different analyses the most common approach particularly for verification of assessments using overlay and index methods is to compare the vulnerability map with the actual occurrence of some common pollutants in groundwater typical pollutants used are nitrate pesticides and bacteriological parameters which have the anthropogenic origin such as agricultural and other anthropogenic activities in this study the nitrate analysis was done the summary of nitrate concentration was presented in table 8 the spatial distribution of these pollution indicative parameters in the study area shows that f401 p314 s401 and p501 have nitrate contents between 17 and 69 64 mg l these concentrations particularly in f401 are sometimes higher than the standards prescribed by who 2011 for water intended for human consumption it is important to know that the presence in the wells and borehole of these pollutants is related to several factors the presence of the septic tanks which extend to great depths uncontrolled landfill wastewater discharges the insufficient cleaning of the town and the water drawing techniques besides physicochemical results show that wells and borehole with high concentrations of nitrate correspond to zones with high susceptibility to pollution according to drastic and god vulnerability maps however the borehole which contains a high concentration of nitrate has a depth of 61 m and ought not to have been contaminated by surface sources this borehole would capture both the fractured and subsurface aquifers or these wells could have been in contact with the subsurface area given its position at the level of the piezometric depression which is the receptacle of all the undesirable products drainage and soil leaching during the precipitations this issue makes the hypothesis of deep boreholes always as bearers of very good quality water to be questionable in contrast to shallow wells this remark brings in the necessity for the entire environmental protection of groundwater which is an important water source for the inhabitants the same analyses were carried out by several authors to validate the vulnerability maps carried out elsewhere in the world this is the case of edet and worden 2009 in three parts of calabar in nigeria these authors present the correlation between nitrate concentration in hand dug wells and boreholes and vulnerability zones identified using the drastic method the result show that the shallow wells in the high vulnerability zone southern part have average nitrate concentration of 49 07 mg l the medium vulnerability zone central part has average nitrate value of 32 96 m l and the low vulnerability zone northern part has an average nitrate concentration of 11 75 mg l according to the previous results several factors express the degrees of vulnerability of the alterites aquifer in various sectors of the study zone the same study was carried out by dipankar and fakhre 2014 in the intense agriculture area of the gangetic plains of india the aquifer vulnerability map obtained was compared with no3 concentration in groundwater the spatial distribution revealed a strong concentration of no3 in five zones thus broadly in line with higher vulnerable areas as exposed by drastic 4 conclusion this study has attempted to assess groundwater vulnerability in the three experimental watersheds in the foumban urban area where groundwater is highly demanded for multiple household uses by households these groundwater resources are confined in two types of superimposed aquifers that function as a bi layer system an upper continuous alteritic aquifer developed on the saprolite usually between the topographic surface up to 20 m deep and the discontinuous fissured aquifers of the basement usually n20 m deep to this effect the drastic and god models which use physical and hydrodynamic parameters of aquifers was applied in a gis environment coupled with the multivariate statistical analysis according to the drastic model the vulnerable risk zones are grouped into two i e low and moderate zones and do not vary between the dry and rainy seasons for a god model the vulnerable risk zones are grouped into three i e inconsiderable low and moderate zones which vary considerably from one season to another contrary to the drasrtic model sensitivity analysis has revealed the important role of depth to water table and impact of vadose zone as most significant parameters in vulnerability assessment emphasizing that the data regarding these two parameters should be representative and accurate multivariate statistical tests show that there is indeed interdependence between some parameters of the natural environment used to assess the degree of vulnerability of the groundwater the aquifer vulnerability maps were compared with no3 concentrations in groundwater the spatial distribution revealed a strong concentration of no3 confined in the moderate vulnerability zone thus clearly coinciding with higher vulnerable areas as exposed by drastic and god however the exception observed around the p102 well may explain the weakness of the model the results of this study constitute first an important baseline data and the decision making tool for the protection of foumban s highly demanding underground water resources but also for the different types of water projects for development as well as sustainable development of the foumban locality acknowledgements this work was supported by the european union through the pafroid educational grant program grant no hdp2a

important renewable resource for agricultural and industrial uses and also as potable water in india the improper disposal of waste water by the industries and human activities are creating the water pollution and deteriorating the quality of water in recent years one of the most serious developmental issues is the scarcity of clean and potable drinking water in many states of india viz west bengal andhra pradesh western uttar pradesh jharkhand orissa rajasthan and punjab tiwari and singh 2014 in the goa mining region and khetri copper mine region of india the ground water is unsuitable for drinking due to the excess levels of heavy metals like copper zinc iron cobalt lead etc gurdeep and kamal 2017 punia and siva siddaiah 2017 copper manganese chromium cadmium lead mercury etc are known to be highly toxic metals and their removal from wastewater is of great interest in the field of water pollution remediation out of different heavy metals copper is most widely used and the consumption was approximately 20 6 million short tons c d a 2015 in 2014 a fraction of copper is released from the industries viz iron and steel production electroplating electrical and electronics printing and photograph but the major sources of copper release into the environment are the water coming from the mines and the other sources are combustion processes wood production phosphate fertilizer production and natural sources viz windblown dust decaying vegetation forest fires sea sprays volcanoes etc elevated levels of copper in drinking water causes immediate effects like vomiting diarrhoea stomach cramps and nausea in more than 20 developed countries excess concentration of copper causing gastrointestinal problems kidney damage anaemia and lung cancers are reported babu rao et al 2016 us epa and who organizations recommended that the copper concentration in drinking water should not exceed 1 3 ppm johnson et al 2002 due to increased demand prices of copper capture of copper from waste streams and recycling is necessary from both ecological and economical point of view for removal of high concentrations of copper the methods processes in use are chemical precipitation chen et al 2009 fu and wang 2011 eg hydroxide sulphide or chelating precipitation which is not economically feasible and produces huge amounts of sludge ion exchange that employs expensive resins whose regeneration causes secondary pollution mautner et al 2016 adsorption using materials like activated carbon feitoza et al 2014 which is restricted due to high cost while low cost adsorbents from industrial waste streams bio adsorbents are limited because of their adsorption efficiencies coagulation flocculation fu and wang 2011 involve chemical consumption and sludge generation floatation involves high initial capital maintenance and operational costs qdais and moussa 2004 and electrochemical treatment restricted due to expensive electricity supply akar et al 2009 biosorption is cost effective and ecofriendly and a few of the biosorbents investigated for the removal of copper include microorganisms viz bacteria arul manikandan et al 2014 batool et al 2014 fungi chew and ting 2016 algae tran et al 2016 teimouri et al 2016 and sea weeds huang and lin 2015 some agricultural wastes like biochar of pristine softwood pine and hardwood jarrah and potato jin et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 moyo et al 2016 were tested as biosorbents biological wastes like bird egg shells feathers yang et al 2007 anantha and kota 2012 2015a manshourim et al 2013 hassan and aigbodion 2015 fish scales prabhu et al 2012 shells of water snails shrimp hossain and aditya 2015 mohanasrinivasan et al 2014 etc have also been used for the said purpose and were found to be effective several synthetic polymer composites like polyaniline chitin cellulose nanofibrils modified with pei benzidine based microporous polymer magnetic graphene oxide supported cyclodextrin karthik and meenakshi 2016 zhang et al 2016 taskin et al 2016 hu et al 2015 etc are reported to be effective in the removal of heavy metals similarly keratin from chick feathers and wool has been used in making composites due to the importance in textiles cell cultivation and medicine tanabe et al 2002 tachibana et al 2005 balaji et al 2012 tran and mututuvari 2015 cellulose graft polyacrylamide hydroxyapatite saber samandari et al 2013 n hap n hap chitin n hapc composite and n hap chitosan n hapcs composite rajiv gandhi et al 2011 are some of the hap based synthesized composites that had the common drawbacks of inconvenience to separation use of a number of chemicals reagents which in turn cause environmental pollution and difficulties in the disposal of used composites in order to eliminate these disadvantages renewable composites were prepared using the wastes from poultry and agriculture like chitosan eggshells and feathers for adsorption of copper in the present study the proposed composites have the desired characteristics for a wide range of applications in sustainable management of waste and groundwater recovery of copper and effluent treatment the top ten egg producing countries are china usa india japan mexico brazil indonesia turkey france and germany with an annual production of 24 8 5 6 3 8 2 522 2 516 2 2 1 22 1 03 0 94 and 0 89 billion kilograms respectively and release tons of eggshells as wastes the approximate production of agaricus bisporous an edible mushroom is about 13 6 million tons per year similarly annually from poultry processing and agricultural industries 8 5 billion tons of feathers and for every kilogram of mushrooms produced 5 kg of byproducts containing chitosan are generated these poultry agricultural wastes are disposed off either as landfill or burnt processed which are not ecofriendly the authors investigated and reported the efficiency of composites made of natural and abundantly available discarded dromaius novaehollandiae eggshells dnes dromaius novaehollandiae feathers dnf and chitosan for the removal copper from aqueous solutions anantha and kota 2015b 2016 the addition of chitosan ch processed from white mushroom agaricus bisporus to the poultry waste eggshells feathers forms a composite which enhances the functional groups aiding in biosorption the present study is aimed at a comparative assessment in the sorption of copper by chitosan gallus domesticus eggshell ch gdes chitosan dromaius novaehollandiae eggshell ch dnes and chitosan dromaius novaehollandiae feather ch dnf composites with three independent parameters viz adsorbent dosage initial metal concentration and ph at three levels a full factorial design of rsm was applied the kinetic isotherm and thermodynamic parameters were calculated from pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models and langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich and van t hoff equations respectively before and after adsorption of copper the characterization of adsorbents was accomplished by brunauer emmett teller bet scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds fourier transform infra red spectroscopy ftir and x ray diffraction xrd 2 experimental 2 1 adsorbent chitosan from agaricus bisporus used for the synthesis of composites was purchased from sigma aldrich 740179 india eggshells of gallus domesticus gdes dromaius novaehollandiae dnes and feathers of dromaius novaehollandiae dnf were collected from poultry processing facilities of bapatla a small town in the state of andhra pradesh india to remove dirt particles shells and feathers were washed with deionized water and dried at room temperature the eggshells were then ground in a ball mill sieved with british standard sieves bss into particles of 53 µm size barbs 1 5 cm length were collected by removing shaft from feathers for the preparation of ch gdes ch dnes ch dnf composites first the eggshells feathers of gallus domesticus dromaius novaehollandiae were treated with 2 aqueous acetic acid followed by 2 nahco3 for neutralization then the neutralized adsorbents gdes dnes dnf were added to chitosan in 10 acetic acid solution and the mixture was finally dropped into an alkaline coagulant solution h2o meoh naoh 5 4 1 w w the ratio of chitosan to eggshells feathers was maintained as 1 5 the composite ch gdes ch dnes ch dnf were then washed with distilled water air dried and stored in air tight containers for experimental use anantha and kota 2015b 2016 2 2 adsorbate the adsorbate was prepared by dissolving 3 798 g of cu no3 2 3h2o in 250 ml of deionized water and diluted to 1 liter in a volumetric flask stock solution was used to prepare test solutions and the ph was adjusted to the appropriate value by using 0 1 n hno3 or 0 1 n naoh solutions all chemicals used were of analytical grade 2 3 sorption kinetics isotherms and thermodynamic studies the adsorption experimental studies viz kinetic isotherm and thermodynamics of the three composites were carried out using one variable at a time method initially table 1 in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks by contacting 300 mg of adsorbent with 50 ml of 20 mg l of copper solution then the flasks were agitated at 180 rpm and 30 c temperature on an orbital shaker remi make cis 24bl to assess the effect of contact time at definite time intervals of 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 and 90 min samples were taken to investigate the effect of ph initial copper ion concentration adsorbent dosage and temperature the parameters were varied in the range of 2 9 20 100 mg l 150 450 mg and 10 c 50 c respectively all the experiments were conducted in duplicate and the mean values were reported using atomic absorption spectrophotometer shimadzu make aa 6300 with copper hallow cathode lamp and air acetylene flame at a wavelength of 324 8 nm the concentration of adsorbate was measured the removal of metal was obtained by the following equation 1 percentage removal of metal c o c e c o 100 where co is the initial metal concentration and ce is the metal concentration in solution after adsorption 2 3 1 determination of point of zero charge pzc a series of erlenmeyer flasks each containing 20 ml of 0 01 m kno3 solution were taken and the initial ph pho of the solution was adjusted in the range between 2 and 9 by addition of 1m hcl or 1m naoh solution then 0 1 g sorbent was added and agitated for 24 h under atmospheric conditions after agitation the final ph values phf of the supernatant were measured the difference between the initial and the final ph δph values δph pho phf was plotted against the initial ph the point of intersection of the resulting curve on x axis pho denoted the point of zero charge 2 4 full factorial design and statistical analysis to optimize the copper adsorption by ch gdes ch dnes anantha and kota 2016 and ch dnf composites anantha and kota 2015b a three level full factorial design of rsm was applied based on the adsorption capacities of individual poultry wastes viz eggshells and feathers experiments with three different sets of initial adsorbent dosages x1 5 6 and 7 g l ch gdes composite 7 8 and 9 g l ch dnes composite and 6 7 and 8 g l ch dnf composite were employed simultaneously according to the design initial metal concentrations x2 were 15 20 and 25 mg l and initial ph values x3 were 5 6 and 7 the process parameters were determined by the equation 2 x i x i x o δ x xi is the coded value of the ith variable xi is the uncoded value of the ith test variable and xo is the uncoded value of the ith test variable at the center point the coded and the real values of the variables with adsorption residuals and error for ch dnes composite anantha and kota 2016 ch dnf composite anantha and kota 2015b were reported the same for ch gdes composite are given in table s1 for analysis of the experimental design the polynomial second order equation employed was 3 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β ii x i 2 i 1 k 1 j 2 k β ij x i x j statistical analyses of the experimental results were performed using design expert 9 trial version using fmincon function of matlab 2008 regression equation was solved surface plots were drawn using the optimum values 2 5 analysis of the composites ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf before and after sorption of copper the surface properties of the adsorbent were determined by sem evo 18 make carl zeiss equipped with an eds oxford instrument inca facility the composites were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to know the main functional groups and their interactions with the metal ions x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406a was used for the measurement of 2θ angles in the scanning range of 5 100 at a scanning speed of 19 685 s 1 a bet surface analyzer quantachrome nova 2000 was used to measure nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 35 k for measurement of surface characteristics viz surface area total pore volume and pore radius 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of composites 3 1 1 sem eds analysis sem analyses of the biosorbent materials ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites before and after adsorption of copper demonstrated marked differences before adsorption the surface of the ch gdes composite was homogeneous smooth and porous in nature fig s1a while after adsorption of copper the surface was uneven and heterogeneous in nature fig s1b similar to ch dnes composite fig s1d these findings are in correlation with the sem analysis of natural eggshells reported to have dense and porous surface texture putra et al 2014 and nonporous pure chitosan with smooth membranous phase consisting of dome shaped orifices microfibrils and crystallite kumar and koh 2012 after adsorption of metal the surface of the eggshell may become rough and irregular with angular pattern of fractures flake like and cube like deposits or formation of a thin layer due to deposition of metal ions and consequent obscurity of protruberances of eggshell surface ahmad et al 2012 fazal and rafique 2013 mohammadnezhad et al 2016 in ch dnf composite the feather morphology was clear with barbs and barbules before adsorption fig s1e while after adsorption of copper the distinction between the barbs and barbules is lost and the shrinkage was obvious fig s1f before adsorption the metals mg na k mn zn fe al sr etc and the elements n p were apparent from the eds analysis of the composites after adsorption of copper all the three composites showed the presence of copper ions fig 1b fig s2b and fig s2d a concomitant decrease in the percentages of mn fe ch gdes composite mg na and zn ch dnes composite as se and cd ch dnf composite and absence of na in all composites suggests that the adsorption of copper by the composites may also include the ion exchange mechanism in which copper replaced most of the positively charged ions 3 1 2 ftir analysis the adsorption mechanism was investigated using ftir analysis of native gdes dnes dnf ch gdes ch dnes ch dnf and metal loaded ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 figs s3a c spectra of the composites obtained by ftir before and after adsorption of copper showed remarkable variations and the groups assigned for adsorption are as given in table 2 the functional groups present in native materials gdes dnes dnf slightly shifted in the synthesized composites with chitosan table 2 in the ftir spectrum obtained for ch gdes composite after interaction with copper metal ion a major shift of the peak at 3356 cm 1 in to a sharp and wide peak at 3337 cm 1 and the appearance of an extra peak at 3089 cm 1 suggest the fact that both o and n atoms present on the adsorbent surface played a significant role in binding metal ions in ch dnes composite the bands at 3357 and 3304 cm 1 changed to sharp bands at 3376 and 3338 cm 1 respectively anantha and kota 2016 in the case of ch dnf composite the wide bands at 3365 cm 1 and 3290 cm 1 shifted to narrow bands at 3377 cm 1 and 3341 cm 1 respectively anantha and kota 2015b a slight shift of the peak at 651 cm 1 to 639 cm 1 is indicative of cu o stretching in the copper loaded gdes ch composite after adsorption of copper deviations showed by dnf ch composite in the absorption peaks at 630 700 cm 1 are indicative of cu o stretching anantha and kota 2015b the bands corresponding to the o h n h bonds c n stretching n h bending vibration and c n amines were widened more in ch gdes composite after adsorption of copper than ch dnes and ch dnf composites this is one of the reasons for more adsorption capacity of copper by ch gdes composite than ch dnes and ch dnf composites 3 1 3 xrd analysis the native ch gdes composite x ray diffractogram exhibited crystalline nature with sharp peaks at 2θ positions 28 30 33 34 36 37 40 43 45 48 49 52 53 56 58 61 65 66 73 84 and 95 fig s4b tavangar et al 2011 and islam et al 2011 reported that the eggshells and the chitosan show the diffraction peak at 2θ position 30 and 21 respectively symbolizing the crystalline calcite and the crystalline nature of chitosan copper treated ch gdes composite x ray diffractogram fig s4a showed broad peaks and the peak at 49 89 jcpds copper 04 0836 suggests the presence of copper while the peaks at 2θ positions of 48 96 58 56 62 1 and 65 96 jcpds cuo 80 1916 indicate the formation of cuo on the adsorbent in the native ch dnes x ray diffractogram less number of peaks at 2θ positions 29 34 44 48 49 58 61 65 74 82 84 94 95 and 100 were observed fig s4b the ch dnf x ray diffractogram exhibited crystalline nature and showed sharp peaks at 2θ positions 9 18 20 28 29 32 34 36 37 40 44 46 48 51 52 55 58 and 71 fig s4b the first two peaks of the ch dnf composite could be correlated to the α helix and the β sheet of keratin protein secondary structure with prominent peaks at 2θ positions 9 9 and 19 respectively zhao et al 2012 the presence of sharp peaks in the native adsorbent while their absence reduction in copper treated adsorbent as evidenced by sem analysis are suggestive of the adsorption of copper 3 1 4 bet surface analysis some of the surface properties viz surface area pore volume and pore radius of the ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites were measured using nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and are represented in table 3 out of the two eggshell composites ch gdes 11 315 m2 g had a higher surface area than ch dnes 8 212 m2 g composite leading to the higher adsorption of copper in contrast to the ch dnf composite 33 176 m2 g with less number of functional groups for binding of copper the micropore surface area of the ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites are 11 478 m2 g 8 403 m2 g and 43 316 m2 g respectively brunauer emmett and teller bet analysis of the naoh modified a bisporus had a specific surface area of 1 55 m2 g with an average pore diameter of 5 23 nm crini and badot 2008 putra et al 2014 reported the surface area and the pore diameter of the eggshell particles as 6 5 m2 g and 11 4 nm respectively by bet analysis from bjh method the surface area pore volume and pore diameter of eggshells are reported to be 44 32 m2 g 0 08cc g and 3 544 respectively fazal and rafique 2013 3 2 effect of contact time adsorption of copper by the three composites as a function of time is depicted in fig 2a the removal efficiencies of copper by ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf reached equilibrium at 50 60 anantha and kota 2016 and 70 min anantha and kota 2015b respectively thus copper adsorption by ch gdes composite is more efficient than by ch dnes and ch dnf composites in the initial stages sorption of copper increased rapidly due to the availability of binding sites on the adsorbent the attainment of equilibrium indicates the utilization of more readily available adsorbing sites especially carboxyl carbonyl hydroxyl and amino groups present on the surfaces of the composites the optimum contact times of ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites obtained in the present study were in the order of 50 60 and 70 min saber samandari et al 2013 and nabil and sameer 2009 used cellulose graft polyacrylamide hydroxyapatite and chick eggshells as adsorbents and reported the optimal contact times for removal of copper as 24 h and 2½ h respectively a much longer time period than the reported period in the current study 3 3 effect of ph the effects of initial ph on the adsorption of copper by the composites ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf were evaluated within the ph range of 2 9 the ph of the aqueous metal solution is a crucial parameter in the sorption and affects adsorbent surface charge ionization and solubility of the adsorbate in the solution the phpzc point of zero charge for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites were 5 4 7 and 4 4 respectively fig 2b indicating that the surfaces of the adsorbents were positively charged at solution ph below phpzc and that at ph higher than phpzc the surface of the adsorbents were deprotonated the optimum ph for highest adsorption of copper with the three adsorbents was found to be 6 with maximum copper removal of 95 5 94 47 anantha and kota 2016 and 91 41 anantha and kota 2015b for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites respectively fig 2c and this is in agreement with the earlier research reports rafatullah et al 2010 chen et al 2012 adsorption was low at strong acidic medium and increased with increase in ph from 2 to 6 due to the weak inhibitory effect of h3o ions and ion exchange mechanisms habib et al 2007 the adsorption increased at ph 6 3 4 effect of initial metal ion concentration the maximum percentage removal of copper by ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites observed were 95 5 94 47 and 91 41 respectively when the initial copper concentration was 20 mg l fig 2d when copper ion concentration increased from 20 mg l to 100 mg l the metal uptake capacity of ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf increased from 3 1 to 15 6 mg g 3 1 to 15 4 mg g and 3 to 14 5 mg g respectively a higher initial concentration provided an important driving force to overcome all mass transfer resistances of copper and thus increased the uptake aksu and tezer 2005 3 5 effect of adsorbent dosage the percentage removal of copper and metal uptake by ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites at different adsorbent doses is presented in fig 2e experimental studies were carried out at 30 c temperature with an initial metal concentration of 20 mg l at ph 6 the removal of copper increased rapidly from 92 21 to 95 5 89 215 to 94 51 and 87 21 to 93 1 with an increase in adsorbent dose from 3 to 6 g l 3 8 g l and 3 7 g l by ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites respectively due to the increased surface area of the adsorbent material and the number of binding sites with further increase in the adsorbent dosage the percentage of adsorption remained constant after attaining the equilibrium the increase in adsorbent dosage did not show any significant change in the adsorption rate witek krowiak et al 2011 3 6 effect of temperature the relationship between temperature and copper uptake onto composites is depicted in fig 2f the adsorption of copper increased from 94 55 to 96 2 93 43 to 95 06 and 92 16 to 93 67 for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf respectively with increasing temperature from 10 c to 50 c at an initial concentration of 20 mg l attributed to increase in the mobility of copper ions with temperature with increase in temperature adsorption increases due to diffusion of the adsorbate molecules on to the adsorbent 3 7 sorption kinetics kinetic studies were carried out in order to understand the behaviour of composites towards copper metal to know the mechanisms controlling the adsorption of copper and to test the experimental data pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion kinetic models were used and their respective equations are as given below 4 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t 6 q t k int t 1 2 c where qe and qt are the amount of metal adsorbed at equilibrium and at time t k1 k2 and kint are the rate constants of pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion respectively and c is the boundary layer thickness the kinetic plots for pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion are given in figs s5a c of supplementary material the rate constants and correlation coefficients are indicated in table 4 the experimental qe is similar to the calculated qe from the pseudo second order kinetic model for the three composites indicating that the adsorption of metal ions by the composites could be by chemisorption in the plot depicting intra particle diffusion the line did not pass through the origin suggesting that it is not the rate limiting model the correlation coefficient for the pseudo second order model is higher than pseudo first order and intra particle diffusion models suggesting a chemisorption process 3 8 adsorption isotherms the experimental data were tested and compared with the four isotherm models langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich fig 3a d and the respective non linear equations are as follows 7 q e q max b c e 1 b c e 8 q e k f c e 1 n 9 q e rt ln a t c e b t 10 ln q e ln q m β ε 2 where qmax is the maximum uptake capacity when the surface is completely covered with metal ions mg g b is a constant and indicates the affinity between the adsorbent and the metal ion ml mg kf is freundlich capacity constant mg g n is the affinity constant at l mg and bt are temkin isothermal constants r is the gas constant β is the activity coefficient related to the mean sorption energy mol2 kj2 and ε is the polanyi potential kj mol isothermal model parameters are calculated from the non linear equations for the three composites w r t the adsorption of copper and presented in table 5 the isothermal equations for the three composites are given in table s2 to find out the best fit isotherm the non linear chi square test statistic χ2 11 χ 2 σ q e exp q e cal 2 q e cal where qe exp qe cal are experimental and calculated values of adsorption capacity respectively was used from error analysis the best isotherm model for all the three composites was found as the langmuir due to its lower χ2 value table 5 followed by temkin freundlich and dubinin radushkevich isothermal models the best isotherm model for adsorption of copper by the three composites is identified as the langmuir due to its lowest chi square χ2 test characteristic value suggestive of corroboration of the experimental data with the calculated data and the higher qmax value model parameters obtained for three composites table 5 show that ch gdes is more potential adsorbent than ch dnes and ch dnf for the adsorption of copper 3 9 thermodynamic studies the nature of adsorption was inferred from the thermodynamic parameters viz gibbs free energy δg entropy δs and enthalpy δh the thermodynamic equation for the determination of gibbs free energy is 12 g o h o t s o the following van t hoff equation was used to evaluate thermodynamic parameters 13 log q e c e h 2 303 rt s 2 303 r van t hoff plot is represented in fig 4 the experimental δh for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites were 7 58 kj mol 5 74 kj mol and 4 51 kj mol respectively indicating the adsorption process as endothermic the δs values were 35 49 kj mol k 25 81 kj mol k and 20 31 kj mol k for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites respectively suggesting that some structural changes occurred on the adsorbent with increase in temperature 10 c 50 c the gibbs free energy change δg increased and it suggests the spontaneous nature of the sorption of copper on to the composites the sticking probability s measures the relationship of adsorbate and adsorbent systems in which first the adsorbate is trapped on the adsorbent and then adsorbs chemically the equation is given as s 1 θ e e a rt where θ is surface coverage area and ea is activation energy θ 1 c e c o where ce and co are equilibrium and initial concentrations of copper respectively from the plot of log 1 θ versus 1 t ea and s are calculated from the slope and intercept respectively the near unity values of s viz 1 04 1 03 1 02 for ch gdes ch dnes ch dnf in the order reveal that the adsorption of copper by the composites is initially by physiosorption at the experimental temperatures of 10 c 50 c fig s6 from the observations of the current and previous studies it is evident that copper sorption by ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites could occur by one or more of the three types of reaction mechanisms viz surface adsorption gao et al 2014 complexation and chemisorption manshourim et al 2013 vimala and das 2009 3 10 comparison of adsorption capacities the preliminary studies on adsorption showed that the adsorption capacities of gallus domesticus eggshells dromaius novaehollandiae eggshells dromaius novaehollandiae feathers and chitosan were 35 71 mg g 32 15 mg g 29 76 mg g and 16 1 mg g respectively adsorption capacities qmax of a few other reported adsorbents such as pseudomonas aeruginosa tuzen et al 2008 saw dust grimm et al 2008 wheat bran wang et al 2009 chitosan supported on porous glass beads shen et al 2013 n hap n hap chitin n hapc composite and n hap chitosan n hapcs composite rajiv gandhi et al 2011 cellulose graft polyacrylamide hydroxyapatite saber samandari et al 2013 potato solanum tuberosum leaf powder moyo et al 2016 porous geopolymeric spheres ge et al 2015 dromaius novaehollandiae feathers anantha and kota 2015a for copper were 5 83 mg g 4 9 mg g 8 62 mg g 7 27 mg g 4 7 mg g 5 4 mg g 6 2 mg g and 175 mg g 42 74 mg g 45 4 mg g 29 76 mg g respectively revealing that the ch gdes 56 49 mg g ch dnes 48 3 mg g and ch dnf 39 06 mg g composites are very effective and efficient for the adsorption of copper the composites used in the present study are easy to prepare and involve inexpensive chemical reagents these can be implemented at large scale treatment of contaminated waters from various effluent outlets 3 11 statistical analysis with the experimental findings from the batch sorption a three level full factorial design under rsm was carried out by varying the levels of adsorbent dosage metal ion concentration and ph the actual and the coded values of the test variables for ch gdes are as given in table s1 for ch dnes composite anantha and kota 2016 and ch dnf composite anantha and kota 2015b the cited references to be viewed for adsorption of copper by ch gdes composite eq 14 the following regression equation was obtained 14 y 96 53 3 75 x 1 1 08 x 2 0 37 x 3 8 33 x 1 x 2 2 60 x 1 x 3 0 99 x 2 x 3 18 20 x 1 2 3 38 x 2 2 1 06 x 3 2 where y is the adsorption of copper x1 adsorbent dosage x2 is the metal ion concentration and x3 is the ph solving the regression equation the optimum adsorbent dosage metal ion concentration and ph were identified as 5 9098 g l 19 9579 mg l and 5 95 respectively for maximum copper sorption by ch gdes composite similarly optimum values for adsorbent dosage metal ion concentration and ph are 7 90 g l 20 2651 mg l and 5 906 respectively for ch dnes composite anantha and kota 2016 and for ch dnf composite anantha and kota 2015b the three factors in order are 6 93 g l 19 7748 mg l and 7 respectively the optimum values suggest that the adsorbent dosage is low for ch gdes composite followed by ch dnf and ch dnes in increasing order surface plots for ch gdes composite fig 5a c ch dnes composite fig s7a c and ch dnf composite fig s7d f were drawn to know the interactive effects of adsorption variables on percentage removal of copper each response plot represents combinations of two of the three test factors x1 x2 x3 in coded value ranging between 1 to 1 through 0 with the third factor maintained at the mid point table s1 the percentage removal of copper indicated by the surface confined in the smallest curve circular or elliptical of each of the response plots of the composites of ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf suggests that all the three chosen variables viz the adsorbent dosage initial metal concentration and ph influenced the adsorption process 3 12 regression analysis and interpretation the fischer s statistical test for analysis of variance anova yielded a f value of 101 7 46 25 anantha and kota 2016 and 35 3 anantha and kota 2015b for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites respectively a low p value p 0 0001 was obtained for all the three composites indicating the significance of the model table 6 s3 determination coefficient r2 nearer to unity viz 0 9807 0 9585 and 0 9464 for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites respectively indicates that only 1 93 ch gdes 4 15 ch dnes and 5 36 ch dnf of the total variations are not explained by the model suggesting the quadratic model as the best fit high values of r2 and f for adsorption of copper the predicted r2 of 0 9513 for ch gdes composite is in reasonable agreement with the adjusted r2 of 0 9711 difference is less than 0 2 similarly the predicted r2 of 0 8977 0 8685 are in reasonable agreement with the adjusted r2 of 0 9378 0 9196 for ch dnes anantha and kota 2016 and ch dnf composite anantha and kota 2015b respectively 4 conclusions initially one variable at a time experiments were conducted for adsorption of copper by varying parameters like contact time adsorbate ph adsorbate concentration adsorbent dosage and temperature due to the abundant active functional groups on the ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites equilibrium was attained at 50 min 60 min and 70 min of contact time respectively percentage removal of copper from aqueous solution increased significantly with increase in ph from 4 to 6 and the desired ph value for adsorption was found to be 6 0 for the composites under study higher qmax values of 56 4971 mg g 48 3091 mg g and 39 06 mg g were obtained for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites respectively the removal of copper attained equilibrium at adsorbent dosages of 6 g l ch gdes 8 g l ch dnes and 7 g l ch dnf the results of the present study demonstrate that the selected composites are effective and facilitate low cost treatment of the industrial waste water and ground water containing copper to save the valuable ground water from contamination these economic and eco friendly composites could be used to remove copper present in the effluent discharges from different sources acknowledgements ark

12361,metal cleaning and plating baths pulp paper board mills printed circuit board and wood pulp production fertilizer industry etc are releasing copper into the environment and seriously affecting the quality of drinking water even minute quantity of copper 1 3 ppm in water is detrimental to biota therefore abundantly available poultry and agricultural wastes are tested as adsorbents for the removal of copper leading to sustainable management of wastes and improving the quality of water sorption capacities of chitosan gallus domesticus eggshell chitosan dromaius novaehollandiae eggshell ch gdes ch dnes and chitosan dromaius novaehollandiae feather ch dnf composites were first evaluated for copper removal from aqueous solution by one variable at a time method and further experiments were carried out by a three level full factorial design of response surface methodology rsm the percent removal of copper by the composites increased with the increase in contact time and the kinetics best fitted to the pseudo second order model the optimum ph of the aqueous solution was found to be 6 for the removal of copper for all the three composites the experimental data of initial metal ion concentration was fitted using langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich adsorption isotherm models and the better suited is langmuir s isotherm model chitosan gallus domesticus eggshell composite showed the highest metal uptake potential of copper qmax 56 49 mg g thermodynamically copper adsorption onto the bio composites is inferred as spontaneous irreversible and endothermic in nature characterization of the adsorbents by sem eds ftir xrd and bet before and after adsorption of copper revealed that the sorption is due to the mechanisms of chemisorption ion exchange and or complexation the adsorbent pads filters made of natural renewable biopolymer composites like ch gdes ch dnes ch dnf can be placed at the source to prevent bulk water pollution with copper and maintain the concentration well below the permissible limits in the ground water graphical abstract fx1 keywords eggshells feathers composite sorption copper response surface 1 introduction groundwater is an important renewable resource for agricultural and industrial uses and also as potable water in india the improper disposal of waste water by the industries and human activities are creating the water pollution and deteriorating the quality of water in recent years one of the most serious developmental issues is the scarcity of clean and potable drinking water in many states of india viz west bengal andhra pradesh western uttar pradesh jharkhand orissa rajasthan and punjab tiwari and singh 2014 in the goa mining region and khetri copper mine region of india the ground water is unsuitable for drinking due to the excess levels of heavy metals like copper zinc iron cobalt lead etc gurdeep and kamal 2017 punia and siva siddaiah 2017 copper manganese chromium cadmium lead mercury etc are known to be highly toxic metals and their removal from wastewater is of great interest in the field of water pollution remediation out of different heavy metals copper is most widely used and the consumption was approximately 20 6 million short tons c d a 2015 in 2014 a fraction of copper is released from the industries viz iron and steel production electroplating electrical and electronics printing and photograph but the major sources of copper release into the environment are the water coming from the mines and the other sources are combustion processes wood production phosphate fertilizer production and natural sources viz windblown dust decaying vegetation forest fires sea sprays volcanoes etc elevated levels of copper in drinking water causes immediate effects like vomiting diarrhoea stomach cramps and nausea in more than 20 developed countries excess concentration of copper causing gastrointestinal problems kidney damage anaemia and lung cancers are reported babu rao et al 2016 us epa and who organizations recommended that the copper concentration in drinking water should not exceed 1 3 ppm johnson et al 2002 due to increased demand prices of copper capture of copper from waste streams and recycling is necessary from both ecological and economical point of view for removal of high concentrations of copper the methods processes in use are chemical precipitation chen et al 2009 fu and wang 2011 eg hydroxide sulphide or chelating precipitation which is not economically feasible and produces huge amounts of sludge ion exchange that employs expensive resins whose regeneration causes secondary pollution mautner et al 2016 adsorption using materials like activated carbon feitoza et al 2014 which is restricted due to high cost while low cost adsorbents from industrial waste streams bio adsorbents are limited because of their adsorption efficiencies coagulation flocculation fu and wang 2011 involve chemical consumption and sludge generation floatation involves high initial capital maintenance and operational costs qdais and moussa 2004 and electrochemical treatment restricted due to expensive electricity supply akar et al 2009 biosorption is cost effective and ecofriendly and a few of the biosorbents investigated for the removal of copper include microorganisms viz bacteria arul manikandan et al 2014 batool et al 2014 fungi chew and ting 2016 algae tran et al 2016 teimouri et al 2016 and sea weeds huang and lin 2015 some agricultural wastes like biochar of pristine softwood pine and hardwood jarrah and potato jin et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 moyo et al 2016 were tested as biosorbents biological wastes like bird egg shells feathers yang et al 2007 anantha and kota 2012 2015a manshourim et al 2013 hassan and aigbodion 2015 fish scales prabhu et al 2012 shells of water snails shrimp hossain and aditya 2015 mohanasrinivasan et al 2014 etc have also been used for the said purpose and were found to be effective several synthetic polymer composites like polyaniline chitin cellulose nanofibrils modified with pei benzidine based microporous polymer magnetic graphene oxide supported cyclodextrin karthik and meenakshi 2016 zhang et al 2016 taskin et al 2016 hu et al 2015 etc are reported to be effective in the removal of heavy metals similarly keratin from chick feathers and wool has been used in making composites due to the importance in textiles cell cultivation and medicine tanabe et al 2002 tachibana et al 2005 balaji et al 2012 tran and mututuvari 2015 cellulose graft polyacrylamide hydroxyapatite saber samandari et al 2013 n hap n hap chitin n hapc composite and n hap chitosan n hapcs composite rajiv gandhi et al 2011 are some of the hap based synthesized composites that had the common drawbacks of inconvenience to separation use of a number of chemicals reagents which in turn cause environmental pollution and difficulties in the disposal of used composites in order to eliminate these disadvantages renewable composites were prepared using the wastes from poultry and agriculture like chitosan eggshells and feathers for adsorption of copper in the present study the proposed composites have the desired characteristics for a wide range of applications in sustainable management of waste and groundwater recovery of copper and effluent treatment the top ten egg producing

and release tons of eggshells as wastes the approximate production of agaricus bisporous an edible mushroom is about 13 6 million tons per year similarly annually from poultry processing and agricultural industries 8 5 billion tons of feathers and for every kilogram of mushrooms produced 5 kg of byproducts containing chitosan are generated these poultry agricultural wastes are disposed off either as landfill or burnt processed which are not ecofriendly the authors investigated and reported the efficiency of composites made of natural and abundantly available discarded dromaius novaehollandiae eggshells dnes dromaius novaehollandiae feathers dnf and chitosan for the removal copper from aqueous solutions anantha and kota 2015b 2016 the addition of chitosan ch processed from white mushroom agaricus bisporus to the poultry waste eggshells feathers forms a composite which enhances the functional groups aiding in biosorption the present study is aimed at a comparative assessment in the sorption of copper by chitosan gallus domesticus eggshell ch gdes chitosan dromaius novaehollandiae eggshell ch dnes and chitosan dromaius novaehollandiae feather ch dnf composites with three independent parameters viz adsorbent dosage initial metal concentration and ph at three levels a full factorial design of rsm was applied the kinetic isotherm and thermodynamic parameters were calculated from pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models and langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich and van t hoff equations respectively before and after adsorption of copper the characterization of adsorbents was accomplished by brunauer emmett teller bet scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds fourier transform infra red spectroscopy ftir and x ray diffraction xrd 2 experimental 2 1 adsorbent chitosan from agaricus bisporus used for the synthesis of composites was purchased from sigma aldrich 740179 india eggshells of gallus domesticus gdes dromaius novaehollandiae dnes and feathers of dromaius novaehollandiae dnf were collected from poultry processing facilities of bapatla a small town in the state of andhra pradesh india to remove dirt particles shells and feathers were washed with deionized water and dried at room temperature the eggshells were then ground in a ball mill sieved with british standard sieves bss into particles of 53 µm size barbs 1 5 cm length were collected by removing shaft from feathers for the preparation of ch gdes ch dnes ch dnf composites first the eggshells feathers of gallus domesticus dromaius novaehollandiae were treated with 2 aqueous acetic acid followed by 2 nahco3 for neutralization then the neutralized adsorbents gdes dnes dnf were added to chitosan in 10 acetic acid solution and the mixture was finally dropped into an alkaline coagulant solution h2o meoh naoh 5 4 1 w w the ratio of chitosan to eggshells feathers was maintained as 1 5 the composite ch gdes ch dnes ch dnf were then washed with distilled water air dried and stored in air tight containers for experimental use anantha and kota 2015b 2016 2 2 adsorbate the adsorbate was prepared by dissolving 3 798 g of cu no3 2 3h2o in 250 ml of deionized water and diluted to 1 liter in a volumetric flask stock solution was used to prepare test solutions and the ph was adjusted to the appropriate value by using 0 1 n hno3 or 0 1 n naoh solutions all chemicals used were of analytical grade 2 3 sorption kinetics isotherms and thermodynamic studies the adsorption experimental studies viz kinetic isotherm and thermodynamics of the three composites were carried out using one variable at a time method initially table 1 in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks by contacting 300 mg of adsorbent with 50 ml of 20 mg l of copper solution then the flasks were agitated at 180 rpm and 30 c temperature on an orbital shaker remi make cis 24bl to assess the effect of contact time at definite time intervals of 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 and 90 min samples were taken to investigate the effect of ph initial copper ion concentration adsorbent dosage and temperature the parameters were varied in the range of 2 9 20 100 mg l 150 450 mg and 10 c 50 c respectively all the experiments were conducted in duplicate and the mean values were reported using atomic absorption spectrophotometer shimadzu make aa 6300 with copper hallow cathode lamp and air acetylene flame at a wavelength of 324 8 nm the concentration of adsorbate was measured the removal of metal was obtained by the following equation 1 percentage removal of metal c o c e c o 100 where co is the initial metal concentration and ce is the metal concentration in solution after adsorption 2 3 1 determination of point of zero charge pzc a series of erlenmeyer flasks each containing 20 ml of 0 01 m kno3 solution were taken and the initial ph pho of the solution was adjusted in the range between 2 and 9 by addition of 1m hcl or 1m naoh solution then 0 1 g sorbent was added and agitated for 24 h under atmospheric conditions after agitation the final ph values phf of the supernatant were measured the difference between the initial and the final ph δph values δph pho phf was plotted against the initial ph the point of intersection of the resulting curve on x axis pho denoted the point of zero charge 2 4 full factorial design and statistical analysis to optimize the copper adsorption by ch gdes ch dnes anantha and kota 2016 and ch dnf composites anantha and kota 2015b a three level full factorial design of rsm was applied based on the adsorption capacities of individual poultry wastes viz eggshells and feathers experiments with three different sets of initial adsorbent dosages x1 5 6 and 7 g l ch gdes composite 7 8 and 9 g l ch dnes composite and 6 7 and 8 g l ch dnf composite were employed simultaneously according to the design initial metal concentrations x2 were 15 20 and 25 mg l and initial ph values x3 were 5 6 and 7 the process parameters were determined by the equation 2 x i x i x o δ x xi is the coded value of the ith variable xi is the uncoded value of the ith test variable and xo is the uncoded value of the ith test variable at the center point the coded and the real values of the variables with adsorption residuals and error for ch dnes composite anantha and kota 2016 ch dnf composite anantha and kota 2015b were reported the same for ch gdes composite are given in table s1 for analysis of the experimental design the polynomial second order equation employed was 3 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β ii x i 2 i 1 k 1 j 2 k β ij x i x j statistical analyses of the experimental results were performed using design expert 9 trial version using fmincon function of matlab 2008 regression equation was solved surface plots were drawn using the optimum values 2 5 analysis of the composites ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf before and after sorption of copper the surface properties of the adsorbent were determined by sem evo 18 make carl zeiss equipped with an eds oxford instrument inca facility the composites were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to know the main functional groups and their interactions with the metal ions x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406a was used for the measurement of 2θ angles in the scanning range of 5 100 at a scanning speed of 19 685 s 1 a bet surface analyzer quantachrome nova 2000 was used to measure nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms at 77 35 k for measurement of surface characteristics viz surface area total pore volume and pore radius 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of composites 3 1 1 sem eds analysis sem analyses of the biosorbent materials ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites before and after adsorption of copper demonstrated marked differences before adsorption the surface of the ch gdes composite was homogeneous smooth and porous in nature fig s1a while after adsorption of copper the surface was uneven and heterogeneous in nature fig s1b similar to ch dnes composite fig s1d these findings are in correlation with the sem analysis of natural eggshells reported to have dense and porous surface texture putra et al 2014 and nonporous pure chitosan with smooth membranous phase consisting of dome shaped orifices microfibrils and crystallite kumar and koh 2012 after adsorption of metal the surface of the eggshell may become rough and irregular with angular pattern of fractures flake like and cube like deposits or formation of a thin layer due to deposition of metal ions and consequent obscurity of protruberances of eggshell surface ahmad et al 2012 fazal and rafique 2013 mohammadnezhad et al 2016 in ch dnf composite the feather morphology was clear with barbs and barbules before adsorption fig s1e while after adsorption of copper the distinction between the barbs and barbules is lost and the shrinkage was obvious fig s1f before adsorption the metals mg na k mn zn fe al sr etc and the elements n p were apparent from the eds analysis of the composites after adsorption of copper all the three composites showed the presence of copper ions fig 1b fig s2b and fig s2d a concomitant decrease in the percentages of mn fe ch gdes composite mg na and zn ch dnes composite as se and cd ch dnf composite and absence of na in all composites suggests that the adsorption of copper by the composites may also include the ion exchange mechanism in which copper replaced most of the positively charged ions 3 1 2 ftir analysis the adsorption mechanism was investigated using ftir analysis of native gdes dnes dnf ch gdes ch dnes ch dnf and metal loaded ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 figs s3a c spectra of the composites obtained by ftir before and after adsorption of copper showed remarkable variations and the groups assigned for adsorption are as given in table 2 the functional groups present in native materials gdes dnes dnf slightly shifted in the synthesized composites with chitosan table 2 in the ftir spectrum obtained for ch gdes composite after interaction with copper metal ion a major shift of the peak at 3356 cm 1 in to a sharp and wide peak at 3337 cm 1 and the appearance of an extra peak at 3089 cm 1 suggest the fact that both o and n atoms present on the adsorbent surface played a significant role in binding metal ions in ch dnes composite the bands at 3357 and 3304 cm 1 changed to sharp bands at 3376 and 3338 cm 1 respectively anantha and kota 2016 in the case of ch dnf composite the wide bands at 3365 cm 1 and 3290 cm 1 shifted to narrow bands at 3377 cm 1 and 3341 cm 1 respectively anantha and kota 2015b a slight shift of the peak at 651 cm 1 to 639 cm 1 is indicative of cu o stretching in the copper loaded gdes ch composite after adsorption of copper deviations showed by dnf ch composite in the absorption peaks at 630 700 cm 1 are indicative of cu o stretching anantha and kota 2015b the bands corresponding to the o h n h bonds c n stretching n h bending vibration and c n amines were widened more in ch gdes composite after adsorption of copper than ch dnes and ch dnf composites this is one of the reasons for more adsorption capacity of copper by ch gdes composite than ch dnes and ch dnf composites 3 1 3 xrd analysis the native ch gdes composite x ray diffractogram exhibited crystalline nature with sharp peaks at 2θ positions 28 30 33 34 36 37 40 43 45 48 49 52 53 56 58 61 65 66 73 84 and 95 fig s4b tavangar et al 2011 and islam et al 2011 reported that the eggshells and the chitosan show the diffraction peak at 2θ position 30 and 21 respectively symbolizing the crystalline calcite and the crystalline nature of chitosan copper treated ch gdes composite x ray diffractogram fig s4a showed broad peaks and the peak at 49 89 jcpds copper 04 0836 suggests the presence of copper while the peaks at 2θ positions of 48 96 58 56 62 1 and 65 96 jcpds cuo 80 1916 indicate the formation of cuo on the adsorbent in the native ch dnes x ray diffractogram less number of peaks at 2θ positions 29 34 44 48 49 58 61 65 74 82 84 94 95 and 100 were observed fig s4b the ch dnf x ray diffractogram exhibited crystalline nature and showed sharp peaks at 2θ positions 9 18 20 28 29 32 34 36 37 40 44 46 48 51 52 55 58 and 71 fig s4b the first two peaks of the ch dnf composite could be correlated to the α helix and the β sheet of keratin protein secondary structure with prominent peaks at 2θ positions 9 9 and 19 respectively zhao et al 2012 the presence of sharp peaks in the native adsorbent while their absence reduction in copper treated adsorbent as evidenced by sem analysis are suggestive of the adsorption of copper 3 1 4 bet surface analysis some of the surface properties viz surface area pore volume and pore radius of the ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites were measured using nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and are represented in table 3 out of the two eggshell composites ch gdes 11 315 m2 g had a higher surface area than ch dnes 8 212 m2 g composite leading to the higher adsorption of copper in contrast to the ch dnf composite 33 176 m2 g with less number of functional groups for binding of copper the micropore surface area of the ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites are 11 478 m2 g 8 403 m2 g and 43 316 m2 g respectively brunauer emmett and teller bet analysis of the naoh modified a bisporus had a specific surface area of 1 55 m2 g with an average pore diameter of 5 23 nm crini and badot 2008 putra et al 2014 reported the surface area and the pore diameter of the eggshell particles as 6 5 m2 g and 11 4 nm respectively by bet analysis from bjh method the surface area pore volume and pore diameter of eggshells are reported to be 44 32 m2 g 0 08cc g and 3 544 respectively fazal and rafique 2013 3 2 effect of contact time adsorption of copper by the three composites as a function of time is depicted in fig 2a the removal efficiencies of copper by ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf reached equilibrium at 50 60 anantha and kota 2016 and 70 min anantha and kota 2015b respectively thus copper adsorption by ch gdes composite is more efficient than by ch dnes and ch dnf composites in the initial stages sorption of copper increased rapidly due to the availability of binding sites on the adsorbent the attainment of equilibrium indicates the utilization of more readily available adsorbing sites especially carboxyl carbonyl hydroxyl and amino groups present on the surfaces of the composites the optimum contact times of ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites obtained in the present study were in the order of 50 60 and 70 min saber samandari et al 2013 and nabil and sameer 2009 used cellulose graft polyacrylamide hydroxyapatite and chick eggshells as adsorbents and reported the optimal contact times for removal of copper as 24 h and 2½ h respectively a much longer time period than the reported period in the current study 3 3 effect of ph the effects of initial ph on the adsorption of copper by the composites ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf were evaluated within the ph range of 2 9 the ph of the aqueous metal solution is a crucial parameter in the sorption and affects adsorbent surface charge ionization and solubility of the adsorbate in the solution the phpzc point of zero charge for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites were 5 4 7 and 4 4 respectively fig 2b indicating that the surfaces of the adsorbents were positively charged at solution ph below phpzc and that at ph higher than phpzc the surface of the adsorbents were deprotonated the optimum ph for highest adsorption of copper with the three adsorbents was found to be 6 with maximum copper removal of 95 5 94 47 anantha and kota 2016 and 91 41 anantha and kota 2015b for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites respectively fig 2c and this is in agreement with the earlier research reports rafatullah et al 2010 chen et al 2012 adsorption was low at strong acidic medium and increased with increase in ph from 2 to 6 due to the weak inhibitory effect of h3o ions and ion exchange mechanisms habib et al 2007 the adsorption increased at ph 6 3 4 effect of initial metal ion concentration the maximum percentage removal of copper by ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites observed were 95 5 94 47 and 91 41 respectively when the initial copper concentration was 20 mg l fig 2d when copper ion concentration increased from 20 mg l to 100 mg l the metal uptake capacity of ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf increased from 3 1 to 15 6 mg g 3 1 to 15 4 mg g and 3 to 14 5 mg g respectively a higher initial concentration provided an important driving force to overcome all mass transfer resistances of copper and thus increased the uptake aksu and tezer 2005 3 5 effect of adsorbent dosage the percentage removal of copper and metal uptake by ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites at different adsorbent doses is presented in fig 2e experimental studies were carried out at 30 c temperature with an initial metal concentration of 20 mg l at ph 6 the removal of copper increased rapidly from 92 21 to 95 5 89 215 to 94 51 and 87 21 to 93 1 with an increase in adsorbent dose from 3 to 6 g l 3 8 g l and 3 7 g l by ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites respectively due to the increased surface area of the adsorbent material and the number of binding sites with further increase in the adsorbent dosage the percentage of adsorption remained constant after attaining the equilibrium the increase in adsorbent dosage did not show any significant change in the adsorption rate witek krowiak et al 2011 3 6 effect of temperature the relationship between temperature and copper uptake onto composites is depicted in fig 2f the adsorption of copper increased from 94 55 to 96 2 93 43 to 95 06 and 92 16 to 93 67 for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf respectively with increasing temperature from 10 c to 50 c at an initial concentration of 20 mg l attributed to increase in the mobility of copper ions with temperature with increase in temperature adsorption increases due to diffusion of the adsorbate molecules on to the adsorbent 3 7 sorption kinetics kinetic studies were carried out in order to understand the behaviour of composites towards copper metal to know the mechanisms controlling the adsorption of copper and to test the experimental data pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion kinetic models were used and their respective equations are as given below 4 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t 6 q t k int t 1 2 c where qe and qt are the amount of metal adsorbed at equilibrium and at time t k1 k2 and kint are the rate constants of pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion respectively and c is the boundary layer thickness the kinetic plots for pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion are given in figs s5a c of supplementary material the rate constants and correlation coefficients are indicated in table 4 the experimental qe is similar to the calculated qe from the pseudo second order kinetic model for the three composites indicating that the adsorption of metal ions by the composites could be by chemisorption in the plot depicting intra particle diffusion the line did not pass through the origin suggesting that it is not the rate limiting model the correlation coefficient for the pseudo second order model is higher than pseudo first order and intra particle diffusion models suggesting a chemisorption process 3 8 adsorption isotherms the experimental data were tested and compared with the four isotherm models langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich fig 3a d and the respective non linear equations are as follows 7 q e q max b c e 1 b c e 8 q e k f c e 1 n 9 q e rt ln a t c e b t 10 ln q e ln q m β ε 2 where qmax is the maximum uptake capacity when the surface is completely covered with metal ions mg g b is a constant and indicates the affinity between the adsorbent and the metal ion ml mg kf is freundlich capacity constant mg g n is the affinity constant at l mg and bt are temkin isothermal constants r is the gas constant β is the activity coefficient related to the mean sorption energy mol2 kj2 and ε is the polanyi potential kj mol isothermal model parameters are calculated from the non linear equations for the three composites w r t the adsorption of copper and presented in table 5 the isothermal equations for the three composites are given in table s2 to find out the best fit isotherm the non linear chi square test statistic χ2 11 χ 2 σ q e exp q e cal 2 q e cal where qe exp qe cal are experimental and calculated values of adsorption capacity respectively was used from error analysis the best isotherm model for all the three composites was found as the langmuir due to its lower χ2 value table 5 followed by temkin freundlich and dubinin radushkevich isothermal models the best isotherm model for adsorption of copper by the three composites is identified as the langmuir due to its lowest chi square χ2 test characteristic value suggestive of corroboration of the experimental data with the calculated data and the higher qmax value model parameters obtained for three composites table 5 show that ch gdes is more potential adsorbent than ch dnes and ch dnf for the adsorption of copper 3 9 thermodynamic studies the nature of adsorption was inferred from the thermodynamic parameters viz gibbs free energy δg entropy δs and enthalpy δh the thermodynamic equation for the determination of gibbs free energy is 12 g o h o t s o the following van t hoff equation was used to evaluate thermodynamic parameters 13 log q e c e h 2 303 rt s 2 303 r van t hoff plot is represented in fig 4 the experimental δh for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites were 7 58 kj mol 5 74 kj mol and 4 51 kj mol respectively indicating the adsorption process as endothermic the δs values were 35 49 kj mol k 25 81 kj mol k and 20 31 kj mol k for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites respectively suggesting that some structural changes occurred on the adsorbent with increase in temperature 10 c 50 c the gibbs free energy change δg increased and it suggests the spontaneous nature of the sorption of copper on to the composites the sticking probability s measures the relationship of adsorbate and adsorbent systems in which first the adsorbate is trapped on the adsorbent and then adsorbs chemically the equation is given as s 1 θ e e a rt where θ is surface coverage area and ea is activation energy θ 1 c e c o where ce and co are equilibrium and initial concentrations of copper respectively from the plot of log

variance anova yielded a f value of 101 7 46 25 anantha and kota 2016 and 35 3 anantha and kota 2015b for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites respectively a low p value p 0 0001 was obtained for all the three composites indicating the significance of the model table 6 s3 determination coefficient r2 nearer to unity viz 0 9807 0 9585 and 0 9464 for ch gdes ch dnes and ch dnf composites respectively indicates that only 1 93 ch gdes 4 15 ch dnes and 5 36 ch dnf of the total variations are not explained by the model suggesting the quadratic model as the best fit high values of r2 and f for adsorption of copper the predicted r2 of 0 9513 for ch gdes composite is in reasonable agreement with the adjusted r2 of 0 9711 difference is less than 0 2 similarly the predicted r2 of 0 8977 0 8685 are in reasonable agreement with the adjusted r2 of 0 9378 0 9196 for ch dnes anantha and kota 2016 and ch dnf composite anantha and kota 2015b respectively 4 conclusions initially one variable

associated groundwater flow the topography climate biota and human activities were considered as main contributors to reflect the water availability in the area study predicted results from the numerical model were compared to field measurements of the runoff 2 methodology the methodology adopted in this study is based on estimating the groundwater recharge of wadi sudr catchment at the presence of a ponding area near the catchment outlet using hydrus 3d finite element analysis software šimůnek et al 2008 darcy s and richard s equations are the governing equations that were used in modeling the water flow in the unsaturated soil zone data collected involved climatic data topography soil properties and groundwater table level in order to identify the real components of the study area catchment area of the valley was delineated from satellite images using geographic information system gis tools the model output results were evaluated and analyzed to compare four scenarios 1 the original condition without using a ponding area during a dry year year 2011 2 a condition with an ponding area for water retention during a dry year year 2011 3 the original condition without

equation are negligible 1 p r et i where p is precipitation r is runoff et is evapotranspiration and i is infiltration to groundwater the calculated runoff was compared to the field runoff amounts measured at melaha weir located at the catchment outlet 2 1 data collection 2 1 1 description of the study area the study area is wadi sudr located in sinai peninsula northeast egypt sinai depends mainly on groundwater to meet its municipal and irrigation all over the year salama et al 2013 the annual average precipitation estimated for some valleys in sinai ranges from 10 mm year in vicinity of coastal areas to 50 mm year over the mountainous areas eissa et al 2013 the geomorphological characteristics of sinai peninsula are the reason of the large variation of microhabitats and landforms resulting in high diversity in its ecosystems eissa et al 2013 wadi sudr catchment is located southwest of sinai between latitudes 29 30 and 29 55 and longitudes 32 40 and 33 20 the catchment area of the valley is 360 km2 that discharges into the red sea at sudr town where the topography varies between 0 and 875 m above sea level with steep slope as shown in fig 1 the population of this area is approximately 5000 capita where the annual demand of water required for domestic and agricultural use is around 5 105 m3 yr the vegetation in this area ranges between grass shrubs and forbs which are also considered as a groundwater dependent ecosystem 2 1 2 climatic data rainfall data was collected from the nearest meteorological center in sinai for 365 consecutive days of the years 2011 and 2016 fig 2 shows the precipitation time history for years 2011 and 2016 the groundwater level measurement was performed using a submersible pressure transmitter it was found to be 10 m below the ground level at the location of the ponding area the mean temperature relative humidity and evapotranspiration rates using penman method were collected from the nearest weather station located in saint catherine as shown in fig 3 fig 4 shows the mean temperature relative humidity and evapotranspiration rates the penman formula was used to estimate the initial evapotranspiration it a semi empirical equation combining mass transfer and energy budget methods evaporation and transpiration occur simultaneously as both depend on solar radiation temperature relative humidity and wind transpiration

dependent on the pressure head in a nonlinear manner brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 vogel and cislerova 1988 fredlund and xing 1994 water content decreases with increasing suction head in the pores above air entry pressure also the hydraulic conductivity decreases with the increase in suction head these relationships however are more complex in cohesive soils than in cohesionless soils the hydraulic parameters of selected soils were included into the hydrus catalog the van genuchten parameters were taken from carsel and parrish 1988 the brooks and corey parameters are from rawls et al 1982 rawls et al 1982 used multiple linear regression in the estimation of the brooks and corey parameters from a large soil database their regression equations were successively used also by carsel and parrish 1988 but the results were further manipulated statistically to get van genuchten parameters probability density functions the models developed by brooks and corey 1964 adopted in this study can be presented as follows 3 k k s s e 2 n l 2 4 s e θ θ r θ s θ r α h n h 1 α 1 h 1 α where k is the hydraulic conductivity ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity se is the effective

size distribution index l is a pore connectivity parameter h is the suction head and α is the inverse of air entry suction note that n l and α are considered to be merely empirical coefficients affecting the shape of the hydraulic function the prevailing soil type identified in the study area of wadi sudr is mainly formed of fine sand el sherbeny et al 2016 the hydraulic properties of this soil were evaluated and summarized in table 1 the water retention relation can be expressed as shown in fig 5 2 2 catchment delineation a delineation map of wadi sudr catchment was produced as shown in fig 6 to identify the main streamlines of the catchment and estimate the possible amount of runoff geographic information system gis was used in the delineation process of the catchment 3 model description the water flow in the unsaturated zone depends mainly on but not limited to the rainfall amount soil type depth to water table hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated zone and the land use froukh 2003 understanding the hydro mechanical soil behavior in the unsaturated zone is important to model the subsurface flow and transport processes richard s equation was used to estimate the rate of flow in the unsaturated soil according to the water budget equation the groundwater recharge can be estimated mathematically by subtracting the runoff and evaporation from the precipitation taking into consideration the land use and soil properties rushton and ward 1979 the wisconsin geological and natural history survey wgnhs developed a soil water balance swb model that involves using the available data about soil land cover topographic and climate simultaneously with gis to estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of groundwater recharge at the watershed level for temperate humid areas rushton et al 2006 numerical modeling of groundwater recharge facilitates understanding of subsurface hydrological processes and provides practical solutions for many of the environmental and water resources management related problems the model major settings depend on defining the hydrological inputs hydraulic parameters initial and boundary conditions hydrus 3d software was used to analyze and estimate recharge of groundwater the developed model is capable of stimulating the infiltration volumes of water into ground and analyzing the movement of water in the unsaturated partially saturated or fully saturated porous media while considering the irregular boundaries of the catchment water flows in two dimensional vertical or horizontal planes or three dimensional planes showing the radial symmetry about the vertical axis hydrus adopts darcy s and richard s equations to model the water flow in unsaturated zone of soil taking into account a soil is unsaturated with water and b water is flowing in all pores under positive pressure head h šimůnek et al 2008 the equations adopted in the model can be summarized as follows 5 q v at where q is the overflow volume per unit cross sectional area v is the volumetric overflow a is the cross sectional area and t is time 6 q k h h where k is the hydraulic conductivity of soil h h z represents the total potential head and z represents the elevation 7 θ t z k h h θ θ z k θ θ z where θ is the volumetric moisture content 8 θ t z d θ θ z k θ θ z where d is the diffusion coefficient 9 θ t z d θ θ z 10 q d θ θ z k θ 11 c h t z k h h z k h h z where c h d θ h d h the catchment characteristics such as topography soil thickness and presence of aquifer layers porosity hydraulic conductivity storage coefficient and capillary rise of the unsaturated zone were identified setting the modeling initial and boundary conditions is necessary to recognize the inflow and outflow conditions 3 1 initial conditions the model initial conditions define the water flow in the unsaturated zone of soil by water content and spatial distribution of the pressure head over the flow domain note that it was assumed that the relationship between the soil water content and the depth of soil is linear 3 2 boundary conditions the boundary conditions define the boundaries of the catchment study area the surface top layer of the model was defined as atmospheric boundary layer which obey the general conditions of contact with atmosphere the catchment side boundaries were divided into different conditions 1 the outlet which was defined as no flux boundary to allow water to infiltrate where the ponding area exists and 2 the other side boundaries of the catchment were defined as variable flux boundaries to allow water to flow in all directions according to its depth the bottom layer boundary condition was defined to represent the groundwater table groundwater level measurement was performed using a submersible pressure transmitter at several locations within the catchment boundary the groundwater table was slightly varying between 9 3 and 10 7 m as such an average of 10 m depth was taken in the model over the whole catchment fig 7 shows the boundaries defined in the model 3 3 numerical iteration the iteration criterion adopted in the study is based on a process that uses richards s equation to obtain solutions over multiple time steps for each iteration the model solves linearized algebraic equations then apply gaussian elimination till a satisfactory degree of convergence is achieved this takes place based on an automated adjustment of the time step during calculations which passes through four time discretization 1 numerical solution 2 boundary conditions implementation 3 data points used in inverse problems and 4 simulated results 4 results analysis the numerical simulation displayed the sequence of recharging process starting from the early stages of the infiltration from the pond to the ground when upon rainfall to the full recharging process this continues after the finish of the rainfall event based on the water content and saturation degree of the soil fig 8 shows the different phases of rainfall infiltration and recharge of the groundwater reservoir four scenarios were simulated for the wadi sudr area these scenarios were selected based on the consideration of rainfall as a variable over time and space accordingly two years 2011 and 2016 with different rainfall data were studied each of which was modeled with and without a ponding area the four scenarios are summarized as follows scenario a without ponding area during dry year at year 2011 with low rainfall records for the initial condition without a ponding area scenario b with ponding area during dry year at year 2011 with low rainfall records for a condition with a ponding area for water accumulation and infiltration into the soil scenario c without ponding area during wet year at year 2016 with high rainfall records for the initial condition without a ponding area scenario d with ponding area during wet year at year 2016 with high rainfall records for a condition with a ponding area for water accumulation and infiltration into the soil figs 9a through 9d show the cumulative precipitation and the cumulative shares of recharge runoff and evapotranspiration for scenarios a through d respectively 4 1 scenario a at year 2011 with low rainfall records for the initial condition without using a ponding area runoff has the major share of the precipitation due to the steep slope topography of the area on which the water tends to run off with limited infiltration recharge and evaporation have the remaining share from the rainfall water fig 9a shows the cumulative precipitation over 2011 and the cumulative shares of recharge runoff and evapotranspiration note that runoff showed a similar trend to that of precipitation recharge rate was higher during the rainfall periods while constant during the drought periods evapotranspiration showed low rates during winter season november through march and high rates during spring summer season april through july 4 2 scenario b at year 2011 with low rainfall records for a condition with a ponding area for water accumulation and infiltration into the soil for scenario b an artificial ponding area was considered at the outlet of the catchment this pond captures the runoff so as not to drain into the red sea instead it allows the precipitation to be shared between evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge through infiltration due to the high hydraulic conductivity of the soil sandy soil at the water content and degree of saturation into account a larger amount of water tends to infiltrate into the soil with minimal evapotranspiration as shown in fig 9b accordingly a larger amount of rainfall water can recharge the groundwater reservoir 4 3 scenario c at year 2016 with high rainfall records for the initial condition without using a ponding area for scenario c the results were very similar to those from scenario a note that these two scenarios study the same case no ponding area but two different precipitation magnitudes occurred in two different years 2011 and 2016 similar to scenario a runoff was found to acquire the highest share from the precipitation due to the steep topography of the area as shown in fig 9c this steep environment forces a larger amount of water to runoff with minimum infiltration into soil as expected cumulative recharge rate was higher during rainfall periods while constant during drought periods evapotranspiration showed low rates during winter season november through march and high rates during spring summer season april through july 4 4 scenario d at year 2016 with high rainfall records for a condition with a ponding area for water accumulation and infiltration into the soil for scenario d the results were very similar to those from scenario b note that these two scenarios study the same case with an artificial ponding area at the outlet of the catchment but two different precipitation magnitudes occurred in two different years 2011 and 2016 similar to scenario b runoff was captured at the artificial ponding area this allowed the water to accumulate and infiltrate into the soil raising the share of groundwater recharge from precipitation as shown in fig 9d 4 5 runoff estimation and verification runoff was estimated from the water balance equation by subtracting the amount of recharge and evapotranspiration from the total amount of precipitation during the year of 2016 the estimated runoff was compared to field measurements acquired for the water head flowing over melaha weir located at the city of ras sudr at which the study catchment outfalls the total catchment runoff flow was computed using measurements of water head over the weir crest as follows 12 q 2 3 c d b 2 g 1 2 h 3 2 where q is the flow rate m3 s h is water head on the weir m b is the width of the weir m g is the freefall gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 and cd is a discharge constant for the weir assumed 0 6 the field measured runoff magnitudes were found very close to those predicted numerically as shown in fig 10 this comparison validates the numerical simulations conducted in this study 4 6 recharge rates by comparing results from scenarios of the same year with and without using an artificial pond it was found that the recharge amounts increased significantly as shown in fig 11 specifically recharge rates were similar between cases with and without ponds during rainfall periods however recharge rates continued to sustain their values during drought periods in cases with ponds this resulted from the continued infiltration of water captured in the ponds on the other hand cases with no ponds showed almost zero recharge during drought periods note that the increase in the total recharge amounts in 2011 and 2016 due to the presence of an artificial pond was estimated to be 6 53 mm yr 57 higher than the no pond case and 11 58 mm yr 53 5 higher than the no pond case respectively 4 7 evapotranspiration rates the amounts of evapotranspiration estimated for scenarios b and d with ponds were found higher than those estimated for scenarios a and c without ponds respectively as shown in fig 12 the retention of water in the ponding area resulted in more evaporation note that no runoff was allowed in cases with ponds the evapotranspiration rate varies with temperature the evapotranspiration rate was estimated to be the lowest during winter season november through march and the highest during spring summer season april through july 5 discussion the amounts of recharge at the 360 km2 catchment drainage area of wadi sudr in the original current condition without ponding areas estimated in 2011 and 2016 were 17 06 105 m3 yr 4 74 mm yr and 36 32 105 m3 yr 10 09 mm yr respectively on the other hand the corresponding amounts of recharge for cases with ponding areas estimated in 2011 and 2016 were 40 56 107 m3 yr 11 27 mm yr and 78 01 105 m3 yr 37 80 mm yr respectively note that the average water demand for municipal and agricultural purposes at wadi sudr is approximately 50 105 m3 yr significant benefit was found in using ponding areas to capture rainfall water for the purpose of recharging groundwater reservoirs i the excess of rainfall water during the high rainfall years such as 2016 can be converted into a strategic groundwater source through recharge that can be used during the low rainfall years such as 2011 this recharge can maintain balanced groundwater withdrawals without exceeding the reservoir yield capacity ii the increase in groundwater amount could have turned the situation from the threat of water shortage of 13 45 105 m3 yr into an excess of 28 01 105 m3 yr of water in 2016 similarly the increase in groundwater amount could have minimized the water shortage from 32 94 105 m3 yr to 9 44 105 m3 yr in 2011 iii the percentage of exceeding the water demand using ponding areas during high rainfall years is almost triple the percentage of shortage during low rainfall years this means that the amount of precipitation in a wet year can fill the gap between the water demand and water shortage for almost three dry years iv the application of groundwater recharge method can maintain a sustainable use of groundwater reservoirs without exceeding their yield capacities in addition it boosts the opportunities for agricultural land expansions and developments 6 conclusions groundwater recharge estimations are essential for a proper management and sustainable use of groundwater resources it necessitates a comprehensive approach that includes several recharge influencing factors such as precipitation runoff evapotranspiration land cover topography and soil properties this study was conducted to investigate a low cost technique to utilize the rainfall water instead a numerical model was developed to simulate the water flow in wadi sudr catchment is this model simulated the original condition of the study area and a proposed condition with an artificial ponding area near the mouth of the catchment on a highly permeable soil four scenarios were studied to estimate the recharge rate with and without using a ponding area during two different years 2011 and 2016 it was found that the ponding area can capture the runoff initially draining into the red sea this allowed water to accumulate and infiltrate into the highly permeable soil of the pond and recharge the groundwater reservoir which can increase the groundwater strategic storage the retention of water in the ponding area increased the amounts of evapotranspiration but ceased the runoff by significantly higher amounts this resulted in an increase in the total amount of groundwater recharge the method of using ponding area at the catchment outlet have deemed to be an effective way of increasing the groundwater strategic storage in arid regions by more than 50 than the original condition without using a pond for wadi sudr this can turn the situation from shortage of water into excess and maintain a sustainable use of groundwater reservoirs without exceeding their yield capacities in addition it boosts the opportunities for agricultural land expansions and developments

plans and multiple year plans respectively specifically four scenarios are considered for a case study district wadi sudr in sinai egypt 1 without ponding area during dry year 2 with ponding area during dry year 3 without ponding area during wet year and 4 with ponding area during wet year a numerical model of the study area was established to simulate the groundwater reservoir and its associated groundwater flow the topography climate biota and human activities were considered as main contributors to reflect the water availability in the area study predicted results from the numerical model were compared to field measurements of the runoff 2 methodology the methodology adopted in this study is based on estimating the groundwater recharge of wadi sudr catchment at the presence of a ponding area near the catchment outlet using hydrus 3d finite element analysis software šimůnek et al 2008 darcy s and richard s equations are the governing equations that were used in modeling the water flow in the unsaturated soil zone data collected involved climatic data topography soil properties and groundwater table level in order to identify the real components of the study area catchment area of the valley was delineated from satellite images using geographic information system gis tools the model output results were evaluated and analyzed to compare four scenarios 1 the original condition without using a ponding area during a dry year year 2011 2 a condition with an ponding area for water retention during a dry year year 2011 3 the original condition without using a ponding area during a wet year year 2016 4 a condition with an ponding area for water retention during a wet year year 2016 the amounts of groundwater recharge obtained from the numerical simulations were used in the water budget equation to estimate the actual runoff amount by subtracting the recharge and evapotranspiration from the precipitation assuming that any minor losses in the equation are negligible 1 p r et i where p is precipitation r is runoff et is evapotranspiration and i is infiltration to groundwater the calculated runoff was compared to the field runoff amounts measured at melaha weir located at the catchment outlet 2 1 data collection 2 1 1 description of the study area the study area is wadi sudr located in sinai peninsula northeast egypt sinai depends mainly on groundwater to meet its municipal and irrigation all over the year salama et al 2013 the annual average precipitation estimated for some valleys in sinai ranges from 10 mm year in vicinity of coastal areas to 50 mm year over the mountainous areas eissa et al 2013 the geomorphological characteristics of sinai peninsula are the reason of the large variation of microhabitats and landforms resulting in high diversity in its ecosystems eissa et al 2013 wadi sudr catchment is located southwest of sinai between latitudes 29 30 and 29 55 and longitudes 32 40 and 33 20 the catchment area of the valley is 360 km2 that discharges into the red sea at sudr town where the topography varies between 0 and 875 m above sea level with steep slope as shown in fig 1 the population of this area is approximately 5000 capita where the annual demand of water required for domestic and agricultural use is around 5 105 m3 yr the vegetation in this area ranges between grass shrubs and forbs which are also considered as a groundwater dependent ecosystem 2 1 2 climatic data rainfall data was collected from the nearest meteorological center in sinai for 365 consecutive days of the years 2011 and 2016 fig 2 shows the precipitation time history for years 2011 and 2016 the groundwater level measurement was performed using a submersible pressure transmitter it was found to be 10 m below the ground level at the location of the ponding area the mean temperature relative humidity and evapotranspiration rates using penman method were collected from the nearest weather station located in saint catherine as shown in fig 3 fig 4 shows the mean temperature relative humidity and evapotranspiration rates the penman formula was used to estimate the initial evapotranspiration it a semi empirical equation combining mass transfer and energy budget methods evaporation and transpiration occur simultaneously as both depend on solar radiation temperature relative humidity and wind transpiration rate is influenced by characteristics of crop and agricultural method different kinds of plants may have different transpiration rates allen et al 1998 2 λ e r n g γ λ e a λ where λe evaporative

dependent on the pressure head in a nonlinear manner brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 vogel and cislerova 1988 fredlund and xing 1994 water content decreases with increasing suction head in the pores above air entry pressure also the hydraulic conductivity decreases with the increase in suction head these relationships however are more complex in cohesive soils than in cohesionless soils the hydraulic parameters of selected soils were included into the hydrus catalog the van genuchten parameters were taken from carsel and parrish 1988 the brooks and corey parameters are from rawls et al 1982 rawls et al 1982 used multiple linear regression in the estimation of the brooks and corey parameters from a large soil database their regression equations were successively used also by carsel and parrish 1988 but the results were further manipulated statistically to get van genuchten parameters probability density functions the models developed by brooks and corey 1964 adopted in this study can be presented as follows 3 k k s s e 2 n l 2 4 s e θ θ r θ s θ r α h n h 1 α 1 h 1 α where k is the hydraulic conductivity ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity se is the effective water content or degree of saturation θ is the volumetric water content θr is the residual volumetric water content θs is the saturated water content which is equal to the soil porosity n is a pore size distribution index l is a pore connectivity parameter h is the suction head and α is the inverse of air entry suction note that n l and α are considered to be merely empirical coefficients affecting the shape of the hydraulic function the prevailing soil type identified in the study area of wadi sudr is mainly formed of fine sand el sherbeny et al 2016 the hydraulic properties of this soil were evaluated and summarized in table 1 the water retention relation can be expressed as shown in fig 5 2 2 catchment delineation a delineation map of wadi sudr catchment was produced as shown in fig 6 to identify the main streamlines of the catchment and estimate the possible amount of runoff geographic information system gis was used in the delineation process of the catchment 3 model description the water flow in the unsaturated zone depends mainly on but not limited to the rainfall amount soil type depth to water table hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated zone and the land use froukh 2003 understanding the hydro mechanical soil behavior in the unsaturated zone is important to model the subsurface flow and transport processes richard s equation was used to estimate the rate of flow in the unsaturated soil according to the water budget equation the groundwater recharge can be estimated mathematically by subtracting the runoff and evaporation from the precipitation taking into consideration the land use and soil properties rushton and ward 1979 the wisconsin geological and natural history survey wgnhs developed a soil water balance swb model that involves using the available data about soil land cover topographic and climate simultaneously with gis to estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of groundwater recharge at the watershed level for temperate humid areas rushton et al 2006 numerical modeling of groundwater recharge facilitates understanding of subsurface hydrological processes and provides practical solutions for many of the environmental and water resources management related problems the model major settings depend on defining the hydrological inputs hydraulic parameters initial and boundary conditions hydrus 3d software was used to analyze and estimate recharge of groundwater the developed model is capable of stimulating the infiltration volumes of water into ground and analyzing the movement of water in the unsaturated partially saturated or fully saturated porous media while considering the irregular boundaries of the catchment water flows in two dimensional vertical or horizontal planes or three dimensional planes showing the radial symmetry about the vertical axis hydrus adopts darcy s and richard s equations to model the water flow in unsaturated zone of soil taking into account a soil is unsaturated with water and b water is flowing in all pores under positive pressure head h šimůnek et al 2008 the equations adopted in the model can be summarized as follows 5 q v at where q is the overflow volume per unit cross sectional area v is the volumetric overflow a is the cross sectional area and t is time 6 q k h h where k is the hydraulic conductivity of soil h h z represents the total potential head and z represents the elevation 7 θ t z k h h θ θ z k θ θ z where θ is the volumetric moisture content 8 θ t z d θ θ z k θ θ z where d is the diffusion coefficient 9 θ t z d θ θ z 10 q d θ θ z k θ 11 c h t z k h h z k h h z where c h d θ h d h the catchment characteristics such as topography soil thickness and presence of aquifer layers porosity hydraulic conductivity storage coefficient and capillary rise of the unsaturated zone were identified setting the modeling initial and boundary conditions is necessary to recognize the inflow and outflow conditions 3 1 initial conditions the model initial conditions define the water flow in the unsaturated zone of soil by water content and spatial distribution of the pressure head over the flow domain note that it was assumed that the relationship between the soil water content and the depth of soil is linear 3 2 boundary conditions the boundary conditions define the boundaries of the catchment study area the surface top layer of the model was defined as atmospheric boundary layer which obey the general conditions of contact with atmosphere the catchment side boundaries were divided into different conditions 1 the outlet which was defined as no flux boundary to allow water to infiltrate where the ponding area exists and 2 the other side boundaries of the catchment were defined as variable flux boundaries to allow water to flow in all directions according to its depth the bottom layer boundary condition was defined to represent the groundwater table groundwater level measurement was performed using a submersible pressure transmitter at several locations within the catchment boundary the groundwater table was slightly varying between 9 3 and 10 7 m as such an average of 10 m depth was taken in the model over the whole catchment fig 7 shows the boundaries defined in the model 3 3 numerical iteration the iteration criterion adopted in the study is based on a process that uses richards s equation to obtain solutions over multiple time steps for each iteration the model solves linearized algebraic equations then apply gaussian elimination till a satisfactory degree of convergence is achieved this takes place based on an automated adjustment of the time step during calculations which passes through four time discretization 1 numerical solution 2 boundary conditions implementation 3 data points used in inverse problems and 4 simulated results 4 results analysis the numerical simulation displayed the sequence of recharging process starting from the early stages of the infiltration from the pond to the ground when upon rainfall to the full recharging process this continues after the finish of the rainfall event based on the water content and saturation degree of the soil fig 8 shows the different phases of rainfall infiltration and recharge of the groundwater reservoir four scenarios were simulated for the wadi sudr area these scenarios were selected based on the consideration of rainfall as a variable over time and space accordingly two years 2011 and 2016 with different rainfall data were studied each of which was modeled with and without a ponding area the four scenarios are summarized as follows scenario a without ponding area during dry year at year 2011 with low rainfall records for the initial condition without a ponding area scenario b with ponding area during dry year at year 2011 with low rainfall records for a condition with a ponding area for water accumulation and infiltration into the soil scenario c without ponding area during wet year at year 2016 with high rainfall records for the initial condition without a ponding area scenario d with ponding area during wet year at year 2016 with high rainfall records for a condition with a ponding area for water accumulation and infiltration into the soil figs 9a through 9d show the cumulative precipitation and the cumulative shares of recharge runoff and evapotranspiration for scenarios a through d respectively 4 1 scenario a at year 2011 with low rainfall records for the initial condition without using a ponding area runoff has the major share of the precipitation due to the steep slope topography of the area on which the water tends to run off with limited infiltration recharge and evaporation have the remaining share from the rainfall water fig 9a shows the cumulative precipitation over 2011 and the cumulative shares of recharge runoff and evapotranspiration note that runoff showed a similar trend to that of precipitation recharge rate was higher during the rainfall periods while constant during the drought periods evapotranspiration showed low rates during winter season november through march and high rates during spring summer season april through july 4 2 scenario b at year 2011 with low rainfall records for a condition with a ponding area for water accumulation and infiltration into the soil for scenario b an artificial ponding area was considered at the outlet of the catchment this pond captures the runoff so as not to drain into the red sea instead it allows the precipitation to be shared between evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge through infiltration due to the high hydraulic conductivity of the soil sandy soil at the water content and degree of saturation into account a larger amount of water tends to infiltrate into the soil with minimal evapotranspiration as shown in fig 9b accordingly a larger amount of rainfall water can recharge the groundwater reservoir 4 3 scenario c at year 2016 with high rainfall records for the initial condition without using a ponding area for scenario c the results were very similar to those from scenario a note that these two scenarios study the same case no ponding area but two different precipitation magnitudes occurred in two different years 2011 and 2016 similar to scenario a runoff was found to acquire the highest share from the precipitation due to the steep topography of the area as shown in fig 9c this steep environment forces a larger amount of water to runoff with minimum infiltration into soil as expected cumulative recharge rate was higher during rainfall periods while constant during drought periods evapotranspiration showed low rates during winter season november through march and high rates during spring summer season april through july 4 4 scenario d at year 2016 with high rainfall records for a condition with a ponding area for water accumulation and infiltration into the soil for scenario d the results were very similar to those from scenario b note that these two scenarios study the same case with an artificial ponding area at the outlet of the catchment but two different precipitation magnitudes occurred in two different years 2011 and 2016 similar to scenario b runoff was captured at the artificial ponding area this allowed the water to accumulate and infiltrate into the soil raising the share of groundwater recharge from precipitation as shown in fig 9d 4 5 runoff estimation and verification runoff was estimated from the water balance equation by subtracting the amount of recharge and evapotranspiration from the total amount of precipitation during the year of 2016 the estimated runoff was compared to field measurements acquired for the water head flowing over melaha weir located at the city of ras sudr at which the study catchment outfalls the total catchment runoff flow was computed using measurements of water head over the weir crest as follows 12 q 2 3 c d b 2 g 1 2 h 3 2 where q is the flow rate m3 s h is water head on the weir m b is the width of the weir m g is the freefall gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s2 and cd is a discharge constant for the weir assumed 0 6 the field measured runoff magnitudes were found very close to those predicted numerically as shown in fig 10 this comparison validates the numerical simulations conducted in this study 4 6 recharge rates by comparing results from scenarios of the same year with and without using an artificial pond it was found that the recharge amounts increased significantly as shown in fig 11 specifically recharge rates were similar between cases with and without ponds during rainfall periods however recharge rates continued to sustain their values during drought periods in cases with ponds this resulted from the continued infiltration of water captured in the ponds on the other hand cases with no ponds showed almost zero recharge during drought periods note that the increase in the total recharge amounts in 2011 and 2016 due to the presence of an artificial pond was estimated to be 6 53 mm yr 57 higher than the no pond case and 11 58 mm yr 53 5 higher than the no pond case respectively 4 7 evapotranspiration rates the amounts of evapotranspiration estimated for scenarios b and d with ponds were found higher than those estimated for scenarios a and c without ponds respectively as shown in fig 12 the retention of water in the ponding area resulted in more evaporation note that no runoff was allowed in cases with ponds the evapotranspiration rate varies with temperature the evapotranspiration rate was estimated to be the lowest during winter season november through march and the highest during spring summer season april through july 5 discussion the amounts of recharge at the 360 km2 catchment drainage area of wadi sudr in the original current condition without ponding areas estimated in 2011 and 2016 were 17 06 105 m3 yr 4 74 mm yr and 36 32 105 m3 yr 10 09 mm yr respectively on the other hand the corresponding amounts of recharge for cases with ponding areas estimated in 2011 and 2016 were 40 56 107 m3 yr 11 27 mm yr and 78 01 105 m3 yr 37 80 mm yr respectively note that the average water demand for municipal and agricultural purposes at wadi sudr is approximately 50 105 m3 yr significant benefit was found in using ponding areas to capture rainfall water for the purpose of recharging groundwater reservoirs i the excess of rainfall water during the high rainfall years such as 2016 can be converted into a strategic groundwater source through recharge that can be used during the low rainfall years such as 2011 this recharge can maintain balanced groundwater withdrawals without exceeding the reservoir yield capacity ii the increase in groundwater amount could have turned the situation from the threat of water shortage of 13 45 105 m3 yr into an excess of 28 01 105 m3 yr of water in 2016 similarly the increase in groundwater amount could have minimized the water shortage from 32 94 105 m3 yr to 9 44 105 m3 yr in 2011 iii the percentage of exceeding the water demand using ponding areas during high rainfall years is almost triple the percentage of shortage during low rainfall years this means that the amount of precipitation in a wet year can fill the gap between the water demand and water shortage for almost three dry years iv the application of groundwater recharge method can maintain a sustainable use of groundwater reservoirs without exceeding their yield capacities in addition it boosts the opportunities for agricultural land expansions and developments 6 conclusions groundwater recharge estimations are essential for a proper management and sustainable use of groundwater resources it necessitates a comprehensive approach that includes several recharge influencing factors such as precipitation runoff evapotranspiration land cover topography and soil properties this study was conducted to investigate a low cost technique to utilize the rainfall water instead a numerical model was developed to simulate the water flow in wadi sudr catchment is this model simulated the original condition of the study area and a proposed condition with an artificial ponding area near the mouth of the catchment on a highly permeable soil four scenarios were studied to estimate the recharge rate with and without using a ponding area during two different years 2011 and 2016 it was found that the ponding area can capture the runoff initially draining into the red sea this allowed water to accumulate and infiltrate into the highly permeable soil of the pond and recharge the groundwater reservoir which can increase the groundwater strategic storage the retention of water in the ponding area increased the amounts of evapotranspiration but ceased the runoff by significantly higher amounts this resulted in an increase in the total amount of groundwater recharge the method of using ponding area at the catchment outlet have deemed to be an effective way of increasing the groundwater strategic storage in arid regions by more than 50 than the original condition without using a pond for wadi sudr this can turn the situation from shortage of water into excess and maintain a sustainable use of groundwater reservoirs without exceeding their yield capacities in addition it boosts the opportunities for agricultural land expansions and developments

india corresponding author geohydrological investigations were carried out in kandivalasa river sub basin a typical khondalitic terrain near cheepurupalli town of vizianagaram district andhra pradesh india by collecting groundwater levels and conducting fourteen pumping tests during the years 2013 2015 groundwater levels were measured during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons at forty one locations covering the entire basin contour maps were drawn and it is found that there is 10 m depletion of groundwater levels as a whole in the basin for the past 21 years however there were pockets of more groundwater depletion in view of the high density of wells at some places lower transmissivity values are observed where differences of depth to water levels between pre and post monsoon seasons are high groundwater potential areas are identified with less fluctuation of water table lower storage coefficient values are found where the kaolinisation is more predominant at the main kandivalasa river 2d resistivity imaging has also revealed that the kaolinisation is increasing towards the stream which is responsible for reduction of storage coefficient all along the main stream based on transmissivity distribution eastern part of the study area is identified as high groundwater potential zone while most of the western side of the basin is having less groundwater potential zone graphical abstract fx1 keywords geohydrological investigations transmissivity storage coefficient khondalite kaolinisation kandivalasa river sub basin 1 introduction peninsular india has discontinuous hill ranges popularly known as eastern ghats all along the east coast of india at an average distance varying from 0 to 100 km forming well developed river basins sarma 1982 most of this terrain is covered with khondalitic suit garneti ferrous siliminite gneiss of rocks which are sedimentary in origin and later they become hard rocks after metamorphism krishna rao 1952 assessment of aquifer hydraulic properties is essential first step for building a groundwater flow model and thereby estimating the input and output stresses of the aquifer the main objective of this paper is to estimate the transmissivity t and storage coefficient s and relate them to the earlier concepts about the groundwater potential zones in the present study t and s are estimated in kandivalasa river sub basin covered with khondalitic terrain of cheepurupally mandal an administrative unit within the district vizianagaram district of andhra pradesh india by conducting pumping tests generally groundwater is available in weathered and fractured zones under unconfined to semi confined conditions quite often the highly weathered layer or kaolinised layer is acting as barrier at low lying areas near the stream and causing accumulation of water at mid land areas venkateswara rao and briz kishore 1991 the average annual rainfall is around 1000 mm which is mostly lost as surface runoff and evapotranspiration only one fifth of it is recharging to groundwater mondal et al 2008 venkateswara rao et al 2007 boulton and pontin 1971 and neuman 1975 analyzed the pumping test data from anisotropic unconfined aquifers in various hard rocks many authors namely barker 1988 black 1994 prodanoff et al 2006 have successfully analyzed aquifer parameters in different hard rock regions maréchal et al 2003 adopted different methods to know the complexity of groundwater flows in a granitic terrain near hyderabad india jain 1977 has clearly described that in situ test or pumping test is the most effective way to determine the hydraulic properties in the hard rock aquifer and to quantify the groundwater resources of water bearing layers according to the study of clark 1988 pumping tests can also be done in large diameter wells in the hard rock terrain for the hydraulic studies and to evaluate the aquifer characteristics the data obtained from pumping test can be analyzed using two types of formula namely those applicable to steady state and those applicable to non steady state conditions constant rate pumping tests and recovery tests are analyzed by elhag 2015 to determine the aquifer characteristics which include transmissibility t and the storage coefficient s in the current study pumping tests have been conducted to evaluate the aquifer parameters by adopting cooper jacob method cooper and jacob 1946 this is a very simple method introduced by cooper and jacob for determining the formation coefficients and aquifer characteristics cooper and jacob have shown that when plotted on semi logarithmic paper the theoretical drawdown curve approaches a straight line when sufficient time has elapsed after pumping started the cooper jacob method gives aquifer properties and coefficients accurately when compared with the type curve solution provided by thies jack and hudson 1961 the study by meier et al 1998 has revealed that the cooper jacob method can be used for estimating effective transmissivity values in many formations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the khonalitic terrain of kandivalasa river sub basin krsb of vizianagaram district in andhra pradesh india is shown in fig 1 the krsb is covered with a typical khondalitic suite of rocks and is situated between east longitudes of 83 32 15 to 83 39 10 and north latitudes of 18 9 15 to 18 19 54 and has an areal extent of 124 km2 it forms a part of survey of india topo sheet nos e 44 l11 and e 44 l12 in general the area is covered by a thick soil cover 1 4 m followed by weathered and fractured khondalitic formation underlain by basement of granite gneiss the area is highly disturbed due to folding faulting and fracturing with isolated hills covered by khondalitic rocks on the top and lateritic soils on the sides fig 2 occasionally quartz veins are seen exposed to surface often serving as guide to locate high yielding wells the topography of the area is undulating at all locations between hills there is a high slope in the foot hill region and a gentle slope towards the valley fig 3 frequently small plateaus are also observed the average annual rainfall is around 1000 mm venkateswara rao and briz kishore 1990 groundwater occurs under semi confined conditions in the weathered portion of the khondalitic formation but the fact that the raise of water table in the bore well after penetrating the fractured environment and drying up of nearby open wells after pumpage of bore wells demonstrate that the weathered and fractured environments are hydrologically connected and the fractured environment is under semi confining conditions venkateswara rao and briz kishore 1991 it was observed by venkateswara rao 2009 that groundwater potential areas are those where less fluctuation of water table between pre and post monsoon seasons is observed in this paper it is verified whether the higher transmissivity areas are coinciding with the areas of less fluctuation of water table or not it is also verified whether low lying areas has low values of transmissivity and storage coefficient as these areas are nearer to the main stream and the formations below the streams are mostly kaolinised zones venkateswara rao 1998 2 2 field data collection the pumping test method is usually preferred for groundwater development and management on a regional scale and for determining aquifer hydraulic characteristics singhal and gupta 1999 pre and post monsoon water levels at 41 locations covering the study area were collected during the years 2013 2014 and 2015 and analyzed by preparing groundwater contour maps with the help of surfer software otutu 2011 pumping tests were conducted at 14 wells using cooper jacob method uhl and sharma 1978 during december 2014 and 2015 the data was analyzed for estimating t and s of the aquifer only irrigation bore wells are used both for pumping wells as well as observation wells for conducting the pumping tests at the fourteen locations before starting to pump water from the wells the water levels from the ground level were measured with the water level indicator the discharge rate during pumping was determined from the time taken to fill the 20 lt bucket pumping well and observation wells were selected in such a way that they are not more than 70 m distance except pumping well no other well was pumped in the vicinity of the pumping and observation wells drawdowns are observed in the observation well till study state conditions are achieved gernand and heidtman 1997 residual drawdowns were also observed to cross check the t obtained in the normal pumping test singh 2000 in this study drawdown measurements were made for a period of 100 135 min with an initial interval of 1 min up to 10 min and later at an interval of 5 min till water level reach the study state condition the transmissivity and storage coefficient values are estimated by using cooper jacob method and the contour maps of t and s values are prepared using surfer software the transmissivity distribution is compared and analyzed with the ground water potential index gwpi and groundwater fluctuation maps of the basin the storage coefficient distribution map is analyzed in conjunction with the two dimensional 2d resistivity imaging conducted near the main stream to find the presence of kaolinization 2 3 calculation of aquifer characteristics the pumping tests are performed by pumping a well and observing the resulting drawdowns in an observation well as described in the cooper jacob method cooper and jacob 1946 hence the method consists of drawing a straight line through the late time data points and extending it backward to the point of zero drawdown time axis intercept which is designated as t0 meier et al 1998 the drawdown per log cycle is obtained from the slope of the line values for transmissivity t and storativity s can be calculated from the following equations maréchal et al 2010 1 transmissivity t 2 3 q 4 π s 2 storage coefficient s 2 25 t t 0 r 2 where q is the constant pumping rate δs is drawdown for one log cycle time t0 is the time since pumping began to just before drawdown starts and r is the radial distance to the observation well 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological investigations depth to water level contour maps of post monsoon seasons of 1993 and 2014 figs 4 and 5 are compared to observe the change in groundwater levels for the past 21 years from the contour maps it can be observed that there is 10 m depletion of groundwater levels as a whole in the basin for the past 21 years 3 2 geohydrological investigations transmissivity and storage coefficient are among the most important geohydrological data needed for managing groundwater resources transmissivity describes the ability of an aquifer to transmit water over the entire saturated thickness transmissivity is defined as the rate at which water of a certain prevailing kinematic viscosity is transmitted through a unit width of the aquifer under a unit hydraulic gradient todd 1980 similarly todd 1980 has also defined the storage coefficient s as the volume of water that an aquifer releases or takes into storage per unit surface area of the aquifer per unit component of the head normal to that surface in an unconfined aquifer the storage coefficient corresponds to its specific yield the geohydrological conditions of the area have been evaluated based on the pumping test results the obtained transmissivity and storage coefficient values in the study area are presented in table 1 it can be observed from the table 1 that the lower transmissivity values of 26 712 m2 day and 37 195 m2 day are obtained at itakarlapalli and karkam villages respectively the values as high as 253 90 m2 day and 304 13 m2 day are observed at peripi and gollapalem villages respectively the storage coefficient values are varying from 0 000291 at itakarlapalli low to 0 00915 at chinanadipalli high the spatial distributions of transmissivity and storage coefficient values are shown in figs 6 and 9 respectively 3 2 1 analysis of transmissivity distribution with gwpi and groundwater level fluctuations fig 7 represents the contour map of ground water potential index gwpi based on hydrogeophysical and hydrogeological parameters in the study area venkateswara rao 1995 gwpi is computed as sum of the products of weights of various variables multiplied with their rating however the selections of variables and their relative weights are completely rests with the groundwater exploration experts working in the terrain but rating depends on the success range of the individual parameters that is highest rating is given to a particular range of a parameter means more number of successful wells are cited in that range venkateswara rao 2009 the more the gwpi of a site the better the chances to have a higher yield the gwpi computed with the above method is coinciding with potential areas of the basin under study this map is helpful to identify the groundwater potential zones in the basin from this map eastern part of the study area is identified as good groundwater potential zones having the high groundwater potential index more than 30 whereas most of the western side of the basin having less potential index less than 30 is identified as low groundwater potential area the contour map of the transmissivity distribution in the study area fig 6 is having good correlation with the ground water potential index map indicating that transmissivity values are more where the groundwater potential is high and transmissivity values are less where the groundwater potential is low the contour map of difference of depth to water level between pre and post monsoon seasons of 2014 fig 8 is also prepared to prove the concept that less groundwater fluctuations in the study area indicates more groundwater potential venkateswara rao 2003 the well census data of the basin has also been collected to find out the abstraction rate in the basin the well census data suggest that even though huge numbers of bore wells are being pumped in the south eastern and western parts of the basin those areas are observed with less groundwater fluctuations fig 8 contrary to the above situation from fig 8 it can be observed that there are pockets of high groundwater depletion where the difference of depth to water level for pre and post monsoon seasons is high due to the more number of bore wells at these places namely boppadam kothapeta karkam itakarlapally and sivaram these areas are also associated with the low transmissivity values fig 6 from the three figures fig 6 fig 7 and fig 8 it can be observed that low groundwater potential areas are having the low transmissivity values with high groundwater fluctuations high groundwater potential areas are with high transmissivity values with less groundwater fluctuations which are identified at gollapalem velpurai chinnanadipalli and peripi in the eastern side of the study area 3 2 2 analysis of storage coefficient storage coefficient distribution in the study area is shown in fig 9 from this figure it can be observed that extreme sides of eastern and western areas are having high storage coefficient values whereas along the main stream very low storage coefficient values are observed as the formations are kaolinised along the main stream the main problem in the khondalitic terrain is kaolinisation which is a process that makes the khondalitic rock becoming clay due to high weathering when it is in contact with water when the khondalitic rock become partly or fully clay due to kaolinisation it is unable to support high well yield venkateswara rao 1995 the yield might have been reduced due to infilling of fractures with kaolinite and other weathering products pailet 2007 earlier geophysical investigations venkateswara rao 1998 in the study area fig 10 have revealed the fact that all along the length of the river the aquifer thickness is least due to kaolinisation of the formation this phenomenon is noticeable in the profile fig 10 across the basin the aquifer thickness is maximum on either side of the river and the kaolinised layer thickness is maximum below the river thus the flanks and adjacent upland areas are having more potential than the lower topographic elevations in the middle of the basin 3 3 two dimensional resistivity imaging surveys kaolinised zones contain sticky clay material and are more conductive in nature when they are saturated with water these zones generally identified with the low resistivity of less than 25 ohm m in the khondalitic terrain venkateswara rao et al 2013 to observe the kaolinisation problem in detail near the stream area two dimensional 2d resistivity imaging surveys are carried out at sivaram village fig 11 three 2d profiles are selected in such a way that they are parallel to the direction of the stream these 2d profiles are having the profile interval of 10 m to each other and are carried out one after other towards the stream the highly weathered zone is identified with the resistivity values below 25 ohm m fig 11 shows that the kaolinisation is increasing from profile to profile towards the stream which means that the second profile is having more kaolinisation at the location of the failed well than first profile and the third profile which is close to the stream is having more kaolinisation than second profile fig 12 represents the 2d resistivity image carried out perpendicular to the direction of the stream at failed well in the sivaram village failed well is placed almost middle of the profile in this case also the highly weathered material that is below 25 ohm m is increasing towards the stream the effect of kaolinisation is maximum at the end of the profile which is very close to the stream the above study implies that all along the stream courses groundwater potential is low due to kaolinisation of the aquifer and not suitable for bore well pumping may be suitable for open wells at the middle uplands away from on either side of the main stream the area is suitable for bore well pumping as well as for recharging as the aquifer is moderately weathered and fractured 4 conclusions there is 10 m depletion of groundwater levels as a whole in the kandivalasa river sub basin for the past 21 years when compared with the past and present data lower transmissivity t values are observed where the difference of depth to groundwater level between pre and post monsoon seasons are more and vice versa groundwater potential areas are identified with less fluctuation of water table storage coefficient s is found to be lower where the kaolinisation is more predominant at the main kandivalasa river which is flowing from north to south direction 2d resistivity investigations have revealed that the kaolinisation is increasing towards the stream which is responsible for reduction of storage coefficient all along the main stream based on transmissivity distribution eastern part of the study area is identified as having good groundwater potential zones whereas most of the western side of the basin having less groundwater potential zones consequently only open wells are recommended near the stream courses whereas bore wells as well as recharge wells can be constructed at middle uplands on either side of the main stream acknowledgements the authors are thankful to science and engineering research board serb govt of india for funding the research project

india corresponding author geohydrological investigations were carried out in kandivalasa river sub basin a typical khondalitic terrain near cheepurupalli town of vizianagaram district andhra pradesh india by collecting groundwater levels and conducting fourteen pumping tests during the years 2013 2015 groundwater levels were measured during pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons at forty one locations covering the entire basin contour maps were drawn and it is found that there is 10 m depletion of groundwater levels as a whole in the basin for the past 21 years however there were pockets of more groundwater depletion in view of the high density of wells at some places lower transmissivity values are observed where differences of depth to water levels between pre and post monsoon seasons are high groundwater potential areas are identified with less fluctuation of water table lower storage coefficient values are found where the kaolinisation is more predominant at the main kandivalasa river 2d resistivity imaging has also revealed that the kaolinisation is increasing towards the stream which is responsible for reduction of storage coefficient all along the main stream based on transmissivity distribution eastern part of the study area is identified as high groundwater potential zone while most of the western side of the basin is having less groundwater potential zone graphical abstract fx1 keywords geohydrological investigations transmissivity storage coefficient khondalite kaolinisation kandivalasa river sub basin 1 introduction peninsular india has discontinuous hill ranges popularly known as eastern ghats all along the east coast of india at an average distance varying from 0 to 100 km forming well developed river basins sarma 1982 most of this terrain is covered with khondalitic suit garneti ferrous siliminite gneiss of rocks which are sedimentary in origin and later they become hard rocks after metamorphism krishna rao 1952 assessment of aquifer hydraulic properties is essential first step for building a groundwater flow model and thereby estimating the input and output stresses of the aquifer the main objective of this paper is to estimate the transmissivity t and storage coefficient s and relate them to the earlier concepts about the groundwater potential zones in the present study t and s are estimated in kandivalasa river sub basin covered with khondalitic terrain of cheepurupally mandal an administrative unit within the district vizianagaram district of andhra pradesh india by conducting pumping tests generally groundwater is available in weathered and fractured zones under unconfined to semi confined conditions quite often the highly weathered layer or kaolinised layer is acting as barrier at low lying areas near the stream and causing accumulation of water at mid land areas venkateswara rao and briz kishore 1991 the average annual rainfall is around 1000 mm which is mostly lost as surface runoff and evapotranspiration only one fifth of it is recharging to groundwater mondal et al 2008 venkateswara rao et al 2007 boulton and pontin 1971 and neuman 1975 analyzed the pumping test data from anisotropic unconfined aquifers in various hard rocks many authors namely barker 1988 black 1994 prodanoff et al 2006 have successfully analyzed aquifer parameters in different hard rock regions maréchal et al 2003 adopted different methods to know the complexity of groundwater flows in a granitic terrain near hyderabad india jain 1977 has clearly described that in situ test or pumping test is the most effective way to determine the hydraulic properties in the hard rock aquifer and to quantify the groundwater resources of water bearing layers according to the study of clark 1988 pumping tests can also be done in large diameter wells in the hard rock terrain for the hydraulic studies and to evaluate the aquifer characteristics the data obtained from pumping test can be analyzed using two types of formula namely those applicable to steady state and those applicable to non steady state conditions constant rate pumping tests and recovery tests are analyzed by elhag 2015 to determine the aquifer characteristics which include transmissibility t and the storage coefficient s in the current study pumping tests have been conducted to evaluate the aquifer parameters by adopting cooper jacob method cooper and jacob 1946 this is a very simple method introduced by cooper and jacob for determining the formation coefficients and aquifer characteristics cooper and jacob have shown that when plotted on semi logarithmic paper the theoretical drawdown curve approaches a straight line when sufficient time has elapsed after pumping started the cooper jacob method gives aquifer properties and coefficients accurately when compared with the type curve solution provided by thies jack and hudson 1961 the study by meier et al 1998 has revealed that the cooper jacob method can be used for estimating effective transmissivity values in many formations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the khonalitic terrain of kandivalasa river sub basin krsb of vizianagaram district in andhra pradesh india is shown in fig 1 the krsb is covered with a typical khondalitic suite of rocks and is situated between east longitudes of 83 32 15 to 83 39 10 and north latitudes of 18 9 15 to 18 19 54 and has an areal extent of 124 km2 it forms a part of survey of india topo sheet nos e 44 l11 and e 44 l12 in general the area is covered by a thick soil cover 1 4 m followed by weathered and fractured khondalitic formation underlain by basement of granite gneiss the area is highly disturbed due to folding faulting and fracturing with isolated hills covered by khondalitic rocks on the top and lateritic soils on the sides fig 2 occasionally quartz veins are seen exposed to surface often serving as guide to locate high yielding wells the topography of the area is undulating at all locations between hills there is a high slope in the foot hill region and a gentle slope towards the valley fig 3 frequently small plateaus are also observed the average annual rainfall is around 1000 mm venkateswara rao and briz kishore 1990 groundwater occurs under semi confined conditions in the weathered portion of the khondalitic formation but the fact that the raise of water table in the bore well after penetrating the fractured environment and drying up of nearby open wells after pumpage of bore wells demonstrate that the weathered and fractured environments are hydrologically connected and the fractured environment is under semi confining conditions venkateswara rao and briz kishore 1991 it was observed by venkateswara rao 2009 that groundwater potential areas are those where less fluctuation of water table between pre and post monsoon seasons is observed in this paper it is verified whether the higher transmissivity areas are coinciding with the areas of less fluctuation of water table or not it is also verified whether low lying areas has low values of transmissivity and storage coefficient as these areas are nearer to the main stream and the formations below the streams are mostly kaolinised zones venkateswara rao 1998 2 2 field data collection the pumping test method is usually preferred for groundwater development and management on a regional scale and for determining aquifer hydraulic characteristics singhal and gupta 1999 pre and post monsoon water levels at 41 locations covering the study area were collected during the years 2013 2014 and 2015 and analyzed by preparing groundwater contour maps with the help of surfer software otutu 2011 pumping tests were conducted at 14 wells using cooper jacob method uhl and sharma 1978 during december 2014 and 2015 the data was analyzed for estimating t and s of the aquifer only irrigation bore wells are used both for pumping wells as well as observation wells for conducting the pumping tests at the fourteen locations before starting to pump water from the wells the water levels from the ground level were measured with the water level indicator the discharge rate during pumping was determined from the time taken to fill the 20 lt bucket pumping well and observation wells were selected in such a way that they are not more than 70 m distance except pumping well no other well was pumped in the vicinity of the pumping and observation wells drawdowns are observed in the observation well till study state conditions are achieved gernand and heidtman 1997 residual drawdowns were also observed to cross check the t obtained in the normal pumping test singh 2000 in this study drawdown measurements were made for a period of 100 135 min with an initial interval of 1 min up to 10 min and later at an interval of 5 min till water level reach the study state condition the transmissivity and storage coefficient values are estimated by using cooper jacob method and the contour maps of t and s values are prepared using surfer software the transmissivity distribution is compared and analyzed with the ground water potential index gwpi and groundwater fluctuation maps of the basin the storage coefficient distribution map is analyzed in conjunction with the two dimensional 2d resistivity imaging conducted near the main stream to find the presence of kaolinization 2 3 calculation of aquifer characteristics the pumping tests are performed by pumping a well and observing the resulting drawdowns in an observation well as described in the cooper jacob method cooper and jacob 1946 hence the method consists of drawing a straight line through the late time data points and extending it backward to the point of zero drawdown time axis intercept which is designated as t0 meier et al 1998 the drawdown per log cycle is obtained from the slope of the line values for transmissivity t and storativity s can be calculated from the following equations maréchal et al 2010 1 transmissivity t 2 3 q 4 π s 2 storage coefficient s 2 25 t t 0 r 2 where q is the constant pumping rate δs is drawdown for one log cycle time t0 is the time since pumping began to just before drawdown starts and r is the radial distance to the observation well 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological investigations depth to water level contour maps of post monsoon seasons of 1993 and 2014 figs 4 and 5 are compared to observe the change in groundwater levels for the past 21 years from the contour maps it can be observed that there is 10 m depletion of groundwater levels as a whole in the basin for the past 21 years 3 2 geohydrological investigations transmissivity and storage coefficient are among the most important geohydrological data needed for managing groundwater resources transmissivity describes the ability of an aquifer to transmit water over the entire saturated thickness transmissivity is defined as the rate at which water of a certain prevailing kinematic viscosity is transmitted through a unit width of the aquifer under a unit hydraulic gradient todd 1980 similarly todd 1980 has also defined the storage coefficient s as the volume of water that an aquifer releases or takes into storage per unit surface area of the aquifer per unit component of the head normal to that surface in an unconfined aquifer the storage coefficient corresponds to its specific yield the geohydrological conditions of the area have been evaluated based on the pumping test results the obtained transmissivity and storage coefficient values in the study area are presented in table 1 it can be observed from the table 1 that the lower transmissivity values of 26 712 m2 day and 37 195 m2 day are obtained at itakarlapalli and karkam villages respectively the values as high as 253 90 m2 day and 304 13 m2 day are observed at peripi and gollapalem villages respectively the storage coefficient values are varying from 0 000291 at itakarlapalli low to 0 00915 at chinanadipalli high the spatial distributions of transmissivity and storage coefficient values are shown in figs 6 and 9 respectively 3 2 1 analysis of transmissivity distribution with gwpi and groundwater level fluctuations fig 7 represents the contour map of ground water potential index gwpi based on hydrogeophysical and hydrogeological parameters in the study area venkateswara rao 1995 gwpi is computed as sum of the products of weights of various variables multiplied with their rating however the selections of variables and their relative weights are completely rests with the groundwater exploration experts working in the terrain but rating depends on the success range of the individual parameters that is highest rating is given to a particular range of a parameter means more number of successful wells are cited in that range venkateswara rao 2009 the more the gwpi of a site the better the chances to have a higher yield the gwpi computed with the above method is coinciding with potential areas of the basin under study this map is helpful to identify the groundwater potential zones in the basin from this map eastern part of the study area is identified as good groundwater potential zones having the high groundwater potential index more than 30 whereas most of the western side of the basin having less potential index less than 30 is identified as low groundwater potential area the contour map of the transmissivity distribution in the study area fig 6 is having good correlation with the ground water potential index map indicating that transmissivity values are more where the groundwater potential is high and transmissivity values are less where the groundwater potential is low the contour map of difference of depth to water level between pre and post monsoon seasons of 2014 fig 8 is also prepared to prove the concept that less groundwater fluctuations in the study area indicates more groundwater potential venkateswara rao 2003 the well census data of the basin has also been collected to find out the abstraction rate in the basin the well census data suggest that even though huge numbers of bore wells are being pumped in the south eastern and western parts of the basin those areas are observed with less groundwater fluctuations fig 8 contrary to the above situation from fig 8 it can be observed that there are pockets of high groundwater depletion where the difference of depth to water level for pre and post monsoon seasons is high due to the more number of bore wells at these places namely boppadam kothapeta karkam itakarlapally and sivaram these areas are also associated with the low transmissivity values fig 6 from the three figures fig 6 fig 7 and fig 8 it can be observed that low groundwater potential areas are having the low transmissivity values with high groundwater fluctuations high groundwater potential areas are with high transmissivity values with less groundwater fluctuations which are identified at gollapalem velpurai chinnanadipalli and peripi in the eastern side of the study area 3 2 2 analysis of storage coefficient storage coefficient distribution in the study area is shown in fig 9 from this figure it can be observed that extreme sides of eastern and western areas are having high storage coefficient values whereas along the main stream very low storage coefficient values are observed as the formations are kaolinised along the main stream the main problem in the khondalitic terrain is kaolinisation which is a process that makes the khondalitic rock becoming clay due to high weathering when it is in contact with water when the khondalitic rock become partly or fully clay due to kaolinisation it is unable to support high well yield venkateswara rao 1995 the yield might have been reduced due to infilling of fractures with kaolinite and other weathering products pailet 2007 earlier geophysical investigations venkateswara rao 1998 in the study area fig 10 have revealed the fact that all along the length of the river the aquifer thickness is least due to kaolinisation of the formation this phenomenon is noticeable in the profile fig 10 across the basin the aquifer thickness is maximum on either side of the river and the kaolinised layer thickness is maximum below the river thus the flanks and adjacent upland areas are having more potential than the lower topographic elevations in the middle of the basin 3 3 two dimensional resistivity imaging surveys kaolinised zones contain sticky clay material and are more conductive in nature when they are saturated with water these zones generally identified with the low resistivity of less than 25 ohm m in the khondalitic terrain venkateswara rao et al 2013 to observe the kaolinisation problem in detail near the stream area two dimensional 2d resistivity imaging surveys are carried out at sivaram village fig 11 three 2d profiles are selected in such a way that they are parallel to the direction of the stream these 2d profiles are having the profile interval of 10 m to each other and are carried out one after other towards the stream the highly weathered zone is identified with the resistivity values below 25 ohm m fig 11 shows that the kaolinisation is increasing from profile to profile towards the stream which means that the second profile is having more kaolinisation at the location of the failed well than first profile and the third profile which is close to the stream is having more kaolinisation than second profile fig 12 represents the 2d resistivity image carried out perpendicular to the direction of the stream at failed well in the sivaram village failed well is placed almost middle of the profile in this case also the highly weathered material that is below 25 ohm m is increasing towards the stream the effect of kaolinisation is maximum at the end of the profile which is very close to the stream the above study implies that all along the stream courses groundwater potential is low due to kaolinisation of the aquifer and not suitable for bore well pumping may be suitable for open wells at the middle uplands away from on either side of the main stream the area is suitable for bore well pumping as well as for recharging as the aquifer is moderately weathered and fractured 4 conclusions there is 10 m depletion of groundwater levels as a whole in the kandivalasa river sub basin for the past 21 years when compared with the past and present data lower transmissivity t values are observed where the difference of depth to groundwater level between pre and post monsoon seasons are more and vice versa groundwater potential areas are identified with less fluctuation of water table storage coefficient s is found to be lower where the kaolinisation is more predominant at the main kandivalasa river which is flowing from north to south direction 2d resistivity investigations have revealed that the kaolinisation is increasing towards the stream which is responsible for reduction of storage coefficient all along the main stream based on transmissivity distribution eastern part of the study area is identified as having good groundwater potential zones whereas most of the western side of the basin having less groundwater potential zones consequently only open wells are recommended near the stream courses whereas bore wells as well as recharge wells can be constructed at middle uplands on either side of the main stream acknowledgements the authors are thankful to science and engineering research board serb govt of india for funding the research project

canada france england italy etc and confederations united states european union have developed frameworks to guide decision making process to protect these valuable resources through the guidelines of

are promoting hydrogeological studies to produce basic hydrogeological documents to prevent water scarcity and pollution this is specially the case of coastal and peri urban aquifers were the accelerated socio economic and industrial development causes increased pressure on available resources and creates a threat to the groundwater quality elewa et al 2013 güler et al 2013 martínez santos et al 2008 saidi et al 2011 salhi et al 2008 samey and gang 2008 in the coastal area of northern morocco the intense demographic economic industrial and touristic acceleration during the last two decades have improved infrastructure and living conditions but it increases also the stress on a water sector that already experiences serious quality and quantity problems in urban zones several non conform behaviors are observed such as the multiplication of urban and industrial pollutants effluents with poor or no treatment the propagation of illegal pumping and the land use mutations that cause changes in the natural water systems the mountainous aspect of northern morocco allows only the appearance of some restricted intra mountainous coastal plains giving rise to the main urban poles and touristic villages extended all along the mediterranean coast within this context the martil alila plain administratively belonging mainly to territories of the urban communes of tetouan and martil contains the most important alluvial aquifer in the area from quantitative qualitative and strategic points of view the numerous public facilities throughout its watershed dam construction pumping etc and the frequent rainfall variability has negatively affected the aquifer piezometric decline marine intrusion and quality deterioration for these reasons the principal goal of this study is to provide hydrogeological characterization of martil alila aquifer and to assess the effectivity of different groundwater vulnerability methods 1 1 study area geologically the study area belongs to the rif belt which forms the southern limb of the gibraltar arc which itself is part of the larger mediterranean alpine belts within this context martil alila is a coastal plain covering a surface of 100 km2 crossed and drained by two rivers martil in the south and alila in the north fig 1 it is a plain of plio quaternary alluvial deposits with dominance of detritic sediments particularly sands gravels conglomerates and clays which rest over a marly paleozoic bedrock himi et al 2017 this alluvial deposits are filling a triangular geological depression that results from an extensive phase which apparently interrupted the continuity of the calcareous mesozoic range the paleozoic ghomarides complex and flyschs nappes chalouan et al 2008 piqué and bouabdelli 2000 1 2 climatic setting the study area is characterized by a mediterranean tempered climate with dry summers and mild moist winters at the watershed level the average annual rainfall is 700 mm approximatively and the annual average temperature is 18 c however the mountainous aspect creates climatic sub zones where conditions may diverge considerably from the general context thus the average annual rainfall varies from 500 up to 1075 mm according to the geographical position within the watershed trend analysis of annual and seasonal time series shows a rainfall increase since 1995 96 with frequent intense and abundant rains causing violent torrents and floods unlike it was expected by previous scenarios based on the succession of extended dry periods during the 1970s 80 s and first half of the 90 s the 5 years rainfall analysis fig 2 and rainfall anomaly charts fig 3 report that same observation which suggest a rainfall increase in the upcoming years that could be reflected in runoff and aquifer recharge nevertheless the historical records show the high probability of sudden and prolonged changes in the precipitation regime therefore seasonal rainfall variability in the martil alila watershed is very significant mainly between winters and summers records indicate only 2 of the annual rainfall average in summers against over 42 in winters in autumn and spring rainfall ranges between 24 and 30 table 1 the monthly rainfall changes significantly with trend of extreme interannual variations according to a standard deviation that hovers around 70 mm on average from a monthly point of view rainfall increases progressively from october to december then it decreases slowly until late may when dry period begins spatial distribution of the annual average rainfall in the martil alila watershed was studied through records of over 15 regional rainfall gauges the map fig 4 shows an increase of rainfall from the martil alila coastal plain under 800 mm to the high mountains upstream the watershed over 1000 mm looking at the watershed aspect it is observed that the topographical and geographical locations have a strong impact on rainfall variability the spatial distribution of rainfall is closely correlated with topographic conditions as suggested in many studies in mountainous regions buytaert et al 2006 fries et al 2012 ochoa et al 2016 rollenbeck and bendix 2011 thus in our case the highest annual average rainfall over 1000 mm is correlated with elevations of more than 800 m obviously the heavy cloud masses are discharged mainly inside the mountainous belt which act as an atmospheric barrier when they are lighter these cloudy masses transit to the plains where they discharge less precipitations otherwise many rainfall microzones are observed due to the regional complexity of topographical and geographical settings apart from upstream thermal variations in the martil alila watershed are slightly moderated due to the proximity to sea thus the monthly temperatures average varies progressively between 13 c in january and 25 c in july 1 3 hydrogeological description from the hydrogeological point of view a multilayered system is clearly identified typical in the alluvial intramountainous mediterranean aquifers which is due to several marine and continental sedimentological quaternary phases stitou el messari 2002 this system consists on an upper sandy gravelly layer and a deep one mainly composed of plio quaternary conglomerates fig 5 often these two layers are separated by a less permeable clayey silty aquitard unit deposited during the flandrian transgression this intermediate unit is characterized by variable thicknesses and depths fig 5 it is thick and extended in the center and east while it is thin and discontinuous in the west and northeast giving rise in some places to a monolayer system this last unit contains imbibed marine water remnants that could be mobilized while pumping giving brackish water this phenomenon explains the salinity of groundwater in the central area where earlier studies erroneously assumed the existence of a marine invasion contrary to the piezometric and geophysical considerations benabdelouahab et al 2012 the aquifer basement is formed by a more or less continuous impermeable clayey marly layer detected by mechanical drilling vertical electric soundings and electric tomography profiles it has a complex and irregular morphology characterized by several sinuosities and depressions especially in the center and east area following the irregular shape of the deep paleozoic bedrock himi et al 2017 the clayey marly basement is shallow upstream the alila river the northwestern edge and near the archeological city of tamouda western area nearby the edges the aquifer is deposited directly on the bedrock formed by the adjacent units christallophylien bedrock at north pelitic at west calcareous on both sides of the tetouan city and paleozoic at south and northwest areas at the central area by the airport sector the basement becomes deeper while extending longitudinally toward the ene it maximum depth more than 70 m is reached near the city of martil fig 5 the piezometric analysis reveals a decreasing hydraulic gradient toward downstream typical of a converging aquifer in the northern area the flow direction is oriented nw se while it follows a dominant direction wsw ene at the southern area at the central zone the piezometric levels south of the martil river are shallow near coelma district giving rise to a few marshes the aquifer receives lateral inflow runoff from hills mostly from the southern edges where several seasonal and permanent streams are fed by flows from the karstic aquifer of the calcareous ridge there is also inflow upstream from the martil and alila rivers and at the northern edges near the tetouan city the main outflow components are discharge toward sea and pumping for drinking agriculture and industrial purposes many studies indicate the existence of several depressions below sea level located at the north of martil city at the center near coelma district and at the west near tamouda district stitou el messari 2002 benabdelouahab 2012 the first two depressions are due to private pumping while the third is due to public pumping for water supply water exchanges between the aquifer and the martil and alila rivers are flowing in both directions by area according to water levels difference and to the rivers bed s permeability thus while piezometric isolines define draining role upstream of these two rivers they locally show discharging flows in the center and downstream intra annual piezometric fluctuation does not exceed 1 5 m and it is directly related to rainfall regime and lateral runoff el morabiti 1991 stitou el messari 2002 otherwise historical comparison shows a relevant decrease in the piezometric levels benabdelouahab et al 2012 el morabiti 1991 stitou el messari 2002 thauvain 1971 this situation is a direct result of the occurrence of an extended dry period combined with the increase of groundwater extractions and dam construction upstream 2 materials and methods 2 1 geophysical study for this study two complementary geophysical methods vertical electrical sounding ves and electrical resistivity tomography ert have been used in combination with hydrogeological data for defining the geometry of the aquifer and assessing the extension of the aquitard layers direct interpretation of apparent electrical resistivity measurements is not easy in alluvial aquifer where values vary slightly and or intercalations of layers with intermediate resistivity are frequent a special attention should be required to correlate the resistivity survey results with the lithological and hydrogeological information obtained from neighboring boreholes to calibrate the thickness of the geoelectrical layers and constrain the inversion process edet and okereke 2002 fortunately abundant information from local 58 well distributed boreholes were used to overcome this fig 1 in this paper 119 ves measurements distributed homogenously under schlumberger standard array were interpreted the maximum spacing between current electrodes ab changes according to the sounding situation within the plain and to the estimated bedrock depth as follows 1 ves with an ab line length of 4000 m 5 of 2000 m 34 of 1000 m 22 of 800 m and 57 vess between 300 and 600 m ves field data were interpreted after 1d forward modeling and inversion through an interactive graphically oriented forward and inverse modeling program for interpreting resistivity sounding data in terms of a layered earth 1 d model direct interpretation allows to estimate the layered model directly from the data curve without having to manually construct the number of layers or layer resistivity and thickness başokur 1990 inverse modeling allows to obtain a model that best fits the data in a least squares sense using ridge regression to interactively adjust the starting model parameters the result of a ves curve interpretation is a layered model of the subsurface with thicknesses h and electrical resistivities ρs characterizing each layer these models can provide information on the lithology of the subsoil and the salinity of the groundwater ρw benkabbour et al 2004 himi et al 2017 ves interpretation was complicated due to frequent layer intercalations and low contrast of recurrent clayey sandy layer mixtures with intermediate resistivity values however scattered and abundant ert results and borehole data made it possible to overcome these complications offering thus good correlations three examples of this good correlation between ves and boreholes are presented in the following ves 19 2 located northern the alila river shows a six layered resistivity model table 2 well correlated with the borehole 1074 2 situated within 230 m it indicates a shallow thick loamy sand resistant level and a second deeper resistant level correlated with coarse sand and gravels separated by a thick conductive clayey level the resistant crystallophyllian basement is identified at 52 m approximatively ves 46 2 located northern martil city were correlated with the borehole 734 2 situated within 80 m two resistant coarse sand layers at 4 and 33 m depth respectively are observed with several clay interlayers of different thicknesses fig 6 similar observations are perceived in the ves 85 2 near coelma district correlated with the borehole 743 2 situated within 100 m ves interpretation indicates that the deep substratum lithologically and geoelectrically variable is only identified near the aquifer boundaries because of its significant depth at the center and to the low resistivity contrast in relation to the alluvial filling then two resistant levels constitute the upper layer medium to coarse sands and deep coarse alluvium of this bilayer locally multilayer aquifer these two resistant levels are mostly separated by a continuous conductive level constituting a semi permeable aquitard formed of clay and sandy loams ves reveals also the existence of a network of geoelectric discontinuities interpreted as an extensive normal synsedimentary faults system that affects the alluvial filling these faults system is located mainly southern the plain and toward the east giving rise to several geological depressions furthermore an ert survey of 18 measurements were performed under wenner schlumberger mixed array with a multielectrode resistivity meter 48 switch of 480 m line length and a standard 10 m electrode spacings ert field data were interpreted after a 2d resistivity modeling software designed to invert large data sets collected with a multielectrode system loke 1997 this is designed to interpolate and interpret field data of electrical geophysical prospecting of electrical resistivity and induced polarization uhlemann et al 2017 the inversion of the resistivity and ip data was conducted by least square method involving finite element and finite difference methods the software can handle data from any electrode array and invert data from the most popular geophysical instruments hellman et al 2016 ert and ves inversion results recovering all the aquifer were well correlated to close borehole data and were useful thus to establish geoelectrical models and to assess groundwater vulnerability described in the following 2 2 vulnerability assessment groundwater pollution impact is persistent while its treatment is complicated and expensive hence prevention and protection are essential for its efficient management in this sense vulnerability assessment is a crucial way to support decision making by understanding current intrinsic conditions and for a better coordination of the future development projects groundwater vulnerability is the susceptibility of an aquifer to be unlikely affected by a pollution load foster and hirata 1988 it is defined by the intrinsic properties of the unsaturated vadose zone that determine the aquifer sensitivity to a pollution load applied from the surface ref vrba and zaporozec 1994 used in this way the term groundwater vulnerability is often referred to as intrinsic vulnerability to distinguish it from specific vulnerability a term that is generally preferred for situations where the role and behavior of a specific contaminant is explicitly considered in the analysis qian et al 2012 subjectively vulnerability maps should indicate clearly and precisely detailed information on potential impact upon water quality based on land zonation gogu and dassargues 2000 salhi et al 2008 several methods have been developed to assess intrinsic groundwater vulnerability table 3 involving a combination between hydrogeological parameters such as depth to groundwater table characteristics of the subsurface layers and hydraulic conductivity aller et al 1987 civita and de maio 2000 foster and hirata 1988 foster et al 2002 kirsch 2009 qian et al 2012 stempvoort et al 1993 ref vrba and zaporozec 1994 then this combination is interpreted through a cartographic process by the assignment of intervals and or classes to produce a vulnerability index map drastic aller et al 1987 is a standardized approach for assessing groundwater pollution vulnerability that has achieved world wide recognition since its development over 30 years ago it consists of parameters rating system where each one is evaluated by a relative weight ranging from 1 to 5 that indicates its relative importance compared to the other parameters sintacs civita and de maio 2000 is an italian approach inspired by drastic and adapted for the mediterranean hydrogeological context both methods consider seven different weighted parameters god foster and hirata 1988 is a similar empirical approach which considers only three equal weight parameters and where groundwater vulnerability index focalizes on the mitigation abilities of the unsaturated zone later this approach was improved to enhance its effectiveness and to provide a relevant tool for integrated soil and water management thus the susceptibility of soil cover was incorporated as a fourth parameter to create the gods approach foster et al 2002 avi stempvoort et al 1993 is an easy approach since it depends only on two parameters hydraulic conductivity and thickness of unsaturated zone without any relative weighting in many cases the application of these approaches is often complicated due to its limitations or to the deficiency of accurate and well distributed data in the drastic approach for example results can be ambiguous and open to more than one interpretation lim et al 2009 the most common problem however is the lack of adequate field data for one or more parameters benabdelouahab et al 2012 diaz et al 2006 draoui et al 2008 kirsch 2009 qian et al 2012 salhi and benabdelouahab 2017 salhi et al 2008 vias et al 2005 hence many authors made modifications to the original assessment approach to adapt it to their own circumstances fritch et al 2000 meng et al 2007 neshat et al 2014 panagopoulos et al 2006 sener and davraz 2013 indeed the natural protection of an aquifer depends on its protective layers which are related to the thickness and hydraulic properties of the unsaturated zone akpan et al 2015 christiansen et al 2014 díaz et al 2008 kirsch 2009 omosuyi and oseghale 2012 stempvoort et al 1993 thus groundwater vulnerability changes proportionally to the hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated zone and inversely proportional to its thickness kirsch 2009 salhi and benabdelouahab 2017 the analysis of the different approaches indicates that they are based on the interpolation of the borehole data several studies have shown the utility of geophysical data to improve vulnerability assessment akpan et al 2015 christiansen et al 2014 díaz et al 2008 kirsch 2009 omosuyi and oseghale 2012 it is widely accepted that the key parameters of vulnerability assessment are closely related to the underground clay content this is the case of the hydraulic conductivity taken into account directly or indirectly in most approaches the clay particles are much smaller than the grains of sand so that the clay particles within a sandy clay layer can block the narrow channels connecting the intergranular pores so as to reduce considerably the hydraulic conductivity of this layer the rate of clay influences greatly the electrical conductivity or its inverse the electrical resistivity thus the increase of the clay rate within a layer leads to the reduction of the electrical resistivity and vice versa kalinski and kelly 1993 several studies have also demonstrated the existence of an inverse correlation between hydraulic and electrical conductivity díaz et al 2008 kirsch 2009 the good correlation between the underground parameters clay contents and hydraulic conductivity and the electrical resistivity allows the vulnerability assessment through geoelectric or electromagnetic measurements the results of these measurements can be used to evaluate the clay content deduce hydraulic conductivity and assess vulnerability even when drilling data are scarce indeed the propagation of a pollutant through the unsaturated zone is influenced by several interconnected and complex parameters in the case of alluvial aquifers the attenuation of pollution is closely related to the purification capacity of the unsaturated zone layers which depends on the clay content and the abundance of the organic matter otherwise an aquifer is less vulnerable when it is surmounted by conductive electrically impermeable hydrogeologically thick and continuous clayey layers these layers are characterized by typical low electrical resistivity values in the avi approach stempvoort et al 1993 a protection index pi is calculated on the basis of the hydraulic conductivity k i and the thickness h i of the unsaturated zone according to the following expression pi i 1 n 1 k i h i taking into account the good correlation between hydraulic and electrical conductivity kirsch 2009 and between this last and the clay content kalinski and kelly 1993 a geophysical protection index gpi was deduced by replacing hydraulic conductivity by electric in the preceding equation casas et al 2005 gpi i 1 n 1 ρ i h i gpi takes high values when the conductive clayey layer is thick in this case the aquifer will be better protected against potential pollution introduced from the soil surface 3 results and conclusions the shared interest to protect groundwater resources motivates the scientific community to develop approaches to assess vulnerability to pollution the divergence of ideologies means and techniques leads to the emergence of a range of different approaches in several countries the application of these approaches is complicated by the lack of adequate hydrogeological data in this paper a comparative geostatistical analysis of one geophysical gpi and five empirical approaches drastc sintacs god gods and avi is carried out to confront their cartographic results fig 7 in an alluvial aquifer under mediterranean context in order to simplify the visual comparison between the six maps vulnerability classes where homogenized to four less vulnerable grouping low and very low vulnerability classes moderately vulnerable vulnerable corresponding to high vulnerability class and very vulnerable grouping very and extremely high classes regarding the spatial distribution of vulnerability classes the analysis shows that the six approaches concord that at least two thirds of the aquifer are vulnerable or moderately vulnerable mostly at the north near alila river in the marshes coelma district and all over the coastal sector from martil to cabo negro less vulnerable sectors center contains high proportions of clay and silt combined with deeper water table the influence of the intrinsic parameters of the unsaturated zone thickness and hydraulic or electric conductivity is relevant in our case other parameters are either indirectly repeated such as the unsaturated zone lithology and the aquifer type or less influent such as recharge homogenous among the aquifer topography very low slope and the saturated zone lithology once the pollutant reaches this zone the aquifer will be partially or totally contaminated the geostatistical pixel to pixel analysis table 4 reveals good correlations between the results from gpi and avi god and gods as well as drastic and sintacs the correlation between drastic and sintacs results shows a conceptual similarity in both approaches against differences at parametric weights intervals and rating system this is the reason of the apparent disparity between the corresponding two maps however the two maps show that almost all the aquifer is vulnerable or moderately vulnerable which is unreasonable in the center souani sector where water table is deeper and fine grained alluvium are abundant god and gods have the same conceptual schemes intervals weights and rating system the only distinction is the soil type parameter in gods which changes the aspect of the corresponding map avi and gpi depends on the spatial interpolation of two parameters punctual data the thickness and the hydraulic avi or electric conductivity gpi of the unsaturated zone although these conceptual similarity both approaches show clear differences in the corresponding maps due to the following two reasons on one hand avi depends on insufficient and poorly distributed punctual measurements of hydraulic conductivity which may distort the result otherwise gpi uses abundant homogenous and recent field measurement very well distributed over the totality of the aquifer on the other hand the maps final aspect is a reflection of the intervals disparities between both approaches despite of these differences these two approaches show locally good correlations where there is enough hydraulic conductivity data this is the case of the center and the coastal sector the number of parameters is clearly reflected on the spatial distribution of vulnerability classes this is the case of drastic and sintacs where the seven employed parameters increases the vulnerability relatively to other approaches otherwise the final map in the four approaches drastic sintacs gods and god is a result of a cartographic overlying process thus the interaction between the parametric maps may lead locally to the appearance of spatially connected areas but divergent in vulnerability response 3 1 validation the validation of the vulnerability approach output should be assessed by tracers nguyet and goldscheider 2006 or by field measured geochemical and microbiological data pathak and hiratsuka 2011 in this paper it is accomplished via the results of field measurements and laboratory analysis made by the loukkos hydraulic basin agency abhl 2015 in 16 groundwater sampling wells the analysis results table 5 shows a poor or moderate water quality in most of samples compared to the quality standards adopted in morocco abhl 2015 most samples indicate high conductivity values reference value 750 1300 µs cm and high concentration of chloride reference value 200 300 mg l measured values were overlaid on the gpi vulnerability map using gis to correlate water quality with vulnerable zones thence it is observed that sampling wells that were highly contaminated are in vulnerable zones while those that were moderately or non contaminated are in less vulnerable zones fig 8 from this result it can be concluded that vulnerability map predicted by gpi approach is reliable in our case therefore water managers can use this result to conduct the groundwater protection strategy in the study area this will be more useful compared to results generated by conventional overlay index method like drastic sintacs and others 4 discussion in conclusion the aspect of vulnerability map in each approach depends on the number of parameters interaction between them and their attributes rating system intervals weights and vulnerability classes furthermore it depends also on the data quality and distribution which in our case constraint the application of classic empirical approaches however the geophysical approach gpi uses recent well distributed abundant and reliable data groundwater pollution receives particular attention in south mediterranean countries where effective protection strategies must aim the prevention and require continuous and reliable data to discern current and future problems vulnerability maps should be established for all the productive aquifers revised periodically and updated whenever modifications affect physical environment or knowledge these maps are an essential guide to ensure sustainable socio economic development and efficient territorial management instead of applying universal controls over land use and effluent discharge to the ground it is more cost effective and less prejudicial to economic development to utilize the natural contaminant attenuation capacity of the strata overlying the aquifer when defining the level of control necessary to protect groundwater quality simple and robust zones based on aquifer pollution vulnerability and source protection perimeters need to be established with matrices that indicate what activities are possible and where they are at an acceptable risk to groundwater foster et al 2002 in this study like in many others results show that two parameters dominate the protection process in alluvial aquifers the depth to water table and the properties of unsaturated zone these two parameters are easily obtained through geophysical field measurements to provide consistent data for groundwater vulnerability assessment despite its regional importance the aquifer of martil alila is mostly vulnerable to pollution and to marine intrusion consequently urgent continuous and well studied protection actions should be achieved to avoid the complexity of these problems and to restore its perfect state therefore it is suggested to set up one or more artificial recharge basins the authorities should be vigilant to inhibit any direct or indirect material spillage or discharge that may alter the groundwater quality moreover all activities must comply with laws and standards of water resources protection pumping must be closely monitored to avoid any piezometric decline especially in the coastal area and in the alila plain acknowledgment this study was supported by the national center for scientific research and technique cnrst morocco under

pumping etc and the frequent rainfall variability has negatively affected the aquifer piezometric decline marine intrusion and quality deterioration for these reasons the principal goal of this study is to provide hydrogeological characterization of martil alila aquifer and to assess the effectivity of different groundwater vulnerability methods 1 1 study area geologically the study area belongs to the rif belt which forms the southern limb of the gibraltar arc which itself is part of the larger mediterranean alpine belts within this context martil alila is a coastal plain covering a surface of 100 km2 crossed and drained by two rivers martil in the south and alila in the north fig 1 it is a plain of plio quaternary alluvial deposits with dominance of detritic sediments particularly sands gravels conglomerates and clays which rest over a marly paleozoic bedrock himi et al 2017 this alluvial deposits are filling a triangular geological depression that results from an extensive phase which apparently interrupted the continuity of the calcareous mesozoic range the paleozoic ghomarides complex and flyschs nappes chalouan et al 2008 piqué and bouabdelli 2000 1 2 climatic setting the study area is characterized by a mediterranean tempered climate with dry summers and mild moist winters at the watershed level the average annual rainfall is 700 mm approximatively and the annual average temperature is 18 c however the mountainous aspect creates climatic sub zones where conditions may diverge considerably from the general context thus the average annual rainfall varies from 500 up to 1075 mm according to the geographical position within the watershed trend analysis of annual and seasonal time series shows a rainfall increase since 1995 96 with frequent intense and abundant rains causing violent torrents and floods unlike it was expected by previous scenarios based on the succession of extended dry periods during the 1970s 80 s and first half of the 90 s the 5 years rainfall analysis fig 2 and rainfall anomaly charts fig 3 report that same observation which suggest a rainfall increase in the upcoming years that could be reflected in runoff and aquifer recharge nevertheless the historical records show the high probability of sudden and prolonged changes in the precipitation regime therefore seasonal rainfall variability in the martil alila watershed is very significant mainly between winters and summers records indicate only 2 of the annual rainfall average in summers against over 42 in winters in autumn and spring rainfall ranges between 24 and 30 table 1 the monthly rainfall changes significantly with trend of extreme interannual variations according to a standard deviation that hovers around 70 mm on average from a monthly point of view rainfall increases progressively from october to december then it decreases slowly until late may when dry period begins spatial distribution of the annual average rainfall in the martil alila watershed was studied through records of over 15 regional rainfall gauges the map fig 4 shows an increase of rainfall from the martil alila coastal plain under 800 mm to the high mountains upstream the watershed over 1000 mm looking at the watershed aspect it is observed that the topographical and geographical locations have a strong impact on rainfall variability the spatial distribution of rainfall is closely correlated with topographic conditions as suggested in many studies in mountainous regions buytaert et al 2006 fries et al 2012 ochoa et al 2016 rollenbeck and bendix 2011 thus in our case the highest annual average rainfall over 1000 mm is correlated with elevations of more than 800 m obviously the heavy cloud masses are discharged mainly inside the mountainous belt which act as an atmospheric barrier when they are lighter these cloudy masses transit to the plains where they discharge less precipitations otherwise many rainfall microzones are observed due to the regional complexity of topographical and geographical settings apart from upstream thermal variations in the martil alila watershed are slightly moderated due to the proximity to sea thus the monthly temperatures average varies progressively between 13 c in january and 25 c in july 1 3 hydrogeological description from the hydrogeological point of view a multilayered system is clearly identified typical in the alluvial intramountainous mediterranean aquifers which is due to several marine and continental sedimentological quaternary phases stitou el messari 2002 this system consists on an upper sandy gravelly layer and a deep one mainly composed of plio quaternary conglomerates fig 5 often these two layers are separated by a less permeable clayey silty aquitard unit deposited during the flandrian transgression this intermediate unit is characterized by variable thicknesses and depths fig 5 it is thick and extended in the center and east while it is thin and discontinuous in the west and northeast giving rise in some places to a monolayer system this last unit contains imbibed marine water remnants that could be mobilized while pumping giving brackish water this phenomenon explains the salinity of groundwater in the central area where earlier studies erroneously assumed the existence of a marine invasion contrary to the piezometric and geophysical considerations benabdelouahab et al 2012 the aquifer basement is formed by a more or less continuous impermeable clayey marly layer detected by mechanical drilling vertical electric soundings and electric tomography profiles it has a complex and irregular morphology characterized by several sinuosities and depressions especially in the center and east area following the irregular shape of the deep paleozoic bedrock himi et al 2017 the clayey marly basement is shallow upstream the alila river the northwestern edge and near the archeological city of tamouda western area nearby the edges the aquifer is deposited directly on the bedrock formed by the adjacent units christallophylien bedrock at north pelitic at west calcareous on both sides of the tetouan city and paleozoic at south and northwest areas at the central area by the airport sector the basement becomes deeper while extending longitudinally toward the ene it maximum depth more than 70 m is reached near the city of martil fig 5 the piezometric analysis reveals a decreasing hydraulic gradient toward downstream typical of a converging aquifer in the northern area the flow direction is oriented nw se while it follows a dominant direction wsw ene at the southern area at the central zone the piezometric levels south of the martil river are shallow near coelma district giving rise to a few marshes the aquifer receives lateral inflow runoff from hills mostly from the southern edges where several seasonal and permanent streams are fed by flows from the karstic aquifer of the calcareous ridge there is also inflow upstream from the martil and alila rivers and at the northern edges near the tetouan city the main outflow components are discharge toward sea and pumping for drinking agriculture and industrial purposes many studies indicate the existence of several depressions below sea level located at the north of martil city at the center near coelma district and at the west near tamouda district stitou el messari 2002 benabdelouahab 2012 the first two depressions are due to private pumping while the third is due to public pumping for water supply water exchanges between the aquifer and the martil and alila rivers are flowing in both directions by area according to water levels difference and to the rivers bed s permeability thus while piezometric isolines define draining role upstream of these two rivers they locally show discharging flows in the center and downstream intra annual piezometric fluctuation does not exceed 1 5 m and it is directly related to rainfall regime and lateral runoff el morabiti 1991 stitou el messari 2002 otherwise historical comparison shows a relevant decrease in the piezometric levels benabdelouahab et al 2012 el morabiti 1991 stitou el messari 2002 thauvain 1971 this situation is a direct result of the occurrence of an extended dry period combined with the increase of groundwater extractions and dam construction upstream 2 materials and methods 2 1 geophysical study for this study two complementary geophysical methods vertical electrical sounding ves and electrical resistivity tomography ert have been used in combination with hydrogeological data for defining the geometry of the aquifer and assessing the extension of the aquitard layers direct interpretation of apparent electrical resistivity measurements is not easy in alluvial aquifer where values vary slightly and or intercalations of layers with intermediate resistivity are frequent a special attention should be required to correlate the resistivity survey results with the lithological and hydrogeological information obtained from neighboring boreholes to calibrate the thickness of the geoelectrical layers and constrain the inversion process edet and okereke 2002 fortunately abundant information from local 58 well distributed boreholes were used to overcome this fig 1 in this paper 119 ves measurements distributed homogenously under schlumberger standard array were interpreted the maximum spacing between current electrodes ab changes according to the sounding situation within the plain and to the estimated bedrock depth as follows 1 ves with an ab line length of 4000 m 5 of 2000 m 34 of 1000 m 22 of 800 m and 57 vess between 300 and 600 m ves field data were interpreted after 1d forward modeling and inversion through an interactive graphically oriented forward and inverse modeling program for interpreting resistivity sounding data in terms of a layered earth 1 d model direct interpretation allows to estimate the layered model directly from the data curve without having to manually construct the number of layers or layer resistivity and thickness başokur 1990 inverse modeling allows to obtain a model that best fits the data in a least squares sense using ridge regression to interactively adjust the starting model parameters the result of a ves curve interpretation is a layered model of the subsurface with thicknesses h and electrical resistivities ρs characterizing each layer these models can provide information on the lithology of the subsoil and the salinity of the groundwater ρw benkabbour et al 2004 himi et al 2017 ves interpretation was complicated due to frequent layer intercalations and low contrast of recurrent clayey sandy layer mixtures with intermediate resistivity values however scattered and abundant ert results and borehole data made it possible to overcome these complications offering thus good correlations three examples of this good correlation between ves and boreholes are presented in the following ves 19 2 located northern the alila river shows a six layered resistivity model table 2 well correlated with the borehole 1074 2 situated within 230 m it indicates a shallow thick loamy sand resistant level and a second deeper resistant level correlated with coarse sand and gravels separated by a thick conductive clayey level the resistant crystallophyllian basement is identified at 52 m approximatively ves 46 2 located northern martil city were correlated with the borehole 734 2 situated within 80 m two resistant coarse sand layers at 4 and 33 m depth respectively are observed with several clay interlayers of different thicknesses fig 6 similar observations are perceived in the ves 85 2 near coelma district correlated with the borehole 743 2 situated within 100 m ves interpretation indicates that the deep substratum lithologically and geoelectrically variable is only identified near the aquifer boundaries because of its significant depth at the center and to the low resistivity contrast in relation to the alluvial filling then two resistant levels constitute the upper layer medium to coarse sands and deep coarse alluvium of this bilayer locally multilayer aquifer these two resistant levels are mostly separated by a continuous conductive level constituting a semi permeable aquitard formed of clay and sandy loams ves reveals also the existence of a network of geoelectric discontinuities interpreted as an extensive normal synsedimentary faults system that affects the alluvial filling these faults system is located mainly southern the plain and toward the east giving rise to several geological depressions furthermore an ert survey of 18 measurements were performed under wenner schlumberger mixed array with a multielectrode resistivity meter 48 switch of 480 m line length and a standard 10 m electrode spacings ert field data were interpreted after a 2d resistivity modeling software designed to invert large data sets collected with a multielectrode system loke 1997 this is designed to interpolate and interpret field data of electrical geophysical prospecting of electrical resistivity and induced polarization uhlemann et al 2017 the inversion of the resistivity and ip data was conducted by least square method involving finite element and finite difference methods the software can handle data from any electrode array and invert data from the most popular geophysical instruments hellman et al 2016 ert and ves inversion results recovering all the aquifer were well correlated to close borehole data and were useful thus to establish geoelectrical models and to assess groundwater vulnerability described in the following 2 2 vulnerability assessment groundwater pollution impact is persistent while its treatment is complicated and expensive hence prevention and protection are essential for its efficient management in this sense vulnerability assessment is a crucial way to support decision making by understanding current intrinsic conditions and for a better coordination of the future development projects groundwater vulnerability is the susceptibility of an aquifer to be unlikely affected by a pollution load foster and hirata 1988 it is defined by the intrinsic properties of the unsaturated vadose zone that determine the aquifer sensitivity to a pollution load applied from the surface ref vrba and zaporozec 1994 used in this way the term groundwater vulnerability is often referred to as intrinsic vulnerability to distinguish it from specific vulnerability a term that is generally preferred for situations where the role and behavior of a specific contaminant is explicitly considered in the analysis qian et al 2012 subjectively vulnerability maps should indicate clearly and precisely detailed information on potential impact upon water quality based on land zonation gogu and dassargues 2000 salhi et al 2008 several methods have been developed to assess intrinsic groundwater vulnerability table 3 involving a combination between hydrogeological parameters such as depth to groundwater table characteristics of the subsurface layers and hydraulic conductivity aller et al 1987 civita and de maio 2000 foster and hirata 1988 foster et al 2002 kirsch 2009 qian et al 2012 stempvoort et al 1993 ref vrba and zaporozec 1994 then this combination is interpreted through a cartographic process by the assignment of intervals and or classes to produce a vulnerability index map drastic aller et al 1987 is a standardized approach for assessing groundwater pollution vulnerability that has achieved world wide recognition since its development over 30 years ago it consists of parameters rating system where each one is evaluated by a relative weight ranging from 1 to 5 that indicates its relative importance compared to the other parameters sintacs civita and de maio 2000 is an italian approach inspired by drastic and adapted for the mediterranean hydrogeological context both methods consider seven different weighted parameters god foster and hirata 1988 is a similar empirical approach which considers only three equal weight parameters and where groundwater vulnerability index focalizes on the mitigation abilities of the unsaturated zone later this approach was improved to enhance its effectiveness and to provide a relevant tool for integrated soil and water management thus the susceptibility of soil cover was incorporated as a fourth parameter to create the gods approach foster et al 2002 avi stempvoort et al 1993 is an easy approach since it depends only on two parameters hydraulic conductivity and thickness of unsaturated zone without any relative weighting in many cases the application of these approaches is often complicated due to its limitations or to the deficiency of accurate and well distributed data in the drastic approach for example results can be ambiguous and open to more than one interpretation lim et al 2009 the most common problem however is the lack of adequate field data for one or more parameters benabdelouahab et al 2012 diaz et al 2006 draoui et al 2008 kirsch 2009 qian et al 2012 salhi and benabdelouahab 2017 salhi et al 2008 vias et al 2005 hence many authors made modifications to the original assessment approach to adapt it to their own circumstances fritch et al 2000 meng et al 2007 neshat et al 2014 panagopoulos et al 2006 sener and davraz 2013 indeed the natural protection of an aquifer depends on its protective layers which are related to the thickness and hydraulic properties of the unsaturated zone akpan et al 2015 christiansen et al 2014 díaz et al 2008 kirsch 2009 omosuyi and oseghale 2012 stempvoort et al 1993 thus groundwater vulnerability changes proportionally to the hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated zone and inversely proportional to its thickness kirsch 2009 salhi and benabdelouahab 2017 the analysis of the different approaches indicates that they are based on the interpolation of the borehole data several studies have shown the utility of geophysical data to improve vulnerability assessment akpan et al 2015 christiansen et al 2014 díaz et al 2008 kirsch 2009 omosuyi and oseghale 2012 it is widely accepted that the key parameters of vulnerability assessment are closely related to the underground clay content this is the case of the hydraulic conductivity taken into account directly or indirectly in most approaches the clay particles are much smaller than the grains of sand so that the clay particles within a sandy clay layer can block the narrow channels connecting the intergranular pores so as to reduce considerably the hydraulic conductivity of this layer the rate of clay influences greatly the electrical conductivity or its inverse the electrical resistivity thus the increase of the clay rate within a layer leads to the reduction of the electrical resistivity and vice versa kalinski and kelly 1993 several studies have also demonstrated the existence of an inverse correlation between hydraulic and electrical conductivity díaz et al 2008 kirsch 2009 the good correlation between the underground parameters clay contents and hydraulic conductivity and the electrical resistivity allows the vulnerability assessment through geoelectric or electromagnetic measurements the results of these measurements can be used to evaluate the clay content deduce hydraulic conductivity and assess vulnerability even when drilling data are scarce indeed the propagation of a pollutant through the unsaturated zone is influenced by several interconnected and complex parameters in the case of alluvial aquifers the attenuation of pollution is closely related to the purification capacity of the unsaturated zone layers which depends on the clay content and the abundance of the organic matter otherwise an aquifer is less vulnerable when it is surmounted by conductive electrically impermeable hydrogeologically thick and continuous clayey layers these layers are characterized by typical low electrical resistivity values in the avi approach stempvoort et al 1993 a protection index pi is calculated on the basis of the hydraulic conductivity k i and the thickness h i of the unsaturated zone according to the following expression pi i 1 n 1 k i h i taking into account the good correlation between hydraulic and electrical conductivity kirsch 2009 and between this last and the clay content kalinski and kelly 1993 a geophysical protection index gpi was deduced by replacing hydraulic conductivity by electric in the preceding equation casas et al 2005 gpi i 1 n 1 ρ i h i gpi takes high values when the conductive clayey layer is thick in this case the aquifer will be better protected against potential pollution introduced from the soil surface 3 results and conclusions the shared interest to protect groundwater resources motivates the scientific community to develop approaches to assess vulnerability to pollution the divergence of ideologies means and techniques leads to the emergence of a range of different approaches in several countries the application of these approaches is complicated by the lack of adequate hydrogeological data in this paper a comparative geostatistical analysis of one geophysical gpi and five empirical approaches drastc sintacs god gods and avi is carried out to confront their cartographic results fig 7 in an alluvial aquifer under mediterranean context in order to simplify the visual comparison between the six maps vulnerability classes where homogenized to four less vulnerable grouping low and very low vulnerability classes moderately vulnerable vulnerable corresponding to high vulnerability class and very vulnerable grouping very and extremely high classes regarding the spatial distribution of vulnerability classes the analysis shows that the six approaches concord that at least two thirds of the aquifer are vulnerable or moderately vulnerable mostly at the north near alila river in the marshes coelma district and all over the coastal sector from martil to cabo negro less vulnerable sectors center contains high proportions of clay and silt combined with deeper water table the influence of the intrinsic parameters of the unsaturated zone thickness and hydraulic or electric conductivity is relevant in our case other parameters are either indirectly repeated such as the unsaturated zone lithology and the aquifer type or less influent such as recharge homogenous among the aquifer topography very low slope and the saturated zone lithology once the pollutant reaches this zone the aquifer will be partially or totally contaminated the geostatistical pixel to pixel analysis table 4 reveals good correlations between the results from gpi and avi god and gods as well as drastic and sintacs the correlation between drastic and sintacs results shows a conceptual similarity in both approaches against differences at parametric weights intervals and rating system this is the reason of the apparent disparity between the corresponding two maps however the two maps show that almost all the aquifer is vulnerable or moderately vulnerable which is unreasonable in the center souani sector where water table is deeper and fine grained alluvium are abundant god and gods have the same conceptual schemes intervals weights and rating system the only distinction is the soil type parameter in gods which changes the aspect of the corresponding map avi and gpi depends on the spatial interpolation of two parameters punctual data the thickness and the hydraulic avi or electric conductivity gpi of the unsaturated zone although these conceptual similarity both approaches show clear differences in the corresponding maps due to the following two reasons on one hand avi depends on insufficient and poorly distributed punctual measurements of hydraulic conductivity which may distort the result otherwise gpi uses abundant homogenous and recent field measurement very well distributed over the totality of the aquifer on the other hand the maps final aspect is a reflection of the intervals disparities between both approaches despite of these differences these two approaches show locally good correlations where there is enough hydraulic conductivity data this is the case of the center and the coastal sector the number of parameters is clearly reflected on the spatial distribution of vulnerability classes this is the case of drastic and sintacs where the seven employed parameters increases the vulnerability relatively to other approaches otherwise the final map in the four approaches drastic sintacs gods and god is a result of a cartographic overlying process thus the interaction between the parametric maps may lead locally to the appearance of spatially connected areas but divergent in vulnerability response 3 1 validation the validation of the vulnerability approach output should be assessed by tracers nguyet and goldscheider 2006 or by field measured geochemical and microbiological data pathak and hiratsuka 2011 in this paper it is accomplished via the results of field measurements and laboratory analysis made by the loukkos hydraulic basin agency abhl 2015 in 16 groundwater sampling wells the analysis results table 5 shows a poor or moderate water quality in most of samples compared to the quality standards adopted in morocco abhl 2015 most samples indicate high conductivity values reference value 750 1300 µs cm and high concentration of chloride reference value 200 300 mg l measured values were overlaid on the gpi vulnerability map using gis to correlate water quality with vulnerable zones thence it is observed that sampling wells that were highly contaminated are in vulnerable zones while those that were moderately or non contaminated are in less vulnerable zones fig 8 from this result it can be concluded that vulnerability map predicted by gpi approach is reliable in our case therefore water managers can use this result to conduct the groundwater protection strategy in the study area this will be more useful compared to results generated by conventional overlay index method like drastic sintacs and others 4 discussion in conclusion the aspect of vulnerability map in each approach depends on the number of parameters interaction between them and their attributes rating system intervals weights and vulnerability classes furthermore it depends also on the data quality and distribution which in our case constraint the application of classic empirical approaches however the geophysical approach gpi uses recent well distributed abundant and reliable data groundwater pollution receives particular attention in south mediterranean countries where effective protection strategies must aim the prevention and require continuous and reliable data to discern current and future problems vulnerability maps should be established for all the productive aquifers revised periodically and updated whenever modifications affect physical environment or knowledge these maps are an essential guide to ensure sustainable socio economic development and efficient territorial management instead of applying universal controls over land use and effluent discharge to the ground it is more cost effective and less prejudicial to economic development to utilize the natural contaminant attenuation capacity of the strata overlying the aquifer when defining the level of control necessary to protect groundwater quality simple and robust zones based on aquifer pollution vulnerability and source protection perimeters need to be established with matrices that indicate what activities are possible and where they are at an acceptable risk to groundwater foster et al 2002 in this study like in many others results show that two parameters dominate the protection process in alluvial aquifers the depth to water table and the properties of unsaturated zone these two parameters are easily obtained through geophysical field measurements to provide consistent data for groundwater vulnerability assessment despite its regional importance the aquifer of martil alila is mostly vulnerable to pollution and to marine intrusion consequently urgent continuous and well studied protection actions should be achieved to avoid the complexity of these problems and to restore its perfect state therefore it is suggested to set up one or more artificial recharge basins the authorities should be vigilant to inhibit any direct or indirect material spillage or discharge that may alter the groundwater quality moreover all activities must comply with laws and standards of water resources protection pumping must be closely monitored to avoid any piezometric decline especially in the coastal area and in the alila plain acknowledgment this study was supported by the national center for scientific research and technique cnrst morocco under
