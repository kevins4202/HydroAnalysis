6765,the indian ocean which is home to many islands and the low lying coastal zones have attracted considerable attention due to regional sea level changes in this study we examine regional changes in sea level of the indian ocean and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data various interpolation methods are evaluated to predict values at locations where data is unavailable based on the cross validation analysis the radial basis function is identified as the most optimal interpolation method and is used to analyze the spatial patterns of sea level changes the analysis reveals that bangladesh seychelles and cocos keeling islands have relatively high rates of sea level rise these regions would thus be highly vulnerable to coastal flooding induced by the accelerating sea level rise in future decades posing significant threats to coastal communities and ecosystems flooding impacts are examined through inundation mapping in a geographic information system gis environment in addition relationships between regional factors sea surface temperature air temperature and vertical land motions affecting sea level rise are investigated our findings indicate that vertical land motion is an important factor affecting sea level changes for the regions of seychelles and cocos islands there is a strong relationship between air temperature and sea level rise for all studied regions this study is a first attempt to examine regional changes in sea level of the indian ocean and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data the methods used in this study can be applied to other coastal regions around the world keywords flooding indian ocean interpolation inundation mapping sea level 1 introduction historical sea level records from warm periods during the last 3 million years indicate that the global mean sea level has exceeded 5 m above the present day scenario recent trends of thinning of glaciers such as greenland and antarctic ice sheets have raised a growing concern gornitz 2013 the contribution made by these two ice sheets has greatly increased since the 1990s due to increased outflow caused warming of immediate adjacent oceans global sea level has risen during the past few decades as a consequence of the thermal expansion of warming oceans and the addition of freshwater from melting continental ice sheets han et al 2010 thermal expansion is one of the dominant factors in sea level rise and is a consequence of sea surface temperature pramanik et al 2015 sea level changes are not uniform globally church et al 2004 hay et al 2015 merrifield et al 2016 regional sea level changes can be affected by oceanic and atmospheric circulation and other factors that can alter sea surface heights in addition there are a variety of factors that can cause vertical land movements such as sediment compaction the compaction caused by groundwater extraction and other geological processes related to plate tectonics and earth movements localized vertical land motions vlm have a significant impact on regional sea level changes wöppelmann and marcos 2016 the downward vlm land subsidence and the upward vlm land uplift can cause a rise or fall in sea levels sweet et al 2017 the indian ocean has been warming faster than other oceans roxy et al 2014 and the in situ hydrographic records have proven that the pacific ocean is likely responsible for the decrease in the ocean heat content of the pacific over the past few decades the heat originally stored in the pacific is being transported to the indian ocean by the indonesian throughflow han et al 2010 revealed that anthropogenic warming effects on the indo pacific ocean pool can result in sea level variations and changes in atmospheric circulation by using ocean circulation modes the hybrid coordinate ocean model and the parallel ocean program the entire indian ocean has been undergoing warming for the past century from 1901 to 2002 the western sea surface temperature has been increasing at a greater rate as compared to other parts of the indian ocean roxy et al 2014 according to the national centre for antarctic and ocean research the sea levels in the indian ocean are almost double than the global mean due to the location of the indian ocean wind and heat play a dominant role in this region whereas melting of ice caps and glaciers are a negligible occurrence sea level rise threatens the densely populated and low lying coastal areas khan et al 2000 qin and lu 2014 it has already caused floods and devastating storms that have impacted many lives over recent years regional sea level rise can vary from place to place depending on many factors such as ocean winds temperatures and land motions an acceleration in sea level rise has been detected in the northern parts of the indian ocean due to changing wind speeds and distribution of heat certain parts of the indian ocean north of the equator have experienced an increase in sea level rise thompson et al 2016 as an evolving issue in a changing climate it is necessary to assess the impacts of sea level rise and to highlight those regions of the world which are highly prone to its consequences the performance of tide gauges has been attracting considerable attention over the past few decades with great improvements in data quality and high frequency data tide gauges have replaced the traditional float gauges and have been widely used in sea level rise studies míguez et al 2012 for example baki and shum 2000 used tide gauge observations from the hong kong observatory to investigate sea level variations in hong kong han et al 2010 combined tide gauge and satellite observations of indian ocean sea level with climate model simulations to identify a distinct spatial pattern of sea level rise since the 1960s pramanik et al 2015 used tide gauge data to map sea level changes along the east coast of india and determined the coastal vulnerability however previous studies have not looked into the regional factors that affect local sea level changes moreover there is a lack of assessing potential coastal flooding threats caused by sea level rise in the indian ocean it is thus necessary to produce inundation maps that can be used to help identify flood prone areas which plays a crucial role in protecting coastal communities from rising sea levels tide gauge data collected from stations can help better understand the current trends in sea level changes however tide gauge stations are unevenly distributed around the globe thereby resulting in large gaps and difficulties in performing spatial analysis as a result spatial interpolation techniques are essential for creating a continuous surface from sampled point values wang et al 2014 2015 in the past a variety of interpolation methods were used to map climate variables for example agnew and palutikof 2000 used the ordinary kriging which was a gis based geostatistical interpolation approach for creating high resolution maps of mean seasonal temperatures and precipitation in the mediterranean basin keskin et al 2015 mapped precipitation wind speed and temperature over turkey in a gis environment the gis based interpolation techniques have been recognized as a powerful means to create continuous surfaces from point data since spatial interpolation methods are data specific or variable specific there is no best choice among the interpolation methods available the best option of interpolation methods in a particular case can thus be obtained by comparing their performance few studies have compared the performance of the gis based interpolation techniques for producing spatial patterns of sea level changes from tide gauge observations the objective of this study is to examine the indian ocean sea level changes over the last 80 years and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data a comparison of spatial interpolation methods will be conducted to generate spatial patterns of sea level changes in the indian ocean coastal flooding impact areas will then be delineated through the inundation mapping for countries that have relatively high rates of sea level rise relationships between regional factors and sea level rise as well as their contributions to sea level changes will also be investigated through multivariate regression analysis this paper is organized as follows section 1 provides an overview of sea level rise limitations of previous studies and objectives of this study section 2 introduces the study area sources of datasets gis based interpolation methods used to create continuous surfaces of sea level changes flood inundation mapping and regression models section 3 presents a thorough analysis and discussion on comparisons of interpolation methods relationships between regional variables and sea level changes and potential impacts of sea level rise on coastal flooding finally conclusions drawn from this study are summarized in section 4 2 case study data and methodology 2 1 study area the indian ocean is the world s third largest ocean with a total area of 70 560 000 km2 which lies between latitudes 30 n to 35 s and longitudes 20 e to 140 e the indian ocean is surrounded by african asian and australian continents which is home to many low lying coastal regions and islands li and han 2015 these low lying areas are vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal flooding church et al 2006 fig 1 shows the study area with the locations of tide gauge stations one of the most damaging impacts of climate change is sea level rise since 160 million people currently live in coastal regions that are less than 1 m above sea level a small magnitude of rise in sea levels can pose significant threats to human population and damage infrastructure near the coastlines in this study spatial patterns of sea level changes were analyzed and potential coastal flooding impacts were then examined by using inundation maps for the countries that had relatively high rates of sea level rise 2 2 data collection tide gauge data has not been used to assess sea level changes in the indian ocean which brings more attention to this study unlike satellites that were launched in the mid 1990s the use of tide gauges provided an idea of long term historical changes in sea level coastal ocean tide gauge time series contain unique information about historical basin scale variability as well as information about global sea level rise chepurin and carton 2013 used in harbor operations the tide gauge data facilitates studying phenomena in the supra hourly range with useful applications in storm surge and tsunami monitoring míguez et al 2012 thus this study used historical data provided by tide gauges in assessing the changes in sea level in the indian ocean due to their sparse distribution along the countries data were chosen based on two factors including data availability i e long term time series and minimal gaps in data collected in this study a thorough investigation on all tide gauge stations was conducted in the first place to decide which stations had updated readings the tide gauge data over a long time period of up to 60 years were then collected since tide gauge stations may have missing data for certain years the stations with small data gaps less than 3 years were chosen to perform time series analysis tide gauge records from the data archive of the permanent service for mean sea level psmsl revised local reference rlr were used in this study the psmsl contains monthly and annual mean values of more than 2000 tide gauge stations distributed around the world the data is received by national authorities who are responsible for monitoring sea level changes for particular countries or regions constructing time series of the sea level measurements at each station requires monthly and annual means be reduced to a common datum this reduction was performed by making use of the tide gauge datum history provided by the supplying authorities the rlr datum at each station is defined to be approximately 7000 mm below mean sea level and an arbitrary choice is made so as to avoid negative values in the datasets since the primary focus is on sea level time series analysis no glacial isostatic adjustment gia corrections have been performed sea surface temperature sst was obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa optimal interpolation oi sst dataset provided by the noaa earth system research laboratory s physical sciences division https www esrl noaa gov psd the noaa oi sst dataset was constructed by combining observations from different platforms including satellites ships and buoys air temperature is another factor considered in this study we analyzed the relationship between air temperature and sea level rise the air temperature data was acquired from the climate change knowledge portal website as part of the world bank group this website provides a wide range of information on climate change around the world this portal was designed to help policy makers and practitioners in using scientific information to make informed decisions and provide valuable information to the end users for projects and research along any coast vlm of the sea or the land can cause variations in sea level relative to land coastal subsidence and uplift can aggravate the problem of sea level rise and measuring vlm is a fundamental key in coastal flood risk management and estimating the needs of the ecosystems worldwide to measure vlm on the earth gps stations satellite altimetry and tide gages spanning the entire globe located between 66 n and 66 s can provide easily accessible data for climatological studies tide gauges measure sea level relative to the earth s crust and thus the measurements are affected by vlm satellite altimetry measurements are generally independent the sea level measured is with respect to the geocenter and is thus independent of vlm vlm is contained in the long term component of the difference between satellite altimetry and tide gauge sea level height measurements and is indicated as altimetry tide gauge or alt tg fenoglio et al 2012 in this study altimetry data were used to explore vlm in the areas with the highest rates of sea level rise the satellite altimetry data is defined as the global msla heights in delayed time all sat merged and is provided by aviso further information about the altimetry measurements can be obtained from sonel www sonel org data service 2 3 spatial interpolation methods in this study we compared all gis based interpolation methods for creating sea level change surfaces over the indian ocean including inverse distance weighting idw local polynomial interpolation lpi global polynomial interpolation gpi radial basis function rbf ordinary kriging ok and universal kriging uk they can be divided into two groups including deterministic and geostatistical techniques the deterministic interpolation methods i e idw lpi gpi and rbf create continuous surfaces from measured points based on mathematical formulae to determine the extent of similarity or degree of smoothing while the geostatistical interpolation methods i e ok and uk use both mathematical and statistical models to predict the values within the given area of interest and provide probabilistic estimates of the interpolation quality based on the spatial autocorrelation among the points the ok method depends on the strong assumption of stationarity the mean and variance of the values are constant across the spatial field which is not often met in many applications in comparison the uk method relaxes the assumption of stationarity by allowing the mean of the values to vary across the spatial field details for each of these interpolation methods are provided as follows 2 3 1 idw method the idw method is used when the density of sampled points is high enough to capture the extent of the surface variations needed for spatial analysis it is based on the principle that the sampled values closer to the prediction location have a greater influence on the prediction value as compared to sampled values which are further apart a higher power assigns more weight to closer points resulting in less smoother surfaces contrarily a lower power assigns a low weight to closer points resulting in a smoother surface the idw specifically relies on the first law of geography the formula for the idw is given below 1 z i 1 n 1 d i p z i i 1 n 1 d i p where z is the predicted value of the interpolation point zi is the value of the sampling point i i 1 2 3 n n is the number of sample points di is the distance between known and unknown sample points p is the power parameter which is a real positive number 2 3 2 gpi method the gpi uses a mathematical function a polynomial to fit a smooth surface over sample points in contrast to the idw the gpi makes predictions using the entire dataset instead of using the measured points within neighborhoods a first order global polynomial can fit a single plane through given data and a second order polynomial creates a bended surface it should be noted that complex polynomials may result in difficulties in representing physical meanings in addition a single global polynomial may not be able to fit a surface with varying shape e g slope variations and thus multiple polynomial planes are more desirable to create the continuous surface 2 3 3 lpi method unlike the gpi the lpi method fits specific order polynomials using all available points within a given neighborhood the overlapping of neighborhoods suggests that the value of the fitted polynomial at the centre of the neighborhood is estimated as the predicted value the lpi method is sensitive to the neighborhood distance in comparison the lpi is capable of producing surfaces that highlight the short range variations whereas the gpi is used to identify long term trends in the dataset 2 3 4 rbf method by using the rbf method the generated surface passes through every measured value and minimizes the total curvature of the surface different from the gpi and the lpi methods which are inexact interpolators the rbf method is an exact interpolator that requires the surface to pass through given points in contrary to the idw method the rbf can predict the values above the maximum and below the minimum values it is often used to create surfaces for a large number of data points adhikary et al 2017 liao et al 2017 2 3 5 ok method compared with the above mentioned deterministic interpolation methods the ok method is a statistical method in which the estimates are less biased with minimum variance because predictions are accompanied by standard errors quantification of uncertainty in predicted values the ok method also takes into account spatial autocorrelations and statistical relationships between measured points wang et al 2014 it assumes that the unknown mean is constant and estimates the predicted value by focusing on spatial components that use sampling points within the local neighborhood the ok is based on the following model 2 z s μ s ε s where z s is the variable of interest µ is an unknown constant ε s is an autocorrelated error term s indicates the location that can be identified in the form of x and y coordinates where x is longitude and y is the latitude 2 3 6 uk method the uk method is based on the assumption that a significant spatial trend in data values exists such as sloping surfaces or localized flat terrains this is considered as a variation of the ok method that has no trend the trends are too difficult to be modeled by a mathematical function due to its irregularity therefore a stochastic approach can be used to characterize spatial variations the uk method proves to be effective when there are discernible trends in the data with great background knowledge of spatial statistics 2 4 cross validation when creating a continuous surface with the point data it is necessary to assess how well each model predicts the values at unknown locations thus cross validation can be used to evaluate and compare the performance of different interpolation techniques so as to identify the best interpolation method for creating continuous surfaces this process involves removing each data location one at a time and predicting the associated data value the original sample is randomly partitioned into two datasets in which one is used to train a model and the other is used to validate the model wang et al 2014 2018 both training and validation datasets must cross over in consecutive rounds so that each data point can be validated against each other the root mean square error rmse is used to assess the accuracy of different interpolation methods because it is the most widely used performance metric rmse can be calculated using the following formula 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n z i z 2 where z is the predicted value zi is the observed value at sample point i i 1 2 n n is the number of sample points rmse is used as the only performance metric in this study in order to perform cross validation in a straightforward and convenient way 2 5 flood inundation mapping flood inundation mapping provides accurate geospatial information about the extent of floods which plays a crucial role in helping decision makers assess and manage flood risks the flood inundation mapping can be carried out by using digital elevation models dem and gis the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem with a spatial resolution of approximately 30 m was used in this study this mission was flown aboard the space shuttle endeavour in february 2000 and collected radar data spanning over 80 of the earth s surface between 60 n and 56 n latitudes with data points posted every 1 arc second approximately 30 m in this study the flood inundation maps were produced using the bathtub model for assessing coastal vulnerability to flood hazards the bathtub model can be used to identify areas that may be subjected to coastal flooding caused by sea level rise the model assumes that areas with an elevation less than a projected flood level will be flooded which is similar to a bathtub yunus et al 2016 specifically the flooded areas can be determined through simulations in a gis environment wherein the elevation in each cell of the raster dem is compared with the projected sea level and those cells with an elevation below the projected value of sea level are considered to be flooded 2 6 regression analysis regression analysis is useful in making predictions wang et al 2016 the regression model can be used to identify if there exists a statistical relationship if any between given variables in a dataset to understand potential relationships between sst air temperature and vlm in changing sea levels a regression model was created based on the wilkinson notation and the formula is given as follows 4 s l β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 where sl represents sea level above datum x 1 sst x 2 air temp and x 3 vlm eq 4 can thus be re written as 5 s l β 0 β 1 s s t β 2 a i r t e m p β 3 v l m when the sl value is obtained by using eq 5 the change in sea level δsl can be derived as follows 6 δ sl sl present sl past n where δsl represents the rate of change in sea level slpresent represents the present sl value slpast represents the past sl value n is the time period the rates of changes in sea level at different stations can be mapped by using arcgis 3 results and discussions 3 1 comparison of interpolation methods for spatial analysis of sea level changes on the basis of the tide gauge data six gis based interpolation techniques namely idw gpi lpi rbf uk and ok were evaluated in this study to generate the spatial patterns of sea level changes fig 2 reveals that the idw and rbf methods nearly produce a similar map of spatial patterns in sea level rise this can be due to the fact that they are exact interpolators interpolation techniques can be exact or inexact interpolators exact interpolators generate surfaces that pass through the control points whereas inexact interpolators predict values at locations which can differ from the known value the raster surfaces created by exact interpolators can be similar but are different from those created by inexact interpolators however there is a considerable spatial difference between the surfaces generated by gpi and lpi which are inexact interpolators the possible reason for this difference can be due to the face that lpi method is known to work well for gridded values the gpi method uses a single mathematical function for the entire dataset and thus a change in a single value has a significant effect on the map on the other hand the lpi method applies mathematical functions to smaller local subsets of the entire dataset therefore a change in any value affects the result within the specified window of data points also it can be seen that the ok method has the smallest range while the lpi method has the largest range of values the interpolation results were also compared against each other based on the rmse values obtained through cross validation as shown in table 1 the derived rmse values for different interpolation methods follow the following order rbf uk ok lpi gpi idw this indicates that the rbf method has the lowest rmse and is thus the most optimal method that can be used to understand the spatial patterns of sea level rise the geostatistical methods of uk and ok also perform well in terms of the rmse values a common visual pattern observed in all six methods is the low rates of sea level rise along the western coast of australia on the contrary the higher rates of sea level rise patterns are observed in bangladesh southern asia the regions with the high rates of increase in sea level were further explored in this study by using the rbf interpolation method we performed spatial analysis of sea level change patterns in fig 3 it can be seen that the countries lying in northeastern and central parts of the indian ocean are facing higher threats of sea level rise countries in indonesia middle east and india also face a moderate risk of sea level rise in comparison the western coast of australia is found to have the least rise in sea level thus the regions that are facing greater increases in coastal sea level rise include bangladesh southern asia seychelles africa and cocos keeling islands 3 2 examination of potential factors affecting sea level by using the sst air temperature and alt tg values a regression model is created to examine the importance of potential factors on sea level at the tide gauge station in seychelles the regression model is given as 7 s l 8477 6 39 134 s s t 128 31 a i r t e m p 0 86 v l m eq 7 indicates that an increase in sst and air temperature can lead to an increase in sea level as for land motions the downward motion or subsidence of land can lead to an increase in sea level above the datum table 2 shows significance levels of regression coefficients for all stations the t statistic is used to examine the importance of each factor the greater the magnitude of t value that can be either positive or negative the more important the factor it indicates that air temperature is more important than sst and vlm for the tide gauge station in seychelles similarly for cocos keeling islands the regression model is created as 8 s l 22011 25 93 s s t 37 86 a i r t e m p 2 174 v l m eq 8 shows an inverse relationship between sst and sea level indicating that an increase in sst may lead to a decrease in sea level in addition the vlm s contribution to sea level changes is much more significant than that for the tide gauge station in seychelles due to the unavailability of alt tg for land movements in bangladesh regression models are created with only two factors including sst and air temperature at different tide gauge stations in bangladesh for cox s bazar the regression model is created as 9 s l 4942 8 13 167 s s t 65 024 a i r t e m p eq 9 indicates that both sst and air temperature have a positive impact on sea level in other words an increase in sst and air temperature can cause an increase in sea level at cox s bazar for hiron point the regression model is generated as 10 s l 6594 3 15 355 s s t 34 703 a i r t e m p eq 10 indicates that an increase in air temperature or a decrease in sst can cause sea level rise for chittagong the regression model is derived as 11 s l 3010 1 3 270 s s t 159 42 a i r t e m p eq 11 indicates a similar relationship as compared to that for the tide gauge station at hiron point nevertheless the importance of air temperature is much more significant at chittagong for khepupara the regression model is obtained as 12 s l 10279 157 98 s s t 43 286 a i r t e m p eq 12 indicates that there is a positive relationship between air temperature and sea level and sst has a much larger contribution to sea level changes in comparison to that of the tide gauge station at chittagong it should be noted that the regression models created with only sst and air temperature cannot be used to predict sea level in bangladesh due to the poor r2 values less than 0 5 in comparison the regression models created with sst air temperature and vlm for seychelles and cocos keeling islands have relatively larger r2 values of 0 53 and 0 79 respectively results reveal that vlm has a significant impact on sea level of the indian ocean and thus the regression models created without vlm can result in poor performance future studies should be undertaken to take into account more potential factors affecting sea level when more data become available 3 3 temporal variations in sea level and consequent impacts on coastal flooding sea level rise is a big concern due to its damaging impacts on coastal regions and is considered the most significant effect on coastal flooding thus the sea level trends measured by tide gauges and the consequent impacts on coastal flooding were examined in this study for the three regions of bangladesh seychelles and cocos islands with the highest rates of sea level rise bangladesh is a low lying and densely populated riverine country which is one of the world s most flood prone countries most of the region in bangladesh is covered by the ganges brahmaputra delta and is rich in fertile flat land due to its proximity to the coast the country has 700 rivers and 8046 km of inland waterways and is home to the sundarbans which is the largest mangrove forest in the world most places have elevations of less than 10 m above the sea level while the southern coastal regions are relatively flat lands which are generally at the sea level climate change takes a huge toll on the country heavy rain falls flooding tidal bores and storm surges ravage the country and its coastline every year annual monsoon flooding results in loss of human life property damage shortage of drinking water and spread of diseases in this study tide gauge data from four stations were used to identify the sea level trends in bangladesh fig 4 shows the increasing trends in sea level at four stations located along the coastlines of bangladesh all stations seem to have a positive sea level rise based on the historical data at cox s bazar the sea level appears to rise at the rate of 3 57 mm year between the period from 1982 to 1990 there is a sharp increase in the sea level at hiron point the sea level rises by 6 1 mm year this increase is the slowest out of the four stations where there is a low change between the years from 1984 to 1999 at chittagong the rate of sea level rise is 9 47 mm year and is characterized by highs and lows in the measurement period khepupara experiences a sea level rise of 17 90 mm year which is the highest of the four stations it can be seen that the trend continues to increase every year the sea level rise at khepupara and hiron point is due to its location on the ganges brahmaputra meghna gbm river delta and therefore is prone to subsidence which is a probable factor for sea level rise a flood inundation map can be produced based on the fact that the average sea level rise derived from tide gauge measurements is approximately 9 2 mm year in bangladesh based on the current trend of sea level rise the inundated area is 1531 37 km2 which accounts for approximately 1 03 of the total land area of bangladesh fig 5 besides the flooding from rivers certain regions are also likely to suffer from floods under the current scenario as shown in fig 6 the inundated area will be 3515 3 km2 which accounts for approximately 2 38 of the total area of bangladesh if the sea level rises by 1 m for the western region of bangladesh a rise of 1 m in sea level can cause flooding problems for the coastline in the west in addition the deltaic regions are also prone to flooding as indicated by blue areas there is no big difference in the flooding areas generated under current and future scenarios because a majority of coastal areas in bangladesh is within 1 2 m above sea level it should be noted that these maps show the inundation areas impacted only by static floods i e floods are caused by sea level rises and not resulting from a storm surge or other combined effects in reality the actual flood zones are likely to be very different due to interactive effects figs 7 and 8 compare the temporal changes in sea level with sea surface temperature and air temperature at four tide gauge stations in seychelles seychelles is a sovereign africa state in the indian ocean off the west coast of africa which contains about 115 islands with a total area of 459 km2 this country has a population of 87 000 of which 90 live on mahé the climate is mostly humid and is classified as tropical rainforest by the köppen geiger system there is a small variation in temperature throughout the year temperature on mahé varies from 24 to 30 c with average rainfall of 3300 mm fig 9 shows that mahé experiences a sea level rise at the rate of 5 19 mm year for the inundation mapping of seychelles mahé is the primary concern because it is the main island with a larger population and land area as shown in fig 10 the inundated area is 3 463 km2 which accounts for about 0 68 of the total land area it can be seen that the northeastern and eastern coasts of mahé are prone to flooding if the sea level rises by 1 m the inundated area will be 7 28 km2 which accounts for approximately 1 5 of the total area of seychelles fig 11 figs 12 and 13 compare the temporal changes in sea level with sst and air temperature fig 14 shows the vlm observed at mahé by using the alt tg data it reveals that the land underwent uplift and subsidence during the period from 1990 to 2012 with notable subsidence between 1999 and 2006 and the region is undergoing subsidence at the rate of 1 55 0 21 mm year the cocos keeling islands are a group of low lying atolls with an area of 14 2 km2 in the indian ocean off the coast of perth australia the australia territory harbors a coastline of 26 km and is covered with coconut palms and other vegetation the population is estimated to be about 600 pleasant climate prevails and is moderated by the southeast trade winds for nine months of the year with moderate rainfall tropical cyclones are known to occur during the early months of the year owing to its position midway between the equator and the tropic of capricorn the climate is characterized as tropical monsoon type by the köppen classification system in fig 15 the rate of rise in sea level is 5 347 mm year based on the current trend of sea level rise at cocos islands by using tide gauge data the inundated area is 1 288 km2 which accounts for about 9 14 of the land area in fig 16 it can be seen that the entire coastline is at risk of flooding and an area in the southern part of the island can be greatly affected by the current sea level trend in fig 17 the inundated area will be 1 63 km2 which accounts for approximately 11 6 of the total area of cocos islands if the sea level rises by 1 m in the future certain parts of the island in the west are prone to flooding under the scenario of 1 m rise in sea level figs 18 and 19 compare the temporal changes in sea level with sst and air temperature fig 20 shows the vlm observed at cocos keeling islands from 1993 to 2015 the land underwent subsidence with relatively high subsidence occurring during the period from 1999 to 2004 the land is undergoing subsidence at the rate of 3 89 0 14 mm year it should be noted that the sea level of the indian ocean has been rising more rapidly in recent years for instance the sea level for seychelles is expected to experience a rise at the rate of 2 21 mm year according to the sea level data collected for the period 1993 2007 ipcc 2007 gerlach 2008 in fact the sea level for the island of seychelles has been experiencing a rise of 5 19 mm year based on the tide gauge data collected in recent years similarly the cocos keeling islands is expected to experience a rise in sea level at the rate of 1 5 mm year according to the reconstructed sea level dataset collected for the period 1950 2001 church et al 2006 ipcc 2007 2013 in fact cocos keeling islands has been experiencing a rise in sea level at the rate of 5 34 mm year in recent years these reveal that the rate of sea level rise has been increasing over time posing a significant threat to the indian ocean coastal areas according to a government report by maunsell australia 2009 the sea level of the indian ocean has risen by 9 8 mm year by the beginning of the 21st century consequently the scenario of 1 m rise in sea level was used in this study to examine potential impacts of sea level rise on coastal flooding in the indian ocean 4 conclusions in this study we examine regional changes in sea level of the indian ocean and the consequent impacts on coastal flooding in a changing climate various interpolation methods are evaluated and compared to generate spatial patterns of sea level changes through cross validation the rbf interpolation method is identified as the optimal one with the smallest rmse value which is thus used to perform spatial analysis of sea level changes in the indian ocean the regions with relatively high sea level rise and their impacts on coastal flooding are further investigated through multivariate regression analysis and inundation mapping our findings reveal that vlm has a considerable impact on sea level rise and a subsidence of land can lead to an increase in the rates of sea level rise specifically the inundated area is 1531 37 km2 that accounts for approximately 1 03 of the total land area of bangladesh based on the current trend of sea level rise and the inundated area will become 3515 3 km2 that accounts for approximately 2 38 of the total land area if the sea level rises by 1 m in the future due to the unavailability of the vlm data for bangladesh it is impossible to deduce its relationship with sea level changes for the region of seychelles the inundated area is 3 463 km2 that accounts for about 0 68 of the total land area under the current scenario and the northeastern and eastern coasts of mahé are prone to flooding if the sea level rises by 1 m the inundated area will become 7 28 km2 that accounts for approximately 1 5 of the total area of seychelles in addition land subsidence has a considerable impact on sea level rise in seychelles and the region is undergoing subsidence at the rate of 1 55 0 21 mm year at cocos islands the inundated area is 1 288 km2 that accounts for about 9 14 of the land area under the current scenario the inundated area will become 1 63 km2 that accounts for approximately 11 6 of the total area of cocos islands if the sea level rises by 1 m in the future and certain parts of the island in the west are prone to flooding under the future scenario moreover the land is undergoing subsidence at the rate of 3 89 0 14 mm year at cocos islands this study is a first attempt to examine regional changes in sea level of the indian ocean and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data the methods used in this study can be applied to other coastal regions around the world since the flood inundation maps were produced in this study based on standard bathtub model which did not take into account the dynamic nature of coastal flooding future studies will be undertaken to perform dynamic coastal flooding simulations in order to improve the accuracy of flood impact assessment moreover linear regression was used to examine potential factors affecting sea level such an assumption of linearity oversimplifies the complex relationships between sea level changes and influencing factors which may result in poor performance it is thus necessary to develop nonlinear regression models with more potential factors affecting sea level in order to improve model performance since only tide gauge data was used in this study any interpolation of the non coastal zones i e in the middle of the ocean cannot be validated due to the sparse data other types of data such as satellite imagery and lidar data should also be used in future studies to enhance the reliability of spatial analysis of sea level changes in addition it is necessary to examine the impact of the spatial resolution of dem on flood inundation mapping in order to improve the accuracy of coastal flood risk assessment acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51809223 and the hong kong

6765,the indian ocean which is home to many islands and the low lying coastal zones have attracted considerable attention due to regional sea level changes in this study we examine regional changes in sea level of the indian ocean and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data various interpolation methods are evaluated to predict values at locations where data is unavailable based on the cross validation analysis the radial basis function is identified as the most optimal interpolation method and is used to analyze the spatial patterns of sea level changes the analysis reveals that bangladesh seychelles and cocos keeling islands have relatively high rates of sea level rise these regions would thus be highly vulnerable to coastal flooding induced by the accelerating sea level rise in future decades posing significant threats to coastal communities and ecosystems flooding impacts are examined through inundation mapping in a geographic information system gis environment in addition relationships between regional factors sea surface temperature air temperature and vertical land motions affecting sea level rise are investigated our findings indicate that vertical land motion is an important factor affecting sea level changes for the regions of seychelles and cocos islands there is a strong relationship between air temperature and sea level rise for all studied regions this study is a first attempt to examine regional changes in sea level of the indian ocean and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data the methods used in this study can be applied to other coastal regions around the world keywords flooding indian ocean interpolation inundation mapping sea level 1 introduction historical sea level records from warm periods during the last 3 million years indicate that the global mean sea level has exceeded 5 m above the present day scenario recent trends of thinning of glaciers such as greenland and antarctic ice sheets have raised a growing concern gornitz 2013 the contribution made by these two ice sheets has greatly increased since the 1990s due to increased outflow caused warming of immediate adjacent oceans global sea level has risen during the past few decades as a consequence of the thermal expansion of warming oceans and the addition of freshwater from melting continental ice sheets han et al 2010 thermal expansion is one of the dominant factors in sea level rise and is a consequence of sea surface temperature pramanik et al 2015 sea level changes are not uniform globally church et al 2004 hay et al 2015 merrifield et al 2016 regional sea level changes can be affected by oceanic and atmospheric circulation and other factors that can alter sea surface heights in addition there are a variety of factors that can cause vertical land movements such as sediment compaction the compaction caused by groundwater extraction and other geological processes related to plate tectonics and earth movements localized vertical land motions vlm have a significant impact on regional sea level changes wöppelmann and marcos 2016 the downward vlm land subsidence and the upward vlm land uplift can cause a rise or fall in sea levels sweet et al 2017 the indian ocean has been warming faster than other oceans roxy et al 2014 and the in situ hydrographic records have proven that the pacific ocean is likely responsible for the decrease in the ocean heat content of the pacific over the past few decades the heat originally stored in the pacific is being transported to the indian ocean by the indonesian throughflow han et al 2010 revealed that anthropogenic warming effects on the indo pacific ocean pool can result in sea level variations and changes in atmospheric circulation by using ocean circulation modes the hybrid coordinate ocean model and the parallel ocean program the entire indian ocean has been undergoing warming for the past century from 1901 to 2002 the western sea surface temperature has been increasing at a greater rate as compared to other parts of the indian ocean roxy et al 2014 according to the national centre for antarctic and ocean research the sea levels in the indian ocean are almost double than the global mean due to the location of the indian ocean wind and heat play a dominant role in this region whereas melting of ice caps and glaciers are a negligible occurrence sea level rise threatens the densely populated and low lying coastal areas khan et al 2000 qin and lu 2014 it has already caused floods and devastating storms that have impacted many lives over recent years regional sea level rise can vary from place to place depending on many factors such as ocean winds temperatures and land motions an acceleration in sea level rise has been detected in the northern parts of the indian ocean due to changing wind speeds and distribution of heat certain parts of the indian ocean north of the equator have experienced an increase in sea level rise thompson et al 2016 as an evolving issue in a changing climate it is necessary to assess the impacts of sea level rise and to highlight those regions of the world which are highly prone to its consequences the performance of tide gauges has been attracting considerable attention over the past few decades with great improvements in data quality and high frequency data tide gauges have replaced the traditional float gauges and have been widely used in sea level rise studies míguez et al 2012 for example baki and shum 2000 used tide gauge observations from the hong kong observatory to investigate sea level variations in hong kong han et al 2010 combined tide gauge and satellite observations of indian ocean sea level with climate model simulations to identify a distinct spatial pattern of sea level rise since the 1960s pramanik et al 2015 used tide gauge data to map sea level changes along the east coast of india and determined the coastal vulnerability however previous studies have not looked into the regional factors that affect local sea level changes moreover there is a lack of assessing potential coastal flooding threats caused by sea level rise in the indian ocean it is thus necessary to produce inundation maps that can be used to help identify flood prone areas which plays a crucial role in protecting coastal communities from rising sea levels tide gauge data collected from stations can help better understand the current trends in sea level changes however tide gauge stations are unevenly distributed around the globe thereby resulting in large gaps and difficulties in performing spatial analysis as a result spatial interpolation techniques are essential for creating a continuous surface from sampled point values wang et al 2014 2015 in the past a variety of interpolation methods were used to map climate variables for example agnew and palutikof 2000 used the ordinary kriging which was a gis based geostatistical interpolation approach for creating high resolution maps of mean seasonal temperatures and precipitation in the mediterranean basin keskin et al 2015 mapped precipitation wind speed and temperature over turkey in a gis environment the gis based interpolation techniques have been recognized as a powerful means to create continuous surfaces from point data since spatial interpolation methods are data specific or variable specific there is no best choice among the interpolation methods available the best option of interpolation methods in a particular case can thus be obtained by comparing their performance few studies have compared the performance of the gis based interpolation techniques for producing spatial patterns of sea level changes from tide gauge observations the objective of this study is to examine the indian ocean sea level changes over the last 80 years and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data a comparison of spatial interpolation methods will be conducted to generate spatial patterns of sea level changes in the indian ocean coastal flooding impact areas will then be delineated through the inundation mapping for countries that have relatively high rates of sea level rise relationships between regional factors and sea level rise as well as their contributions to sea level changes will also be investigated through multivariate regression analysis this paper is organized as follows section 1 provides an overview of sea level rise limitations of previous studies and objectives of this study section 2 introduces the study area sources of datasets gis based interpolation methods used to create continuous surfaces of sea level changes flood inundation mapping and regression models section 3 presents a thorough analysis and discussion on comparisons of interpolation methods relationships between regional variables and sea level changes and potential impacts of sea level rise on coastal flooding finally conclusions drawn from this study are summarized in section 4 2 case study data and methodology 2 1 study area the indian ocean is the world s third largest ocean with a total area of 70 560 000 km2 which lies between latitudes 30 n to 35 s and longitudes 20 e to 140 e the indian ocean is surrounded by african asian and australian continents which is home to many low lying coastal regions and islands li and han 2015 these low lying areas are vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal flooding church et al 2006 fig 1 shows the study area with the locations of tide gauge stations one of the most damaging impacts of climate change is sea level rise since 160 million people currently live in coastal regions that are less than 1 m above sea level a small magnitude of rise in sea levels can pose significant threats to human population and damage infrastructure near the coastlines in this study spatial patterns of sea level changes were analyzed and potential coastal flooding impacts were then examined by using inundation maps for the countries that had relatively high rates of sea level rise 2 2 data collection tide gauge data has not been used to assess sea level changes in the indian ocean which brings more attention to this study unlike satellites that were launched in the mid 1990s the use of tide gauges provided an idea of long term historical changes in sea level coastal ocean tide gauge time series contain unique information about historical basin scale variability as well as information about global sea level rise chepurin and carton 2013 used in harbor operations the tide gauge data facilitates studying phenomena in the supra hourly range with useful applications in storm surge and tsunami monitoring míguez et al 2012 thus this study used historical data provided by tide gauges in assessing the changes in sea level in the indian ocean due to their sparse distribution along the countries data were chosen based on two factors including data availability i e long term time series and minimal gaps in data collected in this study a thorough investigation on all tide gauge stations was conducted in the first place to decide which stations had updated readings the tide gauge data over a long time period of up to 60 years were then collected since tide gauge stations may have missing data for certain years the stations with small data gaps less than 3 years were chosen to perform time series analysis tide gauge records from the data archive of the permanent service for mean sea level psmsl revised local reference rlr were used in this study the psmsl contains monthly and annual mean values of more than 2000 tide gauge stations distributed around the world the data is received by national authorities who are responsible for monitoring sea level changes for particular countries or regions constructing time series of the sea level measurements at each station requires monthly and annual means be reduced to a common datum this reduction was performed by making use of the tide gauge datum history provided by the supplying authorities the rlr datum at each station is defined to be approximately 7000 mm below mean sea level and an arbitrary choice is made so as to avoid negative values in the datasets since the primary focus is on sea level time series analysis no glacial isostatic adjustment gia corrections have been performed sea surface temperature sst was obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa optimal interpolation oi sst dataset provided by the noaa earth system research laboratory s physical sciences division https www esrl noaa gov psd the noaa oi sst dataset was constructed by combining observations from different platforms including satellites ships and buoys air temperature is another factor considered in this study we analyzed the relationship between air temperature and sea level rise the air temperature data was acquired from the climate change knowledge portal website as part of the world bank group this website provides a wide range of information on climate change around the world this portal was designed to help policy makers and practitioners in using scientific information to make informed decisions and provide valuable information to the end users for projects and research along any coast vlm of the sea or the land can cause variations in sea level relative to land coastal subsidence and uplift can aggravate the problem of sea level rise and measuring vlm is a fundamental key in coastal flood risk management and estimating the needs of the ecosystems worldwide to measure vlm on the earth gps stations satellite altimetry and tide gages spanning the entire globe located between 66 n and 66 s can provide easily accessible data for climatological studies tide gauges measure sea level relative to the earth s crust and thus the measurements are affected by vlm satellite altimetry measurements are generally independent the sea level measured is with respect to the geocenter and is thus independent of vlm vlm is contained in the long term component of the difference between satellite altimetry and tide gauge sea level height measurements and is indicated as altimetry tide gauge or alt tg fenoglio et al 2012 in this study altimetry data were used to explore vlm in the areas with the highest rates of sea level rise the satellite altimetry data is defined as the global msla heights in delayed time all sat merged and is provided by aviso further information about the altimetry measurements can be obtained from sonel www sonel org data service 2 3 spatial interpolation methods in this study we compared all gis based interpolation methods for creating sea level change surfaces over the indian ocean including inverse distance weighting idw local polynomial interpolation lpi global polynomial interpolation gpi radial basis function rbf ordinary kriging ok and universal kriging uk they can be divided into two groups including deterministic and geostatistical techniques the deterministic interpolation methods i e idw lpi gpi and rbf create continuous surfaces from measured points based on mathematical formulae to determine the extent of similarity or degree of smoothing while the geostatistical interpolation methods i e ok and uk use both mathematical and statistical models to predict the values within the given area of interest and provide probabilistic estimates of the interpolation quality based on the spatial autocorrelation among the points the ok method depends on the strong assumption of stationarity the mean and variance of the values are constant across the spatial field which is not often met in many applications in comparison the uk method relaxes the assumption of stationarity by allowing the mean of the values to vary across the spatial field details for each of these interpolation methods are provided as follows 2 3 1 idw method the idw method is used when the density of sampled points is high enough to capture the extent of the surface variations needed for spatial analysis it is based on the principle that the sampled values closer to the prediction location have a greater influence on the prediction value as compared to sampled values which are further apart a higher power assigns more weight to closer points resulting in less smoother surfaces contrarily a lower power assigns a low weight to closer points resulting in a smoother surface the idw specifically relies on the first law of geography the formula for the idw is given below 1 z i 1 n 1 d i p z i i 1 n 1 d i p where z is the predicted value of the interpolation point zi is the value of the sampling point i i 1 2 3 n n is the number of sample points di is the distance between known and unknown sample points p is the power parameter which is a real positive number 2 3 2 gpi method the gpi uses a mathematical function a polynomial to fit a smooth surface over sample points in contrast to the idw the gpi makes predictions using the entire dataset instead of using the measured points within neighborhoods a first order global polynomial can fit a single plane through given data and a second order polynomial creates a bended surface it should be noted that complex polynomials may result in difficulties in representing physical meanings in addition a single global polynomial may not be able to fit a surface with varying shape e g slope variations and thus multiple polynomial planes are more desirable to create the continuous surface 2 3 3 lpi method unlike the gpi the lpi method fits specific order polynomials using all available points within a given neighborhood the overlapping of neighborhoods suggests that the value of the fitted polynomial at the centre of the neighborhood is estimated as the predicted value the lpi method is sensitive to the neighborhood distance in comparison the lpi is capable of producing surfaces that highlight the short range variations whereas the gpi is used to identify long term trends in the dataset 2 3 4 rbf method by using the rbf method the generated surface passes through every measured value and minimizes the total curvature of the surface different from the gpi and the lpi methods which are inexact interpolators the rbf method is an exact interpolator that requires the surface to pass through given points in contrary to the idw method the rbf can predict the values above the maximum and below the minimum values it is often used to create surfaces for a large number of data points adhikary et al 2017 liao et al 2017 2 3 5 ok method compared with the above mentioned deterministic interpolation methods the ok method is a statistical method in which the estimates are less biased with minimum variance because predictions are accompanied by standard errors quantification of uncertainty in predicted values the ok method also takes into account spatial autocorrelations and statistical relationships between measured points wang et al 2014 it assumes that the unknown mean is constant and estimates the predicted value by focusing on spatial components that use sampling points within the local neighborhood the ok is based on the following model 2 z s μ s ε s where z s is the variable of interest µ is an unknown constant ε s is an autocorrelated error term s indicates the location that can be identified in the form of x and y coordinates where x is longitude and y is the latitude 2 3 6 uk method the uk method is based on the assumption that a significant spatial trend in data values exists such as sloping surfaces or localized flat terrains this is considered as a variation of the ok method that has no trend the trends are too difficult to be modeled by a mathematical function due to its irregularity therefore a stochastic approach can be used to characterize spatial variations the uk method proves to be effective when there are discernible trends in the data with great background knowledge of spatial statistics 2 4 cross validation when creating a continuous surface with the point data it is necessary to assess how well each model predicts the values at unknown locations thus cross validation can be used to evaluate and compare the performance of different interpolation techniques so as to identify the best interpolation method for creating continuous surfaces this process involves removing each data location one at a time and predicting the associated data value the original sample is randomly partitioned into two datasets in which one is used to train a model and the other is used to validate the model wang et al 2014 2018 both training and validation datasets must cross over in consecutive rounds so that each data point can be validated against each other the root mean square error rmse is used to assess the accuracy of different interpolation methods because it is the most widely used performance metric rmse can be calculated using the following formula 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n z i z 2 where z is the predicted value zi is the observed value at sample point i i 1 2 n n is the number of sample points rmse is used as the only performance metric in this study in order to perform cross validation in a straightforward and convenient way 2 5 flood inundation mapping flood inundation mapping provides accurate geospatial information about the extent of floods which plays a crucial role in helping decision makers assess and manage flood risks the flood inundation mapping can be carried out by using digital elevation models dem and gis the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem with a spatial resolution of approximately 30 m was used in this study this mission was flown aboard the space shuttle endeavour in february 2000 and collected radar data spanning over 80 of the earth s surface between 60 n and 56 n latitudes with data points posted every 1 arc second approximately 30 m in this study the flood inundation maps were produced using the bathtub model for assessing coastal vulnerability to flood hazards the bathtub model can be used to identify areas that may be subjected to coastal flooding caused by sea level rise the model assumes that areas with an elevation less than a projected flood level will be flooded which is similar to a bathtub yunus et al 2016 specifically the flooded areas can be determined through simulations in a gis environment wherein the elevation in each cell of the raster dem is compared with the projected sea level and those cells with an elevation below the projected value of sea level are considered to be flooded 2 6 regression analysis regression analysis is useful in making predictions wang et al 2016 the regression model can be used to identify if there exists a statistical relationship if any between given variables in a dataset to understand potential relationships between sst air temperature and vlm in changing sea levels a regression model was created based on the wilkinson notation and the formula is given as follows 4 s l β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 where sl represents sea level above datum x 1 sst x 2 air temp and x 3 vlm eq 4 can thus be re written as 5 s l β 0 β 1 s s t β 2 a i r t e m p β 3 v l m when the sl value is obtained by using eq 5 the change in sea level δsl can be derived as follows 6 δ sl sl present sl past n where δsl represents the rate of change in sea level slpresent represents the present sl value slpast represents the past sl value n is the time period the rates of changes in sea level at different stations can be mapped by using arcgis 3 results and discussions 3 1 comparison of interpolation methods for spatial analysis of sea level changes on the basis of the tide gauge data six gis based interpolation techniques namely idw gpi lpi rbf uk and ok were evaluated in this study to generate the spatial patterns of sea level changes fig 2 reveals that the idw and rbf methods nearly produce a similar map of spatial patterns in sea level rise this can be due to the fact that they are exact interpolators interpolation techniques can be exact or inexact interpolators exact interpolators generate surfaces that pass through the control points whereas inexact interpolators predict values at locations which can differ from the known value the raster surfaces created by exact interpolators can be similar but are different from those created by inexact interpolators however there is a considerable spatial difference between the surfaces generated by gpi and lpi which are inexact interpolators the possible reason for this difference can be due to the face that lpi method is known to work well for gridded values the gpi method uses a single mathematical function for the entire dataset and thus a change in a single value has a significant effect on the map on the other hand the lpi method applies mathematical functions to smaller local subsets of the entire dataset therefore a change in any value affects the result within the specified window of data points also it can be seen that the ok method has the smallest range while the lpi method has the largest range of values the interpolation results were also compared against each other based on the rmse values obtained through cross validation as shown in table 1 the derived rmse values for different interpolation methods follow the following order rbf uk ok lpi gpi idw this indicates that the rbf method has the lowest rmse and is thus the most optimal method that can be used to understand the spatial patterns of sea level rise the geostatistical methods of uk and ok also perform well in terms of the rmse values a common visual pattern observed in all six methods is the low rates of sea level rise along the western coast of australia on the contrary the higher rates of sea level rise patterns are observed in bangladesh southern asia the regions with the high rates of increase in sea level were further explored in this study by using the rbf interpolation method we performed spatial analysis of sea level change patterns in fig 3 it can be seen that the countries lying in northeastern and central parts of the indian ocean are facing higher threats of sea level rise countries in indonesia middle east and india also face a moderate risk of sea level rise in comparison the western coast of australia is found to have the least rise in sea level thus the regions that are facing greater increases in coastal sea level rise include bangladesh southern asia seychelles africa and cocos keeling islands 3 2 examination of potential factors affecting sea level by using the sst air temperature and alt tg values a regression model is created to examine the importance of potential factors on sea level at the tide gauge station in seychelles the regression model is given as 7 s l 8477 6 39 134 s s t 128 31 a i r t e m p 0 86 v l m eq 7 indicates that an increase in sst and air temperature can lead to an increase in sea level as for land motions the downward motion or subsidence of land can lead to an increase in sea level above the datum table 2 shows significance levels of regression coefficients for all stations the t statistic is used to examine the importance of each factor the greater the magnitude of t value that can be either positive or negative the more important the factor it indicates that air temperature is more important than sst and vlm for the tide gauge station in seychelles similarly for cocos keeling islands the regression model is created as 8 s l 22011 25 93 s s t 37 86 a i r t e m p 2 174 v l m eq 8 shows an inverse relationship between sst and sea level indicating that an increase in sst may lead to a decrease in sea level in addition the vlm s contribution to sea level changes is much more significant than that for the tide gauge station in seychelles due to the unavailability of alt tg for land movements in bangladesh regression models are created with only two factors including sst and air temperature at different tide gauge stations in bangladesh for cox s bazar the regression model is created as 9 s l 4942 8 13 167 s s t 65 024 a i r t e m p eq 9 indicates that both sst and air temperature have a positive impact on sea level in other words an increase in sst and air temperature can cause an increase in sea level at cox s bazar for hiron point the regression model is generated as 10 s l 6594 3 15 355 s s t 34 703 a i r t e m p eq 10 indicates that an increase in air temperature or a decrease in sst can cause sea level rise for chittagong the regression model is derived as 11 s l 3010 1 3 270 s s t 159 42 a i r t e m p eq 11 indicates a similar relationship as compared to that for the tide gauge station at hiron point nevertheless the importance of air temperature is much more significant at chittagong for khepupara the regression model is obtained as 12 s l 10279 157 98 s s t 43 286 a i r t e m p eq 12 indicates that there is a positive relationship between air temperature and sea level and sst has a much larger contribution to sea level changes in comparison to that of the tide gauge station at chittagong it should be noted that the regression models created with only sst and air temperature cannot be used to predict sea level in bangladesh due to the poor r2 values less than 0 5 in comparison the regression models created with sst air temperature and vlm for seychelles and cocos keeling islands have relatively larger r2 values of 0 53 and 0 79 respectively results reveal that vlm has a significant impact on sea level of the indian ocean and thus the regression models created without vlm can result in poor performance future studies should be undertaken to take into account more potential factors affecting sea level when more data become available 3 3 temporal variations in sea level and consequent impacts on coastal flooding sea level rise is a big concern due to its damaging impacts on coastal regions and is considered the most significant effect on coastal flooding thus the sea level trends measured by tide gauges and the consequent impacts on coastal flooding were examined in this study for the three regions of bangladesh seychelles and cocos islands with the highest rates of sea level rise bangladesh is a low lying and densely populated riverine country which is one of the world s most flood prone countries most of the region in bangladesh is covered by the ganges brahmaputra delta and is rich in fertile flat land due to its proximity to the coast the country has 700 rivers and 8046 km of inland waterways and is home to the sundarbans which is the largest mangrove forest in the world most places have elevations of less than 10 m above the sea level while the southern coastal regions are relatively flat lands which are generally at the sea level climate change takes a huge toll on the country heavy rain falls flooding tidal bores and storm surges ravage the country and its coastline every year annual monsoon flooding results in loss of human life property damage shortage of drinking water and spread of diseases in this study tide gauge data from four stations were used to identify the sea level trends in bangladesh fig 4 shows the increasing trends in sea level at four stations located along the coastlines of bangladesh all stations seem to have a positive sea level rise based on the historical data at cox s bazar the sea level appears to rise at the rate of 3 57 mm year between the period from 1982 to 1990 there is a sharp increase in the sea level at hiron point the sea level rises by 6 1 mm year this increase is the slowest out of the four stations where there is a low change between the years from 1984 to 1999 at chittagong the rate of sea level rise is 9 47 mm year and is characterized by highs and lows in the measurement period khepupara experiences a sea level rise of 17 90 mm year which is the highest of the four stations it can be seen that the trend continues to increase every year the sea level rise at khepupara and hiron point is due to its location on the ganges brahmaputra meghna gbm river delta and therefore is prone to subsidence which is a probable factor for sea level rise a flood inundation map can be produced based on the fact that the average sea level rise derived from tide gauge measurements is approximately 9 2 mm year in bangladesh based on the current trend of sea level rise the inundated area is 1531 37 km2 which accounts for approximately 1 03 of the total land area of bangladesh fig 5 besides the flooding from rivers certain regions are also likely to suffer from floods under the current scenario as shown in fig 6 the inundated area will be 3515 3 km2 which accounts for approximately 2 38 of the total area of bangladesh if the sea level rises by 1 m for the western region of bangladesh a rise of 1 m in sea level can cause flooding problems for the coastline in the west in addition the deltaic regions are also prone to flooding as indicated by blue areas there is no big difference in the flooding areas generated under current and future scenarios because a majority of coastal areas in bangladesh is within 1 2 m above sea level it should be noted that these maps show the inundation areas impacted only by static floods i e floods are caused by sea level rises and not resulting from a storm surge or other combined effects in reality the actual flood zones are likely to be very different due to interactive effects figs 7 and 8 compare the temporal changes in sea level with sea surface temperature and air temperature at four tide gauge stations in seychelles seychelles is a sovereign africa state in the indian ocean off the west coast of africa which contains about 115 islands with a total area of 459 km2 this country has a population of 87 000 of which 90 live on mahé the climate is mostly humid and is classified as tropical rainforest by the köppen geiger system there is a small variation in temperature throughout the year temperature on mahé varies from 24 to 30 c with average rainfall of 3300 mm fig 9 shows that mahé experiences a sea level rise at the rate of 5 19 mm year for the inundation mapping of seychelles mahé is the primary concern because it is the main island with a larger population and land area as shown in fig 10 the inundated area is 3 463 km2 which accounts for about 0 68 of the total land area it can be seen that the northeastern and eastern coasts of mahé are prone to flooding if the sea level rises by 1 m the inundated area will be 7 28 km2 which accounts for approximately 1 5 of the total area of seychelles fig 11 figs 12 and 13 compare the temporal changes in sea level with sst and air temperature fig 14 shows the vlm observed at mahé by using the alt tg data it reveals that the land underwent uplift and subsidence during the period from 1990 to 2012 with notable subsidence between 1999 and 2006 and the region is undergoing subsidence at the rate of 1 55 0 21 mm year the cocos keeling islands are a group of low lying atolls with an area of 14 2 km2 in the indian ocean off the coast of perth australia the australia territory harbors a coastline of 26 km and is covered with coconut palms and other vegetation the population is estimated to be about 600 pleasant climate prevails and is moderated by the southeast trade winds for nine months of the year with moderate rainfall tropical cyclones are known to occur during the early months of the year owing to its position midway between the equator and the tropic of capricorn the climate is characterized as tropical monsoon type by the köppen classification system in fig 15 the rate of rise in sea level is 5 347 mm year based on the current trend of sea level rise at cocos islands by using tide gauge data the inundated area is 1 288 km2 which accounts for about 9 14 of the land area in fig 16 it can be seen that the entire coastline is at risk of flooding and an area in the southern part of the island can be greatly affected by the current sea level trend in fig 17 the inundated area will be 1 63 km2 which accounts for approximately 11 6 of the total area of cocos islands if the sea level rises by 1 m in the future certain parts of the island in the west are prone to flooding under the scenario of 1 m rise in sea level figs 18 and 19 compare the temporal changes in sea level with sst and air temperature fig 20 shows the vlm observed at cocos keeling islands from 1993 to 2015 the land underwent subsidence with relatively high subsidence occurring during the period from 1999 to 2004 the land is undergoing subsidence at the rate of 3 89 0 14 mm year it should be noted that the sea level of the indian ocean has been rising more rapidly in recent years for instance the sea level for seychelles is expected to experience a rise at the rate of 2 21 mm year according to the sea level data collected for the period 1993 2007 ipcc 2007 gerlach 2008 in fact the sea level for the island of seychelles has been experiencing a rise of 5 19 mm year based on the tide gauge data collected in recent years similarly the cocos keeling islands is expected to experience a rise in sea level at the rate of 1 5 mm year according to the reconstructed sea level dataset collected for the period 1950 2001 church et al 2006 ipcc 2007 2013 in fact cocos keeling islands has been experiencing a rise in sea level at the rate of 5 34 mm year in recent years these reveal that the rate of sea level rise has been increasing over time posing a significant threat to the indian ocean coastal areas according to a government report by maunsell australia 2009 the sea level of the indian ocean has risen by 9 8 mm year by the beginning of the 21st century consequently the scenario of 1 m rise in sea level was used in this study to examine potential impacts of sea level rise on coastal flooding in the indian ocean 4 conclusions in this study we examine regional changes in sea level of the indian ocean and the consequent impacts on coastal flooding in a changing climate various interpolation methods are evaluated and compared to generate spatial patterns of sea level changes through cross validation the rbf interpolation method is identified as the optimal one with the smallest rmse value which is thus used to perform spatial analysis of sea level changes in the indian ocean the regions with relatively high sea level rise and their impacts on coastal flooding are further investigated through multivariate regression analysis and inundation mapping our findings reveal that vlm has a considerable impact on sea level rise and a subsidence of land can lead to an increase in the rates of sea level rise specifically the inundated area is 1531 37 km2 that accounts for approximately 1 03 of the total land area of bangladesh based on the current trend of sea level rise and the inundated area will become 3515 3 km2 that accounts for approximately 2 38 of the total land area if the sea level rises by 1 m in the future due to the unavailability of the vlm data for bangladesh it is impossible to deduce its relationship with sea level changes for the region of seychelles the inundated area is 3 463 km2 that accounts for about 0 68 of the total land area under the current scenario and the northeastern and eastern coasts of mahé are prone to flooding if the sea level rises by 1 m the inundated area will become 7 28 km2 that accounts for approximately 1 5 of the total area of seychelles in addition land subsidence has a considerable impact on sea level rise in seychelles and the region is undergoing subsidence at the rate of 1 55 0 21 mm year at cocos islands the inundated area is 1 288 km2 that accounts for about 9 14 of the land area under the current scenario the inundated area will become 1 63 km2 that accounts for approximately 11 6 of the total area of cocos islands if the sea level rises by 1 m in the future and certain parts of the island in the west are prone to flooding under the future scenario moreover the land is undergoing subsidence at the rate of 3 89 0 14 mm year at cocos islands this study is a first attempt to examine regional changes in sea level of the indian ocean and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data the methods used in this study can be applied to other coastal regions around the world since the flood inundation maps were produced in this study based on standard bathtub model which did not take into account the dynamic nature of coastal flooding future studies will be undertaken to perform dynamic coastal flooding simulations in order to improve the accuracy of flood impact assessment moreover linear regression was used to examine potential factors affecting sea level such an assumption of linearity oversimplifies the complex relationships between sea level changes and influencing factors which may result in poor performance it is thus necessary to develop nonlinear regression models with more potential factors affecting sea level in order to improve model performance since only tide gauge data was used in this study any interpolation of the non coastal zones i e in the middle of the ocean cannot be validated due to the sparse data other types of data such as satellite imagery and lidar data should also be used in future studies to enhance the reliability of spatial analysis of sea level changes in addition it is necessary to examine the impact of the spatial resolution of dem on flood inundation mapping in order to improve the accuracy of coastal flood risk assessment acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51809223 and the hong kong

6766,despite the massive diversity in the modeling requirements for practical hydrological applications there remains a need to develop more reliable and intelligent expert systems used for real time prediction purposes the challenge in meeting the standards of an expert system is primarily due to the influence and behavior of hydrological processes that is driven by natural fluctuations over the physical scale and the resulting variance in the underlying model input datasets river flow forecasting is an imperative task for water resources operation and management water demand assessments irrigation and agriculture early flood warning and hydropower generations this paper aims to investigate the viability of the enhanced version of extreme learning machine eelm model in river flow forecasting applied in a tropical environment herein we apply the complete orthogonal decomposition cod learning tool to tune the output hidden layer of the elm model s internal neuronal system instead of the conventional multi resolution tool e g singular value decomposition to demonstrate the application of eelm model the kelantan river located in the malaysian peninsular selected as a case study for a comparison of the eelm model and further model evaluation two distinct data intelligent models are developed i e the classical elm and the support vector regression svr model an exhaustive list of diagnostic indicators are used to evaluate the eelm model in respect to the benchmark algorithms namely svr and elm the model performance indicators exhibit superior results for the eelm model relative to elm and svr models in addition the eelm model is presented as a more accurate alternative predictive tool for modelling the tropical river flow patterns and its underlying characteristic perturbations in the physical space several statistical metrics defined as the coefficient of determination r nash sutcliffe efficiency ens willmott s index wi root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae are computed to assess the model s effectiveness in quantitative terms superiority of eelm over elm and svr models was exhibited by ens 0 7995 0 7434 and 0 665 r 0 894 0 869 and 0 818 and wi 0 9380 0 9180 and 0 8921 respectively whereas eelm model attained lower rmse and mae values by approximately 11 61 22 53 and 8 26 8 72 relative to elm and svr models respectively the obtained results reveal that the eelm model is a robust expert model and can be embraced practically in real life water resources management and river sustainability decisions as a complementary component of this paper we also review state of art research works where scholars have embraced extensive implementation of the elm model in water resource engineering problems a comprehensive evaluation is carried out to recognize the current limitations and also to propose potential opportunities of applying improved variants of the elm model presented as a future research

transform group method of data handling keywords extreme learning machine complete orthogonal decomposition river flow forecasting water resources engineering state of the art future research direction 1 introduction 1 1 river flow modeling background it has been proven scientifically that the forecasting of river systems and its water flow behaviors is particularly difficult owing to the physical processes and natural variabilities associated with the river flow system e g chaotic disturbances random and non stationary complex and non linear behaviors farmer 2016 in hydrological applications the need to enhance the reliability and accuracy of forecasting hydrological variables has attracted a lot of attention to date as the research agenda driven by hydro meteorological researchers has progressed there has been no single identified approach that can generally be applied in hydrological process modeling under diverse conditions especially with different catchment characteristics this is due to several physical phenomena such as the patterns in model input and target data periodicity or randomness and natural stochasticity usually observed in river flow datasets yaseen et al 2016a b 2018 prasad et al 2017 considering this viewpoint it may also be argued that currently no universal model exists that can perform better than other models for a diverse range of hydrological conditions and different watershed properties a large number of models cannot generate the forecasts in a consistent manner because of the dynamic and non stationary pattern including the existence of extreme events in historical data because of these constraints researchers are required to explore and develop more robust and versatile models that have an enhanced efficiency using available historical data on the same standpoint researchers must take into consideration the advantage of rapidly evolving and sophisticated computational power that has the potential to improve modeling methodologies and accuracy threshold in hydrological forecasting applications additionally researchers are also applying complex modeling theorems and newly developed software including techniques such as deep learning and convolutional neural networks schmidhuber 2015 a plausible reason why river flow data has technically been quite difficult to forecast can be gleaned by studying its complex non linear dynamical and chaotic disturbances and the randomness present in its historical behavior dietrich 1987 wen 2009 the understanding of a complex river flow systems its phenomenon and the hydrological processes that govern the flow is vital in proper management of water resources many researchers have studied river flow phenomenon over past few decades emerging from their interests studying the impacts of the changes in the global and regional climate pattern on the hydrologic cycle which is known to cause flooding and drought azmi et al 2016 chang 2008 döll and schmied 2012 yang et al 2010 two main approaches have been used in modeling of river flow patterns based on literature i physically based models such as those utilizing partial differential equations and ii statistical models such as soft computing i e machine learning methods under an artificial intelligence ai approach huge research effort needs to be expended including the need for many hydrological variables to supply initial and boundary conditions needed for the physically based model to simulate the elemental processes of a particular watershed by contrast the conceptually based approach utilizing historical input data such as ai models are able to capture non linear relationships between predictors and the simulated variable without a need for a pre knowledge of the flow physics and advantageously these models also require a smaller number of hydrological inputs azmi and sarmadi 2016 maier et al 2014 ai based modeling generally involves the analysis of investigated issues collection and pre processing of data selecting the data driven model identifying optimal model from several trained models and evaluating the final model araghinejad et al 2011 the identification of data driven model is a major component of ai procedure this is the stage where the learning process and feature extraction from input data is implemented and the optimal model is approximated by reducing the training error between the forecasted and target matrix and the optimal model is selected among several trained models on an independent validation set usually judged by lowest mean square error the approximation accuracy of ai models can be affected by various factors that influence real hydrological conditions some of these factors include the determinations of model input the time scale or forecast horizon and the configuration of data driven models conventional river flow forecasting is generally knowledge driven in nature with physical or semi physical representation of the runoff generating processes yet the transformation from rainfall to streamflow is highly complex and is affected by many factors such as topography rainfall distribution soil properties land use climate change urban development etc a precise construction of such physics based model is very difficult to attain as an abundance of these data are required to fulfil the initial conditions furthermore the forecasting successfulness relies highly on attaining a reliable model fit which entails a high quality observed data with sufficient period length chau and jiang 2002 chau and jin 1998 unfortunately some influencing parameters are often not available in many catchments besides in some catchments the historical records may not be reliable after having previously undergone certain climate change or land use changes thus conventional models are often limited by incomplete data availability with recent advances in artificial intelligence technologies machine learning rainfall runoff models have become a viable alternative to their knowledge driven counterparts chau 2017 fotovatikhah et al 2018 machine learning algorithms can detect the complex interrelations among prominent parameters that control the interaction mechanisms and hence can perform runoff prediction accurately in real time without the requirement of a thorough understanding of the interaction mechanisms wang and yao 2013 wu and chau 2011 besides data requirements are much less extensive than those for physics based models and the problem of missing data is solved at the same time as such in all the following three circumstances namely i if we have a well developed physics based river flow forecasting model ii if we do not have a developed model or iii in a data limited situation we may employ a machine learning technique to complement and or replace it cheng and chau 2004 cheng et al 2015 1 2 research motivation and enthusiasm undertaking accurate and reliable forecasts of daily river flow with an expert system is a pivotal task of water resources management such a robust model can be utilized as a pertinent tool by hydrologists for effective sustainability assessment of water resources including its usage in domestic irrigation hydropower and agriculture demand in addition expert models are useful for planning of future applications in environmental protection and developing water balance systems in general establishing an accurate forecast model for all types of hydro climates and watershed environments is extremely significant yet a difficult task jeong and kim 2009 however the efficiency of every model s output response is considerably based on the characteristics of the modelled watershed cui and singh 2016 for example tropical climatic zones are influenced by heavy monsoon rainfall which are occasional intermittent and often quite unpredictable that can make the variation in river flow patterns much more complicated and non linear in its character compared to its normal state gharun et al 2015 parmar and bhardwaj 2014 as the prediction of such behaviors are difficult with physical or hydrological models that require exact initial conditions exploring more versatile and more responsive soft computing models in this area of need remains a desirable mission for hydrological forecasters 1 3 elm model employment in the field of water resources engineering a review extensive review of literature presented in the following section will show that the investigation of the elm model has not been limited to the river flow or hydrological process modeling problems that is beyond this application the elm model has also been extended explored and tested in 1 climatological 2 morphological 3 environmental 4 energy and health and 5 hydraulic areas an extensive set of elm based studies that have been piloted on the climatological aspects including wind speed prediction lazarevska 2016 peng et al 2017 shamshirband et al 2016 evaporation process modeling deo et al 2015 evapotranspiration prediction abdullah et al 2015 feng et al 2017a 2017b 2016 kisi and alizamir 2018 kumar et al 2016 patil and deka 2016 yin et al 2017 weather temperature prediction paniagua tineo et al 2011 global solar radiation modeling deo et al 2017 hosseini nazhad et al 2017 mohammadi et al 2015 şahin 2013 sahin et al 2014 salcedo sanz et al 2014 shamshirband et al 2015a 2015b salcedo sanz et al 2018 rainfall forecasting acharya et al 2014 ortiz garcía et al 2014 drought index determination deo et al

2016 deka et al 2017 soil moisture prediction prasad et al 2018a 2018b real time environment monitoring and water quality parameter prediction fijani et al 2019 and the downscaling of global climate models for the projection of evapotranspiration yin et al 2017 morphological related studies have also exhibited a remarkable progress in using the elm model for instance notable elm based studies were based on land surface temperature retrieval bai et al 2015 landslide displacement prediction cao et al 2016 huang et al 2016 kv et al 2017 lian et al 2014a 2014b landslide susceptibility mapping modeling huang et al 2017 reservoir body parameters estimation cao et al 2015 land slope stability evaluation and prediction liu et al 2014 and groundwater level fluctuation alizamir et al 2017 barzegar et al 2017b yadav et al 2017 2016a water quality modeling is another magnificent component in water resources engineering and this area has received much attention recently by environmental engineers the feasibility of applying a non tuned and a hybrid extended version of elm had been attempted by various research scholars these include studies related to prediction of dissolved oxygen in streamflow heddam 2016 heddam and kisi 2017 wang et al 2015 electrical conductivity prediction barzegar et al 2017a fresh water alga bloom prediction lou et al 2014 groundwater contamination barzegar et al 2018a 2018b water quality parameters modelling including chlorophyll a chl a and dissolved oxygen do in a lake reservoir environment fijani et al 2018 rainfall forecasting in a drought prone region ali et al 2018 soil moisture and temperature forecasting in an agricultural zone prasad et al 2018a sanikhani et al 2018b and the spatial environmental data modeling leuenberger and kanevski 2015 another branch of water resources engineering with potential practicality of the elm model is in the area of hydraulic structural characteristic engineering in this regard numerous properties of the hydraulic structures have been investigated over past two years such as the sediment transport estimation in open channel ebtehaj et al 2016 ebtehaj and bonakdari 2016 bridge piers scouring prediction ebtehaj et al 2017 discharge coefficient of open channel analysis azimi et al 2017 karami et al 2016 surface roughness of water jet ćojbašić et al 2016 and ocean wave height prediction kumar et al 2017 1 4 river flow modeling using elm model a review in the light of the present literature classical regression tools have been used massively but such models have attained a generally low level of accuracy fahimi et al 2016 consequently ai have recently been given the credit for being a reasonably accurate and non linear tool within the scope of hydrological science nourani et al 2014 yaseen et al 2015 some popular examples of ai models include artificial neural network jain and kumar 2007 kagoda et al 2010 yonaba et al 2010 support vector machine behzad et al 2009 he et al 2014 noori et al 2011 adaptive neuro fuzzy system greco 2012 pramanik and panda 2009 sharma et al 2015 evolutionary computing kashid et al 2010 ni et al 2010 and the hybrid wavelet ai model danandeh mehr et al 2013 makwana and tiwari 2014 prasad et al 2017 sahay and srivastava 2014 deo et al 2017 prasad et al 2017 2018b however all of these applied models still have a notable degree of shortcoming about their generalization and implementation as an expert system including its time consuming characteristic and human controlled i e non automated modeling process therefore the design of an automated approach where ai models can be implemented universally and over different local e g catchment scales remains a passionate challenge that continues to be undertaken by practicing hydrologists recently a relatively new learning approach has been proposed namely the extreme learning machines huang et al 2006 the main advantage of this model lies within its internal feature mapping feature without the need of iterative tuning of the hidden neuron parameters which is required for the case of a conventional artificial neural network model in an elm model the input and hidden neuron weighting are randomly computed from a large number of pre assigned neurons without passing through every neuron in the model in addition the elm model has an acceptable generalization skill and has less time consumption cost based on several implemented applications huang et al 2015 deo and şahin 2016 deo et al 2017 it has also been observed over the past five years that an extensive trend in the implementation of the elm model has been noted with particular use in text analysis atsawaraungsuk and horata 2015 bazi et al 2014 control system designs li et al 2013 system modeling and predictions mantoro et al 2011 remote sensing applications pal 2009 and several fields of science and engineering barzegar et al 2018a 2018b salcedo sanz et al 2018 yaseen et al 2018 most recently the investigation of the elm approach in practical problems related to hydrology meteorology climatic studies morphology hydraulic engineering soil moisture studies and environmental sciences has yielded very optimistic findings the first attempt to model the river flow system using elm algorithm was established by siqueira et al 2014 in this study the authors proposed the elm method as an unorganized machine learning predictive model to capture non linearity of hydrological problem in brazilian hydropower plant seasonal river flow data results of that study showed a noticeable outcome in term of modeling the river flow time series that opened the door for several scholars to explore the applicability of this approach in hydrology this was followed by other attempts undertaken by li and cheng 2014 where researchers applied a new predictive model on two reservoirs with monthly inflow scale located in china the modeling results which were validated with one of the dominant ai models the svr showed excellent prediction skill in 2015 researchers have also performed river flow prediction conducted using a coupled extreme learning machine model integrated with binary coded swarm optimization bcso based on implicit base flow separation the bcso method was used to optimize digital filter of the input variable reconstruction in this modelling research results revealed a noticeable underestimation of the base flow process due to the non efficiency of reflected geographical information of the studied watershed region atiquzzaman and kandasamy 2015 developed a traditional elm model for hydrological time series prediction i e focusing on river flows using daily time series information in usa the adopted elm model when compared with an evolutionary computing support vector regression model ec svr showed slight difference in the level of accuracy a more thorough investigation was carried out by applying elm to a total of nine environmental regression based problems lima et al 2015 the modeling proficiency was compared with conventional regression model and several ai models including the ann svm and random forest models under large number of cases and model predictors it was noticed that the elm attained very good results with less computational time vis à vis the ai and linear regression models for almost all inspected problems recently an alternative version of elm namely the online sequential extreme learning machine i e os elm has been developed and applied for daily monthly and yearly river flow forecasting in canada lima et al 2016 the findings demonstrated a remarkable degree of forecasting accuracy in comparison with a multi linear regression mlr model as a benchmark the same method i e os elm applied for flooding events forecasting in the case of neckar river in germany was demonstrated in another study yadav et al 2016b in that paper hourly meteorological dataset was used to construct and evaluate the data intelligent model based on os elm in 2016 zaher et al proposed the non tuned elm based predictive model for modeling monthly time scale streamflow data in a semi arid region in iraq the proposed model was verified against generalized regression neural network and support vector regression models the established models proved the effectiveness of elm for the inspected region and particularly for monthly time scale forecasting rezaie balf and kisi 2017 studied three different predictive models including an optimally pruned elm i e op elm traditional ann and evolutionary polynomial regression epr for daily streamflow forecasting on three different regions located in iran overall the epr model outperformed traditional ann and op elm model for all cases studies it was also noted that op elm model was unable to capture the stochasticity of this region s streamflow patterns deo and şahin 2016 evaluated the elm model in respect to an ann model for streamflow prediction in queensland australia where a set of nine predictors with the month to consider the seasonality of qwl rainfall southern oscillation index pacific decadal oscillation index enso modoki index indian ocean dipole index and nino 3 0 nino 3 4 and nino 4 0 sea surface temperatures ssts were utilized not only did the elm model outperform the ann in terms of testing accuracy but also was several folds faster than the ann model revealing its potential as a real time simulator of streamflow in literature the latest usage of the elm model was undertaken on the johor river located in malaysia over a daily time scale forecast horizon yaseen et al 2016a besides the investigation of river flow forecasting based on multi station information using hybrid elm coupled with wavelet denoising method was conducted by nourani et al 2017 the developed hybrid model was also validated against least square support vector machine lssvm model in conclusion very good results were obtained by coupling elm model with wavelet transformation compared to a benchmark model it should be considered that the input variable attributes have scientifically been proven to contribute to the level of accuracy of any machine learning model taormina and chau 2015a based on this conceptual idea dariane and azimi 2017 integrated the elm model with evolutionary input selection algorithms i e the genetic algorithm for monthly river flow forecasting at the ajichai basin the study confirmed a significant coupling of the input selection algorithm that influenced the elm model s forecasting efficiency in the area of river flows the latest version of the elm model was employed for river flow forecasting by lima et al 2017 where the researchers developed a new form of the online sequential elm os elm model from their earlier published article lima et al 2016 and later applied in context of rainfall forecasting ali et al 2018 this model was denoted as the variable complexity elm i e vc os elm applied for online daily river flow forecasting at a hydrological station in british columbia canada the merit of the proposed vc os elm resulted in its ability to be applied as an online expert predictive model with updated features for the most recent hydrological information the online predictive model was demonstrated as a robust soft computing model that could be applied efficiently in hydrological prospective some other notable studies on river flow system and general hydrological forecasting applications also demonstrated the elm model to exhibit sophisticated level of performance particularly in modeling river and lake water level deo and şahin 2016 shiri et al 2016 rainfall river flow roushangar et al 2017 and urban water demand estimation mouatadid and adamowski 2017 tiwari et al 2016 to date it is clear that the desire to apply the elm model in a range of hydrological prediction problems continues to be an attractive pathway for decision makers to solve practical problems in a diverse range of geographic and hydrological i e catchment scale scenarios 1 5 research review assessments in light of the foregoing state of the art of the extreme learning machine algorithms and their applications in modeling water resources and solving other engineering problems and also to solve these prediction problems in a relatively shorter model execution time compared to some of the other data driven models e g svr and ann the need to establish a comprehensive survey of the previous research works is highly warranted and practically beneficial mainly for the benefit of young new hydrologists and research scholars who may be interested in applying the elm model to improve existing approaches considering this viewpoint an extensive review of the elm model is also required to recognise the current trends of using this data intelligence tool and also to propose a new way to showcase its practicality and versatility in hydrological forecasting problems as it is evident in the findings throughout the comprehensive details provided appendix a based on conducted careful review of existing research works it is apparent that a majority of the elm model applications have been developed on multivariate applications and particularly on the modeling of climatological and environmental systems this has resulted due to the fact that the elm model is able to identify the non linear relationship that represent physical processes between the predictors and the predictand by virtue of its merits driven by the randomized learning process in river flow forecasting modelling different hydrological and geophysical parameters are usually used as predictors whilst river flow time series at specific station is the predictand these models consider inherent assumption of stationarity in the relationship between predictors and predictand however in real cases depending on the actual data this assumption may not be correct in cases of identification of non stationary in the relationships between predictors and predictand the model results become uncertain as such it is significant to determine possible reasons after having identified any specific non stationaries and care should be made in selecting predictors to avoid the occurrence of any non stationarity schmith and foss 2008 demonstrated that if a statistical downscaling model was non stationary over the training phase the basic stationarity assumption became questionable xenarios et al 2018 highlighted the role and impacts of non stationarities and assessed non stationarities between heavy rainstorm events with mega scale circulation in the mediterranean sea despite the excellent capability of the elm model in mimicking the nonlinearities that represent the physical phenomena mainly through multivariate modeling approaches hydrologist sometimes still require univariate models to be developed mainly as time series prediction models where the antecedent trends and magnitudes of the inspected hydrological variable is used to model the future value of the variable it is worthwhile to highlight the fact that the elm model has also been validated for its predictive ability on univariate input data applications and especially for river flow forecasting another noticeable outcome of the review is that the feasibility of the elm model has improved magnificently by virtue of the hybrid elm models that were coupled with data pre processing approaches such as wavelet transformation algorithm in such studies a set of hybrid models have often relied on the decomposition of the input space with multiple levels of frequency based information used to improve the performance skill the nature of the diverse patterns due to the regionalization effect of the model s accuracy in terms of the hydrological differences clearly points out that there is no universal data intelligence model that is able to mimic global watershed features however for the elm model results demonstrated that this tool was a sophisticated predictive algorithm applied over numerous types of watershed regions with different characteristics in modeling of key hydrological variables the review has also led to an extremely encouraging outcome particularly for a practical implementation of the elm model for example the recent version of the elm model known as the variable complexity elm i e vc os elm has a sophisticated and an advanced applicability as an online predictive expert system with a great potential for real time forecasting the vc os elm model is a highly recommended expert system tool for flood control and management purposes including reservoirs system operation and designing reliable irrigating systems for enhanced crop production furthermore the advantage of predicting and forecasting information for future river flows considering the environmental and ecological aspects is amicably possible through this newer real time vc os elm model 1 6 research objectives the purpose of the current research design is to review the application of elm in hydrological contexts and also to investigate an enhanced version of the extreme learning machine model tuned with the complete orthogonal decomposition cod hough and vavasis 1997 instead of the conventional techniques such as singular value decomposition svd that have been used in highly stochastic river flow pattern forecasting in tropical environments i e kelantan river malaysia regression problem classically is solved in elm model through calculating the moore penrose generalized inverse using svd even though svd is a versatile and numerically stable method the main limitation of this procedure is computationally expensive especially when the number of hidden nodes is large the computational complexity will significantly rise guo et al 2016 the large computation complexity of svd is the critical factor limiting the learning speed of elm hence looking for more robust and reliable alternative to svd should be promising to improve the computation efficiency of elm in this study cod approach is adopted to solve the linear least squares problem

scholars within the hydrological community the paper closes by providing propositions on future efforts that can be devoted to this research area 2 theory and background 2 1 extreme learning machine elm model is an innovative machine learning algorithm that is characterized mainly by the fact that there is no need for a tuning of the model s internal parameters i e the hidden neurons in essence elm is an improved version of conventional ann model where it is able to solve regression problems with a reduced model execution time deo et al 2017b deo and şahin 2015 this is because the input weights and biases are randomly generated so that the output weights have a unique least squares solution solved by the moore penrose generalized inverse function huang et al 2006 this can result in a better performance when compared to ann and svr models acharya et al 2013 deo and şahin 2015 deo et al 2017 an additional issue with conventional techniques is that the ann model can suffer from a slow convergence ability inferior generalization local minima issues over fitting and the need for iterative tuning all of which distinguish the superiority of elm over ann considering the basic theory of elm randomly initiated hidden neurons are fixed so elm is remarkably efficient to attain a global optimum solution following universal approximation capabilities huang and chen 2007 huang et al 2006 the general structure of the elm model can be visualized through fig 1 a mathematically the elm model can best be summarized by assuming that there is a set of training data set samples x 1 y 1 x t y t in this assumption x t is the explanatory variable and y t is the response variable the input vectors x 1 x 2 x t present the predictor variables that are based on the initiated model of the antecedent values of the daily time series of river flow the antecedent values are obtained by using the auto correlation function statistical approach see fig 1b for data points defined by t 1 2 n n is the training samples x t r d and y t r the single feed forward neural network slfn can be expressed numerically as proposed by huang et al 2006 1 i 1 l b i g i α i x t β i z t i 1 n the variables

and output node and z t elm model output the number of the input neurons are determined according to the antecedent values which are from 1 to 3 i e the input combinations in this study the output layer generates the forecasted values one step ahead river flow forecasting based on the linear transfer function followed recent literature research in hydrology e g deo and şahin 2016 yaseen et al 2016b in the elm model the hidden node parameters can be randomly generated without any knowledge of the training data or without iteratively tuning the hidden layer neurons one by one for the lowest mean square error that is for any continuous target function f x and any randomly generated sequence α i β i i 1 l eq 1 is used to approximate a set of n training sample through 2 lim l f x f l x lim l f x i 1 l b i g i α i x t β i 0 the primary merits of the non tuned elm model are that the hidden layer weights are randomly obtained this can yield a zero error offering the possibility of configuring the network s output weights b analytically for the training samples it is worthwhile to highlight that values of the internal activation function parameters α i a n d β i are allocated based on probability distribution finally eq 2 is equivalent to y g b as a linear system formulation huang et al 2006 such that 3 g α β x g x i g x n g i α 1 x 1 β 1 g l a l b l x 1 g i α n x n β 1 g

solution of eq 4 is 6 b h y the h is the moore penrose inverse of hussain h matrix traditionally svd has been predominantly used for the elm learning process 2 2 the proposed enhanced elm model as an alternative to the singular value decomposition svd approach the complete orthogonal decomposition cod can exhibit an excellent performance in solving linear problems using the method of least squares with a simple and a reliable computation procedure hough and vavasis 1997 with the purpose of enhancing the elm model s learning process and efficiency the cod algorithm in this study is used to determine the output weights it should be pointed out that the main merits of the distinguished cod approach over the svd model are 1 high efficiency much simpler computation procedure that lead to improvement of the learning performance 2 high stability a stable factorization for the matrix calculation and 3 high reliability cod is usually highly efficient no matter the size of hussain matrix for more details about the complete orthogonal decomposition and its applications in tuning the elm model please refer to guo et al 2016 2 3 support vector regression svr in this study the svr model has been used as a second predictive model to benchmark the efficiency of the eelm model svr is a robust soft computing approach established for hydrological process modeling raghavendra and deka 2014 the primary features of the svr approach entails an optimization of the hyperplane in the original input data set space purposely to isolate the assigned training dataset accurately and to leave as much distance as possible from the closest instances to the hyperplane on both sides vapnik 1995 the mathematical formulation of the regression problem can be defined as follows assuming that a data set space is defined by t 1 2 n n is the training samples x t r d is the training input variables and y t r training output variable the non linear regression function is presented in drucker et al 1997 7 f x w t φ x 1 b the variables above are defined as w the matrix weight φ x 1 the high dimensional feature space and b bias the primary goal of the regression function is to fit the data t by determining the main function value f x that has the largest deviation ε from the actual data set domain over all the training sphere see fig 1c hence eq 7 is transformed into a constrained convex optimization problem with an e insensitivity loss function that can be written as follows minimize φ w ξ 0 5 w 2 c i 1 m ξ 1 ξ 1 0 8 s u b j e c t t o y i w t φ x 1 b ε ξ 1 w t φ x 1 b y 1 ε ξ 1 ξ 1 ξ 1 0 ξ the slack variable that define the upper and lower excess deviation ξ 1 and ξ 1 c is the positive regularization variable ε is the loss function that linked the approximation accuracies of the training data phase radial basis function is used to solve the kernel function it is usually implemented to solve the nonlinearity feature space mapping during the training procedure the rbf internal parameters including γ ε and c are determined by using particle swarm optimization pso algorithm owing to its effectiveness ch et al 2013 chau 2007 yunrong and liangzhong 2009 2 4 modeling implementation and performance skills the models are trained by using the statistically correlated antecedent river flow data as determined by the correlation and the auto correlation statistics see fig 1b this approach has been adopted in several previous works in hydrological forecasting problems hence a total of three input attributes and the relevant combinations are constructed to build the architecture of the predictive models by using the following formulation 9 m o d e l 1 q t f q t 1 10 m o d e l 2 q t f q t 1 q t 2 11 m o d e l 3 q t f q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 it is noted that q t is the forecasted value of river flow q t 1 q t 2 and q t 3 are the antecedent values of the river flow one two and three days previous all these antecedent river flow represent the variables of the targeted q t through the data intelligence functionality i e eelm elm and svr models the prediction of the models are evaluated by using various numerical statistic indicators in addition to the graphical evaluation i e scatter plots and relative error plots ho 2012 nussbaum thom et al 2013 these numerical indicators include determination coefficient r willmott s index wi nash sutcliffe coefficient e ns root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and relative error re chai and draxler 2014 legates and mccabe 1999 nash and sutcliffe 1970 willmott 1981 12 r i 1 n q o q o q f q f i 1 n q o q o 2 i 1 n q f q f 2 13 wi 1 i 1 n q o q f 2 i 1 n q f q o q f q o 2 14 e ns 1 i 1 n q o q f 2 i 1 n q o q o 2 15 rmse 1 n i 1 n q f q o 2 16 mae 1 n i 1 n q f q o 17 re q o q f q o 100 where q o q f q f and q o are the observed value forecasted value mean observed value and mean forecasted value of river flow we utilize eqs 12 17 to provide a comprehensive assessment of models since literature suggests that no single metric is sufficient to fully validate a forecast model asce 2000 chai and draxler 2014 krause et al 2005 nash and sutcliffe 1970 willmott 1982 1981 chai and draxler 2014 noted that model evaluation must include both rmse and mae eqs 15 16 since rmse is largely applicable when the error distribution of the developed model is normal whereas mae is useful when it is uniform however both performance metrics show the magnitude of overall point averaged error in the test period over the entire series but on their own they may fail to show the true validation of a developed model considering this the relative error metric eq 17 should also be used where the error is presented as a percentage within the test set for a river flow regime that has a different mean property or if it is situated in a hydrologically diverse condition the present model cannot be compared unless the relative error in a normalized percentage form is presented therefore this study has employed the relative error together with the mae and rmse in traditional model assessments the employment of the correlation coefficient r computed between the forecasted and observed dataset is paramount since a 1 1 correspondence is likely to show how well the forecast model is able to fit the observed data whilst also showing the estimated amount of variance by means of the r2 equivalent however this is a linear metric and an overall estimator so a normalized metric the nash sutcliffe coefficient e ns is also used the e ns is a well established model evaluation tool nash and sutcliffe 1970 to provide advanced information that is often complementary to r rmse and mae however willmott 1981 1982 found that ens alone may not provide a true account of the forecast model performance since it is based on the square of the differences between the observed and forecasted data where an equal weighting could be given to the low and the high flows deo et al 2017 therefore in this study the willmott s index is used where it includes the absolute value of the predicted and observed means including the observed and forecasted means for further information the readers are referred to the several studies e g asce 2000 chai and draxler 2014 krause et al 2005 nash and sutcliffe 1970 willmott 1981 3 case study and data description in this research daily time series river flow data measured at guillemard station kelantan river located in the north east region of the malaysian peninsula is utilized the statistical properties of the training testing and complete are tabulated in table 1 fig 2 shows the location of the selected river site the historical river flow data are obtained from the department of irrigation and drainage did malaysia the river flow measurements are obtained using telemetry methods where water level pressure remotely calculated using sensor at particular river cross section in general the climatic conditions at this study site is characterized by heavy monsoon rainfall events which often results in annual flood events therefore the development of such an intelligent forecasting model of stream flow can be adopted as an integral part of the flood hydrology assessments and can have potential implications in economic infrastructural and agricultural development dimensions the total length and drainage area of kelantan river are approximately 248 km and 13 170 km2 the river flow data are obtained for the observed period of 1965 2014 over a daily time scale 4 results and discussion in this study based on the context of machine learning models river flow modeling has been categorized into two different approaches one approach considers the fact that a forecasting model can be based on the river flow data itself by including the correlated lag times as an attribute to forecast one step ahead on the other hand the second approach of modeling river flow entails an appropriate exogenous hydrological variable apart from the river flow data such as rainfall water level and other related physical parameters related to river flow that can be used to forecast the river dataset in this paper the enhanced version of elm model eelm is applied to forecast daily time scale data i e the tropical case study it must be noted however that using only river flow information to module the river flow itself is more challenging for the hydrologist in terms of attaining the best level of accuracy as it may lack pertinent features of the catchment that lacks the meteorological information the well established data intelligence predictive models i e the eelm vs the elm svr models are evaluated numerically through several performance statistics that are acceptable norms in hydrological research community table 2 tabulates the performance assessment in the testing phase of hydrological modeling the best input combinations for the eelm elm and svr are designated as model 2 model 2 and model 1 in their order of the best to the worst performance the best fit of goodness metrics including r wi and e ns values are approximately 0 89 0 93 and 0 79 for the eelm 0 86 0 91 and 0 74 for elm and 0 81 0 89 and 0 66 for svr model respectively to further support this result the mean absolute error indicators i e rmse mae are approximately 314 16 m3s 1 100 41 m3s 1 for the eelm 355 42 m3s 1 109 38 m3s 1 for the elm and 405 52 m3s 1 110 05 m3s 1 for the svr model respectively in general results of the proposed eelm model reveal a noticeable enhancement when applied at all daily time horizons in term of accuracy another important diagnostic evaluator displayed in table 2 is the computational time for the testing stage it can be seen that a noticeable difference in the execution speed of the eelm model is recorded in comparison with other benchmark models i e elm and svr this remarkable speed of the eelm model is owing to the potential of the complete orthogonal decomposition learning approach guo et al 2016 for a more detailed insight into and for further evaluation of the predictive performance a set of scatter plots are generated fig 3 the coefficient of determination r 2 and the regression formula y a o x a1 are also displayed in the scatter plots for each model a scatter plot of the actual observed river flow data versus the forecasted river flow data is also prepared to assess the statistical correlation level the best regression values are obtained for the eelm followed by the elm and svr models attaining approximately 0 80 0 74 and 0 67 respectively notably the eelm model is found to demonstrate the best model performance which is displayed by the closest 1 1 line of fit compared to the other data intelligent models on the other hand the scatter plot generated for the testing period i e 2009 2014 reveals that the low river flow forecasting accuracy has a slight variance regarding the medium river flow values results show that they are overestimated but for the high flows values these are underestimated as obviously revealed by the relative error diagnostic indicator see fig 4 in terms of the maximum errors outlined in the seasonality peak flows again and consistently the eelm model outperforms other data intelligent models in forecasting these peak river flows by comparing all studied forecasting methods for the kelantan river case study i e the eelm elm and svr by means of a detailed comprehensive analysis the relative forecasting errors eq 17 are examined for the testing period results of the three data intelligent models are shown in fig 4 a c in general the performance of the three data intelligent models appears to be quite good for this tropical hydrological environment as all utilized approaches achieve almost the same pattern of relative in graphical terms a closer examination shows that the residual error however is improved when using the proposed eelm model over the traditional elm and the svr models based on the graphical presentations in fig 4 the maximum percentages values of model errors are allocated in the peak events of the testing phase this demonstrates that it is not possible to attain a high level of accuracy when utilizing such redundant historical data set the prediction of peak river flow values is difficult because of the sudden river flow records that is resulted due to the heavy rainfall events caused by the monsoon where the environment is predominated with random rainfall events this result might also be due to the fact that the range of the monitoring data for kelantan river is between 100 and 8000 m3s 1 so that the proposed methods are likely to suffer from such large data range which is generally intermittent and less frequent compared to the overall time series if so this perhaps renders it difficult for data intelligent methods to be adequately trained to mimic the pattern of the river flow and to overcome the highly dynamic nature of the modelled dataset it is therefore possible that the availability of less information in the model s training stage likely leads to a set of fewer patterns to be adequately captured by data intelligent models nevertheless the present study shows that the performance of the eelm model remains optimal in respect to the elm and the svr models given that most of the adopted algorithms for river flow forecasts rely only on the use of algorithms such the conventional ann model the performance of the proposed eelm model is significantly better for this specific application in this paper we perform modeling of river flow by using daily data for kelantan river in malaysia this is due to the fact that the length of the kelantan river is about 250 km hence the travel time of water flow in this system is only within a couple of days on the contrary on what can be seen in the study conducted by yaseen et al 2016b the time scale of the tigris river modeled was monthly because that river system was much longer and there was no major significance in terms of the timescale to investigate the daily forecasting models as a further assessment it is also evident that the 55 years stream flow data used to develop forecasting model for the tropical region may not be sufficient since the rmse and mae values were relatively high which were almost three times when compared with similar index in semi arid region yaseen et al 2016b for a practical implementation of the present methods the potential use of the extreme learning machine model in general and particularly the most recent version of the elm i e vc oselm proposed by lima et al 2017 can be a significant tool for river engineering operations this type of soft computing model is featured by the ability to update the learning process online and therefore it may present an ideal interface for real time simulations in more representable illustration fig 5 exhibits the online forecasting intelligence system that can be envisioned in real time flooding control system the online forecasting system will start by obtaining the physical properties of the river including the area velocity and river flow discharge by using various data sensors results of the elm based predictive model can be linked to a global system for mobile communications gsm in the case of expected flooding or in the case of danger events of river flow gsm networks can deliver a chain of messages to alarm the nearby civilians for the preparation in an emergency evacuation task this merit of the elm based model can provide a robust tool for the hydrologist and other decision maker to perform the forecasts and to implement a reliable water resources management and planning system in addition the perceived online forecasting system can be applied in practice on several river flow time scales both of a short and a long forecast horizon moreover reliable and accurate streamflow forecasts for future events can also be used as an external attribute variable for the modeling of the other hydrological components such as water quality river water level sediment concentration transport and others nevertheless a pure machine learning model is a black box model and cannot show the involved physical processes on the other hand hybrids of physically based and machine learning models which were rarely considered so far can take the advantages of both methods and fill the existing research gap in this regard recently researchers commenced to undertake novel works on the inclusion of the physically based process into machine learning techniques chen and chau 2016 taormina and chau 2015b taormina and chau 2015a 2015b included expert knowledge on the baseflow separation in machine learning streamflow modeling with extreme learning machine chen and chau 2016 reported a hybrid model with double neural networks for prediction of suspended sediment loads by incorporating a key physically based process namely the continuity equation into the structure the preliminary results were promising it is believed that it is a cutting edge task of systematically exploring the feasibility of developing novel hybrid physically based and meta heuristic river flow forecasting models nowadays with recent advances in computer technologies new time series forecasting methods including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso elastic net deep learning etc become feasible alternatives for river flow forecasting lasso being a novel way for estimation in linear models was proven to be able to minimize the residual sum of squares of errors when the summation of absolute value of their coefficients was smaller than a threshold value tibshirani 2011 its ability was also demonstrated for applications in different statistical models such as tree based or generalized regression models the elastic net is recognized as a novel method for regularization as well as variable selection ogutu et al 2012 by employing both hypothetical and real data it was shown that elastic net outperformed lasso with a similar sparsity moreover elastic net initiated a grouping effect for predictor correlation and was demonstrated to have advantages particularly if the predictors much outnumbered observations deep learning being a rebranding of artificial neural network in recent years has effected revolutionary strides in its ability to tackle problems that have been resisting artificial intelligence for a long period of time lecun et al 2015 whilst earlier generation ann extracts feature from data strongly correlated with dependent variables deep learning undertakes it automatically via multiple levels of abstraction the recent advances in computing power particularly the availability of graphics processing units together with this emerging technique render it possible to train an artificial neural network with a large number of hidden layers the following are some cases in which these novel techniques are starting to get attention by researchers for applications in hydrology and or weather forecasting jeon et al 2016 employed the generalized extreme value fused lasso penalty function to detect the change point of non stationary annual maximum precipitations in south korea shahbazi et al 2018 developed a regression imputation framework with a two layer structure coupling neuro fuzzy networks and elastic net for filling missing records and air pollution forecasting in tehran fang et al 2017 utilized a time series deep learning neural network to create a system that predicted the soil moisture active passive level 3 moisture product with atmospheric forcing model simulated moisture and static physiographic attributes as inputs considering the notably high performance of the proposed enhanced elm model and the growing aspirations of deep learning algorithms to be used for real prediction and classification purposes in today s data analytics era a future study applying the eelm model that aims to design a recurrent hidden layer elm model following deep learning principles is a promising step forward to advance the findings of this study in such a deep learning model which was beyond the scope of this research researchers could employ a convolutional neural network cnn ertugrul 2016 kim et al 2017 in such a model the principles of elm could still be retained to reduce the computational burden of multiple hidden layer networks however one possibility is also to use a stacked enhanced elm architecture within a cnn framework with backpropagation algorithm to deduce targets of hidden layers to learn network weights while maintaining good performance levels e g kim et al 2017 5 conclusions and future research direction the primary motivation of conducting the current research is to investigate the applicability and assess the capability of the enhanced version of the elm model tuned with the cod approach used in a problem of forecasting one step ahead daily river flow in a tropical environment kelantan river malaysia the modeling efficiency of the proposed eelm model is verified in respect to the classical version of the elm and the svr model in addition the paper demonstrates a timely and a detailed survey of the employment of the extreme learning machine approach and its well established version in the field of water resources engineering a review of such works is necessary to provide young hydrologists a set milestone for the new era of the soft computing and research direction in water resources engineering and in particular in solving the non linearity and non stationarity issues in hydrological modeling the latter of course can be achieved by a data decomposition technique such as the cod method applied in the present study furthermore this study aims to shed some light on future directions of the elm model for its development and implementation as a real time forecasting tool for practitioners in the field of hydrology the major findings of the inspected approaches and their applications are abridged in the following form i in general the eelm model is seen to exhibit itself as a very optimistic predictive model that can be utilized as a viable alternative to the state of the art models for river flow forecasting and particularly in the hydrological region of a tropical environment ii in the testing period 2009 2014 the eelm based predictive model reveals a great potential to improve the level of accuracy of the elm and svr models in quantitative terms the absolute error values i e rmse and mae are reduced significantly by about 11 61 22 53 and 8 26 8 72 respectively when the eelm model is evaluated compared to the elm and svr models iii the proposed eelm model is likely to be considered as a very reliable forecasting tool for the inspected tropical environment yet the behavior of eelm model demonstrates a noticeable challenge in forecasting high river flow patterns due to the high fluctuations and stochasticity of the model input datasets it is concluded that the space for further effort to be accomplished within the current scope of research is still an ongoing endeavor based on accomplished findings and extensive state of the art future research trends can be undertaking in the following propositions i the efficiency of a single hidden layer elm model lies on random initialization of the internal network weight during the learning process but this framework might be a limitation from a soft computing prospective as the single hidden layer can affect the network learning performance and lead to ineffective predictions the potential of thus extending elm into a deep learning neural network model where recurrent hidden layers are positioned in the feature space is an area to be explored for a better internal weight determination for instance ertugrul 2016 designed a recurrent elm based approach to forecast electricity load more accurately and fast learning process while a restricted boltzmann approach was applied hinton et al 2006 to yield effective results on this aspect on the other hand the harmony search approach can also be used seen to exhibit an excellent optimization of the elm geem et al 2001 for the neurons and weight configurations deep learning based elms are largely unnoticed in hydrological sciences but due to their rapid training and testing times and high accuracy they are worth investigating in future research work further an integration of elm model with nature inspired algorithms is highly emphasized to be explored such as particle swarm optimization salp swarm algorithm and others mirjalili et al 2017 ii in future research that applies elm for hydrological forecasting where the memory of hydrological features are prominent an advanced variant of the deep learning process constructed with the gradient based long short term memory network lstm with recurrent or convolutional layers hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is a promising predictive tool the premise of applying lstm based recurrent elm where lstm can learn to bridge minimal time lags in discrete steps to enforce constant error flow through error carousels and allow the multiplicative gate units to learn to open close access to the constant error flow can lead to promising results since such a model can implement time series lagged behavior of input data hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 sak et al 2014 tian and pan 2015 moreover lstm based elm can also be implemented to search for features that are local in space and time and its computational complexity is generally low so that it can lead to extensive feature extraction with a low latency output of the hydrological variable iii it has been reported by prof keith beven one of the famous scientist in hydrology in his advice for young hydrologist beven 2016 that the hydrological science is facing a hazard in its development owing to the limited resources and thus the use of soft computing models is much inexpensive rather that the experimentation investigations that are costly and necessitated for an expensive equipment s hence engineering modelers must take the advantage to build an expert systems that can contribute to real society problems solving such as flooding hurricane etc iv it is worth to report that the efficiency of the elm model should be justified not only through its reliability in term of the numerical accuracy but rather on the practical implementation for the water resources engineering and most importantly knowledge based expert system for instance the typical modeling based on physical based model exhibited excellent and useful methodologies in the field of atmospheric engineering hence the enclosure of the elm modeling potential into the existing decision making outline is still challenging to be considered this is for sure with the well though out of the system physics and information availability v throughout the extensive review there was a significant factor absent from the modeling which is the humans activity impact it should be noted that human activities influence the behavior of the catchment basin with multiple criteria and thus hydrologist must not neglect this constructive factor that certainly can manipulate the modeling results vi correlated variables contribute remarkably for the prediction accuracy as they provide an informative attribute to the targeted output for instance more weather and hydrological information variables such as rainfall evaporation humidity temperature etc for modeling river flow can enrich the modeling learning process and hence more researches are required to be devoted on this prospect vii with regard to the modeling process effectiveness hydrology and climate variables are usually associated with missing data and especially in developing countries where less watershed management and sustainability allocated hence exploring a reliable methods or mathematical procedures is highly recommended to be obtained where those missing data are vastly influencing the modeling performance on the other hand the methods for assessing the prediction process should be reconsidered as for instance leave k out method applied in the literature for modeling validation however as clearly reported by the extensive review research conducted by solomatine and ostfeld 2008 the limitation of using this approach is the data will not always be contiguous so that for example it would not be possible to visualize a hydrograph when the model is fed with the test set since different training and testing sets would be used there are several water resources engineering processes that have not been investigated using the application of elm models or its more advanced versions such as deep learning based or lstm based elm model

6766,despite the massive diversity in the modeling requirements for practical hydrological applications there remains a need to develop more reliable and intelligent expert systems used for real time prediction purposes the challenge in meeting the standards of an expert system is primarily due to the influence and behavior of hydrological processes that is driven by natural fluctuations over the physical scale and the resulting variance in the underlying model input datasets river flow forecasting is an imperative task for water resources operation and management water demand assessments

direction 1 introduction 1 1 river flow modeling background it has been proven scientifically that the forecasting of river systems and its water flow behaviors is particularly difficult owing to the physical processes and natural variabilities associated with the river flow system e g chaotic disturbances random and non stationary complex and non linear behaviors farmer 2016 in hydrological applications the need to enhance the reliability and accuracy of forecasting hydrological variables has attracted a lot of attention to date as the research agenda driven by hydro meteorological researchers has progressed there has been no single identified approach that can generally be applied in hydrological process modeling under diverse conditions especially with different catchment characteristics this is due to several physical phenomena such as the patterns in model input and target data periodicity or randomness and natural stochasticity usually observed in river flow datasets yaseen et al 2016a b 2018 prasad et al 2017 considering this viewpoint it may also be argued that currently no universal model exists that can perform better than other models for a diverse range of hydrological conditions and different watershed properties a large number of models cannot generate the forecasts in a consistent manner because of the dynamic and non stationary pattern including the existence of extreme events in historical data because of these constraints researchers are required to explore and develop more robust and versatile models that have an enhanced efficiency using available historical data on the same standpoint researchers must take into consideration the advantage of rapidly evolving and sophisticated computational power that has the potential to improve modeling methodologies and accuracy threshold in hydrological forecasting applications additionally researchers are also applying complex modeling theorems and newly developed software including techniques such as deep learning and convolutional neural networks schmidhuber 2015 a plausible reason why river flow data has technically been quite difficult to forecast can be gleaned by studying its complex non linear dynamical and chaotic disturbances and the randomness present in its historical behavior dietrich 1987 wen 2009 the understanding of a complex river flow systems its phenomenon and the hydrological processes that govern the flow is vital in proper management of water resources many researchers have studied river flow phenomenon over past few decades emerging from their interests studying the impacts of the changes in the global and regional climate pattern on the hydrologic cycle which is known to cause flooding and drought azmi et al 2016 chang 2008 döll and schmied 2012 yang et al 2010 two main approaches have been used in modeling of river flow patterns based on literature i physically based models such as those utilizing partial differential equations and ii statistical models such as soft computing i e machine learning methods under an artificial intelligence ai approach huge research effort needs to be expended including the need for many hydrological variables to supply initial and boundary conditions needed for the physically based model to simulate the elemental processes of a particular watershed by contrast the conceptually based approach utilizing historical input data such as ai models are able to capture non linear relationships between predictors and the simulated variable without a need for a pre knowledge of the flow physics and advantageously these models also require a smaller number of hydrological inputs azmi and sarmadi 2016 maier et al 2014 ai based modeling generally involves the analysis of investigated issues collection and pre processing of data selecting the data driven model identifying optimal model from several trained models and evaluating the final model araghinejad et al 2011 the identification of data driven model is a major component of ai procedure this is the stage where the learning process and feature extraction from input data is implemented and the optimal model is approximated by reducing the training error between the forecasted and target matrix and the optimal model is selected among several trained models on an independent validation set usually judged by lowest mean square error the approximation accuracy of ai models can be affected by various factors that influence real hydrological conditions some of these factors include the determinations of model input the time scale or forecast horizon and the configuration of data driven models conventional river flow forecasting is generally knowledge driven in nature with physical or semi physical representation of the runoff generating processes yet the transformation from rainfall to streamflow is highly complex and is affected by many factors such as topography rainfall distribution soil properties land use climate change urban development etc a precise construction of such physics based model is very difficult to attain as an abundance of these data are required to fulfil the initial conditions furthermore the forecasting successfulness relies highly on attaining a reliable model fit which entails a high quality observed data with sufficient period length chau and jiang 2002 chau and jin 1998 unfortunately some influencing parameters are often not available in many catchments besides in some catchments the historical records may not be reliable after having previously undergone certain climate change or land use changes thus conventional models are often limited by incomplete data availability with recent advances in artificial intelligence technologies machine learning rainfall runoff models have become a viable alternative to their knowledge driven counterparts chau 2017 fotovatikhah et al 2018 machine learning algorithms can detect the complex interrelations among prominent parameters that control the interaction mechanisms and hence can perform runoff prediction accurately in real time without the requirement of a thorough understanding of the interaction mechanisms wang and yao 2013 wu and chau 2011 besides data requirements are much less extensive than those for physics based models and the problem of missing data is solved at the same time as such in all the following three circumstances namely i if we have a well developed physics based river flow forecasting model ii if we do not have a developed model or iii in a data limited situation we may employ a machine learning technique to complement and or replace it cheng and chau 2004 cheng et al 2015 1 2 research motivation and enthusiasm undertaking accurate and reliable forecasts of daily river flow with an expert system is a pivotal task of water resources management such a robust model can be utilized as a pertinent tool by hydrologists for effective sustainability assessment of water resources including its usage in domestic irrigation hydropower and agriculture demand in addition expert models are useful for planning of future applications in environmental protection and developing water balance systems in general establishing an accurate forecast model for all types of hydro climates and watershed environments is extremely significant yet a difficult task jeong and kim 2009 however the efficiency of every model s output response is considerably based on the characteristics of the modelled watershed cui and singh 2016 for example tropical climatic zones are influenced by heavy monsoon rainfall which are occasional intermittent and often quite unpredictable that can make the variation in river flow patterns much more complicated and non linear in its character compared to its normal state gharun et al 2015 parmar and bhardwaj 2014 as the prediction of such behaviors are difficult with physical or hydrological models that require exact initial conditions exploring more versatile and more responsive soft computing models in this area of need remains a desirable mission for hydrological forecasters 1 3 elm

2009 he et al 2014 noori et al 2011 adaptive neuro fuzzy system greco 2012 pramanik and panda 2009 sharma et al 2015 evolutionary computing kashid et al 2010 ni et al 2010 and the hybrid wavelet ai model danandeh mehr et al 2013 makwana and tiwari 2014 prasad et al 2017 sahay and srivastava 2014 deo et al 2017 prasad et al 2017 2018b however all of these applied models still have a notable degree of shortcoming about their generalization and implementation as an expert system including its time consuming characteristic and human controlled i e non automated modeling process therefore the design of an automated approach where ai models can be implemented universally and over different local e g catchment scales remains a passionate challenge that continues to be undertaken by practicing hydrologists recently a relatively new learning approach has been proposed namely the extreme learning machines huang et al 2006 the main advantage of this model lies within its internal feature mapping feature without the need of iterative tuning of the hidden neuron parameters which is required for the case of a conventional artificial neural network model in an elm model the input and hidden neuron weighting are randomly computed from a large number of pre assigned neurons without passing through every neuron in the model in addition the elm model has an acceptable generalization skill and has less time consumption cost based on several implemented applications huang et al 2015 deo and şahin 2016 deo et al 2017 it has also been observed over the past five years that an extensive trend in the implementation of the elm model has been noted with particular use in text analysis atsawaraungsuk and horata 2015 bazi et al 2014 control system designs li et al 2013 system modeling and predictions mantoro et al 2011 remote sensing applications pal 2009 and several fields of science and engineering barzegar et al 2018a 2018b salcedo sanz et al 2018 yaseen et al 2018 most recently the investigation of the elm approach in practical problems related to hydrology meteorology climatic studies morphology hydraulic engineering soil moisture studies and environmental sciences has yielded very optimistic findings the first attempt to model the river flow system using elm algorithm was established by siqueira et al 2014 in this study the authors proposed the elm method as an unorganized machine learning predictive model to capture non linearity of hydrological problem in brazilian hydropower plant seasonal river flow data results of that study showed a noticeable outcome in term of modeling the river flow time series that opened the door for several scholars to explore the applicability of this approach in hydrology this was followed by other attempts undertaken by li and cheng 2014 where researchers applied a new predictive model on two reservoirs with monthly inflow scale located in china the modeling results which were validated with one of the dominant ai models the svr showed excellent prediction skill in 2015 researchers have also performed river flow prediction conducted using a coupled extreme learning machine model integrated with binary coded swarm optimization bcso based on implicit base flow separation the bcso method was used to optimize digital filter of the input variable reconstruction in this modelling research results revealed a noticeable underestimation of the base flow process due to the non efficiency of reflected geographical information of the studied watershed region atiquzzaman and kandasamy 2015 developed a traditional elm model for hydrological time series prediction i e focusing on river flows using daily time series information in usa the adopted elm model when compared with an evolutionary computing support vector regression model ec svr showed slight difference in the level of accuracy a more thorough investigation was carried out by applying elm to a total of nine environmental regression based problems lima et al 2015 the modeling proficiency was compared with conventional regression model and several ai models including the ann svm and random forest models under large number of cases and model predictors it was noticed that the elm attained very good results with less computational time vis à vis the ai and linear regression models for almost all inspected problems recently an alternative version of elm namely the online sequential extreme learning machine i e os elm has been developed and applied for daily monthly and yearly river flow forecasting in canada lima et al 2016 the findings demonstrated a remarkable degree of forecasting accuracy in comparison with a multi linear regression mlr model as a benchmark the same method i e os elm applied for flooding events forecasting in the case of neckar river in germany was demonstrated in another study yadav et al 2016b in that paper hourly meteorological dataset was used to construct and evaluate the data intelligent model based on os elm in 2016 zaher et al proposed the non tuned elm based predictive model for modeling monthly time scale streamflow data in a semi arid region in iraq the proposed model was verified against generalized regression neural network and support vector regression models the established models proved the effectiveness of elm for the inspected region and particularly for monthly time scale forecasting rezaie balf and kisi 2017 studied three different predictive models including an optimally pruned elm i e op elm traditional ann and evolutionary polynomial regression epr for daily streamflow forecasting on three different regions located in iran overall the epr model outperformed traditional ann and op elm model for all cases studies it was also noted that op elm model was unable to capture the stochasticity of this region s streamflow patterns deo and şahin 2016 evaluated the elm model in respect to an ann model for streamflow prediction in queensland australia where a set of nine predictors with the month to consider the seasonality of qwl rainfall southern oscillation index pacific decadal oscillation index enso modoki index indian ocean dipole index and nino 3 0 nino 3 4 and nino 4 0 sea surface temperatures ssts were utilized not only did the elm model outperform the ann in terms of testing accuracy but also was several folds faster than the ann model revealing its potential as a real time simulator of streamflow in literature the latest usage of the elm model was undertaken on the johor river located in malaysia over a daily time scale forecast horizon yaseen et al 2016a besides the investigation of river flow forecasting based on multi station information using hybrid elm coupled with wavelet denoising method was conducted by nourani et al 2017 the developed hybrid model was also validated against least square support vector machine lssvm model in conclusion very good results were obtained by coupling elm model with wavelet transformation compared to a benchmark model it should be considered that the input variable attributes have scientifically been proven to contribute to the level of accuracy of any machine learning model taormina and chau 2015a based on this conceptual idea dariane and azimi 2017 integrated the elm model with evolutionary input selection algorithms i e the genetic algorithm for monthly river flow forecasting at the ajichai basin the study confirmed a significant coupling of the input selection algorithm that influenced the elm model s forecasting efficiency in the area of river flows the latest version of the elm model was employed for river flow forecasting by lima et al 2017 where the researchers developed a new form of the online sequential elm os elm model from their earlier published article lima et al 2016 and later applied in context of rainfall forecasting ali et al 2018 this model was denoted as the variable complexity elm i e vc os elm applied for online daily river flow forecasting at a hydrological station in british columbia canada the merit of the proposed vc os elm resulted in its ability to be applied as an online expert predictive model with updated features for the most recent hydrological information the online predictive model was demonstrated as a robust soft computing model that could be applied efficiently in hydrological prospective some other notable studies on river flow system and general hydrological forecasting applications also demonstrated the elm model to exhibit sophisticated level of performance particularly in modeling river and lake water level deo and şahin 2016 shiri et al 2016 rainfall river flow roushangar et al 2017 and urban water demand estimation mouatadid and adamowski 2017 tiwari et al 2016 to date it is clear that the desire to apply the elm model in a range of hydrological prediction problems continues to be an attractive pathway for decision makers to solve practical problems in a diverse range of geographic and hydrological i e catchment scale scenarios 1 5 research review assessments in light of the foregoing state of the art of the extreme learning machine algorithms and their applications in modeling water resources and solving other engineering problems and also to solve these prediction problems in a relatively shorter model execution time compared to some of the other data driven models e g svr and ann the need to establish a comprehensive survey of the previous research works is highly warranted and practically beneficial mainly for the benefit of young new hydrologists and research scholars who may be interested in applying the elm model to improve existing approaches considering this viewpoint an extensive review of the elm model is also required to recognise the current trends of using this data intelligence tool and also to propose a new way to showcase its practicality and versatility in hydrological forecasting problems as it is evident in the findings throughout the comprehensive details provided appendix a based on conducted careful review of existing research works it is apparent that a majority of the elm model applications have been developed on multivariate applications and particularly on the modeling of climatological and environmental systems this has resulted due to the fact that the elm model is able to identify the non linear relationship that represent physical processes between the predictors and the predictand by virtue of its merits driven by the randomized learning process in river flow forecasting modelling different hydrological and geophysical parameters are usually used as predictors whilst river flow time series at specific station is the predictand these models consider inherent assumption of stationarity in the relationship between predictors and predictand however in real cases depending on the actual data this assumption may not be correct in cases of identification of non stationary in the relationships between predictors and predictand the model results become uncertain as such it is significant to determine possible reasons after having identified any specific non stationaries and care should be made in selecting predictors to avoid the occurrence of any non stationarity schmith and foss 2008 demonstrated that if a statistical downscaling model was non stationary over the training phase the basic stationarity assumption became questionable xenarios et al 2018 highlighted the role and impacts of non stationarities and assessed non stationarities between heavy rainstorm events with mega scale circulation in the mediterranean sea despite the excellent capability of the elm model in mimicking the nonlinearities that represent the physical phenomena mainly through multivariate modeling approaches hydrologist sometimes still require univariate models to be developed mainly as time series prediction models where the antecedent trends and magnitudes of the inspected hydrological variable is used to model the future value of the variable it is worthwhile to highlight the fact that the elm model has also been validated for its predictive ability on univariate input data applications and especially for river flow forecasting another noticeable outcome of the review is that the feasibility of the elm model has improved magnificently by virtue of the hybrid elm models that were coupled with data pre processing approaches such as wavelet transformation algorithm in such studies a set of hybrid models have often relied on the decomposition of the input space with multiple levels of frequency based information used to improve the performance skill the nature of the diverse patterns due to the regionalization effect of the model s accuracy in terms of the hydrological differences clearly points out that there is no universal data intelligence model that is able to mimic global watershed features however for the elm model results demonstrated that this tool was a sophisticated predictive algorithm applied over numerous types of watershed regions with different characteristics in modeling of key hydrological variables the review has also led to an extremely encouraging outcome particularly for a practical implementation of the elm model for example the recent version of the elm model known as the variable complexity elm i e vc os elm has a sophisticated and an advanced applicability as an online predictive expert system with a great potential for real time forecasting the vc os elm model is a highly recommended expert system tool for flood control and management purposes including reservoirs system operation and designing reliable irrigating systems for enhanced crop production furthermore the advantage of predicting and forecasting information for future river flows considering the environmental and ecological aspects is amicably possible through this newer real time vc os elm model 1 6 research objectives the purpose of the current research design is to review the application of elm in hydrological contexts and also to investigate an enhanced version of the extreme learning machine model tuned with the complete orthogonal decomposition cod hough and vavasis 1997 instead of the conventional techniques such as singular value decomposition svd that have been used in highly stochastic river flow pattern forecasting in tropical environments i e kelantan river malaysia regression problem classically is solved in elm model through calculating the moore penrose generalized inverse using svd even though svd is a versatile and numerically stable method the main limitation of this procedure is computationally expensive especially when the number of hidden nodes is large the computational complexity will significantly rise guo et al 2016 the large computation complexity of svd is the critical factor limiting the learning speed of elm hence looking for more robust and reliable alternative to svd should be promising to improve the computation efficiency of elm in this study cod approach is adopted to solve the linear least squares problem that is simpler than svd yet provides more computation reliability and stability this study aims to provide a robust and reliable soft computing based tool for river engineering systems establishing an accurate data intelligence model can yield essential information for water resources engineering applications e g agriculture irrigation management and environmental impact assessments the proposed model has been justified with respect to old fashioned e g svr and new generation of classical neural network e g elm models as a major contribution of this research work a comprehensive literature survey is conducted from most reliable sources in scopus google scholar web of science and trustworthy repositories of published research on the potential viability of the extreme learning machine model applied in the water resources engineering assessment and evaluation of the knowledge and current state of the art are performed based on the research knowledge generated by key research scholars within the hydrological community the paper closes by providing propositions on future efforts that can be devoted to this research area 2 theory and background 2 1 extreme learning machine elm model is an innovative machine learning algorithm that is characterized mainly by the fact that there is no need for a tuning of the model s internal parameters i e the hidden neurons in essence elm is an improved version of conventional ann model where it is able to solve regression problems with a reduced model execution time deo et al 2017b deo and şahin 2015 this is because the input weights and biases are randomly generated so that the output weights have a unique least squares solution solved by the moore penrose generalized inverse function huang et al 2006 this can result in a better performance when compared to ann and svr models acharya et al 2013 deo and şahin 2015 deo et al 2017 an additional issue with conventional techniques is that the ann model can suffer from a slow convergence ability inferior generalization local minima issues over fitting and the need for iterative tuning all of which distinguish the superiority of elm over ann considering the basic theory of elm randomly initiated hidden neurons are fixed so elm is remarkably efficient to attain a global optimum solution following universal approximation capabilities huang and chen 2007 huang et al 2006 the general structure of the elm model can be visualized through fig 1 a mathematically the elm model can best be summarized by assuming that there is a set of training data set samples x 1 y 1 x t y t in this assumption x t is the explanatory variable and y t is the response variable the input vectors x 1 x 2 x t present the predictor variables that are based on the initiated model of the antecedent values of the daily time series of river flow the antecedent values are obtained by using the auto correlation function statistical approach see fig 1b for data points defined by t 1 2 n n is the training samples x t r d and y t r the single feed forward neural network slfn can be expressed numerically as proposed by huang et al 2006 1 i 1 l b i g i α i x t β i z t i 1 n the variables in eq 1 are l hidden nodes number g i α i x t β i hidden layer output function α i a n d β i hidden node parameters that are randomly determined b i the weight factor connecting the ith hidden nodes and output node and z t elm model output the number of the input neurons are determined according to the antecedent values which are from 1 to 3 i e the input combinations in this study the output layer generates the forecasted values one step ahead river flow forecasting based on the linear transfer function followed recent literature research in hydrology e g deo and şahin 2016 yaseen et al 2016b in the elm model the hidden node parameters can be randomly generated without any knowledge of the training data or without iteratively tuning the hidden layer neurons one by one for the lowest mean square error that is for any continuous target function f x and any randomly generated sequence α i β i i 1 l eq 1 is used to approximate a set of n training sample through 2 lim l f x f l x lim l f x i 1 l b i g i α i x t β i 0 the primary merits of the non tuned elm model are that the hidden layer weights are randomly obtained this can yield a zero error offering the possibility of configuring the network s output weights b analytically for the training samples it is worthwhile to highlight that values of the internal activation function parameters α i a n d β i are allocated based on probability distribution finally eq 2 is equivalent to y g b as a linear system formulation huang et al 2006 such that 3 g α β x g x i g x n g i α 1 x 1 β 1 g l a l b l x 1 g i α n x n β 1 g l a l b l x n and 4 b b 1 t b l t λ x 1 a n d y y 1 t y n t n x 1 g is the hidden layer output matrix and t is the transport of the matrix eq 3 can be simplified as 5 hb y the minimum norm square solution of eq 4 is 6 b h y the h is the moore penrose inverse of hussain h matrix traditionally svd has been predominantly used for the elm learning process 2 2 the proposed enhanced elm model as an alternative to the singular value decomposition svd approach the complete orthogonal decomposition cod can exhibit an excellent performance in solving linear problems using the method of least squares with a simple and a reliable computation procedure hough and vavasis 1997 with the purpose of enhancing the elm model s learning process and efficiency the cod algorithm in this study is used to determine the output weights it should be pointed out that the main merits of the distinguished cod approach over the svd model are 1 high efficiency much simpler computation procedure that lead to improvement of the learning performance 2 high stability a stable factorization for the matrix calculation and 3 high reliability cod is usually highly efficient no matter the size of hussain matrix for more details about the complete orthogonal decomposition and its applications in tuning the elm model please refer to guo et al 2016 2 3 support vector regression svr in this study the svr model has been used as a second predictive model to benchmark the efficiency of the eelm model svr is a robust soft computing approach established for hydrological process modeling raghavendra and deka 2014 the primary features of the svr approach entails an optimization of the hyperplane in the original input data set space purposely to isolate the assigned training dataset accurately and to leave as much distance as possible from the closest instances to the hyperplane on both sides vapnik 1995 the mathematical formulation of the regression problem can be defined as follows assuming that a data set space is defined by t 1 2 n n is the training samples x t r d is the training input variables and y t r training output variable the non linear regression function is presented in drucker et al 1997 7 f x w t φ x 1 b the variables above are defined as w the matrix weight φ x 1 the high dimensional feature space and b bias the primary goal of the regression function is to fit the data t by determining the main function value f x that has the largest deviation ε from the actual data set domain over all the training sphere see fig 1c hence eq 7 is transformed into a constrained convex optimization problem with an e insensitivity loss function that can be written as follows minimize φ w ξ 0 5 w 2 c i 1 m ξ 1 ξ 1 0 8 s u b j e c t t o y i w t φ x 1 b ε ξ 1 w t φ x 1 b y 1 ε ξ 1 ξ 1 ξ 1 0 ξ the slack variable that define the upper and lower excess deviation ξ 1 and ξ 1 c is the positive regularization variable ε is the loss function that linked the approximation accuracies of the training data phase radial basis function is used to solve the kernel function it is usually implemented to solve the nonlinearity feature space mapping during the training procedure the rbf internal parameters including γ ε and c are determined by using particle swarm optimization pso algorithm owing to its effectiveness ch et al 2013 chau 2007 yunrong and liangzhong 2009 2 4 modeling implementation and performance skills the models are trained by using the statistically correlated antecedent river flow data as determined by the correlation and the auto correlation statistics see fig 1b this approach has been adopted in several previous works in hydrological forecasting problems hence a total of three input attributes and the relevant combinations are constructed to build the architecture of the predictive models by using the following formulation 9 m o d e l 1 q t f q t 1 10 m o d e l 2 q t f q t 1 q t 2 11 m o d e l 3 q t f q t 1 q t 2 q t 3 it is noted that q t is the forecasted value of river flow q t 1 q t 2 and q t 3 are the antecedent values of the river flow one two and three days previous all these antecedent river flow represent the variables of the targeted q t through the data intelligence functionality i e eelm elm and svr models the prediction of the models are evaluated by using various numerical statistic indicators in addition to the graphical evaluation i e scatter plots and relative error plots ho 2012 nussbaum thom et al 2013 these numerical indicators include determination coefficient r willmott s index wi nash sutcliffe coefficient e ns root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and relative error re chai and draxler 2014 legates and mccabe 1999 nash and sutcliffe 1970 willmott 1981 12 r i 1 n q o q o q f q f i 1 n q o q o 2 i 1 n q f q f 2 13 wi 1 i 1 n q o q f 2 i 1 n q f q o q f q o 2 14 e ns 1 i 1 n q o q f 2 i 1 n q o q o 2 15 rmse 1 n i 1 n q f q o 2 16 mae 1 n i 1 n q f q o 17 re q o q f q o 100 where q o q f q f and q o are the observed value forecasted value mean observed value and mean forecasted value of river flow we utilize eqs 12 17 to provide a comprehensive assessment of models since literature suggests that no single metric is sufficient to fully validate a forecast model asce 2000 chai and draxler 2014 krause et al 2005 nash and sutcliffe 1970 willmott 1982 1981 chai and draxler 2014 noted that model evaluation must include both rmse and mae eqs 15 16 since rmse is largely applicable when the error distribution of the developed model is normal whereas mae is useful when it is uniform however both performance metrics show the magnitude of overall point averaged error in the test period over the entire series but on their own they may fail to show the true validation of a developed model considering this the relative error metric eq 17 should also be used where the error is presented as a percentage within the test set for a river flow regime that has a different mean property or if it is situated in a hydrologically diverse condition the present model cannot be compared unless the relative error in a normalized percentage form is presented therefore this study has employed the relative error together with the mae and rmse in traditional model assessments the employment of the correlation coefficient r computed between the forecasted and observed dataset is paramount since a 1 1 correspondence is likely to show how well the forecast model is able to fit the observed data whilst also showing the estimated amount of variance by means of the r2 equivalent however this is a linear metric and an overall estimator so a normalized metric the nash sutcliffe coefficient e ns is also used the e ns is a well established model evaluation tool nash and sutcliffe 1970 to provide advanced information that is often complementary to r rmse and mae however willmott 1981 1982 found that ens alone may not provide a true account of the forecast model performance since it is based on the square of the differences between the observed and forecasted data where an equal weighting could be given to the low and the high flows deo et al 2017 therefore in this study the willmott s index is used where it includes the absolute value of the predicted and observed means including the observed and forecasted means for further information the readers are referred to the several studies e g asce 2000 chai and draxler 2014 krause et al 2005 nash and sutcliffe 1970 willmott 1981 3 case study and data description in this research daily time series river flow data measured at guillemard station kelantan river located in the north east region of the malaysian peninsula is utilized the statistical properties of the training testing and complete are tabulated in table 1 fig 2 shows the location of the selected river site the historical river flow data are obtained from the department of irrigation and drainage did malaysia the river flow measurements are obtained using telemetry methods where water level pressure remotely calculated using sensor at particular river cross section in general the climatic conditions at this study site is characterized by heavy monsoon rainfall events which often results in annual flood events therefore the development of such an intelligent forecasting model of stream flow can be adopted as an integral part of the flood hydrology assessments and can have potential implications in economic infrastructural and agricultural development dimensions the total length and drainage area of kelantan river are approximately 248 km and 13 170 km2 the river flow data are obtained for the observed period of 1965 2014 over a daily time scale 4 results and discussion in this study based on the context of machine learning models river flow modeling has been categorized into two different approaches one approach considers the fact that a forecasting model can be based on the river flow data itself by including the correlated lag times as an attribute to forecast one step ahead on the other hand the second approach of modeling river flow entails an appropriate exogenous hydrological variable apart from the river flow data such as rainfall water level and other related physical parameters related to river flow that can be used to forecast the river dataset in this paper the enhanced version of elm model eelm is applied to forecast daily time scale data i e the tropical case study it must be noted however that using only river flow information to module the river flow itself is more challenging for the hydrologist in terms of attaining the best level of accuracy as it may lack pertinent features of the catchment that lacks the meteorological information the well established data intelligence predictive models i e the eelm vs the elm svr models are evaluated numerically through several performance statistics that are acceptable norms in hydrological research community table 2 tabulates the performance assessment in the testing phase of hydrological modeling the best input combinations for the eelm elm and svr are designated as model 2 model 2 and model 1 in their order of the best to the worst performance the best fit of goodness metrics including r wi and e ns values are approximately 0 89 0 93 and 0 79 for the eelm 0 86 0 91 and 0 74 for elm and 0 81 0 89 and 0 66 for svr model respectively to further support this result the mean absolute error indicators i e rmse mae are approximately 314 16 m3s 1 100 41 m3s 1 for the eelm 355 42 m3s 1 109 38 m3s 1 for the elm and 405 52 m3s 1 110 05 m3s 1 for the svr model respectively in general results of the proposed eelm model reveal a noticeable enhancement when applied at all daily time horizons in term of accuracy another important diagnostic evaluator displayed in table 2 is the computational time for the testing stage it can be seen that a noticeable difference in the execution speed of the eelm model is recorded in comparison with other benchmark models i e elm and svr this remarkable speed of the eelm model is owing to the potential of the complete orthogonal decomposition learning approach guo et al 2016 for a more detailed insight into and for further evaluation of the predictive performance a set of scatter plots are generated fig 3 the coefficient of determination r 2 and the regression formula y a o x a1 are also displayed in the scatter plots for each model a scatter plot of the actual observed river flow data versus the forecasted river flow data is also prepared to assess the statistical correlation level the best regression values are obtained for the eelm followed by the elm and svr models attaining approximately 0 80 0 74 and 0 67 respectively notably the eelm model is found to demonstrate the best model performance which is displayed by the closest 1 1 line of fit compared to the other data intelligent models on the other hand the scatter plot generated for the testing period i e 2009 2014 reveals that the low river flow forecasting accuracy has a slight variance regarding the medium river flow values results show that they are overestimated but for the high flows values these are underestimated as obviously revealed by the relative error diagnostic indicator see fig 4 in terms of the maximum errors outlined in the seasonality peak flows again and consistently the eelm model outperforms other data intelligent models in forecasting these peak river flows by comparing all studied forecasting methods for the kelantan river case study i e the eelm elm and svr by means of a detailed comprehensive analysis the relative forecasting errors eq 17 are examined for the testing period results of the three data intelligent models are shown in fig 4 a c in general the performance of the three data intelligent models appears to be quite good for this tropical hydrological environment as all utilized approaches achieve almost the same pattern of relative in graphical terms a closer examination shows that the residual error however is improved when using the proposed eelm model over the traditional elm and the svr models based on the graphical presentations in fig 4 the maximum percentages values of model errors are allocated in the peak events of the testing phase this demonstrates that it is not possible to attain a high level of accuracy when utilizing such redundant historical data set the prediction of peak river flow values is difficult because of the sudden river flow records that is resulted due to the heavy rainfall events caused by the monsoon where the environment is predominated with random rainfall events this result might also be due to the fact that the range of the monitoring data for kelantan river is between 100 and 8000 m3s 1 so that the proposed methods are likely to suffer from such large data range which is generally intermittent and less frequent compared to the overall time series if so this perhaps renders it difficult for data intelligent methods to be adequately trained to mimic the pattern of the river flow and to overcome the highly dynamic nature of the modelled dataset it is therefore possible that the availability of less information in the model s training stage likely leads to a set of fewer patterns to be adequately captured by data intelligent models nevertheless the present study shows that the performance of the eelm model remains optimal in respect to the elm and the svr models given that most of the adopted algorithms for river flow forecasts rely only on the use of algorithms such the conventional ann model the performance of the proposed eelm model is significantly better for this specific application in this paper we perform modeling of river flow by using daily data for kelantan river in malaysia this is due to the fact that the length of the kelantan river is about 250 km hence the travel time of water flow in this system is only within a couple of days on the contrary on what can be seen in the study conducted by yaseen et al 2016b the time scale of the tigris river modeled was monthly because that river system was much longer and there was no major significance in terms of the timescale to investigate the daily forecasting models as a further assessment it is also evident that the 55 years stream flow data used to develop forecasting model for the tropical region may not be sufficient since the rmse and mae values were relatively high which were almost three times when compared with similar index in semi arid region yaseen et al 2016b for a practical implementation of the present methods the potential use of the extreme learning machine model in general and particularly the most recent version of the elm i e vc oselm proposed by lima et al 2017 can be a significant tool for river engineering operations this type of soft computing model is featured by the ability to update the learning process online and therefore it may present an ideal interface for real time simulations in more representable illustration fig 5 exhibits the online forecasting intelligence system that can be envisioned in real time flooding control system the online forecasting system will start by obtaining the physical properties of the river including the area velocity and river flow discharge by using various data sensors results of the elm based predictive model can be linked to a global system for mobile communications gsm in the case of expected flooding or in the case of danger events of river flow gsm networks can deliver a chain of messages to alarm the nearby civilians for the preparation in an emergency evacuation task this merit of the elm based model can provide a robust tool for the hydrologist and other decision maker to perform the forecasts and to implement a reliable water resources management and planning system in addition the perceived online forecasting system can be applied in practice on several river flow time scales both of a short and a long forecast horizon moreover reliable and accurate streamflow forecasts for future events can also be used as an external attribute variable for the modeling of the other hydrological components such as water quality river water level sediment concentration transport and others nevertheless a pure machine learning model is a black box model and cannot show the involved physical processes on the other hand hybrids of physically based and machine learning models which were rarely considered so far can take the advantages of both methods and fill the existing research gap in this regard recently researchers commenced to undertake novel works on the inclusion of the physically based process into machine learning techniques chen and chau 2016 taormina and chau 2015b taormina and chau 2015a 2015b included expert knowledge on the baseflow separation in machine learning streamflow modeling with extreme learning machine chen and chau 2016 reported a hybrid model with double neural networks for prediction of suspended sediment loads by incorporating a key physically based process namely the continuity equation into the structure the preliminary results were promising it is believed that it is a cutting edge task of systematically exploring the feasibility of developing novel hybrid physically based and meta heuristic river flow forecasting models nowadays with recent advances in computer technologies new time series forecasting methods including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso elastic net deep learning etc become feasible alternatives for river flow forecasting lasso being a novel way for estimation in linear models was proven to be able to minimize the residual sum of squares of errors when the summation of absolute value of their coefficients was smaller than a threshold value tibshirani 2011 its ability was also demonstrated for applications in different statistical models such as tree based or generalized regression models the elastic net is recognized as a novel method for regularization as well as variable selection ogutu et al 2012 by employing both hypothetical and real data it was shown that elastic net outperformed lasso with a similar sparsity moreover elastic net initiated a grouping effect for predictor correlation and was demonstrated to have advantages particularly if the predictors much outnumbered observations deep learning being a rebranding of artificial neural network in recent years has effected revolutionary strides in its ability to tackle problems that have been resisting artificial intelligence for a long period of time lecun et al 2015 whilst earlier generation ann extracts feature from data strongly correlated with dependent variables deep learning undertakes it automatically via multiple levels of abstraction the recent advances in computing power particularly the availability of graphics processing units together with this emerging technique render it possible to train an artificial neural network with a large number of hidden layers the following are some cases in which these novel techniques are starting to get attention by researchers for applications in hydrology and or weather forecasting jeon et al 2016 employed the generalized extreme value fused lasso penalty function to detect the change point of non stationary annual maximum precipitations in south korea shahbazi et al 2018 developed a regression imputation framework with a two layer structure coupling neuro fuzzy networks and elastic net for filling missing records and air pollution forecasting in tehran fang et al 2017 utilized a time series deep learning neural network to create a system that predicted the soil moisture active passive level 3 moisture product with atmospheric forcing model simulated moisture and static physiographic attributes as inputs considering the notably high performance of the proposed enhanced elm model and the growing aspirations of deep learning algorithms to be used for real prediction and classification purposes in today s data analytics era a future study applying the eelm model that aims to design a recurrent hidden layer elm model following deep learning principles is a promising step forward to advance the findings of this study in such a deep learning model which was beyond the scope of this research researchers could employ a convolutional neural network cnn ertugrul 2016 kim et al 2017 in such a model the principles of elm could still be retained to reduce the computational burden of multiple hidden layer networks however one possibility is also to use a stacked enhanced elm architecture within a cnn framework with backpropagation algorithm to deduce targets of hidden layers to learn network weights while maintaining good performance levels e g kim et al 2017 5 conclusions and future research direction the primary motivation of conducting the current research is to investigate the applicability and assess the capability of the enhanced version of the elm model tuned with the cod approach used in a problem of forecasting one step ahead daily river flow in a tropical environment kelantan river malaysia the modeling efficiency of the proposed eelm model is verified in respect to the classical version of the elm and the svr model in addition the paper demonstrates a timely and a detailed survey of the employment of the extreme learning machine approach and its well established version in the field of water resources engineering a review of such works is necessary to provide young hydrologists a set milestone for the new era of the soft computing and research direction in water resources engineering and in particular in solving the non linearity and non stationarity issues in hydrological modeling the latter of course can be achieved by a data decomposition technique such as the cod method applied in the present study furthermore this study aims to shed some light on future directions of the elm model for its development and implementation as a real time forecasting tool for practitioners in the field of hydrology the major findings of the inspected approaches and their applications are abridged in the following form i in general the eelm model is seen to exhibit itself as a very optimistic predictive model that can be utilized as a viable alternative to the state of the art models for river flow forecasting and particularly in the hydrological region of a tropical environment ii in the testing period 2009 2014 the eelm based predictive model reveals a great potential to improve the level of accuracy of the elm and svr models in quantitative terms the absolute error values i e rmse and mae are reduced significantly by about 11 61 22 53 and 8 26 8 72 respectively when the eelm model is evaluated compared to the elm and svr models iii the proposed eelm model is likely to be considered as a very reliable forecasting tool for the inspected tropical environment yet the behavior of eelm model demonstrates a noticeable challenge in forecasting high river flow patterns due to the high fluctuations and stochasticity of the model input datasets it is concluded that the space for further effort to be accomplished within the current scope of research is still an ongoing endeavor based on accomplished findings and extensive state of the art future research trends can be undertaking in the following propositions i the efficiency of a single hidden layer elm model lies on random initialization of the internal network weight during the learning process but this framework might be a limitation from a soft computing prospective as the single hidden layer can affect the network learning performance and lead to ineffective predictions the potential of thus extending elm into a deep learning neural network model where recurrent hidden layers are positioned in the feature space is an area to be explored for a better internal weight determination for instance ertugrul 2016 designed a recurrent elm based approach to forecast electricity load more accurately and fast learning process while a restricted boltzmann approach was applied hinton et al 2006 to yield effective results on this aspect on the other hand the harmony search approach can also be used seen to exhibit an excellent optimization of the elm geem et al 2001 for the neurons and weight configurations deep learning based elms are largely unnoticed in hydrological sciences but due to their rapid training and testing times and high accuracy they are worth investigating in future research work further an integration of elm model with nature inspired algorithms is highly emphasized to be explored such as particle swarm optimization salp swarm algorithm and others mirjalili et al 2017 ii in future research that applies elm for hydrological forecasting where the memory of hydrological features are prominent an advanced variant of the deep learning process constructed with the gradient based long short term memory network lstm with recurrent or convolutional layers hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is a promising predictive tool the premise of applying lstm based recurrent elm where lstm can learn to bridge minimal time lags in discrete steps to enforce constant error flow through error carousels and allow the multiplicative gate units to learn to open close access to the constant error flow can lead to promising results since such a model can implement time series lagged behavior of input data hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 sak et al 2014 tian and pan 2015 moreover lstm based elm can also be implemented to search for features that are local in space and time and its computational complexity is generally low so that it can lead to extensive feature extraction with a low latency output of the hydrological variable iii it has been reported by prof keith beven one of the famous scientist in hydrology in his advice for young hydrologist beven 2016 that the hydrological science is facing a hazard in its development owing to the limited resources and thus the use of soft computing models is much inexpensive rather that the experimentation investigations that are costly and necessitated for an expensive equipment s hence engineering modelers must take the advantage to build an expert systems that can contribute to real society problems solving such as flooding hurricane etc iv it is worth to report that the efficiency of the elm model should be justified not only through its reliability in term of the numerical accuracy but rather on the practical implementation for the water resources engineering and most importantly knowledge based expert system for instance the typical modeling based on physical based model exhibited excellent and useful methodologies in the field of atmospheric engineering hence the enclosure of the elm modeling potential into the existing decision making outline is still challenging to be considered this is for sure with the well though out of the system physics and information availability v throughout the extensive review there was a significant factor absent from the modeling which is the humans activity impact it should be noted that human activities influence the behavior of the catchment basin with multiple criteria and thus hydrologist must not neglect this constructive factor that certainly can manipulate the modeling results vi correlated variables contribute remarkably for the prediction accuracy as they provide an informative attribute to the targeted output for instance more weather and hydrological information variables such as rainfall evaporation humidity temperature etc for modeling river flow can enrich the modeling learning process and hence more researches are required to be devoted on this prospect vii with regard to the modeling process effectiveness hydrology and climate variables are usually associated with missing data and especially in developing countries where less watershed management and sustainability allocated hence exploring a reliable methods or mathematical procedures is highly recommended to be obtained where those missing data are vastly influencing the modeling performance on the other hand the methods for assessing the prediction process should be reconsidered as for instance leave k out method applied in the literature for modeling validation however as clearly reported by the extensive review research conducted by solomatine and ostfeld 2008 the limitation of using this approach is the data will not always be contiguous so that for example it would not be possible to visualize a hydrograph when the model is fed with the test set since different training and testing sets would be used there are several water resources engineering processes that have not been investigated using the application of elm models or its more advanced versions such as deep learning based or lstm based elm model

given the future projection of more frequent occurrence of severe droughts qiu 2010 wang et al 2014 more efforts are needed in monitoring groundwater resources in this region for mitigating potential water crisis conventionally ground based methods e g boreholes or observation wells numerical modelling are applied in southwest china to monitor groundwater dynamics for instance a total of 1247 wells were drilled in guizhou during the drought period of 2007 2011 to provide potable water of 0 21 km3 yr 1 2 mm yr enough for nearly 1 78 million people to drink luo et al 2012 an improved distributed hydrology soil vegetation model was developed and applied to a small karst basin in guizhou by integrating the routings of porous darcy flow fissure flow and underground channel flow zhang et al 2011 providing valuable information for understanding groundwater storage dynamics and its interaction with surface water storage in the karst areas of southwest china however these previous studies were mainly focused on the small scales although the observational wells were installed at several stations only 10 of the southwest china area have been surveyed for the exploitation of groundwater resources qiu 2010 in contrast to the smaller scales monitoring large scale groundwater storage dynamics can be achieved by using the terrestrial water storage tws data from the twin satellite gravity recovery and climate experiment grace launched in march 2002 the grace tws data contain the combined signals from the variations of surface water storage sws soil moisture storage sms groundwater storage gws and snow water equivalent wahr et al 1998 pan et al 2017 with the ancillary data on sws and sms gws can be isolated from grace tws data previous grace studies conducted in the southwest china regions were mainly focused on the general characteristics of tws li and shen 2010 li et al 2013 liu et al 2012 liu and miao 2011 wang et al 2012 wei et al 2013 or the impacts of climatic extremes on tws variability chao et al 2016 long et al 2014 luo et al 2016 tang et al 2014 sun et al 2014 long et al 2014 used 2003 2012 grace data to re construct 1979 2012 terrestrial water storage anomalies in a karstic region of southwest china and highlighted the severe impacts of more frequent and intensifying droughts and floods on the karst water resources during recent three decades tang et al 2014 estimated tws changes under the extreme 2009 2012 drought in southwest china and analysed the connections between regional tws precipitation and the el niño southern oscillation enso a non seasonal water storage deficit approach was proposed by chao et al 2016 to characterize the features of droughts occurred in southwest china luo et al 2016 demonstrated the capability of grace to detect water storage changes in large man made reservoirs although these previous studies in southwest china showed the overall capability of grace in monitoring tws variability during extreme droughts over the karst landscapes few of them have evaluated large scale gws variations in the highly heterogeneous environment of karst hydrogeology mainly due to the lack of observed water storage data despite the fact that grace data were widely used in inferring gws variations globally castle et al 2014 feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 rodell et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 werth et al 2017 yeh et al 2006 most of previous studies were focused on the mixed aquifer types rather than the karstic aquifers the focus of this study is on the gws variations in the karst regions of southwest china located in the eastern part of southwest china fig 1 nearly 50 of the eastern guizhou and guangxi provinces are covered by the karst landscape i e the highly karstic region hkr 412 900 km2 in contrast to 28 of the karst regions in the western yunnan province i e the low karstic region lkr 390 000 km2 chinese academy of geological sciences cags 1979 wang et al 2007 hkr has higher permeability than lkr owing to its more developed epi karst zones legrand and stringfield 1973 zhang et al 2011 han 2015 according to chen et al 2012 the hydraulic conductivity of the high permeability epikarst aquifer is of the order 10 3 m s while that in the low permeability aquifer is about 10 5 m s hkr has larger annual precipitation 1326 mm yr than lkr 1094 mm yr under the heterogeneous hydrogeology and non uniform hydro climatic conditions it is of interest to explore the potential of grace tws data to detect gws variations and distinguish their differences between hkr and lkr specifically we attempt to answer the following science questions in this study 1 what are the individual contributions of gws sms sws to the total tws variability in hkr and lkr 2 what is the relation between water storage components and precipitation in the two regions 3 how large are the gws losses and the recoverability during recent extreme droughts occurred in the two regions 2 data 2 1 grace tws data the level 2 monthly grace spherical harmonic solutions are used to retrieve tws anomalies from 2003 to 2013 due to the errors in any single grace solution long et al 2017 sakumura et al 2014 we use three grace solutions in this study including the data of jpl jet propulsion laboratory rl05 1 csr centre for space research the university of texas rl05 and gfz geoforschungszentrum potsdam rl05a the spherical harmonic solutions are post processed by 1 adding the c10 c11 and s11 terms not included in grace products which represent the geo center variations using the data accessible from https grace jpl nasa gov swenson et al 2008 and replacing c20 terms by using the satellite laser ranging slr estimates cheng and tapley 2004 2 depressing the longitudinal stripes using the p3m10 de correlation method chambers 2006 chen et al 2007 swenson and wahr 2006 and 3 filtering with the 200 km and 500 km gaussian smoothers respectively jekeli 1981 wahr et al 1998 the cubic spline interpolation method is applied to fill eight missing months of the grace data jun 2003 jan and jun 2011 may and oct 2012 mar aug and sept 2013 2 2 model simulated sms and sws data in order to estimate gws model simulated sms and sws data from the watergap global hydrology model wghm version 2 1f6 döll et al 2003 güntner et al 2007 are used for the disaggregation of tws hereafter as smswghm and swswghm respectively the wghm has the following advantages over the widely used gldas 1 global land data assimilation system models rodell et al 2004 1 it simulates sws and gws both of which were not simulated in all gldas 1 models 2 it takes into account of human induced water consumptions döll et al 2003 3 its simulation has been calibrated against streamflow observations hunger and döll 2008 the smswghm is validated against the average of observed sms smsobs from 18 stations in southwest china more information given in section s1 of the supplementary materials overall agreement in timing can be observed between smswghm and smsobs with r 0 5 in the following the smswghm data will be used in the estimation of gws from grace tws data due to the insufficient spatial coverage and substantial amounts of months in certain years with missing data at several stations of the smsobs data see section s1 of the supplementary materials for more details 2 3 reservoir water storage data although wghm indeed simulates sws it does not represent the largest reservoir in southwest china i e the longtan reservoir ltr with the storage capacity of 16 2 km3 figs 1 and 2 a the periodic impoundment and regulation of ltr can cause non negligible gravity changes potentially detectable by grace luo et al 2016 wang et al 2011 zhan and wang 2011 the observed reservoir water level data of ltr available in 2006 2013 used by yan et al 2015 and luo et al 2016 are used in this study to estimate observed monthly sws based on the fitted exponential relation between observed water level data and reservoir storage data provided by the water regime annual report of the pearl river mwr 2008 see fig 2b reservoir storage from jan 2003 to aug 2006 is assumed to be zero since ltr started to impound water in sept 2006 the impounded water in ltr reached the dead water level of 330 m 4 8 km3 first in jun 2007 and then reached the normal water level of 375 m 16 2 km3 in nov 2008 as only the water stored between the dead and normal water levels can be utilized the maximum water storage to be released from ltr is 11 4 km3 i e 16 2 minus 4 8 the forward modelling approach longuevergne et al 2013 is conducted to quantify leakage errors resulting from ltr storage ltrs with the purposes to understand the influences of the spherical harmonic expansion truncation and filtering on the magnitude and spatial pattern of grace tws data and the removal of high frequency noises contained in grace solutions to achieve a synthetic forward modelling is first performed by assuming a 1 km3 point mass distributed over the 0 125 degree grid point where ltr is located see fig 2a the derived spatial pattern of forward modelled ltrs ltrsf is shown in fig 2c on a regional average basis the 1 km3 water impoundment in ltr results in a gain of 0 63 km3 or equivalently 1 53 mm and 0 12 km3 or 0 32 mm of water storages in hkr and lkr respectively second a forward modelling is performed using the actual reservoir storage data with both 200 km and 500 km gaussian filters as seen fig 2d ltrsf in hkr shows a reduced amplitude after filtering and the attenuation is more significant when using the 500 km gaussian filter than using the 200 km filter the influence of filtering on the leakage signals of ltrsf into the lkr region is insignificant due to its longer distance from the reservoir 2 4 in situ groundwater level observations the validation of gwsgrace against the gws estimates from the in situ groundwater level observations gwsobs is conducted only in hkr due to data availability the observed groundwater level data at 22 wells 13 in guizhou and 9 in guangxi are obtained from the groundwater level yearbook compiled and published by the china institute of geo environment monitoring cigem 2005 2012 among 22 wells 18 are located at the carbonate karstic aquifers 3 at the unconsolidated porous aquifers and 1 at the consolidated fracture aquifer fig 1 the long term mean and the coefficient of variation of groundwater depth is 11 m and 1 42 in guizhou and 7 m and 0 56 in guangxi fig 3 the gwsobs anomalies are estimated by multiplying groundwater level anomalies with the specific yield of the unconfined aquifers or the storage coefficient of the confined aquifers yeh et al 2006 for all the unconfined carbonate karstic aquifers 17 wells the specific yield is estimated as the average 0 08 between the less karstic aquifers 0 01 and the highly karstic aquifers 0 15 http www chinabaike com china geological survey cgs 2012 chen and zhang 1999 the specific yield of the unconfined unconsolidated porous aquifers is estimated to be 0 24 as suggested by cgs 2012 the specific yield of the semi confined consolidated fracture aquifers is estimated to be 0 225 following johnson 1967 a value of 0 001 zheng et al 2014 is estimated as the elastic storage coefficient for all the confined aquifers in this study we follow previous studies e g feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 castle et al 2014 to use the simple arithmetic average of all available well data as the regional average 2 5 precipitation data and the palmer drought severity index pdsi the 0 5 degree gridded monthly precipitation dataset in china from 2003 to 2013 provided by the china meteorological administration cma is used here to analyse the response of gws to climate variability this gridded precipitation dataset was developed by using the thin plate spline interpolation based on the ground observation data of precipitation from 2472 meteorological stations in china http data cma cn the pdsi data provided by dai 2011 dai et al 2004 are used as an indicator of meteorological droughts in this study the pdsi incorporating precipitation temperature and soil parameters information hayes 2000 defines an extreme drought as pdsi 3 dai 2011 long et al 2013 although the spatial resolution of pdsi data is coarse 2 5 the spatial scale of this study 400 000 km2 is large enough to make the different drought situations between hkr and lkr distinguishable as seen from fig 4 a the pdsi well captures two unprecedented extreme droughts occurred in southwest china one from the autumn of 2009 to the spring of 2010 and another from the late summer of 2011 to the summer of 2012 mwr 2009 2012 wang et al 2014 2015 the hkr experienced more severe extreme droughts lasting nearly for the entire 2009 2011 whereas the lkr experienced the same two droughts but with a recovery between them during 2010 2011 although the drought was alleviated in 2012 in hkr the drought in lkr was instead intensified fig 4b plots the leakage corrected tws in two regions although both extreme droughts have left clear signatures on tws its temporal variations differ significantly from that of pdsi which is reasonable since pdsi accounts for meteorological factors and sms information only within the surface layers dai et al 2004 while tws integrates the variations all storage components including gws differences in the timing and amplitude of the peaks and troughs of tws can be observed as influenced by climatic conditions and the heterogeneous distribution of karst hydrogeology over southwest china 3 methods 3 1 estimation of gws from grace tws following the global unconstrained forward modelling approach chen et al 2014 2015 yan et al 2006 gws anomalies are estimated based on spherical harmonic coefficients in order to isolate gws from tws the gridded sms and sws data are expanded into the spherical harmonic coefficients truncated at the degree and order of 60 and filtered with the 200 km and 500 km gaussian smoothers respectively no de correlation is needed chen et al 2014 since snow storage and canopy water storage are negligible in southwest china the disaggregation of gws from grace tws can be expressed as 1 gws f tws f sws wghm f sms wghm f ltrs f where twsf denotes the original twsgrace without leakage correction swswghm f smswghm f and ltrsf denote the filtered sws sms and ltrs components and gwsf is the filtered gwsgrace without leakage correction a signal correction is required to reduce leakage errors and recover true signals the iterative global unconstrained forward modelling method is more advanced than using the scaling factor or multiplicative factor methods landerer and swenson 2012 long et al 2015 which are known to be highly sensitive to the required a priori information which is usually taken from model simulations chen et al 2014 2015 an iterative forward modelling is performed here for gwsf in each month during 2003 2013 the iteration is terminated at 25 and 50 iterations for the 200 km and 500 km gaussian filters respectively see section s3 of the supplementary material for details fig 5 compares the 2006 2012 mean seasonal cycles of gwsgrace and gwsobs in hkr and lkr with and without the iterative forward modelling as seen for all three grace products with both 200 km and 500 km gaussian filter the seasonal amplitude of gwsgrace is amplified and the timing is modified after the iterative forward modelling in both hkr fig 5a c and lkr fig 5d f the processing leads to an improved agreement with gwsobs in hkr fig 5a c indicating the effectiveness of the iterative forward modelling to recover the attenuated signals caused by the processes of spherical harmonic expansion truncation and filtering the original sms sws including ltrs and the leakage corrected gws are summed up to obtain the leakage corrected total tws 3 2 components contribution ratio in the following the component contribution ratio ccr kim et al 2009 is used to quantify the mean percentage contribution of individual water storage component to the temporal variability of the total tws which is defined as the ratio of the mean absolute deviation mad of a storage component to the total tws variability tv as follows 1 ccr s mad s tv where mad s 1 n t n s t s t v s storages mad s a n d s denotes the individual storage components e g gws sms and sws 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of gwsgrace with gwsobs the 2003 2013 monthly gwsgrace and gwsobs in hkr are compared in fig 6 a a general agreement between the 2006 2012 monthly gwsgrace and gwsobs can be seen r 0 71 rmse 41 6 mm fig 6b compares the 2006 2012 mean seasonal cycle between gwsgrace and gwsobs in hkr where the consistency in terms of both timing and amplitude can be observed the similar comparisons of monthly time series and mean seasonal cycle of gws in lkr are plotted in fig 6c and 6d respectively although no in situ groundwater level data are available for validation in lkr 390 000 km2 the gwsgrace can be reliable considering that 1 the effectiveness of the iterative forward modelling approach as demonstrated above in hkr with the similar spatial scale 412 900 km2 and also in northwest india chen et al 2014 long et al 2016 and antarctica chen et al 2015 in previous studies 2 the reliability of the modelled sms and sws data for the isolation of gws have been examined see section s1 and s2 of the supplementary material and 3 the leakage errors in the grace derived gws anomalies in lkr are smaller than that in hkr see discussion below the boxplots in fig 6b and d display the quartiles of the six leakage corrected gwsgrace estimates the solid green and red lines plotted in fig 5a c and d f correspondingly as seen from fig 6d or 5d f the seasonal cycles of gwsgrace anomalies in lkr from different post processing specification exhibit better consistency among each other than those in hkr fig 6b or 5a c indicating less leakage errors in gwsgrace in lkr it is worth noting that the signal leakage in grace data is related to the spatial mass distribution long et al 2016 which further indicate the heterogeneity of the aquifer systems in lkr 28 of karst most areas are covered by non karst landscapes with generally lower permeability and hydraulic conductivity i e lower heterogeneity yuan 1985 chen et al 2012 than karst landscapes and the eastern part of lkr is developed with homogeneous deep confined karst aquifers cgs 2006 however the hkr 50 of karst is underlain by the unconfined karst aquifers with a high permeability and hydraulic conductivity cgs 2012 yuan 1985 chen et al 2012 hence the regional gws variability in lkr may contain a lower degree of heterogeneity and can result in less leakage errors of grace data see section 5 for the error estimation fig 6 also compares gwswghm to both gwsgrace and gwsobs the result indicates that gwswghm is consistent with gwsobs in timing r 0 78 in hkr during 2005 2012 fig 6a a fair agreement in timing can also be noted between gwsgrace and gwswghm in both hkr r 0 70 and lkr r 0 81 however the seasonal amplitudes fig 6b and d and interannual variability see section 4 4 for details of gwswghm are significantly underestimated in both hkr and lkr which can be attributed mainly to the absence of the representation of the karst features of subsurface hydrogeology in wghm hartmann et al 2015 4 2 contribution of storage components to tws variability fig 7 plots the 2003 2013 monthly time series fig 7a b and mean seasonal cycle fig 7c d of tws and its individual storage components gws sms and sws including ltrs for hkr and lkr respectively the contribution of each water storage component to tws i e ccrs is also given in fig 7a b and table 1 on average gws contributes to 60 and 58 of the total tws variability in hkr and lkr respectively sms and sws ltrs in hkr contribute respectively to 18 and 22 14 of tws variability in hkr and 28 and 14 of that in lkr gws plays a more significant role in tws variability than sws and sms in both hkr and lkr consistent with the large storage capacity of the well developed subsurface karst systems with fractures and conduits than the small storage capacity of the leaky epikarst zones with thin soil layers liu et al 2014 yuan 1985 sms has a larger contribution 28 to tws in lkr fig 7a b and table 1 due to its thicker unsaturated zone to store more water than the more leaky epi karst zones in hkr to retain less water moreover sws in hkr is dominated by ltrs indicating significant regulation of reservoirs unlike hkr sws in lkr is dominated by the lake storage less influenced by climate and human activities lehner and döll 2004 water resources department wrd 2009 2011 see section s2 of the supplementary information on the lake storage in lkr the differences among the ccrs calculated based on various processed grace tws time series i e with or without leakage correction different grace products different filters used are smaller in sms and sws 4 than in gws 10 table 1 the lowest ccrs of gws contribution to tws variability is 57 in both hkr and lkr when using the csr data with a 500 km gaussian filter the largest ccrs of gws is 67 in hkr and 62 in lkr when using the gfz data with a 200 km filter table 2 as seen from table 1 the range of ccrs of gws 57 67 is approximately the same for both hkr and lkr indicating similar seasonal amplitude and pattern of gws anomalies between two regions the major difference in gws anomalies between hkr and lkr lies in timing as shown in fig 7c d gws in hkr has an earlier seasonal trough in feb and peak in jul than that in lkr trough in may and peak in oct this is related to the spatial variability of precipitation and different response of aquifers to precipitation recharge as will be discussed further below in sections 4 3 and 4 4 4 3 correlation among water storage components and precipitation the cross correlation analysis ni et al 2018 oppenheim et al 1989 is used to investigate the time lags between water storage anomaly and precipitation table 2 summarizes the cross correlation coefficients r at the lags from zero to 6 months between the 2006 2012 monthly precipitation and individual storage component from which the time lag with the highest r can be identified both gws gwsgrace and gwsobs in hkr lag behind precipitation for one month r 0 72 and 0 76 respectively however gws in lkr has a weak correlation with precipitation r 0 20 at lag zero and with a lag behind precipitation by 2 months r 0 72 table 2 the lag of gws behind precipitation in hkr is 1 2 months shorter than the lag in lkr table 2 and fig 7c d due to the higher recharge rate caused by the more permeable epi karst zones and high hydraulic gradient under the mountainous topography in hkr legrand and stringfield 1973 conversely the aquifers in lkr has lower recharge rates due to the thicker unsaturated zone and considerably less permeable non karstic aquifers mainly in the central western yunnan relative to hkr a high correlation 0 80 r 0 90 between the modelled sms also sws and precipitation is found in both hkr and lkr table 2 an even larger cross correlation 0 85 r 0 95 can be noted when sms and sws lag one month behind precipitation table 2 these high correlations indicate direct control of precipitation on the temporal variability of sms and sws unlike the modelled sws which mainly reflects natural variability the ltrs in hkr shows a lag of about 3 5 months behind precipitation with the highest r 0 46 at the 4 month lag owing to strong human regulation on reservoir storage table 2 table 3 summarizes the correlation matrix between the 2006 2012 monthly grace total water storage anomaly twsgrace and its individual storage components gws sms and sws including ltrs in the highly hkr and low lkr karstic regions from this table the higher correlation between gwsgrace gwsobs and sms is found in hkr with r 0 68 0 55 than that in lkr r 0 48 between gwsgrace and sms also the correlation between gwsgrace gwsobs and sws is more significant in hkr with r 0 73 0 70 than lkr with r 0 56 table 3 the higher correlations between gws and sms also sws in hkr than lkr implies a higher degree of surface water groundwater interaction over the more karstic hydrogeology conditions 4 4 role of water storage components during the 2009 2012 extreme drought period annual water storage changes can be estimated as the difference in water storage anomalies between the decembers in two consecutive years i e storage anomalies in this december minus that in last december as the storage change of this year table 4 summarizes annual changes of grace tws and its components gws sms and sws including ltrs during the 2009 2012 extreme drought period from which significant gws losses can be noted in both 2009 and 2011 for both regions the estimated gwsgrace loss in hkr in 2009 is 74 3 mm yr 66 of total tws loss comparable to the estimated gwsobs loss of 72 5 mm yr table 4 the estimated gwsgrace loss in lkr in 2009 is 42 7 mm yr 62 of total tws loss the gwsgrace losses in 2009 and 2011 table 4 indicate that groundwater discharge exceeds groundwater recharge during the extreme drought years the major source of groundwater recharge over southwest china is diffuse recharge from precipitation whereas the source of groundwater discharge is mainly from river baseflow through subsurface channels groundwater pumping for human consumption and groundwater evapotranspiration i e the capillary rise to the phreatic zone cui et al 1985 during the extreme drought periods when most rivers run dry chen et al 2013 the karstic aquifers can drain more rapidly through the subsurface channels without receiving much replenishment subsequently the subsurface channels capture the water stored in the surrounding fractural and porous aquifers due to the increased hydraulic gradient and eventually produce substantial discharge hartmann et al 2017 goldscheider and drew 2007 han 2015 human consumption contributes little to total groundwater discharge since groundwater resources are still underexploited in southwest china 4 0 km3 yr 12 of the potentially exploitable amounts xia et al 2016 groundwater evapotranspiration is negligible due to its small magnitude chen and shu 2006 yeh and famiglietti 2009 therefore significant gws losses during the droughts in southwest china should be mainly due to natural discharge through river baseflow and subsurface channels it is worth noting that a 30 mm yr larger gws loss as detected by grace was experienced in 2009 in hkr than in lkr table 4 despite the less severe drought occurred in hkr fig 4a which is reasonable given that hkr has more underground channels than lkr cui et al 1985 xia et al 2016 according to the statistics given by pei et al 2008 the number of underground channels in guangxi guizhou and yunnan is 374 219 and 96 respectively the more developed underground river system is a result of more intensive erosion which ultimately results in a higher degree of heterogeneity therefore hkr has higher subsurface drainage capability and potentially experiences larger gws losses during the extreme droughts unlike 2009 annual gwsgrace loss in 2011 is estimated to be larger in lkr 78 5 mm yr 82 of total tws loss than that in hkr 28 9 mm yr 54 of total tws loss annual gwsgrace loss in 2011 in hkr was significantly underestimated when comparing to gwsobs loss 60 3 mm yr table 4 aquifers in southwest china has a clear rebound in 2010 and 2012 following the 2009 and 2011 extreme droughts table 4 gwsgrace gwsobs has a larger increase of 98 9 64 7 mm yr in 2010 in hkr accounting for 82 of total tws recovery compared to 16 3 mm yr in lkr 42 of tws recovery there are two major reasons for such a difference first due to the atmospheric circulation influenced by sea surface temperature and complex topography qin et al 2015 wang et al 2015 hkr receives more precipitation table 4 with the seasonal peak one month earlier in june fig 7c than lkr peak in july fig 7d second as discussed in section 4 3 the karstic aquifers in hkr respond more rapidly to precipitation owing to its higher permeability than that in lkr consequently the earlier and heavier precipitation combined with the more efficient infiltration lead to a significant recovery of gws after the extreme drought legrand and stringfield 1973 zhang et al 2011 however the larger gwsgrace recovery in hkr was not observed in 2012 the estimated gwsgrace in 2012 was 42 6 mm yr 50 of tws recovery less than that in lkr 69 6 mm yr 100 of tws recovery table 4 gwsgrace recovery in 2012 in lkr may be overestimated considering the aggravated severe drought since the summer of 2011 with the decreasing pdsi as shown in fig 4a with the precipitation deficit in both 2011 and 2012 table 4 in contrast to the alleviated drought in hkr with the increasing pdsi as shown in fig 4a sms has a smaller interannual variability 23 mm yr during 2009 2012 table 4 than gws 100 mm yr in both hkr and lkr annual sms loss in 2009 and recovery in 2010 also the contribution to tws loss in lkr are larger than that in hkr due to the higher storage capacity of the thicker unsaturated zones in lkr table 4 sws has an even smaller interannual variability 6 mm yr in both hkr and lkr during 2009 2012 table 4 it should be noted that the annual ltrs losses in hkr 18 2 mm yr in 2009 and 16 6 mm yr in 2011 see table 4 were not equivalent to actual release of reservoir storage in drought table 4 the ltrs loss during the extreme drought from the autumn of 2009 to the spring of 2010 is 14 5 mm 6 0 km3 53 the available capacity of 11 4 km3 and no apparent change of ltrs occurred during the 2011 summer drought figs 2d or 7a the above results indicate that the reservoir storage plays a limited role in mitigating drought impacts in hkr particularly if droughts occur in the low storage stage in summer figs 2d or 7a when reservoirs are incapable to release water for the use of downstream areas 5 uncertainty analysis the monthly errors uncertainty in the grace measurements model simulated sms sws and ltrs data and the post processing specifications are quantified in this sub section the grace measurement error is estimated from the root mean square of the residual mass changes over the pacific ocean at the same latitude 20 5 29 5 n as southwest china chen et al 2009 the final grace measurement error is the standard deviation of the six error estimates from the three grace data products csr gfz and jpl with the two gaussian filters 200 and 500 km independently the grace measurement error for hkr and lkr is assigned to be equal due to the same latitude it should be noted that the grace measurement error is affected by the area and shape of region of interest longuevergne et al 2010 for the lkr and hkr their areas are very close to each other but their shape is quite different lkr has a more irregular shape which may incur higher uncertainties in grace measurements therefore the grace measurement error in lkr can be underestimated in this study the uncertainty in modelled sms and sws is difficult to estimate due to the lack of sufficient in situ observations and hence assumed to be 30 in both hkr and lkr the uncertainty for the ltrs in hkr induced by curve fitting is estimated to be 5 the post processing error is represented by the standard deviation of the six leakage corrected monthly gws anomalies finally by assuming the independence among the error components the uncertainty in gwsgrace is estimated by error propagation i e calculating the root square of sum of the square errors the estimated error of each component is shown in table 5 post processing error is the largest among the error components with 37 4 mm mo for hkr and 26 2 mm mo for lkr followed by the error in grace measurement 18 2 mm mo sms 7 5 mm mo and sws 4 0 mm mo table 5 the final monthly error the root mean square of error series of gwsgrace is estimated to be 41 9 mm mo for hkr and 32 9 mm mo for lkr table 5 the specification of specific yield sy values is critical for estimating gwsobs but challenging according to the statistics of pumping test for 33 wells in guangxi the karst ratio as well as the sy value changes at different depths for instance the sy changes slightly within 0 100 m with the value ranging from 0 05 to 0 074 however the sy value decreased significantly within 100 150 m with an average value of 0 0016 chen and zhang 1999 the study by chen and zhang 1999 well reflect the high heterogeneity of karst aquifers at three dimensions i e both horizontally and vertically ideally we should identify appropriate sy for each individual well based on pumping test data rodell et al 2007 considering the the high heterogeneity of karst aquifers but this is difficult to achieve due to the lack of data from pumping tests sun et al 2010 in this study a single sy is assigned to all the karstic wells which could incur uncertainties but we use different sy for different aquifer types which can be more reliable than using a constant sy for all wells as commonly adopted in previous studies e g chen et al 2016 rodell et al 2007 2009 strassberg et al 2007 this study assumes 40 uncertainty of s y chen et al 2016 leblanc et al 2009 hence the error of gwsobs in hkr is 21 7 mm mo during 2006 2012 table 5 the sensitivity of the post processing specification on the determination of time lag is small the six gws anomaly estimates i e three grace solutions with two gaussian filters in hkr and lkr respectively represent a time lag of one month and two month with the lagged correlation ranging from 0 61 to 0 72 table 2 moreover due to the failure in simulating gws in southwest china see section 3 1 wghm does not reveal the different gws variability in response to precipitation between hkr and lkr as indicated by grace and groundwater level data and instead shows the same time lag of two months table 2 the error of annual water storage change see table 4 is estimated as the mean square root of the sum of the square errors in december of two consecutive years the error in annual gws change is considerably large with an average of 45 mm in hkr and 35 mm in lkr comparing to the estimated annual gws changes within 100 mm during 2004 2013 table 4 the large uncertainty in the annual gws change is mainly attributed to the post processing for leakage correction of different grace products with the standard deviation up to 43 mm table s1 moreover the annual gws change simulated by wghm are significantly underestimated showing weaker variability within 22 mm than gwsgrace 100 mm table 4 6 conclusions this study estimates 2003 2013 monthly groundwater storage gws anomalies in the highly karstic region hkr 50 of karst areas and low karstic region lkr 28 of karst areas in the southwest china from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace terrestrial water storage tws data by using the ancillary data of surface water storage sws and soil moisture storage sms from the watergap global hydrology model wghm simulations the leakage errors in the estimated gws anomalies are corrected through the iterative forward modelling approach the key findings of this study are summarized in the following 1 the effectiveness of the iterative forward modelling approach is demonstrated by the satisfactory validation of the leakage corrected gws anomalies against that based on in situ gw level observations r 0 71 rmse 41 6 mm 2 the temporal variability of tws is dominated by gws 60 in both hkr and lkr sms contributes 18 28 to tws variability in hkr lkr while sws contributes 22 14 in hkr lkr the storage in the largest reservoir in southwest china the longtan reservoir contributes to 14 of the tws variability in hkr 3 gws anomalies in hkr show an approximately one month shorter lag to precipitation than that in lkr due to the higher permeability of the epi karst zones in hkr grace derived gws anomalies in hkr are better correlated with sws r 0 73 rmse 51 mm and sms r 0 68 rmse 47 mm anomalies than that in lkr sws r 0 56 rmse 50 mm and sms r 0 48 rmse 49 mm indicating the well connected system between the epi karst zones and subsurface aquifers in hkr 4 hkr experienced a larger gws loss 74 3 mm yr 66 of total tws loss in the extreme drought year of 2009 than lkr 42 7 mm yr 62 of total tws loss due to larger natural discharge through the well developed subsurface drainage system gws in hkr recovers faster than lkr from extreme droughts owing to the larger and earlier by approximately one month precipitation and quicker response of groundwater to precipitation 5 human regulation on reservoir storage plays a minor role in mitigating the impacts of extreme droughts in particular during the summer when reservoirs remain at the lowest water level 6 considering its still under exploitation status 4 km3 yr only 12 of the potentially exploitable amounts groundwater resources in southwest china are of high potential for future water resource management under drought conditions 7 post processing error i e error in leakage correction and different products of grace data is the largest among the error components with 37 4 mm mo for hkr and 26 2 mm mo for lkr indicating smaller leakage errors in grace estimated gws anomalies in lkr due to its less heterogeneous hydrogeology the sensitivity of the post processing specification of grace data on the contribution ratio of gws anomalies to total tws and its lag to precipitation is small in southwest china still it is difficult to accurately estimate annual gws changes by using grace data due to the uncertainty errors from both satellite measurements and ancillary data of soil moisture and surface water storage the pressing need of utilizing grace data to identify regional gws variability over the heterogeneous aquifers such as southwest china warrants the enhanced spatial resolution and sensor precision of grace data which are expected to be achieved by the future grace follow on missions elsaka et al 2014 last but not the least even the most sophisticated hydrologic models such as wghm are unable to simulate the seasonal amplitudes and annual variability of gws accurately in the karst areas of southwest china owing to that the hydrologic characteristics of the karst landscapes are not accounted for in wghm model parameterization hartmann et al 2015 as the karst landscape is one of the most important aquifer formation bakalowicz 2005 this study calls for the necessary representation of the specifics of karst hydrogeology in current global hydrology models this study further highlights the unique values of grace in interpreting regional gws variations considering the hydrogeology conditions hu et al 2017 hu and jiao 2015 and in the data

6767,the 2003 2013 monthly groundwater storage gws anomalies in the highly karstic region hkr and low karstic region lkr in the southwest china are estimated from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace terrestrial water storage tws data by using the ancillary data of surface water storage sws and soil moisture storage sms from the watergap model simulations the leakage errors in the estimated gws anomalies are corrected through using the iterative forward modelling approach the estimated gws anomalies compare well with in situ groundwater level observations with the correlation coefficient r 0 71 and the root mean square error rmse 42 mm for both hkr and lkr 60 of temporal variability of tws is contributed by gws variability while sms contributes to 18 hkr and 28 lkr and sws contributes to 22 hkr and 14 lkr of the tws variability due to the higher permeability of the epi karst zones and their better connection with the subsurface aquifers gws anomalies in hkr show larger correlations with sws r 0 73 rmse 51 mm and sms r 0 68 rmse 47 mm and a shorter lag to precipitation than that in lkr sws r 0 56 rmse 50 mm and sms r 0 48 rmse 49 mm during the extreme drought in 2009 gws loss in hkr lkr was 74 3 mm yr 42 7 mm yr accounting for 66 62 of total tws loss the severe gws loss was mainly due to larger discharges through the well developed subsurface drainage system rather than human depletion since groundwater resources are still under exploited in southwest china 4 km3 yr 12 of the potentially exploitable amounts a quicker recovery of gws from 2009 drought can be observed in hkr than lkr due to the larger and earlier approximately one month precipitation and infiltration and quicker response of groundwater to precipitation in hkr keywords grace karst groundwater storage loss and recovery forward modelling drought time lag 1 introduction karst is one of the most important aquifer formations worldwide bakalowicz 2005 karst develops only when the possibility of dissolving carbonate rock i e a solvent exists and there are groundwater flows determined by the hydraulic gradient bakalowicz 2005 as a precious freshwater resource for over one quarter of global population han 2015 parise and gunn 2007 the karst groundwater possesses high heterogeneity in terms of water yield and the anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity yuan 1985 and generally characterized by its quick response to precipitation owing to the high permeability of epi karst zones with sinkholes and bare rocks and the high discharge capability via baseflow legrand and stringfield 1973 the feature of the well developed and connected subsurface drainage systems with relatively high flow velocity make the karst landscape highly susceptible to extreme droughts due to more frequent surface water deficits and reduced groundwater resources guo et al 2015 among the global largest karst areas the southwest china region 802 900 km2 fig 1 encompassing the provinces of guizhou guangxi and yunnan has 40 karst area 316 000 km2 the soil depth in southwest china is in general thin 1m particularly over the karst regions liu et al 2014 which makes it susceptible to the impacts of floods and droughts despite abundant precipitation 1200 mm yr in the humid subtropical climate the southwest china region experienced 99 droughts including 54 extreme droughts during the period 1900 2012 guo et al 2015 over the last decade two unprecedented extreme droughts hit southwest china one from the autumn of 2009 to the spring of 2010 and another from the late summer of 2011 to the summer of 2012 leading to tremendous socio economic losses and multi million people seeking water for survival ministry of water resources mwr 2009 2012 wang et al 2014 2015 abundant but under exploited groundwater resources are available in southwest china lu 2006 the estimated exploitable groundwater resource is 33 3 km3 yr while that already exploited is only 4 0 km3 yr xia et al 2016 given the future projection of more frequent occurrence of severe droughts qiu 2010 wang et al 2014 more efforts are needed in monitoring groundwater resources in this region for mitigating potential water crisis conventionally ground based methods e g boreholes or observation wells numerical modelling are applied in southwest china to monitor groundwater dynamics for instance a total of 1247 wells were drilled in guizhou during the drought period of 2007 2011 to provide potable water of 0 21 km3 yr 1 2 mm yr enough for nearly 1 78 million people to drink luo et al 2012 an improved distributed hydrology soil vegetation model was developed and applied to a small karst basin in guizhou by integrating the routings of porous darcy flow fissure flow and underground channel flow zhang et al 2011 providing valuable information for understanding groundwater storage dynamics and its interaction with surface water storage in the karst areas of southwest china however these previous studies were mainly focused on the small scales although the observational wells were installed at several stations only 10 of the southwest china area have been surveyed for the exploitation of groundwater resources qiu 2010 in contrast to the smaller scales monitoring large scale groundwater storage dynamics can be achieved by using the terrestrial water storage tws data from the twin satellite gravity recovery and climate experiment grace launched in march 2002 the grace tws data contain the combined signals from the variations of surface water storage sws soil moisture storage sms groundwater storage gws and snow water equivalent wahr et al 1998 pan et al 2017 with the ancillary data on sws and sms gws can be isolated from grace tws data previous grace studies conducted in the southwest china regions were mainly focused on the general characteristics of tws li and shen 2010 li et al 2013 liu et al 2012 liu and miao 2011 wang et al 2012 wei et al 2013 or the impacts of climatic extremes on tws variability chao et al 2016 long et al 2014 luo et al 2016 tang et al 2014 sun et al 2014 long et al 2014 used 2003 2012 grace data to re construct 1979 2012 terrestrial water storage anomalies in a karstic region of southwest china and highlighted the severe impacts of more frequent and intensifying droughts and floods on the karst water resources during recent three decades tang et al 2014 estimated tws changes under the extreme 2009 2012 drought in southwest china and analysed the connections between regional tws precipitation and the el niño southern oscillation enso a non seasonal water storage deficit approach was proposed by chao et al 2016 to characterize the features of droughts occurred in southwest china luo et al 2016 demonstrated the capability of grace to detect water storage changes in large man made reservoirs although these previous studies in southwest china showed the overall capability of grace in monitoring tws variability during extreme droughts over the karst landscapes few of them have evaluated large scale gws variations in the highly heterogeneous environment of karst hydrogeology mainly due to the lack of observed water storage data despite the fact that grace data were widely used in inferring gws variations globally castle et al 2014 feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 rodell et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 werth et al 2017 yeh et al 2006 most of previous studies were focused on the mixed aquifer types rather than the karstic aquifers the focus of this study is on the gws variations in the karst regions of southwest china located in the eastern part of southwest china fig 1 nearly 50 of the eastern guizhou and guangxi provinces are covered by the karst landscape i e the highly karstic region hkr 412 900 km2 in contrast to 28 of the karst regions in the western yunnan province i e the low karstic region lkr 390 000 km2 chinese academy of geological sciences cags 1979 wang et al 2007 hkr has higher permeability than lkr owing to its more developed epi karst zones legrand and stringfield 1973 zhang et al 2011 han 2015 according to chen et al 2012 the hydraulic conductivity of the high permeability epikarst aquifer is of the order 10 3 m s while that in the low permeability aquifer is about 10 5 m s hkr has larger annual precipitation 1326 mm yr than lkr 1094 mm yr under the heterogeneous hydrogeology and non uniform hydro climatic conditions it is of interest to explore the potential of grace tws data to detect gws variations and distinguish their differences between hkr and lkr specifically we attempt to answer the following science questions in this study 1 what are the individual contributions of gws sms sws to the total tws variability in hkr and lkr 2 what is the relation between water storage components and precipitation in the two regions 3 how large are the gws losses and the recoverability during recent extreme droughts occurred in the two regions 2 data 2 1 grace tws data the level 2 monthly grace spherical harmonic solutions are used to retrieve tws anomalies from 2003 to 2013 due to the errors in any single grace solution long et al 2017 sakumura et al 2014 we use three grace solutions in this study including the data of jpl jet propulsion laboratory rl05 1 csr centre for space research the university of texas rl05 and gfz geoforschungszentrum potsdam rl05a the spherical harmonic solutions are post processed by 1 adding the c10 c11 and s11 terms not included in grace products which represent the geo center variations using the data accessible from https grace jpl nasa gov swenson et al 2008 and replacing c20 terms by using the satellite laser ranging slr estimates cheng and tapley 2004 2 depressing the longitudinal stripes using the p3m10 de correlation method chambers 2006 chen et al 2007 swenson and wahr 2006 and 3 filtering with the 200 km and 500 km gaussian smoothers respectively jekeli 1981 wahr et al 1998 the cubic spline interpolation method is applied to fill eight missing months of the grace data jun 2003 jan and jun 2011 may and oct 2012 mar aug and sept 2013 2 2 model simulated sms and sws data in order to estimate gws model simulated sms and sws data from the watergap global hydrology model wghm version 2 1f6 döll et al 2003 güntner et al 2007 are used for the disaggregation of tws hereafter as smswghm and swswghm respectively the wghm has the following advantages over the widely used gldas 1 global land data assimilation system models rodell et al 2004 1 it simulates sws and gws both of which were not simulated in all gldas 1 models 2 it takes into account of human induced water consumptions döll et al 2003 3 its simulation has been calibrated against streamflow observations hunger and döll 2008 the smswghm is validated against the average of observed sms smsobs from 18 stations in southwest china more information given in section s1 of the supplementary materials overall agreement in timing can be observed between smswghm and smsobs with r 0 5 in the following the smswghm data will be used in the estimation of gws from grace tws data due to the insufficient spatial coverage and substantial amounts of months in certain years with missing data at several stations of the smsobs data see section s1 of the supplementary materials for more details 2 3 reservoir water storage data although wghm indeed simulates sws it does not represent the largest reservoir in southwest china i e the longtan reservoir ltr with the storage capacity of 16 2 km3 figs 1 and 2 a the periodic impoundment and regulation of ltr can cause non negligible gravity changes potentially detectable by grace luo et al 2016 wang et al 2011 zhan and wang 2011 the observed reservoir water level data of ltr available in 2006 2013 used by yan et al 2015 and luo et al 2016 are used in this study to estimate observed monthly sws based on the fitted exponential relation between observed water level data and reservoir storage data provided by the water regime annual report of the pearl river mwr 2008 see fig 2b reservoir storage from jan 2003 to aug 2006 is assumed to be zero since ltr started to impound water in sept 2006 the impounded water in ltr reached the dead water level of 330 m 4 8 km3 first in jun 2007 and then reached the normal water level of 375 m 16 2 km3 in nov 2008 as only the water stored between the dead and normal water levels can be utilized the maximum water storage to be released from ltr is 11 4 km3 i e 16 2 minus 4 8 the forward modelling approach longuevergne et al 2013 is conducted to quantify leakage errors resulting from ltr storage ltrs with the purposes to understand the influences of the spherical harmonic expansion truncation and filtering on the magnitude and spatial pattern of grace tws data and the removal of high frequency noises contained in grace solutions to achieve a synthetic forward modelling is first performed by assuming a 1 km3 point mass distributed over the 0 125 degree grid point where ltr is located see fig 2a the derived spatial pattern of forward modelled ltrs ltrsf is shown in fig 2c on a regional average basis the 1 km3 water impoundment in ltr results in a gain of 0 63 km3 or equivalently 1 53 mm and 0 12 km3 or 0 32 mm of water storages in hkr and lkr respectively second a forward modelling is performed using the actual reservoir storage data with both 200 km and 500 km gaussian filters as seen fig 2d ltrsf in hkr shows a reduced amplitude after filtering and the attenuation is more significant when using the 500 km gaussian filter than using the 200 km filter the influence of filtering on the leakage signals of ltrsf into the lkr region is insignificant due to its longer distance from the reservoir 2 4 in situ groundwater level observations the validation of gwsgrace against the gws estimates from the in situ groundwater level observations gwsobs is conducted only in hkr due to data availability the observed groundwater level data at 22 wells 13 in guizhou and 9 in guangxi are obtained from the groundwater level yearbook compiled and published by the china institute of geo environment monitoring cigem 2005 2012 among 22 wells 18 are located at the carbonate karstic aquifers 3 at the unconsolidated porous aquifers and 1 at the consolidated fracture aquifer fig 1 the long term mean and the coefficient of variation of groundwater depth is 11 m and 1 42 in guizhou and 7 m and 0 56 in guangxi fig 3 the gwsobs anomalies are estimated by multiplying groundwater level anomalies with the specific yield of the unconfined aquifers or the storage coefficient of the confined aquifers yeh et al 2006 for all the unconfined carbonate karstic aquifers 17 wells the specific yield is estimated as the average 0 08 between the less karstic aquifers 0 01 and the highly karstic aquifers 0 15 http www chinabaike com china geological survey cgs 2012 chen and zhang 1999 the specific yield of the unconfined unconsolidated porous aquifers is estimated to be 0 24 as suggested by cgs 2012 the specific yield of the semi confined consolidated fracture aquifers is estimated to be 0 225 following johnson 1967 a value of 0 001 zheng et al 2014 is estimated as the elastic storage coefficient for all the confined aquifers in this study we follow previous studies e g feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 castle et al 2014 to use the simple arithmetic average of all available well data as the regional average 2 5 precipitation data and the palmer drought severity index pdsi the 0 5 degree gridded monthly precipitation dataset in china from 2003 to 2013 provided by the china meteorological administration cma is used here to analyse the response of gws to climate variability this gridded precipitation dataset was developed by using the thin plate spline interpolation based on the ground observation data of precipitation from 2472 meteorological stations in china http data cma cn the pdsi data provided by dai 2011 dai et al 2004 are used as an indicator of meteorological droughts in this study the pdsi incorporating precipitation temperature and soil parameters information hayes 2000 defines an extreme drought as pdsi 3 dai 2011 long et al 2013 although the spatial resolution of pdsi data is coarse 2 5 the spatial scale of this study 400 000 km2 is large enough to make the different drought situations between hkr and lkr distinguishable as seen from fig 4 a the pdsi well captures two unprecedented extreme droughts occurred in southwest china one from the autumn of 2009 to the spring of 2010 and another from the late summer of 2011 to the summer of 2012 mwr 2009 2012 wang et al 2014 2015 the hkr experienced more severe extreme droughts lasting nearly for the entire 2009 2011 whereas the lkr experienced the same two droughts but with a recovery between them during 2010 2011 although the drought was alleviated in 2012 in hkr the drought in lkr was instead intensified fig 4b plots the leakage corrected tws in two regions although both extreme droughts have left clear signatures on tws its temporal variations differ significantly from that of pdsi which is reasonable since pdsi accounts for meteorological factors and sms information only within the surface layers dai et al 2004 while tws integrates the variations all storage components including gws differences in the timing and amplitude of the peaks and troughs of tws can be observed as influenced by climatic conditions and the heterogeneous distribution of karst hydrogeology over southwest china 3 methods 3 1 estimation of gws from grace tws following the global unconstrained forward modelling approach chen et al 2014 2015 yan et al 2006 gws anomalies are estimated based on spherical harmonic coefficients in order to isolate gws from tws the gridded sms and sws data are expanded into the spherical harmonic coefficients truncated at the degree and order of 60 and filtered with the 200 km and 500 km gaussian smoothers respectively no de correlation is needed chen et al 2014 since snow storage and canopy water storage are negligible in southwest china the disaggregation of gws from grace tws can be expressed as 1 gws f tws f sws wghm f sms wghm f ltrs f where twsf denotes the original twsgrace without leakage correction swswghm f smswghm f and ltrsf denote the filtered sws sms and ltrs components and gwsf is the filtered gwsgrace without leakage correction a signal correction is required to reduce leakage errors and recover true signals the iterative global unconstrained forward modelling method is more advanced than using the scaling factor or multiplicative factor methods landerer and swenson 2012 long et al 2015 which are known to be highly sensitive to the required a priori information which is usually taken from model simulations chen et al 2014 2015 an iterative forward modelling is performed here for gwsf in each month during 2003 2013 the iteration is terminated at 25 and 50 iterations for the 200 km and 500 km gaussian filters respectively see section s3 of the supplementary material for details fig 5 compares the 2006 2012 mean seasonal cycles of gwsgrace and gwsobs in hkr and lkr with and without the iterative forward modelling as seen for all three grace products with both 200 km and 500 km gaussian filter the seasonal amplitude of gwsgrace is amplified and the timing is modified after the iterative forward modelling in both hkr fig 5a c and lkr fig 5d f the processing leads to an improved agreement with gwsobs in hkr fig 5a c indicating the effectiveness of the iterative forward modelling to recover the attenuated signals caused by the processes of spherical harmonic expansion truncation and filtering the original sms sws including ltrs and the leakage corrected gws are summed up to obtain the leakage corrected total tws 3 2 components contribution ratio in the following the component contribution ratio ccr kim et al 2009 is used to quantify the mean percentage contribution of individual water storage component to the temporal variability of the total tws which is defined as the ratio of the mean absolute deviation mad of a storage component to the total tws variability tv as follows 1 ccr s mad s tv where mad s 1 n t n s t s t v s storages mad s a n d s denotes the individual storage components e g gws sms and sws 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of gwsgrace with gwsobs the 2003 2013 monthly gwsgrace and gwsobs in hkr are compared in fig 6 a a general agreement between the 2006 2012 monthly gwsgrace and gwsobs can be seen r 0 71 rmse 41 6 mm fig 6b compares the 2006 2012 mean seasonal cycle between gwsgrace and gwsobs in hkr where the consistency in terms of both timing and amplitude can be observed the similar comparisons of monthly time series and mean seasonal cycle of gws in lkr are plotted in fig 6c and 6d respectively although no in situ groundwater level data are available for validation in lkr 390 000 km2 the gwsgrace can be reliable considering that 1 the effectiveness of the iterative forward modelling approach as demonstrated above in hkr with the similar spatial scale 412 900 km2 and also in northwest india chen et al 2014 long et al 2016 and antarctica chen et al 2015 in previous studies 2 the reliability of the modelled sms and sws data for the isolation of gws have been examined see section s1 and s2 of the supplementary material and 3 the leakage errors in the grace derived gws anomalies in lkr are smaller than that in hkr see discussion below the boxplots in fig 6b and d display the quartiles of the six leakage corrected gwsgrace estimates the solid green and red lines plotted in fig 5a c and d f correspondingly as seen from fig 6d or 5d f the seasonal cycles of gwsgrace anomalies in lkr from different post processing specification exhibit better consistency among each other than those in hkr fig 6b or 5a c indicating less leakage errors in gwsgrace in lkr it is worth noting that the signal leakage in grace data is related to the spatial mass distribution long et al 2016 which further indicate the heterogeneity of the aquifer systems in lkr 28 of karst most areas are covered by non karst landscapes with generally lower permeability and hydraulic conductivity i e lower heterogeneity yuan 1985 chen et al 2012 than karst landscapes and the eastern part of lkr is developed with homogeneous deep confined karst aquifers cgs 2006 however the hkr 50 of karst is underlain by the unconfined karst aquifers with a high permeability and hydraulic conductivity cgs 2012 yuan 1985 chen et al 2012 hence the regional gws variability in lkr may contain a lower degree of heterogeneity and can result in less leakage errors of grace data see section 5 for the error estimation fig 6 also compares gwswghm to both gwsgrace and gwsobs the result indicates that gwswghm is consistent with gwsobs in timing r 0 78 in hkr during 2005 2012 fig 6a a fair agreement in timing can also be noted between gwsgrace and gwswghm in both hkr r 0 70 and lkr r 0 81 however the seasonal amplitudes fig 6b and d and interannual variability see section 4 4 for details of gwswghm are significantly underestimated in both hkr and lkr which can be attributed mainly to the absence of the representation of the karst features of subsurface hydrogeology in wghm hartmann et al 2015 4 2 contribution of storage components to tws variability fig 7 plots the 2003 2013 monthly time series fig 7a b and mean seasonal cycle fig 7c d of tws and its individual storage components gws sms and sws including ltrs for hkr and lkr respectively the contribution of each water storage component to tws i e ccrs is also given in fig 7a b and table 1 on average gws contributes to 60 and 58 of the total tws variability in hkr and lkr respectively sms and sws ltrs in hkr contribute respectively to 18 and 22 14 of tws variability in hkr and 28 and 14 of that in lkr gws plays a more significant role in tws variability than sws and sms in both hkr and lkr consistent with the large storage capacity of the well developed subsurface karst systems with fractures and conduits than the small storage capacity of the leaky epikarst zones with thin soil layers liu et al 2014 yuan 1985 sms has a larger contribution 28 to tws in lkr fig 7a b and table 1 due to its thicker unsaturated zone to store more water than the more leaky epi karst zones in hkr to retain less water moreover sws in hkr is dominated by ltrs indicating significant regulation of reservoirs unlike hkr sws in lkr is dominated by the lake storage less influenced by climate and human activities lehner and döll 2004 water resources department wrd 2009 2011 see section s2 of the supplementary information on the lake storage in lkr the differences among the ccrs calculated based on various processed grace tws time series i e with or without leakage correction different grace products different filters used are smaller in sms and sws 4 than in gws 10 table 1 the lowest ccrs of gws contribution to tws variability is 57 in both hkr and lkr when using the csr data with a 500 km gaussian filter the largest ccrs of gws is 67 in hkr and 62 in lkr when using the gfz data with a 200 km filter table 2 as seen from table 1 the range of ccrs of gws 57 67 is approximately the same for both hkr and lkr indicating similar seasonal amplitude and pattern of gws anomalies between two regions the major difference in gws anomalies between hkr and lkr lies in timing as shown in fig 7c d gws in hkr has an earlier seasonal trough in feb and peak in jul than that in lkr trough in may and peak in oct this is related to the spatial variability of precipitation and different response of aquifers to precipitation recharge as will be discussed further below in sections 4 3 and 4 4 4 3 correlation among water storage components and precipitation the cross correlation analysis ni et al 2018 oppenheim et al 1989 is used to investigate the time lags between water storage anomaly and precipitation table 2 summarizes the cross correlation coefficients r at the lags from zero to 6 months between the 2006 2012 monthly precipitation and individual storage component from which the time lag with the highest r can be identified both gws gwsgrace and gwsobs in hkr lag behind precipitation for one month r 0 72 and 0 76 respectively however gws in lkr has a weak correlation with precipitation r 0 20 at lag zero and with a lag behind precipitation by 2 months r 0 72 table 2 the lag of gws behind precipitation in hkr is 1 2 months shorter than the lag in lkr table 2 and fig 7c d due to the higher recharge rate caused by the more permeable epi karst zones and high hydraulic gradient under the mountainous topography in hkr legrand and stringfield 1973 conversely the aquifers in lkr has lower recharge rates due to the thicker unsaturated zone and considerably less permeable non karstic aquifers mainly in the central western yunnan relative to hkr a high correlation 0 80 r 0 90 between the modelled sms also sws and precipitation is found in both hkr and lkr table 2 an even larger cross correlation 0 85 r 0 95 can be noted when sms and sws lag one month behind precipitation table 2 these high correlations indicate direct control of precipitation on the temporal variability of sms and sws unlike the modelled sws which mainly reflects natural variability the ltrs in hkr shows a lag of about 3 5 months behind precipitation with the highest r 0 46 at the 4 month lag owing to strong human regulation on reservoir storage table 2 table 3 summarizes the correlation matrix between the 2006 2012 monthly grace total water storage anomaly twsgrace and its individual storage components gws sms and sws including ltrs in the highly hkr and low lkr karstic regions from this table the higher correlation between gwsgrace gwsobs and sms is found in hkr with r 0 68 0 55 than that in lkr r 0 48 between gwsgrace and sms also the correlation between gwsgrace gwsobs and sws is more significant in hkr with r 0 73 0 70 than lkr with r 0 56 table 3 the higher correlations between gws and sms also sws in hkr than lkr implies a higher degree of surface water groundwater interaction over the more karstic hydrogeology conditions 4 4 role of water storage components during the 2009 2012 extreme drought period annual water storage changes can be estimated as the difference in water storage anomalies between the decembers in two consecutive years i e storage anomalies in this december minus that in last december as the storage change of this year table 4 summarizes annual changes of grace tws and its components gws sms and sws including ltrs during the 2009 2012 extreme drought period from which significant gws losses can be noted in both 2009 and 2011 for both regions the estimated gwsgrace loss in hkr in 2009 is 74 3 mm yr 66 of total tws loss comparable to the estimated gwsobs loss of 72 5 mm yr table 4 the estimated gwsgrace loss in lkr in 2009 is 42 7 mm yr 62 of total tws loss the gwsgrace losses in 2009 and 2011 table 4 indicate that groundwater discharge exceeds groundwater recharge during the extreme drought years the major source of groundwater recharge over southwest china is diffuse recharge from precipitation whereas the source of groundwater discharge is mainly from river baseflow through subsurface channels groundwater pumping for human consumption and groundwater evapotranspiration i e the capillary rise to the phreatic zone cui et al 1985 during the extreme drought periods when most rivers run dry chen et al 2013 the karstic aquifers can drain more rapidly through the subsurface channels without receiving much replenishment subsequently the subsurface channels capture the water stored in the surrounding fractural and porous aquifers due to the increased hydraulic gradient and eventually produce substantial discharge hartmann et al 2017 goldscheider and drew 2007 han 2015 human consumption contributes little to total groundwater discharge since groundwater resources are still underexploited in southwest china 4 0 km3 yr 12 of the potentially exploitable amounts xia et al 2016 groundwater evapotranspiration is negligible due to its small magnitude chen and shu 2006 yeh and famiglietti 2009 therefore significant gws losses during the droughts in southwest china should be mainly due to natural discharge through river baseflow and subsurface channels it is worth noting that a 30 mm yr larger gws loss as detected by grace was experienced in 2009 in hkr than in lkr table 4 despite the less severe drought occurred in hkr fig 4a which is reasonable given that hkr has more underground channels than lkr cui et al 1985 xia et al 2016 according to the statistics given by pei et al 2008 the number of underground channels in guangxi guizhou and yunnan is 374 219 and 96 respectively the more developed underground river system is a result of more intensive erosion which ultimately results in a higher degree of heterogeneity therefore hkr has higher subsurface drainage capability and potentially experiences larger gws losses during the extreme droughts unlike 2009 annual gwsgrace loss in 2011 is estimated to be larger in lkr 78 5 mm yr 82 of total tws loss than that in hkr 28 9 mm yr 54 of total tws loss annual gwsgrace loss in 2011 in hkr was significantly underestimated when comparing to gwsobs loss 60 3 mm yr table 4 aquifers in southwest china has a clear rebound in 2010 and 2012 following the 2009 and 2011 extreme droughts table 4 gwsgrace gwsobs has a larger increase of 98 9 64 7 mm yr in 2010 in hkr accounting for 82 of total tws recovery compared to 16 3 mm yr in lkr 42 of tws recovery there are two major reasons for such a difference first due to the atmospheric circulation influenced by sea surface temperature and complex topography qin et al 2015 wang et al 2015 hkr receives more precipitation table 4 with the seasonal peak one month earlier in june fig 7c than lkr peak in july fig 7d second as discussed in section 4 3 the karstic aquifers in hkr respond more rapidly to precipitation owing to its higher permeability than that in lkr consequently the earlier and heavier precipitation combined with the more efficient infiltration lead to a significant recovery of gws after the extreme drought legrand and stringfield 1973 zhang et al 2011 however the larger gwsgrace recovery in hkr was not observed in 2012 the estimated gwsgrace in 2012 was 42 6 mm yr 50 of tws recovery less than that in lkr 69 6 mm yr 100 of tws recovery table 4 gwsgrace recovery in 2012 in lkr may be overestimated considering the aggravated severe drought since the summer of 2011 with the decreasing pdsi as shown in fig 4a with the precipitation deficit in both 2011 and 2012 table 4 in contrast to the alleviated drought in hkr with the increasing pdsi as shown in fig 4a sms has a smaller interannual variability 23 mm yr during 2009 2012 table 4 than gws 100 mm yr in both hkr and lkr annual sms loss in 2009 and recovery in 2010 also the contribution to tws loss in lkr are larger than that in hkr due to the higher storage capacity of the thicker unsaturated zones in lkr table 4 sws has an even smaller interannual variability 6 mm yr in both hkr and lkr during 2009 2012 table 4 it should be noted that the annual ltrs losses in hkr 18 2 mm yr in 2009 and 16 6 mm yr in 2011 see table 4 were not equivalent to actual release of reservoir storage in drought table 4 the ltrs loss during the extreme drought from the autumn of 2009 to the spring of 2010 is 14 5 mm 6 0 km3 53 the available capacity of 11 4 km3 and no apparent change of ltrs occurred during the 2011 summer drought figs 2d or 7a the above results indicate that the reservoir storage plays a limited role in mitigating drought impacts in hkr particularly if droughts occur in the low storage stage in summer figs 2d or 7a when reservoirs are incapable to release water for the use of downstream areas 5 uncertainty analysis the monthly errors uncertainty in the grace measurements model simulated sms sws and ltrs data and the post processing specifications are quantified in this sub section the grace measurement error is estimated from the root mean square of the residual mass changes over the pacific ocean at the same latitude 20 5 29 5 n as southwest china chen et al 2009 the final grace measurement error is the standard deviation of the six error estimates from the three grace data products csr gfz and jpl with the two gaussian filters 200 and 500 km independently the grace measurement error for hkr and lkr is assigned to be equal due to the same latitude it should be noted that the grace measurement error is affected by the area and shape of region of interest longuevergne et al 2010 for the lkr and hkr their areas are very close to each other but their shape is quite different lkr has a more irregular shape which may incur higher uncertainties in grace measurements therefore the grace measurement error in lkr can be underestimated in this study the uncertainty in modelled sms and sws is difficult to estimate due to the lack of sufficient in situ observations and hence assumed to be 30 in both hkr and lkr the uncertainty for the ltrs in hkr induced by curve fitting is estimated to be 5 the post processing error is represented by the standard deviation of the six leakage corrected monthly gws anomalies finally by assuming the independence among the error components the uncertainty in gwsgrace is estimated by error propagation i e calculating the root square of sum of the square errors the estimated error of each component is shown in table 5 post processing error is the largest among the error components with 37 4 mm mo for hkr and 26 2 mm mo for lkr followed by the error in grace measurement 18 2 mm mo sms 7 5 mm mo and sws 4 0 mm mo table 5 the final monthly error the root mean square of error series of gwsgrace is estimated to be 41 9 mm mo for hkr and 32 9 mm mo for lkr table 5 the specification of specific yield sy values is critical for estimating gwsobs but challenging according to the statistics of pumping test for 33 wells in guangxi the karst ratio as well as the sy value changes at different depths for instance the sy changes slightly within 0 100 m with the value ranging from 0 05 to 0 074 however the sy value decreased significantly within 100 150 m with an average value of 0 0016 chen and zhang 1999 the study by chen and zhang 1999 well reflect the high heterogeneity of karst aquifers at three dimensions i e both horizontally and vertically ideally we should identify appropriate sy for each individual well based on pumping test data rodell et al 2007 considering the the high heterogeneity of karst aquifers but this is difficult to achieve due to the lack of data from pumping tests sun et al 2010 in this study a single sy is assigned to all the karstic wells which could incur uncertainties but we use different sy for different aquifer types which can be more reliable than using a constant sy for all wells as commonly adopted in previous studies e g chen et al 2016 rodell et al 2007 2009 strassberg et al 2007 this study assumes 40 uncertainty of s y chen et al 2016 leblanc et al 2009 hence the error of gwsobs in hkr is 21 7 mm mo during 2006 2012 table 5 the sensitivity of the post processing specification on the determination of time lag is small the six gws anomaly estimates i e three grace solutions with two gaussian filters in hkr and lkr respectively represent a time lag of one month and two month with the lagged correlation ranging from 0 61 to 0 72 table 2 moreover due to the failure in simulating gws in southwest china see section 3 1 wghm does not reveal the different gws variability in response to precipitation between hkr and lkr as indicated by grace and groundwater level data and instead shows the same time lag of two months table 2 the error of annual water storage change see table 4 is estimated as the mean square root of the sum of the square errors in december of two consecutive years the error in annual gws change is considerably large with an average of 45 mm in hkr and 35 mm in lkr comparing to the estimated annual gws changes within 100 mm during 2004 2013 table 4 the large uncertainty in the annual gws change is mainly attributed to the post processing for leakage correction of different grace products with the standard deviation up to 43 mm table s1 moreover the annual gws change simulated by wghm are significantly underestimated showing weaker variability within 22 mm than gwsgrace 100 mm table 4 6 conclusions this study estimates 2003 2013 monthly groundwater storage gws anomalies in the highly karstic region hkr 50 of karst areas and low karstic region lkr 28 of karst areas in the southwest china from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace terrestrial water storage tws data by using the ancillary data of surface water storage sws and soil moisture storage sms from the watergap global hydrology model wghm simulations the leakage errors in the estimated gws anomalies are corrected through the iterative forward modelling approach the key findings of this study are summarized in the following 1 the effectiveness of the iterative forward modelling approach is demonstrated by the satisfactory validation of the leakage corrected gws anomalies against that based on in situ gw level observations r 0 71 rmse 41 6 mm 2 the temporal variability of tws is dominated by gws 60 in both hkr and lkr sms contributes 18 28 to tws variability in hkr lkr while sws contributes 22 14 in hkr lkr the storage in the largest reservoir in southwest china the longtan reservoir contributes to 14 of the tws variability in hkr 3 gws anomalies in hkr show an approximately one month shorter lag to precipitation than that in lkr due to the higher permeability of the epi karst zones in hkr grace derived gws anomalies in hkr are better correlated with sws r 0 73 rmse 51 mm and sms r 0 68 rmse 47 mm anomalies than that in lkr sws r 0 56 rmse 50 mm and sms r 0 48 rmse 49 mm indicating the well connected system between the epi karst zones and subsurface aquifers in hkr 4 hkr experienced a larger gws loss 74 3 mm yr 66 of total tws loss in the extreme drought year of 2009 than lkr 42 7 mm yr 62 of total tws loss due to larger natural discharge through the well developed subsurface drainage system gws in hkr recovers faster than lkr from extreme droughts owing to the larger and earlier by approximately one month precipitation and quicker response of groundwater to precipitation 5 human regulation on reservoir storage plays a minor role in mitigating the impacts of extreme droughts in particular during the summer when reservoirs remain at the lowest water level 6 considering its still under exploitation status 4 km3 yr only 12 of the potentially exploitable amounts groundwater resources in southwest china are of high potential for future water resource management under drought conditions 7 post processing error i e error in leakage correction and different products of grace data is the largest among the error components with 37 4 mm mo for hkr and 26 2 mm mo for lkr indicating smaller leakage errors in grace estimated gws anomalies in lkr due to its less heterogeneous hydrogeology the sensitivity of the post processing specification of grace data on the contribution ratio of gws anomalies to total tws and its lag to precipitation is small in southwest china still it is difficult to accurately estimate annual gws changes by using grace data due to the uncertainty errors from both satellite measurements and ancillary data of soil moisture and surface water storage the pressing need of utilizing grace data to identify regional gws variability over the heterogeneous aquifers such as southwest china warrants the enhanced spatial resolution and sensor precision of grace data which are expected to be achieved by the future grace follow on missions elsaka et al 2014 last but not the least even the most sophisticated hydrologic models such as wghm are unable to simulate the seasonal amplitudes and annual variability of gws accurately in the karst areas of southwest china owing to that the hydrologic characteristics of the karst landscapes are not accounted for in wghm model parameterization hartmann et al 2015 as the karst landscape is one of the most important aquifer formation bakalowicz 2005 this study calls for the necessary representation of the specifics of karst hydrogeology in current global hydrology models this study further highlights the unique values of grace in interpreting regional gws variations considering the hydrogeology conditions hu et al 2017 hu and jiao 2015 and in the data

6768,the hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of precipitation and water vapor are useful tracers in the water cycle the water balance of inland river basins located in the monsoon marginal zone are difficult to determine because little is known about the contribution of various vapor involved based on the three component isotopic mixing model the monthly precipitation surface water and plant water isotope data of the seven sampling stations from april to october 2017 were used to assess the vapor contribution to precipitation in the shiyang river basin the average contribution of plant transpiration land surface evaporation and advected vapor to precipitation accounted for 11 6 and 83 in the mountain regions for 21 7 and 72 in the oasis regions and for 10 5 and 85 in the desert regions respectively the contribution of plant transpiration and surface evaporation vapor was similar in time variation and the maximum value appeared in july the average plant transpiration vapor contribution at each station was always greater than the surface evaporation vapor different landscape and special underlying surfaces are important factors influencing the difference in water vapor contribution the average surface evaporation water vapor contribution of the xiying m1 station is the largest in the study area with a contribution fraction of 9 the contribution of wuwei oasis recycled moisture can reach 30 the plant transpiration vapor accounted for 73 keywords stable isotope recycled moisture three component isotopic mixing model monsoon marginal zone 1 introduction in recent decades stable isotopes have been widely used in the fields of hydrology and ecology fontes et al 1986 longinelli et al 2008 sprenger et al 2016 ala aho et al 2018 one of the most important uses is to determine the proportion of different sources in the mixture phillips and gregg 2001 for example to distinguish the sources of plants water use and animal food li et al 2007 oelze et al 2011 evaristo and mcdonnell 2017 discrimination of carbon sources in soil zheng and wang 2009 glenn et al 2011 and estimation of the contribution of different water vapor sources to precipitation clark and fritz 1997 peng et al 2011 precipitation vapor is a mixture of recycled moisture and advected vapor the recycled moisture also includes the vapor contribution of evaporation from surface water bodies marine lake river and soil water and plant transpiration trenberth 1999 van der ent et al 2010 rios entenza et al 2014 recycled moisture plays an important role in the local water cycle and is a key part of the atmospheric water vapor balance in some areas litschi 2006 aemisegger et al 2014 precipitation hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition can be used to deduce the proportion of plant transpiration vapor land surface evaporation vapor and advected vapor clark and fritz 1997 genereux 1998 xu et al 2008 therefore in the study of water isotopes many studies have focused on the application of craig gordon water evaporation model isotope mixing model and isotope distillation model to evaluate the contribution of recycled moisture and advected vapor to precipitation according to the relative magnitude of the flux such as surface evaporation and plant transpiration the isotope mixing model can be divided into two element model and three element model from the model hypothesis the two element mixture model generally focuses on the contribution of land surface evaporation to precipitation froehlich et al 2008 kong et al 2013 but it ignores the contribution of plant transpiration vapor the three element mixture model can distinguish the relative contribution of plant transpiration vapor land surface evaporation vapor and advected vapor to precipitation peng et al 2011 and has been applied in previous studies peng et al 2011 wang et al 2016 these studies have quantified the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation in china s pure monsoon region and arid region but the understanding of interlaced zone between monsoon region and arid region is still unclear some scholars also have estimated the evaporation loss of open water bodies horita et al 2008 gibson and reid 2010 skrzypek et al 2015 and its contribution to precipitation gat et al 2003 vallet coulomb et al 2008 xu et al 2011 however most of these studies have considered the contribution of single water from a single underlying surface to precipitation the contribution of water vapor to precipitation from different sources in different underlying areas needs further study the shiyang river basin is located in the monsoon marginal zone the water vapor cycle processes is extremely complex because the climate is controlled by different atmospheric circulation patterns zhang et al 2008 however with traditional meteorological and hydrological methods it is difficult to understand the specific process of the water vapor cycle making most of the research limited to the source of advected vapor and its transport pang et al 2005 wu et al 2011 li et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 although seasonal and spatial changes in water vapor contribution have previously been applied to this region li et al 2016 the contribution of mountains oases and deserts as separate systems were not considered as a typical inland river basin in the monsoon marginal zone the shiyang river basin provides a feasible case for this study because its complex underlying surface natural environment in view of this the specific purpose of our study is to compare the relative contribution of plant transpiration land surface evaporation and advected vapor to precipitation in different landscape area in order to further clarify the mechanism of water vapor cycle and the distribution of water vapor resources in inland river basins 2 date and method 2 1 study area the shiyang river basin is located on the northern slope of the qilian mountains and the lower reaches are located between the tengger desert and the badain jaran desert fig 1 it is located in the transition zone of the three climatic regions in the eastern monsoon region the northwest arid region and the qinghai tibet plateau region the climate is controlled by several atmospheric circulation patterns such as the westerly wind belt the eastern monsoon and the plateau monsoon zhang et al 2008 the upper reaches of the shiyang river basin are a mountainous area and the middle and lower reaches have been developed into an oasis agricultural region the end of the river extends into the desert and semi desert regions vegetation is mainly distributed in the area between 2000 m and 3600 m altitudes the area of the oasis regions is 7549 km2 in the middle and lower reaches accounting for 18 of the total basin area wen et al 2013 according to the water vapor transport situation there are monsoon water vapor transport from eastern china in the shiyang river basin from april to october 2017 after clustering of water vapors transported to the shiyang river basin it was found that the trajectory of water vapor movement always migrated from the southern desert regions through the oasis regions to the northern mountain regions figs 2 and 3 2 2 sampling and laboratory analysis the precipitation surface water and plant samples were collected at seven stations of the shiyang river basin from october 2016 to october 2017 the basic information of these seven sampling stations is shown in table 1 the nature environment at where the stations are located can be divided into three landscape units the mountain region the oasis region and the desert region there are four sampling stations in mountain region xiying m1 huajian m2 ningchan m3 and lenglong m4 two sampling stations in oasis region minqin o1 and wuwei o2 and one sampling station in desert region zhishazhan d fig 1 the precipitation samples were collected by plastic funnel bottle sets to prevent evaporation precipitation samples were collected immediately after each rainfall event and then transferred to a 50 ml hdpe sample bottle sample bottle mouth was sealed with waterproof tapes and stored frozen until experimental analysis surface water samples were collected from nearby rivers plant samples were collected from arbors shrubs and crops in different landscape zones of shiyang river basin we intercepted the xylem of the stems from the local dominant plants quickly peeled off the epidermis and sealed them into sample bottles and stored frozen the plant species and the samples number at each station are shown in table 1 surface water and plant samples were collected near the precipitation samples collection station within 500 m fig 1 the lake water samples come from qingtu lake the terminal lake of shiyang river basin qingtu lake can be divided into south lake and north lake there are two sampling point in south lake and one sampling points in north lake in total 21 lake water samples were collected from five sampling points in qingtu lake from april to october 2017 all samples were analyzed for δ 2h and δ 18o using the liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research usa at the stable isotope laboratory of northwest normal university the plant water was extracted with cryogenic vacuum distillation apparatus li 2100 lica united technology limited china for analysis every water sample and isotope standard sample was continuously injected six times to avoid the memory effect of isotope analysis the first two injections were discarded and the average value of the last four injections was used in the analyses the isotope analysis results are expressed by the symbol δ and relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow 1 δ sample r sample r v smow 1 1000 where r sample is the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in the samples and r standard is the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in v smow the precision is 0 6 for δ 2h and 0 2 for δ 18o fig 4 shows the monthly variation of stable isotope values at these stations during winter months from november to march the surface air temperature in arid areas of northwest china is usually low and evaporation from surface water and transpiration from plants are very limited shen et al 2010 therefore a total of 417 isotope data of precipitation surface water and xylem water from april to october 2017 were selected table 2 lists the monthly average values of precipitation surface water and xylem water isotope values at each station during the sampling period meteorological data such as temperature precipitation amount and relative humidity were recorded by the automatic weather station watchdog 2000 series in mountain region station in oasis and desert region stations meteorological data was collected from two national meteorology observation stations http data cma cn water vapor fluxes were calculated using ncep ncar 2 5 2 5 reanalysis data at 700 hpa ncep ncar reanalysis 1 which were obtained from the national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research http www esrl noaa gov the sampling work and maintenance of the weather station were completed by the staff of the research team stationed in the shiyang river basin and they also assisted in sampling 2 3 three component mixing model it is assumed that the precipitation is a mixture of advected vapor and local recycled moisture brubaker et al 1993 van der ent et al 2010 the recycling fractions indicate the proportion of recycled moisture in precipitation 2 f re p tr p ev p tr p ev p adv where f re represents the proportion of recycled moisture in precipitation p tr p ev p adv are the precipitation from plant transpiration vapor surface evaporation vapor and advected vapor respectively therefore the water vapor recycling fractions can be calculated by the following equations 3 δ pv δ tr f tr δ ev f ev δ adv f adv 4 1 f tr f ev f adv where δ pv δ tr δ ev and δ adv are stable isotope compositions in precipitation vapor plant transpiration vapor land surface evaporation vapor and advected vapor respectively f tr f ev and f adv are the contribution fractions of plant transpiration vapor surface evaporation vapor and advected vapor to precipitation respectively which can be calculated by isoerror software ver 1 04 available at http www epa gov eco research phillips and gregg 2001 we use case b dual isotopes three

with a value of 0 88 for the north american great lakes and around 0 5 for the eastern mediterranean sea the value n for a stable layer like soil and leaf cover is 1 and for a large open water body is 0 5 the cd value of 2h is 25 1 18o is 28 5 in our study areas the weight value θ takes 1 and n takes 0 5 merlivat 1978 gonfiantini 1986 araguás araguás et al 2000 skrzypek et al 2015 wang et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 the calculation process is repeated for values of k between 0 6 and 1 0 with a step width of 0 0001 the value of k depends on the difference between the calculated slope of lel eq 8 and the actually observed slope of lel when the difference between the two was the lowest or k reached the boundary values 0 6 or 1 0 the final k value was taken skrzypek et al 2015 in this study area the lel equation obtained using the isotope data from the qingtu lake water was δ 2h 3 86δ 18o 19 88 r 2 0 994 p 0 0001 n 19 thus the actually observed slope of lel was 3 86 water is absorbed from the soil by plants and diffuses into the atmosphere through transpiration this process is assumed to not lead to any fractionation flanagan et al 1991 therefore δ tr can be replaced by xylem water isotope value δ x among the sampling stations in shiyang river basin m4 is located in alpine meadow zone the vegetation growing season is short and d is located in desert and semi desert area with almost no vegetation growing therefore δ tr is replaced by the water isotope values precipitation or surface water available to plants 11 δ tr δ x δ w the δ ev can be calculated by a simplified craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 machavaram et al 1995 gat 1996 peng et al 2011 the equation is as follows 12 δ ev δ s h δ adv ε 1 h where δ s is the isotope value of the surface water before evaporation and δ adv is the isotope value of the advected vapor δ adv can be calculated by the rayleigh distillation equation peng et al 2011 13 δ adv δ pv adv 10 3 α 1 ln f however along the trajectory of water vapor transport the isotope were not significantly depleted in some months fig 4 as suggested by peng et al 2011 the δ adv is calculated by eq 14 instead of rayleigh distillation equation eq 13 14 δ adv δ pv adv in the above eqs 13 and 14 δ pv adv is the precipitation vapor isotope value of the upwind station f is a ratio between final and initial vapor which is sometimes estimated using the atmospheric water content parameter peng et al 2011 studies have found that the precipitation amount in arid areas is positively correlated with the surface water vapor pressure hu et al 2015 so the f value is 0 8 in our study area which is defined by the ratio of the average land surface vapor pressure at the high elevation station mountain 9 1 hpa to the low elevation station oasis 7 2 hpa 3 results 3 1 sources of precipitation water vapor in the desert regions by clustering the water vapor sources transported to the shiyang river basin it was found that the trajectory of water vapor migration is always from the lower reaches to the upper reaches of the shiyang river basin that is from desert regions to oasis regions to mountain regions fig 3 therefore we first estimate the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation in desert regions d station the yinchuan observation station jing et al 2014 in the eastern of lower reaches of shiyang river basin was used as the upwind station of the d station and the water vapor was transported from yinchuan to the d station through the southeast monsoon path therefore in study area the monsoon transport water vapor passing through the yinchuan station is defined as the first stage of the advected vapor δ adv1 during the water vapor transport carried by the summer monsoon from coast to inland water vapor isotopes undergo distillation and was depleted this process can be simulated by the rayleigh distillation equation eq 13 however in some months during the process of water vapor transport from yinchuan to d station the isotope value was not significantly distillation due to the affection of isotope effect table 3 in these months the δ adv1 can be considered as the precipitation water vapor isotope value at yinchuan station δ pv1 eq 14 table 3 lists the calculated δ pv and δ adv of yinchuan and d stations in different months in the calculation of δ ev eq 12 δ s were replaced by local precipitation isotope values table 2 δ adv was δ adv1 or δ pv1 from yinchuan station the calculated δ ev are listed in table 3 because d station is located in desert and semi desert region there is almost no vegetation growth and vegetation samples are lacking so the δ tr in d station was also replaced by δ p eq 11 f tr f ev and f adv of desert regions in different months were calculated using isoerror software and above calculated δ tr δ ev and δ adv by calculation from april to october the range of f tr was 5 15 the average value was 10 the range of f ev was 2 12 the average value was 5 the range of f adv was 73 93 the average value was 85 in desert regions all calculation results are shown in table 3 and fig 5 a b and c show the monthly variations of f tr f ev and f adv in each region respectively 3 2 sources of precipitation water vapor in the oasis and mountain regions during water vapor transport passing through desert regions to the middle and upper reaches the water vapor first reaches oasis regions which is defined as the second stage of water vapor transport δ adv2 similar to desert regions procedure in some months when water vapor migrates from d station to o1 and o2 station the isotope were not significantly depleted so the δ adv of o1 and o2 sampling stations in oasis regions was δ adv2 or δ pv2 from d station in desert regions eq 13 or eq 14 when calculating δ ev eq 12 δ s takes the local river water isotope values at the each sampling stations table 2 δ adv was δ pv2 or δ adv2 from d station δ tr was replaced by the crops water isotope values at the oasis regions sampling station the calculated δ pv δ adv δ ev δ tr and f tr f ev f adv of o1 and o2 station are listed in table 3 by calculation from april to october the range of f tr was 14 26 the average value was 21 the range of f ev was 4 13 the average value was 7 the range of f adv was 61 82 the average value was 72 in oasis regions fig 5 in terms of local water vapor transport most of the water vapor in the mountain region comes from the oasis region in the north of shiyang river basin fig 3 which is defined as the third stage of water vapor transport δ adv3 there are four sampling stations in the small watershed of ningchan river in the mountain region similar to desert and oasis regions when calculating the δ ev of sampling stations in different months in mountain regions δ adv was the δ pv3 and δ adv3 from the oasis region and the upwind station at their respective stations δ s was the nearest river water isotope value to the sampling stations δ tr was replaced by arbors and shrubs xylem water isotope values in different vegetation zones eq 11 because m4 station is located in alpine meadow zone and the vegetation growing season is short the δ tr of each month was also replaced by the river water isotope value table 3 lists the calculated δ pv δ adv δ ev δ tr and f tr f ev f adv of the m1 m2 m3 and m4 stations in the mountain regions by calculation from april to october the range of f tr was 7 17 the average value was 11 the range of f ev was 3 11 the average value was 6 the range of f adv was 72 89 the average value was 83 in the mountain regions fig 5 as shown in fig 5a b c f tr and f ev increased from april to july and decreased from august to october this seasonal variation have high consistency with temperature changes table 2 in general there are relatively consistent of f tr and f ev changes in desert oasis and mountain regions but the change of f tr and f ev deserve further discussion due to the differences of regional environments at each station see the discussion section of this paper fig 5c shows the change of monthly average f tr and f ev for each sampling station fig 6 makes the calculation results of the three regions and the water cycle process in the shiyang river basin more visualized 4 discussion 4 1 effect of reservoir on recycled moisture the contribution of land surface evaporation vapor from each sampling stations in shiyang river basin ranged from 4 to 9 fig 5d and the largest contribution was 9 of m1 sampling stations in the mountain regions the contribution of plant transpiration vapor exhibits a similar spatial variation to the land surface evaporation vapor and the plant transpiration vapor contribution was 15 at m1 station therefore the contribution fraction of recycled moisture to precipitation was as high as 24 at m1 station which is larger than other sampling stations in mountain regions of shiyang river basin in particular land surface evaporation was most significant fig 5d some studies have shown that the evaporation contribution of large and open water bodies to precipitation can be high edwards 2002 bowen et al 2012 and will also increase the local water vapor recycling fraction located within 4 4 km to the m1 sampling station xiying reservoir is the largest artificial water body in the mountain regions the existence of the xiying reservoir in the study area may be the main reason for the sudden increase in the contribution of the recycled moisture in the m1 station to further analyze the reasons we compared the air temperature and relative humidity with f tr and f ev of each station in the shiyang river basin as shown in fig 7 the air temperature and relative humidity of each sampling station from upstream to downstream show a decreasing and rising trend respectively however this trend is reversed at the m1 station where temperature decreases slowly but relative humidity is obviously increased this further indicates that xiying reservoir may increase the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation some studies on lake evaporation losses and their contribution to precipitation also support this conclusion in summer the contribution of lake water evaporation from the great lakes of north america to atmospheric water vapor varies between 4 6 and 15 7 gat et al 2013 lake evaporation losses in the yinchuan plain also located in the monsoon marginal zone were generally greater than 25 reaching up to 42 8 qian et al 2013 the annual contribution rate of evaporation to precipitation in the qinghai lake basin was 23 42 cui and li 2015 the contribution of evaporation vapor from nam co lake to local atmospheric water vapor was about 28 4 31 1 xu et al 2011 therefore the influence of open water bodies located in arid areas on local recycled moisture and its contribution to precipitation cannot be ignored 4 2 influence of oasis effect on recycled moisture as shown in fig 5d the contribution of plant transpiration vapor at each sampling station in our study area was always greater than that of land surface evaporation vapor which is consistent with the research conclusions for other regions peng et al 2011 li et al 2016 wang et al 2016 previous studies combining results from 81 locations around the world show that plant transpiration vapor plays a major role in the water cycle on a global scale accounting for 61 of recycled moisture and contributing 39 to precipitation schlesinger and jasechko 2014 although oases in arid regions of northwest china account for only a small fraction of the land area 5 they are essential for 95 of the population and their agricultural activities lü et al 2004 it also has great significance for local precipitation and the local water vapor cycle wang et al 2016 used the isotopic signature of recycled moisture to show the oasis effect in arid central asia and demonstrate that water vapor recirculation in large oases is more pronounced than in small oases in our study area the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation from o2 station in wuwei oasis was 30 and the plant transpiration vapor accounts for 73 of the local recirculated moisture t et this value is lower than the average value 87 of the heihe river basin oasis which is the second largest inland river basin in northwest china wen et al 2015 according to previous studies this may be due to the decrease of surface water and groundwater which lead to the reduction of oasis area however other factors also need to be further explored 4 3 applicability of three component mixing model in the monsoon marginal zone similarly the three component isotopic mixing model has also been applied to the tianshan mountains of non monsoon region and the taiwan island of monsoon region in taiwan island the f tr varied between 29 and 41 and f ev varied between 1 and 2 peng et al 2011 in the tianshan mountains the f tr value varied between 2 8 and 10 3 the f ev ranged from 0 6 to 5 9 wang et al 2016 in essence our study area is located in the monsoon marginal zone which has the common characteristics of the monsoon region and non monsoon region the range of f tr in the study area is 8 22 which is between tianshan mountains and taiwan island the f ev is slightly larger than that of the tianshan mountains and much larger than that of taiwan island but it is close to the f ev in the whole western regions of china ma et al 2012 at the same time the study area is an inland river basin in the northwest of china the total surface water resource in the basin is 1552 million m3 ma 2018 which provides more possibilities for surface water evaporation thus making the evaporation vapor contribution from land surface higher than in other arid regions by comparing the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation in the monsoon region and non monsoon region it is considered that the three component mixing model can be applied to inland river basins in the monsoon marginal zone it can also reasonably reflect the characteristics of water vapor cycle in this study area 4 4 model uncertainty analysis in this study area no xylem samples were collected due to the scarcity of vegetation at d and m4 station therefore the xylem water isotope values at these stations were replaced by the isotope values of precipitation and surface water available to plants which results in uncertainty in estimating the transpiration vapor isotope values and the surface water isotope values of d station were also replaced by precipitation isotope values resulting in uncertainty in the estimation of surface evaporation vapor isotope values the uncertainty caused by the above assumptions has been analyzed by wang et al 2016 his research shows that when the δ 18o value is greater than 10 the contribution fractions of the three vapors are not very sensitive to the xylem water isotope and to the changes of the surface water isotope values in the study area the water vapor source and the water vapor migration trajectory caused uncertainty in the estimation of upwind water vapor isotope values at each station as shown in the distribution of the backward trajectory in fig 3 from april to october shiyang river basin has the dominant water vapor transportation from west wind to monsoon and then to west wind the trajectory of water vapor transport in small scale is complex by clustering the water vapor transported to the shiyang river basin fig 3 it is found that the trajectory of water vapor transport is generally from downstream to upstream however in the shiyang river basin the upstream mountain region is the main occurrence area of precipitation and the runoff formation area and then the mountain regions may also form water vapor sources which may also be transported to the middle and lower reaches without considering other uncertainties as shown in fig 8 although there are differences between the results calculated from the trajectory of water vapor transport in mountain oasis desert regions and those calculated in the opposite direction the results basically show that the contribution of recycled moisture in mountain and desert regions is small while that in oasis regions is large 5 conclusions the contribution of plant transpiration land surface evaporation and advected vapor to precipitation was assessed during the growing season in the mountain oasis and desert regions of an inland river basin in the monsoon marginal zone the advected vapor contribution was always dominant but recycled moisture from plant transpiration and land surface evaporation cannot be ignored in the local water vapor cycle processes the contribution of plant transpiration and surface evaporation vapor is similar in time variation and has high consistency with the change of temperature overall the recycled moisture contribution increases during april to july and decreases during august to october the contribution of crop transpiration vapor in oasis region is always greater than that in desert and mountain region the contribution of average plant transpiration vapor in each station is always greater than that of surface evaporation vapor in the mountain regions the contribution of recycled moisture increased with the decreasing of the elevation the average contribution of plant transpiration land surface evaporation and advected vapor was 11 6 and 83 respectively the contribution of surface evaporation vapor in the xiying m1 station near the xiying reservoir was 9 accounting for 38 of the recycled moisture which is the station with the largest contribution to surface evaporation in the study area in the oasis region the contribution of recycled moisture is the largest mainly from plant transpiration the average contribution from plant transpiration land surface evaporation and advected vapor was 21 7 and 72 respectively the recycled moisture contributions for wuwei oasis is up to 30 and the plant transpiration vapor accounts for 73 desert region recycled moisture contribution is relatively low the average contribution from plant transpiration land surface evaporation and advected vapor was 10 5 and 85 respectively the evident high contribution of plant transpiration vapor in oasis region indicates that the rational development of artificial oasis in inland river basin with shortage of water resources is very

6768,the hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of precipitation and water vapor are useful tracers in the water cycle the water balance of inland river basins located in the monsoon marginal zone are difficult to determine because little is known about the contribution of various vapor involved based on the three component isotopic mixing model the monthly precipitation surface water and plant water isotope data of the seven sampling stations from april to october 2017 were used to assess the vapor contribution to precipitation in the shiyang river basin the average contribution of plant transpiration land surface evaporation and advected vapor to precipitation accounted for 11 6 and 83 in the mountain regions for 21 7 and 72 in the oasis regions and for 10 5 and 85 in the desert regions respectively the contribution of plant transpiration and surface evaporation vapor was similar in time variation and the maximum value appeared in july the average plant transpiration vapor contribution at each station was always greater than the surface evaporation vapor different landscape and special underlying surfaces are important factors influencing the difference in water vapor contribution the average surface evaporation water vapor contribution of the xiying m1 station is the largest in the study area with a contribution fraction of 9 the contribution of wuwei oasis recycled moisture can reach 30 the plant transpiration vapor accounted for 73 keywords stable isotope recycled moisture three component isotopic mixing model monsoon marginal zone 1 introduction in recent decades stable isotopes have been widely used in the fields of hydrology and ecology fontes et al 1986 longinelli et al 2008 sprenger et al 2016 ala aho et al 2018 one of the most important uses is to determine the proportion of different sources in the mixture phillips and gregg 2001 for example to distinguish the sources of plants water use and animal food li et al 2007 oelze et al 2011 evaristo and mcdonnell 2017 discrimination of carbon sources in soil zheng and wang 2009 glenn et al 2011 and estimation of the contribution of different water vapor sources to precipitation clark and fritz 1997 peng et al 2011 precipitation vapor is a mixture of recycled moisture and advected vapor the recycled moisture also includes the vapor contribution of evaporation from surface water bodies marine lake river and soil water and plant transpiration trenberth 1999 van der ent et al 2010 rios entenza et al 2014 recycled moisture plays an important role in the local water cycle and is a key part of the atmospheric water vapor balance in some areas litschi 2006 aemisegger et al 2014 precipitation hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition can be used to deduce the proportion of plant transpiration vapor land surface evaporation vapor and advected vapor clark and fritz 1997 genereux 1998 xu et al 2008 therefore in the study of water isotopes many studies have focused on the application of craig gordon water evaporation model isotope mixing model and isotope distillation model to evaluate the contribution of recycled moisture and advected vapor to precipitation according to the relative magnitude of the flux such as surface evaporation and plant transpiration the isotope mixing model can be divided into two element model and three element model from the model hypothesis the two element mixture model generally focuses on the contribution of land surface evaporation to precipitation froehlich et al 2008 kong et al 2013 but it ignores the contribution of plant transpiration vapor the three element mixture model can distinguish the relative contribution of plant transpiration vapor land surface evaporation vapor and advected vapor to precipitation peng et al 2011 and has been applied in previous studies peng et al 2011 wang et al 2016 these studies have quantified the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation in china s pure monsoon region and arid region but the understanding of interlaced zone between monsoon region and arid region is still unclear some scholars also have estimated the evaporation loss of open water bodies horita et al 2008 gibson and reid 2010 skrzypek et al 2015 and its contribution to precipitation gat et al 2003 vallet coulomb et al 2008 xu et al 2011 however most of these studies have considered the contribution of single water from a single underlying surface to precipitation the contribution of water vapor to precipitation from different sources in different underlying areas needs further study the shiyang river basin is located in the monsoon marginal zone the water vapor cycle processes is extremely complex because the climate is controlled by different atmospheric circulation patterns zhang et al 2008 however with traditional meteorological and hydrological methods it is difficult to understand the specific process of the water vapor cycle making most of the research limited to the source of advected vapor and its transport pang et al 2005 wu et al 2011 li et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 although seasonal and spatial changes in water vapor contribution have previously been applied to this region li et al 2016 the contribution of mountains oases and deserts as separate systems were not considered as a typical inland river basin in the monsoon marginal zone the shiyang river basin provides a feasible case for this study because its complex underlying surface natural environment in view of this the specific purpose of our study is to compare the relative contribution of plant transpiration land surface evaporation and advected vapor to precipitation in different landscape area in order to further clarify the mechanism of water vapor cycle and the distribution of water vapor resources in inland river basins 2 date and method 2 1 study area the shiyang river basin is located on the northern slope of the qilian mountains and the lower reaches are located between the tengger desert and the badain jaran desert fig 1 it is located in the transition zone of the three climatic regions in the eastern monsoon region the northwest arid region and the qinghai tibet plateau region the climate is controlled by several atmospheric circulation patterns such as the westerly wind belt the eastern monsoon and the plateau monsoon zhang et al 2008 the upper reaches of the shiyang river basin are a mountainous area and the middle and lower reaches have been developed into an oasis agricultural region the end of the river extends into the desert and semi desert regions vegetation is mainly distributed in the area between 2000 m and 3600 m altitudes the area of the oasis regions is 7549 km2 in the middle and lower reaches accounting for 18 of the total basin area wen et al 2013 according to the water vapor transport situation there are monsoon water vapor transport from eastern china in the shiyang river basin from april to october 2017 after clustering of water vapors transported to the shiyang river basin it was found that the trajectory of water vapor movement always migrated from the southern desert regions through the oasis regions to the northern mountain regions figs 2 and 3 2 2 sampling and laboratory analysis the precipitation surface water and plant samples were collected at seven stations of the shiyang river basin from october 2016 to october 2017 the basic information of these seven sampling stations is shown in table 1 the nature environment at where the stations are located can be divided into three landscape units the mountain region the oasis region and the desert region there are four sampling stations in mountain region xiying m1 huajian m2 ningchan m3 and lenglong m4 two sampling stations in oasis region minqin o1 and wuwei o2 and one sampling station in desert region zhishazhan d fig 1 the precipitation samples were collected by plastic funnel bottle sets to prevent evaporation precipitation samples were collected immediately after each rainfall event and then transferred to a 50 ml hdpe sample bottle sample bottle mouth was sealed with waterproof tapes and stored frozen until experimental analysis surface water samples were collected from nearby rivers plant samples were collected from arbors shrubs and crops in different landscape zones of shiyang river basin we intercepted the xylem of the stems from the local dominant plants quickly peeled off the epidermis and sealed them into sample bottles and stored frozen the plant species and the samples number at each station are shown in table 1 surface water and plant samples were collected near the precipitation samples collection station within 500 m fig 1 the lake water samples come from qingtu lake the terminal lake of shiyang river basin qingtu lake can be divided into south lake and north lake there are two sampling point in south lake and one sampling points in north lake in total 21 lake water samples were collected from five sampling points in qingtu lake from april to october 2017 all samples were analyzed for δ 2h and δ 18o using the liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research usa at the stable isotope laboratory of northwest normal university the plant water was extracted with cryogenic vacuum distillation apparatus li 2100 lica united technology limited china for analysis every water sample and isotope standard sample was continuously injected six times to avoid the memory effect of isotope analysis the first two injections were discarded and the average value of the last four injections was used in the analyses the isotope analysis results are expressed by the symbol δ and relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow 1 δ sample r sample r v smow 1 1000 where r sample is the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in the samples and r standard is the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in v smow the precision is 0 6 for δ 2h and 0 2 for δ 18o fig 4 shows the monthly variation of stable isotope values at these stations during winter months from november to march the surface air temperature in arid areas of northwest china is usually low and evaporation from surface water and transpiration from plants are very limited shen et al 2010 therefore a total of 417 isotope data of precipitation surface water and xylem water from april to october 2017 were selected table 2 lists the monthly average values of precipitation surface water and xylem water isotope values at each station during the sampling period meteorological data such as temperature precipitation amount and relative humidity were

stationed in the shiyang river basin and they also assisted in sampling 2 3 three component mixing model it is assumed that the precipitation is a mixture of advected vapor and local recycled moisture brubaker et al 1993 van der ent et al 2010 the recycling fractions indicate the proportion of recycled moisture in precipitation 2 f re p tr p ev p tr p ev p adv where f re represents the proportion of recycled moisture in precipitation p tr p ev p adv are the precipitation from plant transpiration vapor surface evaporation vapor and advected vapor respectively therefore the water vapor recycling fractions can be calculated by the following equations 3 δ pv δ tr f tr δ ev f ev δ adv f adv 4 1 f tr f ev f adv where δ pv δ tr δ ev and δ adv are stable isotope compositions in precipitation vapor plant transpiration vapor land surface evaporation vapor and advected vapor respectively f tr f ev and f adv are the contribution fractions of plant transpiration vapor surface evaporation vapor and advected vapor to precipitation respectively which can be calculated by isoerror software ver 1 04 available at http www epa gov eco research phillips and gregg 2001 we use case b dual isotopes three

the lel equation obtained using the isotope data from the qingtu lake water was δ 2h 3 86δ 18o 19 88 r 2 0 994 p 0 0001 n 19 thus the actually observed slope of lel was 3 86 water is absorbed from the soil by plants and diffuses into the atmosphere through transpiration this process is assumed to not lead to any fractionation flanagan et al 1991 therefore δ tr can be replaced by xylem water isotope value δ x among the sampling stations in shiyang river basin m4 is located in alpine meadow zone the vegetation growing season is short and d is located in desert and semi desert area with almost no vegetation growing therefore δ tr is replaced by the water isotope values precipitation or surface water available to plants 11 δ tr δ x δ w the δ ev can be calculated by a simplified craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 machavaram et al 1995 gat 1996 peng et al 2011 the equation is as follows 12 δ ev δ s h δ adv ε 1 h where δ s is the isotope value of the surface water before evaporation and δ adv is the isotope value of the advected vapor δ adv can be calculated by the rayleigh distillation equation peng et al 2011 13 δ adv δ pv adv 10 3 α 1 ln f however along the trajectory of water vapor transport the isotope were not significantly depleted in some months fig 4 as suggested by peng et al 2011 the δ adv is calculated by eq 14 instead of rayleigh distillation equation eq 13 14 δ adv δ pv adv in the above eqs 13 and 14 δ pv adv is the precipitation vapor isotope value of the upwind station f is a ratio between final and initial vapor which is sometimes estimated using the atmospheric water content parameter peng et al 2011 studies have found that the precipitation amount in arid areas is positively correlated with the surface water vapor pressure hu et al 2015 so the f value is 0 8 in our study area which is defined by the ratio of the average land surface vapor pressure at the high elevation station mountain 9 1 hpa to the low elevation station oasis 7 2 hpa 3 results 3 1 sources of precipitation water vapor in the desert regions by clustering the water vapor sources transported to the shiyang river basin it was found that the trajectory of water vapor migration is always from the lower reaches to the upper reaches of the shiyang river basin that is from desert regions to oasis regions to mountain regions fig 3 therefore we first estimate the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation in desert regions d station the yinchuan observation station jing et al 2014 in the eastern of lower reaches of shiyang river basin was used as the upwind station of the d station and the water vapor was transported from yinchuan to the d station through the southeast monsoon path therefore in study area the monsoon transport water vapor passing through the yinchuan station is defined as the first stage of the advected vapor δ adv1 during the water vapor transport carried by the summer monsoon from coast to inland water vapor isotopes undergo distillation and was depleted this process can be simulated by the rayleigh distillation equation eq 13 however in some months during the process of water vapor transport from yinchuan to d station the isotope value was not significantly distillation due to the affection of isotope effect table 3 in these months the δ adv1 can be considered as the precipitation water vapor isotope value at yinchuan station δ pv1 eq 14 table 3 lists the calculated δ pv and δ adv of yinchuan and d stations in different months in the calculation of δ ev eq 12 δ s were replaced by local precipitation isotope values table 2 δ adv was δ adv1 or δ pv1 from yinchuan station the calculated δ ev are listed in table 3 because d station is located in desert and semi desert region there is almost no vegetation growth and vegetation samples are lacking so the δ tr in d station was also replaced by δ p eq 11 f tr f ev and f adv of desert regions in different months were calculated using isoerror software and above calculated δ tr δ ev and δ adv by calculation from april to october the range of f tr was 5 15 the average value was 10 the range of f ev was 2 12 the average value was 5 the range of f adv was 73 93 the average value was 85 in desert regions all calculation results are shown in table 3 and fig 5 a b and c show the monthly variations of f tr f ev and f adv in each region respectively 3 2 sources of precipitation water vapor in the oasis and mountain regions during water vapor transport passing through desert regions to the middle and upper reaches the water vapor first reaches oasis regions which is defined as the second stage of water vapor transport δ adv2 similar to desert regions procedure in some months when water vapor migrates from d station to o1 and o2 station the isotope were not significantly depleted so the δ adv of o1 and o2 sampling stations in oasis regions was δ adv2 or δ pv2 from d station in desert regions eq 13 or eq 14 when calculating δ ev eq 12 δ s takes the local river water isotope values at the each sampling stations table 2 δ adv was δ pv2 or δ adv2 from d station δ tr was replaced by the crops water isotope values at the oasis regions sampling station the calculated δ pv δ adv δ ev δ tr and f tr f ev f adv of o1 and o2 station are listed in table 3 by calculation from april to october the range of f tr was 14 26 the average value was 21 the range of f ev was 4 13 the average value was 7 the range of f adv was 61 82 the average value was 72 in oasis regions fig 5 in terms of local water vapor transport most of the water vapor in the mountain region comes from the oasis region in the north of shiyang river basin fig 3 which is defined as the third stage of water vapor transport δ adv3 there are four sampling stations in the small watershed of ningchan river in the mountain region similar to desert and oasis regions when calculating the δ ev of sampling stations in different months in mountain regions δ adv was the δ pv3 and δ adv3 from the oasis region and the upwind station at their respective stations δ s was the nearest river water isotope value to the sampling stations δ tr was replaced by arbors and shrubs xylem water isotope values in different vegetation zones eq 11 because m4 station is located in alpine meadow zone and the vegetation growing season is short the δ tr of each month was also replaced by the river water isotope value table 3 lists the calculated δ pv δ adv δ ev δ tr and f tr f ev f adv of the m1 m2 m3 and m4 stations in the mountain regions by calculation from april to october the range of f tr was 7 17 the average value was 11 the range of f ev was 3 11 the average value was 6 the range of f adv was 72 89 the average value was 83 in the mountain regions fig 5 as shown in fig 5a b c f tr and f ev increased from april to july and decreased from august to october this seasonal variation have high consistency with temperature changes table 2 in general there are relatively consistent of f tr and f ev changes in desert oasis and mountain regions but the change of f tr and f ev deserve further discussion due to the differences of regional environments at each station see the discussion section of this paper fig 5c shows the change of monthly average f tr and f ev for each sampling station fig 6 makes the calculation results of the three regions and the water cycle process in the shiyang river basin more visualized 4 discussion 4 1 effect of reservoir on recycled moisture the contribution of land surface evaporation vapor from each sampling stations in shiyang river basin ranged from 4 to 9 fig 5d and the largest contribution was 9 of m1 sampling stations in the mountain regions the contribution of plant transpiration vapor exhibits a similar spatial variation to the land surface evaporation vapor and the plant transpiration vapor contribution was 15 at m1 station therefore the contribution fraction of recycled moisture to precipitation was as high as 24 at m1 station which is larger than other sampling stations in mountain regions of shiyang river basin in particular land surface evaporation was most significant fig 5d some studies have shown that the evaporation contribution of large and open water bodies to precipitation can be high edwards 2002 bowen et al 2012 and will also increase the local water vapor recycling fraction located within 4 4 km to the m1 sampling station xiying reservoir is the largest artificial water body in the mountain regions the existence of the xiying reservoir in the study area may be the main reason for the sudden increase in the contribution of the recycled moisture in the m1 station to further analyze the reasons we compared the air temperature and relative humidity with f tr and f ev of each station in the shiyang river basin as shown in fig 7 the air temperature and relative humidity of each sampling station from upstream to downstream show a decreasing and rising trend respectively however this trend is reversed at the m1 station where temperature decreases slowly but relative humidity is obviously increased this further indicates that xiying reservoir may increase the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation some studies on lake evaporation losses and their contribution to precipitation also support this conclusion in summer the contribution of lake water evaporation from the great lakes of north america to atmospheric water vapor varies between 4 6 and 15 7 gat et al 2013 lake evaporation losses in the yinchuan plain also located in the monsoon marginal zone were generally greater than 25 reaching up to 42 8 qian et al 2013 the annual contribution rate of evaporation to precipitation in the qinghai lake basin was 23 42 cui and li 2015 the contribution of evaporation vapor from nam co lake to local atmospheric water vapor was about 28 4 31 1 xu et al 2011 therefore the influence of open water bodies located in arid areas on local recycled moisture and its contribution to precipitation cannot be ignored 4 2 influence of oasis effect on recycled moisture as shown in fig 5d the contribution of plant transpiration vapor at each sampling station in our study area was always greater than that of land surface evaporation vapor which is consistent with the research conclusions for other regions peng et al 2011 li et al 2016 wang et al 2016 previous studies combining results from 81 locations around the world show that plant transpiration vapor plays a major role in the water cycle on a global scale accounting for 61 of recycled moisture and contributing 39 to precipitation schlesinger and jasechko 2014 although oases in arid regions of northwest china account for only a small fraction of the land area 5 they are essential for 95 of the population and their agricultural activities lü et al 2004 it also has great significance for local precipitation and the local water vapor cycle wang et al 2016 used the isotopic signature of recycled moisture to show the oasis effect in arid central asia and demonstrate that water vapor recirculation in large oases is more pronounced than in small oases in our study area the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation from o2 station in wuwei oasis was 30 and the plant transpiration vapor accounts for 73 of the local recirculated moisture t et this value is lower than the average value 87 of the heihe river basin oasis which is the second largest inland river basin in northwest china wen et al 2015 according to previous studies this may be due to the decrease of surface water and groundwater which lead to the reduction of oasis area however other factors also need to be further explored 4 3 applicability of three component mixing model in the monsoon marginal zone similarly the three component isotopic mixing model has also been applied to the tianshan mountains of non monsoon region and the taiwan island of monsoon region in taiwan island the f tr varied between 29 and 41 and f ev varied between 1 and 2 peng et al 2011 in the tianshan mountains the f tr value varied between 2 8 and 10 3 the f ev ranged from 0 6 to 5 9 wang et al 2016 in essence our study area is located in the monsoon marginal zone which has the common characteristics of the monsoon region and non monsoon region the range of f tr in the study area is 8 22 which is between tianshan mountains and taiwan island the f ev is slightly larger than that of the tianshan mountains and much larger than that of taiwan island but it is close to the f ev in the whole western regions of china ma et al 2012 at the same time the study area is an inland river basin in the northwest of china the total surface water resource in the basin is 1552 million m3 ma 2018 which provides more possibilities for surface water evaporation thus making the evaporation vapor contribution from land surface higher than in other arid regions by comparing the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation in the monsoon region and non monsoon region it is considered that the three component mixing model can be applied to inland river basins in the monsoon marginal zone it can also reasonably reflect the characteristics of water vapor cycle in this study area 4 4 model uncertainty analysis in this study area no xylem samples were collected due to the scarcity of vegetation at d and m4 station therefore the xylem water isotope values at these stations were replaced by the isotope values of precipitation and surface water available to plants which results in uncertainty in estimating the transpiration vapor isotope values and the surface water isotope values of d station were also replaced by precipitation isotope values resulting in uncertainty in the estimation of surface evaporation vapor isotope values the uncertainty caused by the above assumptions has been analyzed by wang et al 2016 his research shows that when the δ 18o value is greater than 10 the contribution fractions of the three vapors are not very sensitive to the xylem water isotope and to the changes of the surface water isotope values in the study area the water vapor source and the water vapor migration trajectory caused uncertainty in the estimation of upwind water vapor isotope values at each station as shown in the distribution of the backward trajectory in fig 3 from april to october shiyang river basin has the dominant water vapor transportation from west wind to monsoon and then to west wind the trajectory of water vapor transport in small scale is complex by clustering the water vapor transported to the shiyang river basin fig 3 it is found that the trajectory of water vapor transport is generally from downstream to upstream however in the shiyang river basin the upstream mountain region is the main occurrence area of precipitation and the runoff formation area and then the mountain regions may also form water vapor sources which may also be transported to the middle and lower reaches without considering other uncertainties as shown in fig 8 although there are differences between the results calculated from the trajectory of water vapor transport in mountain oasis desert regions and those calculated in the opposite direction the results basically show that the contribution of recycled moisture in mountain and desert regions is small while that in oasis regions is large 5 conclusions the contribution of plant transpiration land surface evaporation and advected vapor to precipitation was assessed during the growing season in the mountain oasis and desert regions of an inland river basin in the monsoon marginal zone the advected vapor contribution was always dominant but recycled moisture from plant transpiration and land surface evaporation cannot be ignored in the local water vapor cycle processes the contribution of plant transpiration and surface evaporation vapor is similar in time variation and has high consistency with the change of temperature overall the recycled moisture contribution increases during april to july and decreases during august to october the contribution of crop transpiration vapor in oasis region is always greater than that in desert and mountain region the contribution of average plant transpiration vapor in each station is always greater than that of surface evaporation vapor in the mountain regions the contribution of recycled moisture increased with the decreasing of the elevation the average contribution of plant transpiration land surface evaporation and advected vapor was 11 6 and 83 respectively the contribution of surface evaporation vapor in the xiying m1 station near the xiying reservoir was 9 accounting for 38 of the recycled moisture which is the station with the largest contribution to surface evaporation in the study area in the oasis region the contribution of recycled moisture is the largest mainly from plant transpiration the average contribution from plant transpiration land surface evaporation and advected vapor was 21 7 and 72 respectively the recycled moisture contributions for wuwei oasis is up to 30 and the plant transpiration vapor accounts for 73 desert region recycled moisture contribution is relatively low the average contribution from plant transpiration land surface evaporation and advected vapor was 10 5 and 85 respectively the evident high contribution of plant transpiration vapor in oasis region indicates that the rational development of artificial oasis in inland river basin with shortage of water resources is very

6769,the cosmic ray neutron probe crnp is a new tool for continuously monitoring mean soil water content swc on a hectometer scale but the performance of crnps in highly heterogeneous distributions of swc vegetation and especially soil texture caused by the broken surface on the loess plateau in china remains uncertain the study evaluated the application and accuracy of the method for three soil textures in a small watershed on the plateau to provide a reference and scientific basis for its application three crnps were installed in a loamy sand hills lsh plot a silty loam dam sld plot and a sandy loam slope sls plot soil moisture sensors were buried at various depths in three plots the footprints of the crnps for swc observation had radii of 127 170 126 174 and 148 174 m in sld sls and lsh respectively and the mean measuring depth was about 20 cm for sld and sls and 40 cm for lsh based on general calculation equations the accuracy of the crnp method was high when validated using oven dried method rmse 0 068 cm3 cm 3 the mean swcs estimated from the other types of sensors were consistent with the mean swcs from the crnp probes in the three plots the coefficient of determination of the linear relationship was in the order sls lsh sld the coefficient of variations cv were higher in lsh than sld and sls indicating that swc varied most in lsh during periods of rain the variations were larger for sld than sls and lsh with a cv of 32 2 the crnp for sld had the highest rates of change during periods with and without rain for both increasing and decreasing swc but this plot held more water than lsh and sls consistent with the high clay and organic matter contents in sld the rates of change were significantly correlated with the antecedent swcs p 0 01 and the higher the antecedent swc the faster the rate of change for each plot this study verified the application of the crnp for monitoring field average swc of the broken surface on the loess plateau and represents a new approach for the study of the spatial distribution of swc on the plateau crnp can measure swc of the complex underlying surface accurately so as to provide a more reliable assessment of the impacts of landscapes and vegetation changes such as conversion of cropland to forest and grassland on the loess plateau on water resources keywords crnp swc soil texture loess plateau 1 introduction soil water is a principal component of earth s water and sustains the survival and reproduction of terrestrial life and the stable development of terrestrial ecological systems ground based measurements of soil water content swc are used in a wide variety of applications including agriculture hydrology hydrological modelling meteorology and the calibration of algorithms for obtaining soil moisture information by satellite swc influences regional hydrometeorology by redistributing precipitation into deep soil and runoff and controls the exchange of energy between the soil and the atmosphere by evaporation jia and shao 2013 accurate observation of swc can improve the accuracy of meteorological and climatic prediction prevent various disasters such as drought soil and water erosion and improve the efficiency of management of agricultural water rosolem et al 2014 swc can be measured by many methods such as oven drying neutron probes time domain reflectometry and frequency domain reflectometry vereecken et al 2014 all these methods are point measurements with small measuring scales and insufficient spatial representativeness on the other hand remote sensing methods can monitor swc at large scales but with shallow penetration depths that may be influenced by topography and vegetation sensing neutrons generated by cosmic rays which is an automatic and nondestructive method for measuring swc has been rapidly adopted since the 1980s andreasen et al 2017 cosmic rays are common throughout the universe and enter the atmosphere after penetrating earth s magnetic field primary cosmic rays interact with the atmosphere producing fast neutrons that can penetrate the soil and be moderated by interacting with hydrogen atoms which mainly exist in soil water zreda et al 2008 hydrogen atoms are several fold more efficient than atoms of the next most efficient element carbon at moderating fast neutrons desilets et al 2010 thus the intensity of moderated neutrons is negatively correlated with swc which is the basis for crnp measuring swc zreda et al 2008 indicating crnp could measure swc without the effects of soil salt cosmic ray neutron probes count the moderated neutrons near ground level zreda et al 2012 the footprint of the crnp is defined as the region containing 86 of the detected neutrons vertically and horizontally so the radius r of a crnp is calculated to be 130 240 m köhli et al 2015 at sea level atmospheric pressure of 1013 kpa and is mainly influenced by air pressure humidity swc and biomass the measuring depth was estimated to be from about 15 cm saturated soil to 83 cm dry soil by köhli et al 2015 crnp can therefore continuously measure the field average swc for an irregular hemisphere of soil because the measuring depth would decrease as the distance to the crnp increased köhli et al 2015 a hectometer scale can be a bridge between point soil moisture observations and remotely sensed images the principle and application of crnp has been widely studied in recent years several methods are available for estimating swc from measured neutron intensity the n0 method desilets et al 2010 the hydrogen molar fraction method franz et al 2013 and the cosmic operator method shuttleworth et al 2013 are calibrated using the monte carlo neutron particle extended mcnpx radiation transport code all three methods were validated by baatz et al 2014 and performed similarly well the n0 method is used most widely because it is the simplest for estimating swc since it just needs one parameter desilets et al 2010 fitted the neutron flux obtained from the mcnpx radiation transport code to derive a widely used equation for calibrating swc and reported the values of the parameters in the equation desilets and zreda 2013 proposed that r was mainly affected by the properties of the atmosphere and had a weak relationship with swc köhli et al 2015 proposed an improved method to estimate the measuring depth and radius of crnp zreda et al 2012 provided a better basis of the wider application of crnp by systematically explaining the principle calculations influencing factors calibration and application of the crnp the analysis and correction of the effects of air pressure water vapor solar activity and vegetation water content on the crnp have been studied desilets and zreda 2001 rosolem et al 2013 baatz et al 2015 köhli et al 2015 and the accuracy of the crnp was improved several methods can correct for the effects of vegetation water content but require further study franz et al 2016 baatz et al 2015 coopersmith et al 2014 baroni and oswald 2015 the crnp was developed on a solid theoretical foundation and its application is growing zreda et al 2012 having been applied in a variety of ecosystems such as forest heidbüchel et al 2016 farmland han et al 2014 and grassland peterson et al 2016 under different climatic conditions schattan et al 2017 crnp networks have been installed in the usa zreda et al 2012 australia hawdon et al 2014 germany baatz et al 2014 africa and england rosolem et al 2014 these studies have built the foundation for the application of the crnp method villarreyes et al 2011 bogena et al 2013 han et al 2014 evans et al 2016 found differences in swc between sites with similar weather but different soil types and land covers using crnps and the vegetation reduced the accuracy of crnp many studies have confirmed the performance of crnp and new methods have been proposed to correct the footprint and improve the accuracy köhli et al 2015 schrön et al 2017 these obtained high accuracies but most were performed on flat terrain and only a few were performed on uneven terrain the performance of the crnp on the loess plateau in china with highly heterogeneous distributions of swc vegetation and soil texture caused by the broken surface however remains uncertain the topography of the plateau is also complex thus obtaining accurate measurements of swc on a large scale with numerous eroded gullies is difficult besides the vegetation distribution and landscape of the loess plateau have changed greatly since the implementation of the project of conversion of cropland to forest and grassland which improved the ecological environment curbed serious soil and water erosion but increased the water consumption of vegetation even caused some negative effects such as soil desiccation wang et al 2011 therefore it is very important to study the interaction between the spatio temporal variation of swc and vegetation restoration on the loess plateau the purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and of the crnp at a site with three land use types with different soil textures and to provide basis for the sustainable utilization of soil moisture and the rational selection of vegetation on the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was carried out at the erosion and environmental station of northwest a f university in the liudaogou watershed shaanxi province china 38 62 n 110 35 e from 22 april to 15 october 2016 and from 15 april to 15 october 2017 fig 1 the average elevation is 1181 m a s l the study area has a continental monsoon climate with dry winters and springs and wet summers and autumns for 1857 to 1989 the multi year mean temperature and precipitation are 8 4 c and 437 mm respectively and the multi year mean solar radiation was 5922 mj m 2 the rainy season is between july and september during which approximately 80 of the total annual rainfall occurs tang et al 1993 the growing season is from the end of april to mid october and senescence occurs in mid september but rapid growth begins in mid june the interaction between wind and water erosion in this area has formed a unique water wind erosion interlaced region zhu and shao 2008 three plots were established a loamy sand hill plot lsh a silty loam dam plot sld and a sandy loam slope plot sls the three plots were in one small watershed with an area of 8 9 km2 so they had the same precipitation lsh was covered with caragana korshinskii kom artemisia and approximately 70 poplar trees with a mean diameter at breast height of 10 3 cm and a mean height of 5 2 m sld had loessial soil and was covered with artemisia zea mays l and a few populus simonii carr and salix matsudana koidz trees this area had been formed by the deposition of sediment from a catchment controlled by a small check dam sls had loessial soil and was covered with medicago sativa l stipa bungeana and a small amount of glycine max l merr the gradient of the slope was approximately 15 the dry aboveground biomasses of the main vegetation are shown in table 1 the soil mechanical compositions and textures of the three plots are shown in table 2 the constant head method was used to measure saturated hydraulic conductivity twenty undisturbed soil cores 100 cm3 were collected in each plot by excavating a soil pit with 10 samples collected at depths of 10 and 20 cm each sandy soil is the main textural type in lsh which was formed mainly by wind erosion and accumulation li et al 2005 the eroded sediments in sld were dominantly influenced by the erodibility of the original soil zhao et al 2009 loessial soil is the main soil type in sls which was formed by water and wind erosion and maturation of the loessial parental material and is widely distributed in areas with strong soil erosion on the loess plateau lin 1983 swc was measured in august 2017 by the tektronix 1502c tektronix inc beaverton usa by grid sampling with the crnp as the center and the density is 10 10 m to show the spatial distribution of swc the amount of the measuring samples were 211 137 and 191 for lsh sld and sls respectively fig 2 showed the spatial distribution of swc of three plots the standard deviations and coefficients of variation of swc were 0 024 cm3 cm 3 and 18 6 0 034 cm3 cm 3 and 13 6 and 0 048 cm3 cm 3 and 24 6 for lsh sld and sls respectively 2 2 the crnp a crnp was installed in the center of each plot fig 1 its main component was a moderated fast neutron probe which was filled with he 3 and was produced by probe science and technology ltd beijing china probe technology 2015 the probe was installed 50 cm above the ground fixed to a steel tube a meteorological station was installed with the crnp to measure air temperature humidity and precipitation a datalogger was used to store the data at intervals of 1 h the positions of the crnps were 38 79698 n 110 35963 e in lsh 38 79457 n 110 36480 e in sld and 38 79455 n 110 36172 e in sls the linear distance is 375 291 and 572 m between lsh and sls lsh and sld sld and lsh respectively the distances were measured by google earth the crnps became operational on 22 april 2016 the data were collected from 22 april 2016 to 15 october 2017 but tdr or fdr sensors were disturbed by air temperature which measure dielectric constant of soil water to calculate the swc but temperatures in winter are below 0 c and the dielectric constant of water 81 0 is very different from that of ice 3 2 so the swc during this period is not accurate for those reasons data of period of 16 october 2016 to 14 april 2017 was removed only the data for 22 april to 15 october 2016 and 15 april to 15 october 2017 were analyzed 2 2 1 horizontal and vertical footprints of the crnp köhli et al 2015 proposed that measuring depth would decrease as the distance to the crnp increased and that hydrogen pools such as vegetation would decrease the measuring depth because they would increase the amount of hydrogen on the surface thus measuring depth would be more like an irregular hemisphere a recent study reported r between 130 and 240 m and proposed an equation for calculating r köhli et al 2015 1 r f p f veg θ r 86 h θ where r is the radius of crnp fp is a factor for the influence of air pressure see köhli et al 2015 eq 5 fveg θ is a factor for the influence of vegetation which depends on swc and modeled above ground vegetation as a layer of height see köhli et al 2015 eq 4 r 86 h θ is the radius without calculations for air pressure and vegetation see köhli et al 2015 eqs 2 3 and fig 6 h is the absolute humidity g m 3 and θ is swc m3 m 3 d cm is defined as the depth at which 86 of the neutrons are detected negatively correlated with swc and depends little on other soil properties franz et al 2012 but bogena et al 2013 proposed that d was also affected by other hydrogen pools such as soil organic matter lattice water and roots the more water the soil contains the more of the fast neutrons will be slowed and fewer fast neutrons will reach deeper soil hence d will be shallower franz et al 2012 d was calculated as köhli et al 2015 2 d ρ bd 1 p 0 p 1 p 2 e r 100 p 3 θ p 4 θ where d cm is the measuring depth of crnp ρbd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 r is the radial distance from the crnp m pi is a numerical parameter with values of 8 321 0 142 0 967 26 42 and 0 057 for p 0 to p 4 respectively köhli et al 2015 and θ is swc m3 m 3 2 2 2 calibration of neutron intensity and the crnp air pressure varies with meteorological conditions and latitude which affects the amount of atmospheric shielding changes in near ground cosmic ray neutron intensity are inversely proportional to changes in local air pressure which is a good proxy for mass shielding air pressure was corrected for latitude and altitude using desilets and zreda 2001 3 n p n raw exp p s 0 p s l where nraw is the count of original density of the moderated fast neutrons ps is the measured air pressure kpa ps 0 is the standard air pressure 1013 kpa and l is the mass attenuation length for high energy neutrons g cm 2 varying from 128 g cm 2 at high latitudes to 142 g cm 2 near the equator zreda et al 2012 a value of 136 g cm 2 was used for l at our study site desilets and zreda 2013 atmospheric water vapor content varies with meteorological parameters such as air temperature so the number of hydrogen atoms in the water vapor will affect the accuracy of the crnp results the correction formula is rosolem et al 2013 4 n pw n p 1 0 0054 ρ ρ 0 where npw is the neutron flux corrected for water vapor and air pressure ρ is the absolute vapor density g m 3 at the experimental site and ρ 0 is the reference vapor density generally set to 0 g m 3 solar activity can strongly influence the intensity of incoming neutrons on a timescale of months and even occasionally on a timescale of a few days thus the variations in the incoming neutron intensity accordingly need to be removed the intensity correction factor fi zreda et al 2012 should be used to correct the neutron count and the final equation is 5 n n p w f i n p w n a n m where n is the final neutron count nm is the measured neutron monitor intensity at a given time and na is the average neutron intensity during the period of measurement the background intensity based on data collected at the jungfraujoch neutron monitoring station are available from the neutron monitoring database http cosray unibe ch the corrected neutron flux is negatively and nonlinearly proportional to swc the shape defining function developed by desilets et al 2010 is widely used to determine θcrnp cm3 cm 3 6 θ crnp a 0 n n 0 a 1 a 2 ρ bd where n is the corrected neutron flux n0 is the neutron flux in dry soil under the same reference condition obtained from the measured swc in the footprint and parameters a0 0 0808 a1 0 372 and a2 0 115 are dimensionless desilets et al 2010 note that θcrnp calculated from eq 6 includes soil water lattice water soil organic matter and vegetation which contain hydrogen and can moderate fast neutrons zreda et al 2012 conversion from gravimetric to volumetric water content using measured soil density in eq 6 is also needed because neutron counts are directly converted to gravimetric water content using the n0 method 2 2 3 soil samples for calibration calibration points at 25 and 75 m every 60 around the crnps were marked with a yellow plastic stick in each plot disturbed soil samples were collected at depths of 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 cm and undisturbed soil cores 100 cm3 were collected by excavating a soil pit and sampling at depths of 10 20 and 30 cm at each point hence the volumetric swc of the samples could be used to calculate n0 swcs measured on 27 june 23 july 5 october 2016 and 6 may 2017 by oven drying were used to calculate n 0 for each plot using eq 6 as recommended by köhli et al 2015 72 samples were collected from each plot at each sampling event swcs measured by oven drying were weight averaged for calibrating the crnp as 1 vertically weight averaged 7 w d r θ e 2 d d where d is the depth of soil layer and d is the measuring depth in the

the final weight averaged swc θ was then used to calculate n0 9 θ i w i θ i i w i 2 3 swc sensors five ec 5 meter group inc pullman usa soil moisture sensors were buried at depths of 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm in lsh five gs 1 meter group inc pullman usa sensors were buried at depths of 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm in 2016 and five ec 5 sensors were buried at depths of 5 10 20 30 and 50 cm in 2017 in sld nine sdi 12 sensors for time domain transmissometry tdt acclima inc meridian usa were installed at a depth of 5 cm and 9 of the same sensors were installed at a depth of 15 cm in sls the sensors and their distributions are listed in table 3 the sensors in this study are based on time domain reflection and the time interval for data collection was the same as for crnp 1 h all sensors were installed into undisturbed soil profiles by digging to the depth required and installing the sensor horizontally the tdt sensors in sls were installed in 2012 the gs1 sensors in sld were installed in 2016 and the ec 5 sensors in sld and lsh were installed in 2017 and 2016 respectively the sensors were calibrated by using swc values obtained by oven drying method performed on 5 october 2016 the swcs measured by these sensors were weight averaged by the method proposed by köhli et al 2015 see section 2 2 3 3 results 3 1 field swc and calculating n 0 n 0 and the root mean square errors rmses between the swcs estimated from n 0 calculated from each sampling time and the oven dried swcs are presented in table 4 table 5 shows the deviation between the oven dried swc and the crnp swc estimated from each calibration sample an experiment in a region dominated by a heterogenous monsoon climate nguyen et al 2017 suggested that n 0 is influenced by soil wetness conditions of calibration and that calibration was more accurate under dry rmse 0 035 m3 m 3 than wet conditions rmse 0 049 m3 m 3 due to the fewer hydrogen pools in our experiment however the calibration sampling on 23 july 2016 which had higher swcs than the other samplings had the lowest rmse indicating that the swc estimated from n 0 calculated from this sampling was more consistent with the true swc which may due to the effect of vegetation the biomass was not measured because of the uneven distribution of the vegetation and the complex terrain and n 0 calculated from other samplings may not represent hydrogen pools thus n 0 calculated from the sampling on 23 july 2016 was selected for estimating swc for which the biomass was well representative of the average conditions of the monitoring period baroni and oswald 2015 the rmses were in the order sls lsh sld bogena et al 2013 reported that swc at a wet forest site was a relatively small contributor to the total hydrogen pool and that the rmse was higher than that for a soil moisture network installed within the crnp footprint the rmse between the crnps and the sensors measuring swc can be lower when biomass water is eliminated from crnp measurements tian et al 2016 coopersmith et al 2014 sld had the highest vegetation coverage thus the high rmse for the crnp in sld may have been due to biomass water and the hydrogen in the vegetation tissues the swcs estimated from the crnps using n0 calculated from swc measured on 23 july 2016 were significantly correlated with the swcs measured by oven drying p 0 01 total rmse was 0 0675 cm3 cm 3 and the rmses for lsh sld and sls were 0 051 0 030 and 0 100 cm3 cm 3 respectively indicating that the crnp could accurately measure mean swc fig 3 rmse was higher in sls than the other plots due to artificial rain experiments which is performed by other researchers and no swc sensors in there and the distance between it and crnp is about 80 m so swc was much higher in this area than the surrounding area leading to the high rmse but having little effect on the regional average swc due to its small area sld and lsh received almost no human interference and the vegetation coverage was more uniform in sld than lsh fig 1 leading to the lower rmse in sld than lsh the raw data and 24 h moving averaged swcs measured by the crnps for the three plots is shown in fig 4 for the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons along with the measured daily precipitation the three plots were in one small watershed so precipitation was the same the differences in swc between the plots were thus due to the different soil textures terrains and water consumption by vegetation the corrected swc obtained from the crnp probes had a similar pattern of changes over time but were delayed briefly especially when the swcs were decreasing perhaps due to the differences of three plots between soil textures saturated hydraulic conductivities and antecedent swcs lead to the water moved at different speed in soil swc was high in july and august in both 2016 and 2017 corresponding to the high rainfall in these months the low rainfall from april to june in 2016 and 2017 caused the low swcs the crnp swcs of all three plots were 0 2 cm3 cm 3 the precipitation increased rapidly in july and august and swc increased sharply the swcs for sld were oversaturated θs 0 41 cm3 cm 3 numerically equals to soil porosity on 22 july 13 to 24 august and 17 and 25 september 2016 and 22 july to 1 august 22 to 27 august and 26 september to 15 october 2017 during periods of rain swc estimated from crnp consisted of all hydrogen pools in the footprint including soil water and biomass water but crnp overestimated swc when water was ponded on the surface because the water increased the hydrogen pools but did not infiltrate into soil to increase swc most swc peaks correlate well with rainfall events except the swc peaks at 16 april and 6 may 2017 which was found the swc measured by other sensors did not increase at that day that may be caused by solar storms during april 2017 according to the reports http www spaceweather com lsh had the highest saturated hydraulic conductivity thus water quickly infiltrated to a depth beyond the range of the probes and sensors leading to the lowest swc in lsh sld during this period however collected runoff from the surrounding area because its landscape is low in the middle and high on all sides and held water due to the influence of the lowest saturated hydraulic conductivity sls produced runoff infiltration excess surface runoff and soil and water erosion thus water flowed out and swc was higher for sld than sls the surface soil in sls was compacted and the deep soil was looser because the roots of the dominant species alfalfa loosens deep soil even though the regional average saturated hydraulic conductivity was high leading to excessive surface runoff when the rain was heavy 3 2 footprint of the crnp vegetation was not considered in this study because of its heterogeneous distribution and r ranged from 148 to 174 m 127 to 170 m and 126 to 174 m for lsh sld and sls respectively the maximum measuring depths of crnp were 68 5 37 0 and 51 4 cm in 2016 and 59 8 25 9 and 45 1 cm in 2017 for lsh sld and sls respectively fig 5 precipitation in our study was relatively uniform in july and august which produced relatively stable levels of soil water sld held more water than the other plots and had shallowest measuring depth because it had the lowest saturated hydraulic conductivity and the highest field capacity lsh was opposite to sld lsh had the lowest swc and the deepest measuring depth bogena et al 2013 also found that the crnp reduced the effective measuring depth up to 50 during dry periods due to the amounts of lattice water organic matter and belowground biomass the relationship between measuring depth and rainfall indicated that swc estimated from the crnp was sensitive to rainfall in this area 3 3 comparisons of swcs from the crnp probes and the other sensors all swc sensors were calibrated against measurements from oven drying method so as to eliminate the errors due to different sources of measurements figs 6 and 7 show the temporal variation and comparisons of swcs from the crnp probes and the mean swcs of the other sensors for the 0 20 cm layer in the three plots in 2016 and 2017 the swc cvs were higher for the crnp probes than the other sensors in the three plots table 6 and the cvs of crnp and sensors were highest for lsh indicating that the crnps were more sensitive and that swc was most variable in lsh perhaps due to the terrain the effects of the water content of the vegetation canopy interception and the differences between a point measurement ec 5 and a mid scale measurement crnp the soil was most porous had more macropores and the saturated hydraulic conductivity was highest for lsh thus water moved quickly into the soil after periods of rain the linear relationship between the crnp swc and swc of buried sensors in 2016 was poorer for sld than the other plots because the gs1 sensors were near trees fig 6 thus some of the rain would have been intercepted which may account for the low sensitivity of the sensors to precipitation five ec 5 sensors were installed in 2017 at depths of 5 10 20 30 and 50 cm near the crnp probe covered with alfalfa in sld because the alfalfa intercepted much less precipitation than the trees considering the dominant species of sld are herbage and there are few trees the swc measured in 2017 is more representative thus r 2 was higher between the crnp and buried sensors swcs than between crnp and buried sensors in 2016 r 2 between crnp swc and the average swc of buried sensors was highest for sls perhaps due to the more uniform distribution of vegetation in sls than the other plots and had nine profiles of swc sensors which could represent the regional swc the swc trends of the plots following the crnp could be verified even though different sensors were used and the calibration of the sensors also minimized the effects of the different types of sensors 3 4 effect of soil texture on the variability of swc fig 8 shows the daily variations of the swcs estimated from the crnps and the other sensors in the three plots the daily variations of crnp swc were significantly correlated with swc measured by the buried sensors in 2017 the correlation was strongest for lsh with a correlation coefficient of 0 532 which may have been due to the lower vegetation coverage in lsh than the other plots the maximum daily variations of crnp swcs in 2016 and 2017 were in the order sld sls lsh the maximum variations of the buried sensors were in the orders sls lsh sld in 2016 and lsh sld sls in 2017 the gs1 sensors were near trees in sld in 2016 so some of the precipitation would have been intercepted and the ec 5 sensors were installed near the crnp in 2017 which may have contributed to the differences in the maximum variations daily variation in 2016 was highest for the crnp in sld 0 18 cm3 cm 3 on 8 july when the rainfall 124 mm was heaviest the average variations of crnp swc for the three plots for 8 to 11 july 2016 were selected which was the heaviest rain with a total rainfall of 207 7 mm producing the largest variation of swc in 2016 the swc variation was large but the trend was consistent in the three plots the cv of crnp swc in sld during this period was 32 2 larger than in lsh and sls the rates of change of swc obtained from the crnps were in the order sld 0 042 cm3 cm 3 d 1 sls 0 030 cm3 cm 3 d 1 lsh 0 017 cm3 cm 3 d 1 the rates of increase in crnp swc were thus in the order sld sls lsh the saturated hydraulic conductivity was higher for lsh than the other plots and was limited by the measuring depth of the crnp resulted in the rate of increase in swc was lowest for lsh in addition to the effect of saturated hydraulic conductivity canopy interception would slow the infiltration of water and thereby increase the surface swc therefore the rate of increase was highest for sld the subsequent rates of change of swc obtained from the crnp for the dry period on 12 and 13 july were in the order sld 0 0187 cm3 cm 3 d 1 lsh sls 0 010 cm3 cm 3 d 1 the rate of decrease was highest for sld considering its rate of increase but sld could hold more water than the other plots this result is consistent with the clay and organic matter contents of the three plots table 3 and consistent with the study by lv et al 2014 in which swc at locations with higher clay contents was significantly higher over time 4 discussion in this study the calibration of 3 crnps were performed 4 times for every calibration 72 samples were taken around the crnp in different distances and different depths and were weighted average followed köhli et al 2015 then the calibration with lowest rmse was selected to calculate n0 which ensures the n0 is the most representative in space and time this study did not measure biomass so n 0 calculated from the calibration at 23 july 2016 when its biomass was well representative of the average conditions of the monitoring period baroni and oswald 2015 which may lead to errors of swc early and late in the monitoring period because the biomass was not correct a study in an agricultural landscape with high clay content found that multiple and dynamic calibration could reduce the error between the crnp probes and the tdt sensors franz et al 2016 in this study the non uniform spatial distribution of swc and texture may also have contributed to the high rmse in sld which needs further investigation the water in lsh moved due to the uneven terrain leading to the heterogeneous distribution of soil water fig 2 c korshinskii which has an extremely high demand for water and can desiccate the soil was distributed sporadically in lsh na et al 2013 lsh also had a wide range of biological crusts the effects of which require more study crnp can be sensitive to the variability of swc where soil texture has a negligible effect crnp can be used to measure swc on a medium scale in uneven terrain and undisturbed non uniform landscapes evans et al 2016 found that vegetation may reduce the accuracy of crnp and intercept water stored in the tree canopy and vegetation water content and water trapped in the litter layer bogena et al 2013 may lead to the overestimation of crnp the effects of vegetation precipitation interception and measuring scale may have contributed to the differences between the swcs measured by the crnp probes and the other sensors which requires more study han et al 2014 reported that the crnp could be used to measured swc in highly heterogeneous farmland with only one parameter n0 of crnp requiring calibration before inversion the effects of water consumption by vegetation must be taken into account the water transferred from soil to vegetation during dry periods would likely influence crnp measurements by affecting the intensity of neutrons above the ground surface thus the actual swc would be lower and thus overestimated by the crnp the comparisons between the rates of change obtained from the crnp and the other sensors during dry periods though indicated higher rates of decrease in sld and sls but a lower rate in lsh perhaps because of the strong evapotranspiration from the denser taller vegetation in sld and sls the calibration of overestimated swcs due to the effect of the water content of the vegetation on the crnp thus needs further study the rate of change of swc was also correlated with the antecedent swc several dry periods after rainfalls of 10 mm in the three plots were selected for comparing the rates of decrease and antecedent swcs the rates of decrease were significantly correlated with the antecedent swcs p 0 01 and the antecedent swcs differed significantly among the plots p 0 05 the rates of decrease did not differ significantly among the three plots but the higher the antecedent swc the faster the rate of decrease for each plot the swcs measured by the buried sensors in sls sld and lsh had the same relationships with the antecedent swcs the relationship between the rate of increase and the antecedent swc during periods of rain was opposite to the relationship between the rate of decrease and the antecedent swc the lower the antecedent swc the faster the rate of increase for each plot the rates of increase in the plots were in the order lsh sls sld the rates of increase in the plots were lower for the crnp swcs than the swcs measured by the other sensors perhaps because the antecedent swc was lowest in lsh and highest in sld water also ponded on the surface in sld during periods of rain but precipitation infiltrated faster in lsh because of its high saturated hydraulic conductivity antecedent swcs were higher for the crnp perhaps because the crnp probes overestimated swcs due to the effects of canopy interception and the water content of the vegetation the different soil textures affected vegetation types and swc in three plots for example there is no medicago sativa l in lsh swc and vegetation can also interact such as in areas where high swc leads to more vegetation growth and where vegetation with high water consumption such as c korshinskii can lead to dried soil layers quantifying each factor and identifying the main factor are therefore difficult but the effects of different soil textures are the original influencing factor the larger footprint measured by crnp could give more information about swc changes in complex landscapes this study used crnp to measure swc with complex underlying surface conditions which could provide data for the efficient use of water resources in similar regions in large scale considering the un uniform spatial distribution of vegetation and the high rmse in sld in this study the spatial distribution of vegetation should be taken into account because the farther distances to the crnp from hydrogen pools the less affects contribution is made by neutrons köhli et al 2015 besides some studies proposed methods to weight swc measured by oven dried method or soilnet köhli et al 2015 bogena et al 2013 those may be can used to weight the vegetation hydrogen pools and need further research crnp could obtain water content estimated from hydrogen density content in mid scale such as measuring snowpack in winter or measuring biomass schattan et al 2017 jakobi et al 2018 therefore quantifying and classifying every hydrogen pool would be a research focus 5 conclusion detecting cosmic ray neutrons for measuring mean swc at hectometer scales has been adopted since the 1980s has developed rapidly in recent decades and can bridge scale differences between conventional point measurements and remote sensing this method has the advantages of undisturbed and continuous observation with high temporal resolution and represents a new approach for swc studies three probes were installed for detecting neutrons generated by cosmic rays in three plots in the same watershed for measuring mean swc in 2016 and 2017 r for the crnp ranges from 127 to 170 m 126 to 174 m and 148 to 174 m for sld sls and lsh respectively and the measuring depth is about 10 60 cm in the three plots based on general calculation equations the accuracy of the crnp is high when validated against the oven drying method rmse 0 068 cm3 cm 3 the mean swcs estimated from the other sensors were consistent with the mean swcs from the crnp probes in the plots and the coefficient of determination of the linear relationship is in the order sandy loam loamy sand silt loam the variation of swc during wet and dry periods is largest for sld although the sld crnp swc has the lowest rate of decrease considering its high rate of increase sld could hold more water than lsh and sls consistent with the high clay and organic matter contents of sld antecedent swcs significantly and positively affected the variability of the swcs p 0 01 swc estimated from crnp for the three plots have similar patterns following the time series even though crnp is not calibrated for the vegetation thus crnp can be sensitive to the variability of swc with negligible effects of soil textures indicating crnp is suitable for obtaining swc on the loess plateau the distribution of swc has little effects on crnp which means crnp could obtain accurate mean regional swc fill the gap between remote sensing and point measurement especially regions with heterogeneous land use types terrains and soil textures crnp can measure swc of the complex underlying surface accurately so as to provide a more reliable assessment of the impacts of landscapes and vegetation changes such as conversion of cropland to forest and grassland on the loess plateau on water resources simple vegetation correction did not significantly improve the accuracy under conditions of a complex spatial distribution of vegetation and relatively biomass 6 declaration of interest statement the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interests acknowledgements we acknowledge funding by the

6769,the cosmic ray neutron probe crnp is a new tool for continuously monitoring mean soil water content swc on a hectometer scale but the performance of crnps in highly heterogeneous distributions of swc vegetation and especially soil texture caused by the broken surface on the loess plateau in china remains uncertain the study evaluated the application and accuracy of the method for three soil textures in a small watershed on the plateau to provide a reference and scientific basis for its application three crnps were installed in a loamy sand hills lsh plot a silty loam dam sld plot and a sandy loam slope sls plot soil moisture sensors were buried at various depths in three plots the footprints of the crnps for swc observation had radii of 127 170 126 174 and 148 174 m in sld sls and lsh respectively and the mean measuring depth was about 20 cm for sld and sls and 40 cm for lsh based on general calculation equations the accuracy of the crnp method was high when validated using oven dried method rmse 0 068 cm3 cm 3 the mean swcs estimated from the other types of sensors were consistent with the mean swcs from the crnp probes in the three plots the coefficient of determination of the linear relationship was in the order sls lsh sld the coefficient of variations cv were higher in lsh than sld and sls indicating that swc varied most in lsh during periods of rain the variations were larger for sld than sls and lsh with a cv of 32 2 the crnp for sld had the highest rates of change during periods with and without rain for both increasing and decreasing swc but this plot held more water than lsh and sls consistent with the high clay and organic matter contents in sld the rates of change were significantly correlated with the antecedent swcs p 0 01 and the higher the antecedent swc the faster the rate of change for each plot this study verified the application of the crnp for monitoring field average swc of the broken surface on the loess plateau and represents a new approach for the study of the spatial distribution of swc on the plateau crnp can measure swc of the complex underlying surface accurately so as to provide a more reliable assessment of the impacts of landscapes and vegetation changes such as conversion of cropland to forest and grassland on the loess plateau on water resources keywords crnp swc soil texture loess plateau 1 introduction soil water is a principal component of earth s water and sustains the survival and reproduction of terrestrial life and the stable development of terrestrial ecological systems ground based measurements of soil water content swc are used in a wide variety of applications including agriculture hydrology hydrological modelling meteorology and the calibration of algorithms for obtaining soil moisture information by satellite swc influences regional hydrometeorology by redistributing precipitation into deep soil and runoff and controls the exchange of energy between the soil and the atmosphere by evaporation jia and shao 2013 accurate observation of swc can improve the accuracy of meteorological and climatic prediction prevent various disasters such as drought soil and water erosion and improve the efficiency of management of agricultural water rosolem et al 2014 swc can be measured by many methods such as oven drying neutron probes time domain reflectometry and frequency domain reflectometry vereecken et al 2014 all these methods are point measurements with small measuring scales and insufficient spatial representativeness on the other hand remote sensing methods can monitor swc at large scales but with shallow penetration depths that may be influenced by topography and vegetation sensing neutrons generated by cosmic rays which is an automatic and nondestructive method for measuring swc has been rapidly adopted since the 1980s andreasen et al 2017 cosmic rays are common throughout the universe and enter the atmosphere after penetrating earth s magnetic field primary cosmic rays interact with the atmosphere producing fast neutrons that can penetrate the soil and be moderated by interacting with hydrogen atoms which mainly exist in soil water zreda et al 2008 hydrogen atoms are several fold more efficient than atoms of the next most efficient element carbon at moderating fast neutrons desilets et al 2010 thus the intensity of moderated neutrons is negatively correlated with swc which is the basis for crnp measuring swc zreda et al 2008 indicating crnp could measure swc without the effects of soil salt cosmic ray neutron probes count the moderated neutrons near ground level zreda et al 2012 the footprint of the crnp is defined as the region containing 86 of the detected neutrons vertically and horizontally so the radius r of a crnp is calculated to be 130 240 m köhli et al 2015 at sea level atmospheric pressure of 1013 kpa and is mainly influenced by air pressure humidity swc and biomass the measuring depth was estimated to be from about 15 cm saturated soil to 83 cm dry soil by köhli et al 2015 crnp can therefore continuously measure the field average swc for an irregular hemisphere of soil because the measuring depth would decrease as the distance to the crnp increased köhli et al 2015 a hectometer scale can be a bridge between point soil moisture observations and remotely sensed images the principle and application of crnp has been widely studied in recent years several methods are available for estimating swc from measured neutron intensity the n0 method desilets et al 2010 the hydrogen molar fraction method franz et al 2013 and the cosmic operator method shuttleworth et al 2013 are calibrated using the monte carlo neutron particle extended mcnpx radiation transport code all three methods were validated by baatz et al 2014 and performed similarly well the n0 method is used most widely because it is the simplest for estimating swc since it just needs one parameter desilets et al 2010 fitted the neutron flux obtained from the mcnpx radiation transport code to derive a widely used equation for calibrating swc and reported the values of the parameters in the equation desilets and zreda 2013 proposed that r was mainly affected by the properties of the atmosphere and had a weak relationship with swc köhli et al 2015 proposed an improved method to estimate the measuring depth and radius of crnp zreda et al 2012 provided a better basis of the wider application of crnp by systematically explaining the principle calculations influencing factors calibration and application of the crnp the analysis and correction of the effects of air pressure water vapor solar activity and vegetation water content on the crnp have been studied desilets and zreda 2001 rosolem et al 2013 baatz et al 2015 köhli et al 2015 and the accuracy of the crnp was improved several methods can correct for the effects of vegetation water content but require further study franz et al 2016 baatz et al 2015 coopersmith et al 2014 baroni and oswald 2015 the crnp was developed on a solid theoretical foundation and its application is growing zreda et al 2012 having been applied in a variety of ecosystems such as forest heidbüchel et al 2016 farmland han et al 2014 and grassland peterson et al 2016 under different climatic conditions schattan et al 2017 crnp networks have been installed in the usa zreda et al 2012 australia hawdon et al 2014 germany baatz et al 2014 africa and england rosolem et al 2014 these studies have built the foundation for the application of the crnp method villarreyes et al 2011 bogena et al 2013 han et al 2014 evans et al 2016 found differences in swc between sites with similar weather but different soil types and land covers using crnps and the vegetation reduced the accuracy of crnp many studies have confirmed the performance of crnp and new methods have been proposed to correct the footprint and improve the accuracy köhli et al 2015 schrön et al 2017 these obtained high accuracies but most were performed on flat terrain and only a few were performed on uneven terrain the performance of the crnp on the loess plateau in china with highly heterogeneous distributions of swc vegetation and soil texture caused by the broken surface however remains uncertain the topography of the plateau is also complex thus obtaining accurate measurements of swc on a large scale with numerous eroded gullies is difficult besides the vegetation distribution and landscape of the loess plateau have changed greatly since the implementation of the project of conversion of cropland to forest and grassland which improved the ecological environment curbed serious soil and water erosion but increased the water consumption of vegetation even caused some negative effects such as soil desiccation wang et al 2011 therefore it is very important to study the interaction between the spatio temporal variation of swc and vegetation restoration on the loess plateau the purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and of the crnp at a site with three land use types with different soil textures and to provide basis for the sustainable utilization of soil moisture and the rational selection of vegetation on the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was carried out at the erosion and environmental station of

were in one small watershed with an area of 8 9 km2 so they had the same precipitation lsh was covered with caragana korshinskii kom artemisia and approximately 70 poplar trees with a mean diameter at breast height of 10 3 cm and a mean height of 5 2 m sld had loessial soil and was covered with artemisia zea mays l and a few populus simonii carr and salix matsudana koidz trees this area had been formed by the deposition of sediment from a catchment controlled by a small check dam sls had loessial soil and was covered with medicago sativa l stipa bungeana and a small amount of glycine max l merr the gradient of the slope was approximately 15 the dry aboveground biomasses of the main vegetation are shown in table 1 the soil mechanical compositions and textures of the three plots are shown in table 2 the constant head method was used to measure saturated hydraulic conductivity twenty undisturbed soil cores 100 cm3 were collected in each plot by excavating a soil pit with 10 samples collected at depths of 10 and 20 cm each sandy soil is the main textural type in lsh which was formed mainly by wind erosion and accumulation li et al 2005 the eroded sediments in sld were dominantly influenced by the erodibility of the original soil zhao et al 2009 loessial soil is the main soil type in sls which was formed by water and wind erosion and maturation of the loessial parental material and is widely distributed in areas with strong soil erosion on the loess plateau lin 1983 swc was measured in august 2017 by the tektronix 1502c tektronix inc beaverton usa by grid sampling with the crnp as the center and the density is 10 10 m to show the spatial distribution of swc the amount of the measuring samples were 211 137 and 191 for lsh sld and sls respectively fig 2 showed the spatial distribution of swc of three plots the standard deviations and coefficients of variation of swc were 0 024 cm3 cm 3 and 18 6 0 034 cm3 cm 3 and 13 6 and 0 048 cm3 cm 3 and 24 6 for lsh sld and sls respectively 2 2 the crnp a crnp was installed in the center of each plot fig 1 its main component was a moderated fast neutron probe which was filled with he 3 and was produced by probe science and technology ltd beijing china probe technology 2015 the probe was installed 50 cm above the ground fixed to a steel tube a meteorological station was installed with the crnp to measure air temperature humidity and precipitation a datalogger was used to store the data at intervals of 1 h the positions of the crnps were 38 79698 n 110 35963 e in lsh 38 79457 n 110 36480 e in sld and 38 79455 n 110 36172 e in sls the linear distance is 375 291 and 572 m between lsh and sls lsh and sld sld and lsh respectively the distances were measured by google earth the crnps became operational on 22 april 2016 the data were collected from 22 april 2016 to 15 october 2017 but tdr or fdr sensors were disturbed by air temperature which measure dielectric constant of soil water to calculate the swc but temperatures in winter are below 0 c and the dielectric constant of water 81 0 is very different from that of ice 3 2 so the swc during this period is not accurate for those reasons data of period of 16 october 2016 to 14 april 2017 was removed only the data for 22 april to 15 october 2016 and 15 april to 15 october 2017 were analyzed 2 2 1 horizontal and vertical footprints of the crnp köhli et al 2015 proposed that measuring depth would decrease as the distance to the crnp increased and that hydrogen pools such as vegetation would decrease the measuring depth because they would increase the amount of hydrogen on the surface thus measuring depth would be more like an irregular hemisphere a recent study reported r between 130 and 240 m and proposed an equation for calculating r köhli et al 2015 1 r f p f veg θ r 86 h θ where r is the radius of crnp fp is a factor for the influence of air pressure see köhli et al 2015 eq 5 fveg θ is a factor for the influence of vegetation which depends on swc and modeled above ground vegetation as a layer of height see köhli et al 2015 eq 4 r 86 h θ is the radius without calculations for air pressure and vegetation see köhli et al 2015 eqs 2 3 and fig 6 h is the absolute humidity g m 3 and θ is swc m3 m 3 d cm is defined as the depth at which 86 of the neutrons are detected negatively correlated with swc and depends little on other soil properties franz et al 2012 but bogena et al 2013 proposed that d was also affected by other hydrogen pools such as soil organic matter lattice water and roots the more water the soil contains the more of the fast neutrons will be slowed and fewer fast neutrons will reach deeper soil hence d will be shallower franz et al 2012 d was calculated as köhli et al 2015 2 d ρ bd 1 p 0 p 1 p 2 e r

42 and 0 057 for p 0 to p 4 respectively köhli et al 2015 and θ is swc m3 m 3 2 2 2 calibration of neutron intensity and the crnp air pressure varies with meteorological conditions and latitude which affects the amount of atmospheric shielding changes in near ground cosmic ray neutron intensity are inversely proportional to changes in local air pressure which is a good proxy for mass shielding air pressure was corrected for latitude and altitude using desilets and zreda 2001 3 n p n raw exp p s 0 p s l where nraw is the count of original density of the moderated fast neutrons ps is the measured air pressure kpa ps 0 is the standard air pressure 1013 kpa and l is the mass attenuation length for high energy neutrons g cm 2 varying from 128 g cm 2 at high latitudes to 142 g cm 2 near the equator zreda et al 2012 a value of 136 g cm 2 was used for l at our study site desilets and zreda 2013 atmospheric water vapor content varies with meteorological parameters such as air temperature so the number of hydrogen atoms in the water vapor will affect the accuracy of the crnp results the correction formula is rosolem et al 2013 4 n pw n p 1 0 0054 ρ ρ 0 where npw is the neutron flux corrected for water vapor and air pressure ρ is the absolute vapor density g m 3 at the experimental site and ρ 0 is the reference vapor density generally set to 0 g m 3 solar activity can strongly influence the intensity of incoming neutrons on a timescale of months and even occasionally on a timescale of a few days thus the variations in the incoming neutron intensity accordingly need to be removed the intensity correction factor fi zreda et al 2012 should be used to correct the neutron count and the final equation is 5 n n p w f i n p w n a n m where n is the final neutron count nm is the measured neutron monitor intensity at a given time and na is the average neutron intensity during the period of measurement the background intensity based on data collected at the jungfraujoch neutron monitoring station are available from the neutron monitoring database http cosray unibe ch the corrected neutron flux is negatively and nonlinearly proportional to swc the shape defining function developed by desilets et al 2010 is widely used to determine θcrnp cm3 cm 3 6 θ crnp a 0 n n 0 a 1 a 2 ρ bd where n is the corrected neutron flux n0 is the neutron flux in dry soil under the same reference condition obtained from the measured swc in the footprint and parameters a0 0 0808 a1 0 372 and a2 0 115 are dimensionless desilets et al 2010 note that θcrnp calculated from eq 6 includes soil water lattice water soil organic matter and vegetation which contain hydrogen and can moderate fast neutrons zreda et al 2012 conversion from gravimetric to volumetric water content using measured soil density in eq 6 is also needed because neutron counts are directly converted to gravimetric water content using the n0 method 2 2 3 soil samples for calibration calibration points at 25 and 75 m every 60 around the crnps were marked with a yellow plastic stick in each plot disturbed soil samples were collected at depths of 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 cm and undisturbed soil cores 100 cm3 were collected by excavating a soil pit and sampling at depths of 10 20 and 30 cm at each point hence the volumetric swc of the samples could be used to calculate n0 swcs measured on 27 june 23 july 5 october 2016 and 6 may 2017 by oven drying were used to calculate n 0 for each plot using eq 6 as recommended by köhli et al 2015 72 samples were collected from each plot at each sampling event swcs measured by oven drying were weight averaged for calibrating the crnp as 1 vertically weight averaged 7 w d r θ e 2 d d where d is the depth of soil layer and d is the measuring depth in the calibration date there were some samples not needed when the measuring depth of crnp was lower than the depth of sampling 2 horizontally weight averaged 8 w r h θ f 1 e f 2 r f 3 e f 4 r 0 5 m r 50 m

the final weight averaged swc θ was then used to calculate n0 9 θ i w i θ i i w i 2 3 swc sensors five ec 5 meter group inc pullman usa soil moisture sensors were buried at depths of 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm in lsh five gs 1 meter group inc pullman usa sensors were buried at depths of 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm in 2016 and five ec 5 sensors were buried at depths of 5 10 20 30 and 50 cm in 2017 in sld nine sdi 12 sensors for time domain transmissometry tdt acclima inc meridian usa were installed at a depth of 5 cm and 9 of the same sensors were installed at a depth of 15 cm in sls the sensors and their distributions are listed in table 3 the sensors in this study are based on time domain reflection and the time interval for data collection was the same as for crnp 1 h all sensors were installed into undisturbed soil profiles by digging to the depth required and installing the sensor horizontally the tdt sensors in sls were installed in 2012 the gs1 sensors in sld were installed in 2016 and the ec 5 sensors in sld and lsh were installed in 2017 and 2016 respectively the sensors were calibrated by using swc values obtained by oven drying method performed on 5 october 2016 the swcs measured by these sensors were weight averaged by the method proposed by köhli et al 2015 see section 2 2 3 3 results 3 1 field swc and calculating n 0 n 0 and the root mean square errors rmses between the swcs estimated from n 0 calculated from each sampling time and the oven dried swcs are presented in table 4 table 5 shows the deviation between the oven dried swc and the crnp swc estimated from each calibration sample an experiment in a region dominated by a heterogenous monsoon climate nguyen et al 2017 suggested that n 0 is influenced by soil wetness conditions of calibration and that calibration was more accurate under dry rmse 0 035 m3 m 3 than wet conditions rmse 0 049 m3 m 3 due to the fewer hydrogen pools in our experiment however the calibration sampling on 23 july 2016 which had higher swcs than the other samplings had the lowest rmse indicating that the swc estimated from n 0 calculated from this sampling was more consistent with the true swc which may due to the effect of vegetation the biomass was not measured because of the uneven distribution of the vegetation and the complex terrain and n 0 calculated from other samplings may not represent hydrogen pools thus n 0 calculated from the sampling on 23 july 2016 was selected for estimating swc for which the biomass was well representative of the average conditions of the monitoring period baroni and oswald 2015 the rmses were in the order sls lsh sld bogena et al 2013 reported that swc at a wet forest site was a relatively small contributor to the total hydrogen pool and that the rmse was higher than that for a soil moisture network installed within the crnp footprint the rmse between the crnps and the sensors measuring swc can be lower when biomass water is eliminated from crnp measurements tian et al 2016 coopersmith et al 2014 sld had the highest vegetation coverage thus the high rmse for the crnp in sld may have been due to biomass water and the hydrogen in the vegetation tissues the swcs estimated from the crnps using n0 calculated from swc measured on 23 july 2016 were significantly correlated with the swcs measured by oven drying p 0 01 total rmse was 0 0675 cm3 cm 3 and the rmses for lsh sld and sls were 0 051 0 030 and 0 100 cm3 cm 3 respectively indicating that the crnp could accurately measure mean swc fig 3 rmse was higher in sls than the other plots due to artificial rain experiments which is performed by other researchers and no swc sensors in there and the distance between it and crnp is about 80 m so swc was much higher in this area than the surrounding area leading to the high rmse but having little effect on the regional average swc due to its small area sld and lsh received almost no human interference and the vegetation coverage was more uniform in sld than lsh fig 1 leading to the lower rmse in sld than lsh the raw data and 24 h moving averaged swcs measured by the crnps for the three plots is shown in fig 4 for the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons along with the measured daily precipitation the three plots were in one small watershed so precipitation was the same the differences in swc between the plots were thus due to the different soil textures terrains and water consumption by vegetation the corrected swc obtained from the crnp probes had a similar pattern of changes over time but were delayed briefly especially when the swcs were decreasing perhaps due to the differences of three plots between soil textures saturated hydraulic conductivities and antecedent swcs lead to the water moved at different speed in soil swc was high in july and august in both 2016 and 2017 corresponding to the high rainfall in these months the low rainfall from april to june in 2016 and 2017 caused the low swcs the crnp swcs of all three plots were 0 2 cm3 cm 3 the precipitation increased rapidly in july and august and swc increased sharply the swcs for sld were oversaturated θs 0 41 cm3 cm 3 numerically equals to soil porosity on 22 july 13 to 24 august and 17 and 25 september 2016 and 22 july to 1 august 22 to 27 august and 26 september to 15 october 2017 during periods of rain swc estimated from crnp consisted of all hydrogen pools in the footprint including soil water and biomass water but crnp overestimated swc when water was ponded on the surface because the water increased the hydrogen pools but did not infiltrate into soil to increase swc most swc peaks correlate well with rainfall events except the swc peaks at 16 april and 6 may 2017 which was found the swc measured by other sensors did not increase at that day that may be caused by solar storms during april 2017 according to the reports http www spaceweather com lsh had the highest saturated hydraulic conductivity thus water quickly infiltrated to a depth beyond the range of the probes and sensors leading to the lowest swc in lsh sld during this period however collected runoff from the surrounding area because its landscape is low in the middle and high on all sides and held water due to the influence of the lowest saturated hydraulic conductivity sls produced runoff infiltration excess surface runoff and soil and water erosion thus water flowed out and swc was higher for sld than sls the surface soil in sls was compacted and the deep soil was looser because the roots of the dominant species alfalfa loosens deep soil even though the regional average saturated hydraulic conductivity was high leading to excessive surface runoff when the rain was heavy 3 2 footprint of the crnp vegetation was not considered in this study because of its heterogeneous distribution and r ranged from 148 to 174 m 127 to 170 m and 126 to 174 m for lsh sld and sls respectively the maximum measuring depths of crnp were 68 5 37 0 and 51 4 cm in 2016 and 59 8 25 9 and 45 1 cm in 2017 for lsh sld and sls respectively fig 5 precipitation in our study was relatively uniform in july and august which produced relatively stable levels of soil water sld held more water than the other plots and had shallowest measuring depth because it had the lowest saturated hydraulic conductivity and the highest field capacity lsh was opposite to sld lsh had the lowest swc and the deepest measuring depth bogena et al 2013 also found that the crnp reduced the effective measuring depth up to 50 during dry periods due to the amounts of lattice water organic matter and belowground biomass the relationship between measuring depth and rainfall indicated that swc estimated from the crnp was sensitive to rainfall in this area 3 3 comparisons of swcs from the crnp probes and the other sensors all swc sensors were calibrated against measurements from oven drying method so as to eliminate the errors due to different sources of measurements figs 6 and 7 show the temporal variation and comparisons of swcs from the crnp probes and the mean swcs of the other sensors for the 0 20 cm layer in the three plots in 2016 and 2017 the swc cvs were higher for the crnp probes than the other sensors in the three plots table 6 and the cvs of crnp and sensors were highest for lsh indicating that the crnps were more sensitive and that swc was most variable in lsh perhaps due to the terrain the effects of the water content of the vegetation canopy interception and the differences between a point measurement ec 5 and a mid scale measurement crnp the soil was most porous had more macropores and the saturated hydraulic conductivity was highest for lsh thus water moved quickly into the soil after periods of rain the linear relationship between the crnp swc and swc of buried sensors in 2016 was poorer for sld than the other plots because the gs1 sensors were near trees fig 6 thus some of the rain would have been intercepted which may account for the low sensitivity of the sensors to precipitation five ec 5 sensors were installed in 2017 at depths of 5 10 20 30 and 50 cm near the crnp probe covered with alfalfa in sld because the alfalfa intercepted much less precipitation than the trees considering the dominant species of sld are herbage and there are few trees the swc measured in 2017 is more representative thus r 2 was higher between the crnp and buried sensors swcs than between crnp and buried sensors in 2016 r 2 between crnp swc and the average swc of buried sensors was highest for sls perhaps due to the more uniform distribution of vegetation in sls than the other plots and had nine profiles of swc sensors which could represent the regional swc the swc trends of the plots following the crnp could be verified even though different sensors were used and the calibration of the sensors also minimized the effects of the different types of sensors 3 4 effect of soil texture on the variability of swc fig 8 shows the daily variations of the swcs estimated from the crnps and the other sensors in the three plots the daily variations of crnp swc were significantly correlated with swc measured by the buried sensors in 2017 the correlation was strongest for lsh with a correlation coefficient of 0 532 which may have been due to the lower vegetation coverage in lsh than the other plots the maximum daily variations of crnp swcs in 2016 and 2017 were in the order sld sls lsh the maximum variations of the buried sensors were in the orders sls lsh sld in 2016 and lsh sld sls in 2017 the gs1 sensors were near trees in sld in 2016 so some of the precipitation would have been intercepted and the ec 5 sensors were installed near the crnp in 2017 which may have contributed to the differences in the maximum variations daily variation in 2016 was highest for the crnp in sld 0 18 cm3 cm 3 on 8 july when the rainfall 124 mm was heaviest the average variations of crnp swc for the three plots for 8 to 11 july 2016 were selected which was the heaviest rain with a total rainfall of 207 7 mm producing the largest variation of swc in 2016 the swc variation was large but the trend was consistent in the three plots the cv of crnp swc in sld during this period was 32 2 larger than in lsh and sls the rates of change of swc obtained from the crnps were in the order sld 0 042 cm3 cm 3 d 1 sls 0 030 cm3 cm 3 d 1 lsh 0 017 cm3 cm 3 d 1 the rates of increase in crnp swc were thus in the order sld sls lsh the saturated hydraulic conductivity was higher for lsh than the other plots and was limited by the measuring depth of the crnp resulted in the rate of increase in swc was lowest for lsh in addition to the effect of saturated hydraulic conductivity canopy interception would slow the infiltration of water and thereby increase the surface swc therefore the rate of increase was highest for sld the subsequent rates of change of swc obtained from the crnp for the dry period on 12 and 13 july were in the order sld 0 0187 cm3 cm 3 d 1 lsh sls 0 010 cm3 cm 3 d 1 the rate of decrease was highest for sld considering its rate of increase but sld could hold more water than the other plots this result is consistent with the clay and organic matter contents of the three plots table 3 and consistent with the study by lv et al 2014 in which swc at locations with higher clay contents was significantly higher over time 4 discussion in this study the calibration of 3 crnps were performed 4 times for every calibration 72 samples were taken around the crnp in different distances and different depths and were weighted average followed köhli et al 2015 then the calibration with lowest rmse was selected to calculate n0 which ensures the n0 is the most representative in space and time this study did not measure biomass so n 0 calculated from the calibration at 23 july 2016 when its biomass was well representative of the average conditions of the monitoring period baroni and oswald 2015 which may lead to errors of swc early and late in the monitoring period because the biomass was not correct a study in an agricultural landscape with high clay content found that multiple and dynamic calibration could reduce the error between the crnp probes and the tdt sensors franz et al 2016 in this study the non uniform spatial distribution of swc and texture may also have contributed to the high rmse in sld which needs further investigation the water in lsh moved due to the uneven terrain leading to the heterogeneous distribution of soil water fig 2 c korshinskii which has an extremely high demand for water and can desiccate the soil was distributed sporadically in lsh na et al 2013 lsh also had a wide range of biological crusts the effects of which require more study crnp can be sensitive to the variability of swc where soil texture has a negligible effect crnp can be used to measure swc on a medium scale in uneven terrain and undisturbed non uniform landscapes evans et al 2016 found that vegetation may reduce the accuracy of crnp and intercept water stored in the tree canopy and vegetation water content and water trapped in the litter layer bogena et al 2013 may lead to the overestimation of crnp the effects of vegetation precipitation interception and measuring scale may have contributed to the differences between the swcs measured by the crnp probes and the other sensors which requires more study han et al 2014 reported that the crnp could be used to measured swc in highly heterogeneous farmland with only one parameter n0 of crnp requiring calibration before inversion the effects of water consumption by vegetation must be taken into account the water transferred from soil to vegetation during dry periods would likely influence crnp measurements by affecting the intensity of neutrons above the ground surface thus the actual swc would be lower and thus overestimated by the crnp the comparisons between the rates of change obtained from the crnp and the other sensors during dry periods though indicated higher rates of decrease in sld and sls but a lower rate in lsh perhaps because of the strong evapotranspiration from the denser taller vegetation in sld and sls the calibration of overestimated swcs due to the effect of the water content of the vegetation on the crnp thus needs further study the rate of change of swc was also correlated with the antecedent swc several dry periods after rainfalls of 10 mm in the three plots were selected for comparing the rates of decrease and antecedent swcs the rates of decrease were significantly correlated with the antecedent swcs p 0 01 and the antecedent swcs differed significantly among the plots p 0 05 the rates of decrease did not differ significantly among the three plots but the higher the antecedent swc the faster the rate of decrease for each plot the swcs measured by the buried sensors in sls sld and lsh had the same relationships with the antecedent swcs the relationship between the rate of increase and the antecedent swc during periods of rain was opposite to the relationship between the rate of decrease and the antecedent swc the lower the antecedent swc the faster the rate of increase for each plot the rates of increase in the plots were in the order lsh sls sld the rates of increase in the plots were lower for the crnp swcs than the swcs measured by the other sensors perhaps because the antecedent swc was lowest in lsh and highest in sld water also ponded on the surface in sld during periods of rain but precipitation infiltrated faster in lsh because of its high saturated hydraulic conductivity antecedent swcs were higher for the crnp perhaps because the crnp probes overestimated swcs due to the effects of canopy interception and the water content of the vegetation the different soil textures affected vegetation types and swc in three plots for example there is no medicago sativa l in lsh swc and vegetation can also interact such as in areas where high swc leads to more vegetation growth and where vegetation with high water consumption such as c korshinskii can lead to dried soil layers quantifying each factor and identifying the main factor are therefore difficult but the effects of different soil textures are the original influencing factor the larger footprint measured by crnp could give more information about swc changes in complex landscapes this study used crnp to measure swc with complex underlying surface conditions which could provide data for the efficient use of water resources in similar regions in large scale considering the un uniform spatial distribution of vegetation and the high rmse in sld in this study the spatial distribution of vegetation should be taken into account because the farther distances to the crnp from hydrogen pools the less affects contribution is made by neutrons köhli et al 2015 besides some studies proposed methods to weight swc measured by oven dried method or soilnet köhli et al 2015 bogena et al 2013 those may be can used to weight the vegetation hydrogen pools and need further research crnp could obtain water content estimated from hydrogen density content in mid scale such as measuring snowpack in winter or measuring biomass schattan et al 2017 jakobi et al 2018 therefore quantifying and classifying every hydrogen pool would be a research focus 5 conclusion detecting cosmic ray neutrons for measuring mean swc at hectometer scales has been adopted since the 1980s has developed rapidly in recent decades and can bridge scale differences between conventional point measurements and remote sensing this method has the advantages of undisturbed and continuous observation with high temporal resolution and represents a new approach for swc studies three probes were installed for detecting neutrons generated by cosmic rays in three plots in the same watershed for measuring mean swc in 2016 and 2017 r for the crnp ranges from 127 to 170 m 126 to 174 m and 148 to 174 m for sld sls and lsh respectively and the measuring depth is about 10 60 cm in the three plots based on general calculation equations the accuracy of the crnp is high when validated against the oven drying method rmse 0 068 cm3 cm 3 the mean swcs estimated from the other sensors were consistent with the mean swcs from the crnp probes in the plots and the coefficient of determination of the linear relationship is in the order sandy loam loamy sand silt loam the variation of swc during wet and dry periods is largest for sld although the sld crnp swc has the lowest rate of decrease considering its high rate of increase sld could hold more water than lsh and sls consistent with the high clay and organic matter contents of sld antecedent swcs significantly and positively affected the variability of the swcs p 0 01 swc estimated from crnp for the three plots have similar patterns following the time series even though crnp is not calibrated for the vegetation thus crnp can be sensitive to the variability of swc with negligible effects of soil textures indicating crnp is suitable for obtaining swc on the loess plateau the distribution of swc has little effects on crnp which means crnp could obtain accurate mean regional swc fill the gap between remote sensing and point measurement especially regions with heterogeneous land use types terrains and soil textures crnp can measure swc of the complex underlying surface accurately so as to provide a more reliable assessment of the impacts of landscapes and vegetation changes such as conversion of cropland to forest and grassland on the loess plateau on water resources simple vegetation correction did not significantly improve the accuracy under conditions of a complex spatial distribution of vegetation and relatively biomass 6 declaration of interest statement the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interests acknowledgements we acknowledge funding by the
