6365,climate change and gullies and ditches on peatlands are well known factors altering peat hydrology yet exactly how this alteration emerges from interaction of these factors with groundwater dynamics is still not fully understood in this study we tackled this issue by coupling field measurement with model simulation using visual modflow groundwater processes and the associated water budget during five months of the wet season 2017 were examined in the zoige peatland located on the northeastern side of qinghai tibet plateau china with elevations of 3400 3900 m simulations were performed for a peatland area of 3 89 104 m2 and three sub zones within it representing peatland with no gullies ng a deep gully cutting through the peat layer ct and a shallow gully whose bed is within the peat layer nct model input parameters were calibrated and validated using the field measured data modeling outcomes led to water budget showing relative contributions of main hydrological pathways mhps i e precipitation p evapotranspiration et gully groundwater flow and boundary to changes of water storage in peats δs although these mhps varied differently during rain and inter rain periods δs values were mainly controlled by the oscillated trend of the difference between p and et variations of mhps caused by nct and ct were secondary to those due to those of p and et during the wet season referred to as the short term climate change vertical groundwater vgw flows were strongly correlated with water table wt levels in both rain and inter rain periods but their directions had different patterns in the two periods horizontal groundwater hgw flows tended to move into the deep ct gully while move from the shallow nct gully to the neighbor peats during both periods since hgw flows were about ten times greater than vgw ones their effect on δs was significant during the long dry season this would lead to continuous loss of groundwater stored in peats demonstrating the coupled effect of long term climate change and gullies on δs these findings underline the necessity of controlling gully development and avoiding ditch excavation in future zoige peatland management practices keywords groundwater flow groundwater storage change water budget disturbed peatland climate change modflow 1 introduction the unique physical properties of peats make peatlands rich of water carbon and nutrient shi et al 2015 therefore peatland degradation due to natural processes such as climate change and development of gullies and anthropogenic influence such as ditch excavation and grazing negatively affects peatland ecosystems and ecological functions holden et al 2004 wilson et al 2011 particularly those more vulnerable such as the zoige basin in the qinghai tibet plateau china zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 although degradation of peatland essentially refers to transformation of organics to inorganic mineral soils decomposition caused by biogeochemical processes and microbial activities holden et al 2007 ramchunder et al 2009 these processes and activities are closely related to changes of peatland hydrology for a given peatland unit a site plot or catchment peatland hydrology includes surface runoff subsurface flow that mainly consists of macropore and pipe flows and groundwater flow labadz et al 2010 these flow paths are controlled by precipitation and evapotranspiration interaction between these flow paths and control factors drives the change of groundwater storage in peatland which finally affects physical properties of peats e g porosity moisture contents specific yield and hydraulic conductivity price and whitehead 2001 therefore determining groundwater storage and its change in peatland is essential for revealing the complex mechanisms that cause peatland degradation theoretically groundwater storage change δs for a given time interval is a function of peat specific yield sy and the associated water table wt change assuming peatland is an unconfined aquifer however many field studies and modeling analyses indicated that values of sy vary spatially and temporally not only among different peatlands but also within itself particularly they vary along peat vertical profiles with inconsistent patterns among different peatlands price 1992 price 1996 ronkanen and klove 2005 sumner 2007 moreover wt varies spatially and temporally holden et al 2011 luscombe et al 2016 the spatial variation may be due to topography at the local scale or caused by natural gullies and artificial ditches leading to the lateral dropdown effect and unevenly distributed wt levels on both sides of ditches the temporal variation could be either varying between day and night or seasonally evans and warburton 2007 thus determining sy and wt variation involve various uncertainties in addition to these uncertainties a more fundamental challenge lies in the fact that changes of wt can also be caused by peat expansion and compaction which could contribute up to 60 of δs values kellner and halldin 2002 price and schlotzhauer 1999 these uncertainties and challenges undermine the reliability of direct calculating δs in peatlands that have relatively large areas an alternative approach to determining δs relies on constructing water balance of a peatland fraser et al 2001b price 1996 van seters and price 2001 1 p e t r δ s ε where p is the precipitation et is the evapotranspiration r is the runoff and ɛ is the residual term this approach implicitly assumes that the groundwater gw exchange is small such that it may be ignored and lumped into the residual term evans and warburton 2007 nonetheless even during rainfall events vertical gw exchanges may be measurable fraser et al 2001a in the inter rain periods the impact of gw flows on δs may not be negligible for instance diffuse seepage of gw was observed in ditches cutting through the peat layer rossi et al 2012 suggesting relatively strong movement of gw flows which may possibly contribute to δs however the interaction between gw flows and δs under the influence of ditches is apparently intricate and still not well known since natural gullies and or artificial ditches are widespread in peatlands all over the world fisher et al 1996 gatis et al 2016 joosten et al 2008 labadz et al 2010 li et al 2018 ronkanen and klove 2005 sikstrom and hokka 2016 whittington and price 2006 understanding hydrological processes controlling this complex interaction is valuable for better managing peatland ecosystem dahl et al 2007 particularly in remote alpine peatland where deploying an intensive sampling campaign is often challenging in this study we examined this interaction in a small peatland catchment in the zoige basin china using visual modflow model calibrated and validated by field measured data based on simulated results spanning over 124 days from may 17 to september 17 2017 we elaborated quantitative contribution of each hydrological and climatic factor to water balance of the peatland then we demonstrated different responses of δs to the climate change represented as the rain and inter rain periods and gullies which was followed by examining responses of both vertical and horizontal gw flows to these two factors the study was closed by revealing the impact of long term climate change and deep gullies on δs and gw flows our findings provided first hand knowledge of groundwater hydrology in this rare alpine peatland that has not been studied from the process based perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area zoige basin is situated in the yellow river source region on the northeastern side of qinghai tibet plateau china fig 1 a and b where it develops the world s largest alpine peatland at the elevations of 3400 3900 m the annual average rainfall of zoige basin is about 765 mm most of which is mainly concentrated in the june september period since 1950s the air temperature has increased by about 0 2 c per decade and the annual rainfall has varied with no distinct trend yang et al 2017 li et al 2015 evapotranspiration is related to land use types and climate change ranging between 450 and 550 mm per year with a slightly increasing trend annually zhao et al 2014 the area of zoige peatland is about 5098 km2 accounting for 49 of the total peatland area in china and the organic carbon storage in this region is roughly 0 477 pg accounting for 32 of that stored in the qinghai tibet plateau wang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 in addition zoige peatland stores groundwater up to several billions of cubic meters unfortunately affected by climate change and human activities zoige peatland has experienced degradation since the 1950s with an annual degradation rate of about 10 jeopardizing local aquatic ecosystems and water resources utilization in the upper yellow river system bai et al 2008 huo et al 2013 li et al 2010 yang et al 2017 as ombrotrophic mires zoige peats are annually replenished by precipitation and their stored water is reduced by evapotranspiration and further drained out by natural gullies and artificial ditches li et al 2018 li et al 2015 thus understanding dynamic changes of stored groundwater in zoige peatland is crucial for developing best management practices to stop degradation our study catchment is located in a small tributary of the upper black river with the area of about 0 151 km2 fig 1c its west and east sides are surrounded by hillsides and the south side is the high end of this catchment the mainstream of the catchment flows into the north from the southwest direction converged by a few tributaries with variable sizes since all of the channels are developed on upland of the upper black river they may be geomorphologically treated as gullies the peat layer within the catchment varies between 0 and 2 m thick underlain by a sandy silt layer with the median diameter varying between 0 039 mm and 0 651 mm in this study gullies are divided into two categories in the first category deep gullies cut through the peat layer making their beds lower than the bottom of the peat layer and hence possibly allowing more groundwater to seep out from the boundary between the top peat and bottom soil layers in the second one shallow gullies have the bed whose depth is less than the peat layer thickness such that the entire gully is within the peat layer hereafter these two types of gullies are referred to as the ct fig 1d and nct fig 1e gullies respectively according to this definition the mainstream and the longest tributary are the ct gullies with the total length of about 1014 4 m the mean width of 1 3 m and the deepest depth up to 1 5 m while others are nct gullies with the total length of 1458 6 m and very shallow depths fig 1c 2 2 data acquisition we measured topography peat layer thickness wt levels specific yield and hydraulic conductivity in 2016 and 2017 in the study catchment using a differential gps trimble r2 that has vertical and horizontal accuracies of 0 85 and 0 50 m respectively we collected 831 elevation points across the catchment and converted them using a kriging interpolation method into dem data that had a mean plane resolution of 13 m fig 1c peats in the study area were generally deep in and near the valley and shallow toward the east and west edges with relatively steep slopes we measured peat depths at 119 locations and interpolated them throughout the entire study area to obtain spatially variable distribution of peat thickness both dem and peat depths in the simulation zone were used as a prototype for defining the simulated peat volume and constructing the conceptual model we also measured wt levels within the study catchment using self made dipwells each of which was 110 cm long and 0 02 m wide in diameter and was pushed or hammed into the peat for at least 1 m deep on may 17th 20th and 23th july 17th and september 18th wt levels at 114 103 105 77 and 81 locations distributed within the student catchment were manually measured respectively fig 2 a furthermore several automatic water loggers hobo were installed in gullies and inserted under the peat surface to measured continuous wt levels fig 2a some of these data were used to determine daily water levels in the gully and to create dynamic wt levels along the boundary of the simulation zone i e the boundary conditions specific yield sy of peats was measured by taking a total of 36 samples from three different locations and in different peat depths using the method described by price 1992 the measured sy values did not show much variation along the peat depth and its mean among three locations ranged between 0 02 and 0 05 hydraulic conductivity k was measured using self made piezometers following the procedure laid out by chason and siegel 1986 this procedure does not distinguish horizontal from vertical k and thus is a comprehensive k measured values of k varied in the range of 0 35 0 89 10 6 m s 1 generally the sandy silt layer beneath the peats has less permeability since the median size of the sandy silts was about 0 039 mm the value of k should be between 1 and 2 10 5 m s 1 zheng and bennett 2002 given that k in a silt layer is typically 10 1 100 1 times less than that in a peat layer ronkanen and kløve 2008 it is reasonable to set k 1 10 8 m s 1 for the sandy silt layer 2 3 model overview we used visual modflow modular three dimensional finite difference ground water flow model to simulate groundwater movement within peatlands in the study catchment and construct water budget from may to september 2017 using modeling outcomes this software has been widely used to simulate three dimensional groundwater flow and pollutant transport due to its easy to use simulation environment bujakowski et al 2014 cruz fuentes et al 2014 grapes et al 2006 lautz and siegel 2006 xue et al 2018 it adopts a three dimensional model equation of ground motion in porous media harbaugh et al 2000 2 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z w s s h t where kx ky and kz are the hydraulic conductivity m s 1 in horizontal transverse and vertical directions h is the pressure head m w is the rate at which the source and sink flow input and output per unit time s 1 ss is the unit water storage rate m 1 and t is the time s in the model the simulated peatland is treated as a series of discretized three dimensional cells and eq 2 is applied to these cells to simulate the temporal and spatial variations of continuous water volume within the peatland the finite difference method was used in the model to obtain an approximate solution for each cell if the solution may be achieved within a given error range then an output stable water head is produced to represent average groundwater head around the cell simulation requires that each of these three dimensional cells is set for soil parameters and initial water head distribution input parameters of the model include rainfall evapotranspiration boundary water head topographic feature geometrical information of gullies hydraulic conductivity specific storage specific yield effective porosity total porosity and initial water head results of model simulation lead to a water balance formula for calculating the net change of the groundwater in the peatland i e groundwater storage change δs 3 δ s p e t n b w n g w s r where p is the total precipitation of the rainy season et is the total amount of evapotranspiration over the same period nbw is the net change of the amount of groundwater in the boundary ngw is the net change of the groundwater volume of peatland discharged by the gullies and sr is the surface runoff in the rainy season 2 4 model setup and input data since the peat layer in the study catchment becomes thinner as moving toward locations with higher elevations on both western and eastern sides modeling groundwater flow in these thin peats is very difficult if not impossible so we selected a peat zone in the middle of the catchment as the modeling zone i e prototype with the area of 3 89 104 m2 fig 2a its boundary fig 2b was determined in terms of three reasons first it includes both types of gullies which enables examining the impact of gullies on groundwater dynamics and groundwater storage changes second it involves sufficient number of measured discrete water table wt levels which may be used for model calibration and validation third it contains several locations where continuous wt levels were recorded by hobo water level data loggers which allowed for the simulation under the transient head boundary condition peat thickness within the modeling zone varied between 2 90 m and 0 00 m giving rise to the peat volume of 6 79 104 m3 in the preliminary runs the upper peat layer within the simulation zone was divided into a grid of cells whose size was 2 2 m and split vertically in two layers this arrangement resulted in 160 76 cells with the density of 3 2 m2 much less than that set by brixel 2010 and ronkanen and kløve 2008 which was 80 and 9 25 m2 respectively thus the spatial resolution of our model structure is relatively high unfortunately modeling failed because simulation could not converge as such the whole peat layer was treated as one layer and discretized into a series of three dimensional cubes with the size of 2 m2 d m where d is the mean peat thickness within each cube the underneath sandy silt layer was set with the thickness of 20 m therefore the conceptual model is the peatland volume bounded by the orange polygon in fig 2b that contains the peat upper layer and soil lower layer visual modflow requires input of three parameters describing physical properties of peats in the simulation zone sy k and porosity ϕ based on our field measurement the value of sy was set as 0 05 and specific storage ss is 0 001 m 1 values of k we measured in the field were the comprehensive k thus we assume kx ky kz k and set it as 3 89 10 4 m s 1 values of effective and total porosity were not measured directly in the field alternatively we set them as 30 and 80 respectively based on earlier studies heathwaite and göttlich 1993 reeve et al 2000 peatland topography was represented by the mean elevation of each cube which was determined by interpolating the field measured elevation points and taking the average for those falling within each cube the initial boundary condition for simulation was represented by wt levels along the boundary which were determined using the measured wt levels on may 17 2017 using time series of wt levels measured at several locations on the boundary we created temporally variable wt levels along the boundary to provide the transitional head condition for model simulation elevations of the gully bed in the ct sub zone were reconstructed based on field observation and measurements showing that a large proportion of it bottom of gully bog was below the peat layer bottom of peat bop fig 2c in the nct sub zone the bog was well above the bop fig 2d the initial water level in the ct gully was set as 1 m below the peat surface sop and its variation during the simulation period was determined based on the water levels recorded by an installed water logger in the nct gully it was set as 0 2 m below the sop and varied between 0 03 and 0 23 m based on measured wt levels from a nearby dipwell during the simulation period rainfall is the main water input in the zoige peatland in this study hourly precipitation for the simulation period i e may 17 september 17 2017 was approximated using the compiled precipitation data from the nearest weather station hongyuan county meteorological observatory 32 48 n 102 33 e evapotranspiration et in the simulation zone was also estimated from the same weather station using meteorological data including temperature sunshine hours wind speed air pressure and relative humidity values of et in wetlands have been widely calculated using a modified penman monteith p m formula commonly referred to as the fao56 p m method abtew et al 2011 jacobs et al 2002 lott and hunt 2001 mao et al 2002 wossenu 1996 however the et value calculated in this way is only for a reference crop defined as a hypothetical crop with a height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and a reflectivity of 0 23 allen et al 1998 to calculate the true et values for peatland this one needs to be multiplied by a correction factor cp using independently determined cp values which vary seasonally li et al 2013 we calculated hourly et values for the simulating period see detailed calculation in li and gao 2019 under review surface runoff is not specifically simulated in visual modflow instead it is approximated by the drain module imbedded in the model and estimated as a lumped amount of water moving out of the simulation zone without taking part in any hydrological process reeve and gracz 2008 grapes et al 2006 reeve et al 2000 rossi et al 2014 therefore this component was included in the subsequent water budget calculation to understand gully impact on both δs and groundwater flows we selected three sub zones within the simulation zone fig 2b the ct sub zone includes a proportion of the ct gully the nct sub zone contains a proportion of the nct gully and the ng sub zone has no gully within it at all their areas were 3605 99 3594 46 and 1800 00 m2 respectively in addition to the entire simulation zone visual modflow was also used in these three sub zones for the same time periods with the same input parameters 2 5 model calibration and validation the initial wt levels in the simulated area were set at the peat surface to allow free movement of groundwater from january 1 to april 24 2017 then the available p and et data were used as true input data and wt levels along boundaries were remained unchanged until may 17 the beginning of the formal simulation this pre modeling treatment provided sufficient time for groundwater to distribute within the sandy silt i e lower layer the difference between calculated wt levels cal and observed ones obs was used to test the goodness of fit parameters required as input data in the model were calibrated by comparing the 48 and 31 pairs of cal and obs in the simulation area on may 17 and july 17 2017 respectively fig 3 a the resultant rmses were 0 27 and 0 20 m for the two days respectively given that variation of wt levels could be more than 1 m based on our measured continuous water table level data these rmse values are very low in addition the shape of the residuals suggests that there was no spatial autocorrelation that may affect the assessment burt and barber 2009 these calibrated parameters were subsequently validated using the measured wt levels in may 20 34 points may 23 36 points and september 17 26 points the rmses were 0 33 0 31 and 0 12 m for the three days respectively both these relatively low rmses and their error shapes fig 3b indicated that the model was robust for predicting wt levels and groundwater flows in the study area 2 6 analysis water budget that included net input and output of hydrological components was analyzed for both the entire simulation zone and three sub zones the short term climate change during the simulation period i e the wet season was reflected by net water change from the air which was quantitatively expressed as the difference between p and et wp et to specifically characterize its impact on both δs and groundwater flow the entire simulation period that amounted to 124 days was divided into a group of rain periods and that of inter rain periods based on temporal distribution of precipitation in addition all these small periods were further categorized into four classes based on the nature of the distributed et values class 1 et 2 mm class 2 2 mm et 3 mm class 3 3 mm et 4 mm class 4 et 4 mm water budget was subsequently analyzed during these two distinct periods to show different responses of δs to rain and inter rain periods groundwater flows were examined in the vertical direction between the peat layer and its underlying sandy silt layer and the horizontal direction in the peat layer vertical groundwater vgw flows in the four et classes were compared among each other and linked statistically to the associated wt levels during the two types i e rain and inter rain of periods for not only the entire simulation peat zone but also three small sub zones horizontal groundwater hgw flows were examined only for the ct and nct sub zones to reveal their responses to the two different types of gullies along the lateral distances away from the two gullies 3 results and analysis 3 1 water storage change and its dynamic variations 3 1 1 the entire simulation zone during the study period 5 17 2017 9 17 2017 the dominant water input was precipitation p taking 97 42 of the total input this left only 2 58 supplied from the boundary as groundwater gw flow fig 4 a the amount of lost water from the peats was largely from evapotranspiration et 71 62 about 21 03 of it was in the form of surface runoff flowing out of the simulated peatland area gullies developed within the simulated peatland area drained as gw flow about 7 35 of the total out of the system these hydrological paths resulted in the increase of water storage by 487 64 m3 taking about 2 73 of the original stored water i e that on may 17 2017 in the simulated peatland body these values showed that p and et were clearly two dominant factors controlling the change of groundwater storage δs during the inter rain periods input water to the peat layer was predominantly from groundwater moving in from outside of the simulation zone through the boundary and the gullies taking 58 43 and 38 39 respectively fig 4b water loss was almost all due to et the net result was the reduction of stored water i e δs by 2359 47 m3 taking about 13 20 of the original δs value for all individual rain periods the mean δs values were not correlated with the four et classes fig 5 although they were statistically similar based on the analysis of variance anova test individual δs values in particular those in the highest et class may vary greatly for the inter rain periods all δs values and their means in the four et classes were less than zero fig 5 and their means remained statistically similar clearly δs values were more variable in the rain periods than in their counterparts fig 5 3 1 2 the three sub zones although p was still the dominant water input source during the whole periods its contribution to the three sub zones varied from 100 in the ng to 86 36 and 86 55 in the ct and nct sub zones respectively fig 6 a the latter were obviously different from that of the entire simulation zone the remaining 13 84 to the ct sub zone was supplied from the boundary while that of 10 45 in the nct sub zone was supplied from the gully the main water loss was also primarily contributed from et with 72 54 and 72 03 in the ng and nct sub zones respectively this pattern was similar to that of the entire zone but only 48 05 of the total loss was from et in the ct sub zone fig 6a the second largest water loss was from surface runoff in the ng from the gully in the ct and from the boundary in the nct sub zones taking about 20 03 42 32 and 18 50 respectively because wt levels in the ct gully were measured in situ these values measured during rainfall periods were indeed mostly contributed from surface runoff because overland flow moves much faster than gw flow yet the ng sub zone lost water from the boundary by 7 43 while the ct sub zone received water via the boundary thus different types of gullies apparently alter distributions of hydrological components in peatland differently these differences collectively led to different values of δs in the ng ct and nct sub zones which were 6 35 3 17 and 3 95 respectively signifying that gullies in peatlands could also change the variations of water storage in peats the impact of gullies on hydrological components in peats also prevailed in the inter rain periods the ng sub zone had no input water at all while small amount of water moved into the ct sub zone from boundary 65 62 and the gully 32 86 and much more water was seeped through the gully into the nct sub zone fig 6b although et was the main pathway of water loss for all three sub zones 10 26 and 23 25 of the total loss was still through the boundary in the ng and nct sub zones consequently the inter rain periods caused the decrease of δs by 78 56 32 67 and 47 04 mm in the ng ct and nct sub zones taking 16 37 6 81 and 9 80 of the original δs value respectively it should be noted that gullies played different roles during the rain and inter rain periods the nct gully supplied water to the sub zone in both periods with a higher contribution during the inter rain periods fig 6a and b the ct gully received water from the sub zone during the rain periods while supplied water to the sub zone during the inter rain periods among the three sub zones δs values were not well correlated with the four et classes fig s1 which is similar to the case for the entire study watershed suggesting that et and gullies had independent impact on hydrological components and δs in peats 3 2 changes of water table levels and groundwater flows 3 2 1 vertical groundwater vgw flows over the entire simulation zone and three sub zones over the entire simulation zone the mean water table wt levels during the inter rain periods decreased quickly from 0 14 to 0 45 m below the peat surface with the increase of the et classes showing a clear correlation between the two variables fig 7 a during the rain periods however the mean wt levels did not change with the et classes and remained in a range between 0 13 and 0 24 m below the peat surface fig 7b anova test showed that they were statistically similar their pattern over the four et classes was indeed very similar to that of the mean precipitations in the same classes during the inter rain periods the mean vgw flows in the four et classes showed a similar trend to that of the mean wt levels fig 7a in the lowest et class the vgw moved downward with a very small rate but it reversed the flow direction in the remaining higher et classes and gradually increased with the increase of et during the rain periods all of the mean vgw flows in the four et classes moved downward fig 7b which was very different from those during the inter rain periods yet these values showed a similar pattern to those of wt levels in the four et classes indicating a general correlation between wt values and vgw flows the positive relationship only appeared during the inter rain periods these correlations may be further confirmed by strong linear relationships between vgw and et for both inter rain and rain periods fig s2 nonetheless the magnitudes of these mean vgw flows were very low ranging between 0 009 and 0 013 mm d 1 comparing with them the means of vgw flows in the inter rain period were mostly greater ranging between 0 015 and 0 026 mm d 1 except that in the first et class which was 0 004 mm d 1 therefore the vgw flows at the larger spatial scale were generally small but they were well correlated with wt levels during the inter rain periods the mean wt levels were negative in all three sub zones with the lowest ones emerging in the ct sub zone fig 8 a in addition they decreased at a similar rate in the nct and ng sub zones while remained almost unchanged in the ct sub zone anova test was not significant fig 8a the discernable different patterns of wt levels between the former i e the nct and ng sub zones and the latter also echoed in their vgw flows for the nct and ng sub zones the means of vgw flows had very similar patterns fig 8b in the lowest et class they moved downward with relatively low rates while in other higher et classes they changed the direction moving upward yet the means of the vgw flows for the ct sub zone in the four et classes remained roughly unchanged fig 8b the similar patterns between mean wt values and means of vgw flows indicated their correlations that may be evidenced by their linear relationships in all three sub zones fig s3 consistent with that for the entire study area fig s2 during the rain periods the wt levels and mean vgw flows demonstrated different trends fig 8c and d the wt levels were still the lowest in the ct sub zone while higher but showing no trend with the four et classes in the nct and ng sub zones fig 8c although vgw flows for the ct sub zone were still obviously different from those in the other two sub zones they slightly increased with the increase of the et classes fig 8d furthermore vgw flows for the nct and ng sub zones moved downward for all et classes with relatively high rates both changes of vgw flows and wt levels tended to be driven by the changes of mean p values in the four et classes overall these results showed the distinct impact of deeper ct gullies on both wt levels and vgw flows 3 2 2 horizontal groundwater flows around the ct and nct gullies horizontal groundwater hgw flows showed variable trends between the two types of gullies in the four et classes during the inter rain periods fig 9 in the lowest et class the hgw flows at the distance very close to the ct gully moved into the gully with the highest rates as the distance away from the gully on both sides increased the hgw flow continuously moved toward the gully but with decreased rates fig 9a along the lateral direction of the nct gully the hgw flow still moved into the gully within the distance about 8 m away from the gully but the rates of the flow were much less than those around the ct gully fig 9a as this distance further increased the hgw gradually switched its flow direction moving away from the gully this lateral trend was obviously different from that around the ct gully in the second and third et classes the hgw flow generally moved toward the ct gully along the lateral distance away from it fig 9b and c also the hgw flows changed little with their means similar in the two et classes around the nct gully the hgw flow commonly moved away from it with the flow rate higher at the location closest to the gully and lower in other locations in the highest et class the hgw at the location closest to the ct gully flowed away from it with a relatively small rate fig 9d as the distance away from the ct gully increased the hgw flow gradually reduced to zero and then slightly moved toward the gully the hgw flow around the nct gully however moved away from the gully in all modeled locations within 15 m away from the gully fig 9d the flow rate was relatively high at the location closest to the gully and then reduced moving away from the gully there was no clear trend between the spatial patterns of the hgw flows and the et classes during the rain periods the mean hgw flows along the lateral distance away from the ct gully were generally higher than those around the nct gully fig 9e h in the four et classes the mean hgw flows demonstrated a similar pattern starting with a high value at the closest location decreasing quickly till the location of 9 m away from the ct gully and gradually decreasing further with a lower rate the hgw always flowed toward the ct gully even in the highest et class around the nct gully the decreasing pattern of the mean hgw flows was also similar among the four different et classes with the hgw changed the flow direction at the location roughly 9 m away from the nct gully in all four et classes the variation around the mean hgw flows was the highest at the closest location to the ct gully fig 9e h and then decreased quickly moving away from the gully around the nct gully the variation of the hgw flows at the closest location was still the highest one among that along the lateral distance but was less than that around the ct gully at the same location in general the hgw flow moved toward the ct gully and its magnitude either decreased or remained unchanged as the distance away from the ct gully increased 4 discussions 4 1 model limitations and sensitivity analysis as a crucial parameter in groundwater modeling hydraulic conductivity k varies greatly in peats cunliffe et al 2013 holden and burt 2003 unfortunately it is very hard to directly measure its spatial distribution our attempts of using the subroutine in visual modflow i e pest to create anisotropic and heterogeneous k values within the peat layer were not successful because simulations could not converge alternatively we treated k values isotropic as many previous studies did and homogeneous as did in others molina et al 2013 reeve and gracz 2008 ritzema and jansen 2008 ronkanen and kløve 2008 given that our measured k values at different peat depths and different time were variable table 1 we chose to determine the appropriate k value for the model from the result of sensitivity analysis in which measured wt levels were compared with predicted ones for each of the k values within the measured range fig 10 on may 17 2017 and july 17 2017 the difference between predicted and measured wt levels increased generally with k but within a limited range increase of the k value by more than three times i e from 2 to 7 10 6 m s 1 would lead to no more than 42 increase of the difference on september 17 2107 the same increase of k values led to the decrease of the difference but only by 14 these trends indicated that 1 errors in prediction i e the differences were not very sensitive to the change of k values which was consistent with an earlier study ritzema and jansen 2008 and 2 the trends of errors were not always consistent over time thus k 3 89 10 6 m s 1 should be the most appropriate one although determining surface runoff using the drain module imbedded in visual modflow has been a common method grapes et al 2006 reeve and gracz 2008 reeve et al 2000 rossi et al 2014 it implicitly ignored a proportion of runoff moving into gullies within the study watershed during rainfall periods however water levels of flow in gullies used in the model were measured in situ which had included this proportion of runoff this inconsistency could lead to some errors in computation of water balance fortunately the temporal changes of water levels during the entire simulation period were within 0 2 m which mainly happened during rainfall periods thus this uncertainty would cause limited errors in determining δs values 4 2 climatic and gully impact on water storage in the disturbed peatlands for the entire simulation zone the amount of supplied groundwater from ambient areas only took about 3 of the total input water during the rain periods but more than 59 during the inter rain periods fig 4a and b nonetheless in both periods either p et or both dominated hydrological input and output thus values of δs were mainly controlled by relative magnitudes of p and et i e the difference between p and et wp et vicissitudes of rain and inter rain periods in the wet season may september which represents short term climate change could cause oscillation of δs between positive and negative values fig 11 during the rain periods the greater the wp et value the greater the increase of water storage while during the inter rain i e dry periods et caused the loss of water storage but the magnitude of the loss was not only controlled by et values for instance groundwater input could be an important contributing factor as shown in fig 4b the opposite trends of δs between rain and dry periods gave rise to a very complex temporal pattern of δs that is it altered temporally between positive and negative over the whole modeling period i e 124 days to understand these temporal changes over a long time period we calculated the actual daily amount of water stored in peats as follow after interpolating the measured wt levels on may 17 2017 using a kriging method we obtained the initial spatially distributed wt levels in the study watershed and subsequently calculated the volume of the saturated peats which was 596000 m3 assuming the effective porosity is 30 heathwaite and johnes 1996 reeve et al 2000 and pore water in the unsaturated upper peat layer is negligible we could determine the initial amount of stored water s 0 which was then unified by dividing the area of the study watershed i e 38859 m2 using s 0 and δs temporal changes of water storage may be finally determined up to the end of december 2017 fig 12 which clearly signified that the amount of water stored in the peat layer highly varied from time to time though the degree of variation was no more than 5 6 given that the annual climate change of the study area i e the zoige basin is featured by the cycle of dry and wet seasons this result i e fig 12 may be repeated for many years and thus provided a reasonable projection on the impact of long term climate change on water storage in peats nevertheless whether this degree of variation may have significant ecological impact on the peat degradation is yet unclear putra et al 2018 during the full modeling period water storage increased in all three sub zones suggesting that the impact of climatic changes i e wp et on water storage in peats is greater than that of gullies furthermore during the dry periods with et values in the three high classes the decreasing rate of storage water in the ng sub zone was higher than that in the nct sub zone which was higher than that in the ct sub zone fig s1 this apparently suggests that the disturbed peatland lost less stored water than the blanket peatland under the similar dry weather conditions which is at odds with our field observation that in many ct gullies groundwater seepage is discernable from the gully banks around the bottom of the peat layer li and gao 2019 indicating greater loss of stored water in peats we can examine this phenomenon from a different perspective over the dry periods both ct and nct gullies supplied water to their surrounding peats and the nct gully supplied much more water than the ct gully fig 6b suggesting that flow depths in the gully on average were higher than hydraulic heads of the neighboring peats and this difference was greater in the nct than in the ct gully the fact that gullies both ct and nct in the entire simulation zone supplied a significant amount water to the surrounding peats fig 4b suggested that the hydraulic gradient from gullies to the neighboring peats prevailed over the entire simulation zone during the dry periods the possible explanation is that sufficient water was supplied to the gullies during the rain periods such that gully flows were capable of retaining at relatively high levels during the dry periods despite of precedent fast draining this kind of hysteresis effect may be further corroborated by the fact that hgw flowed from the gully to the simulated peats most of time fig 9 however this trend of hydraulic gradient gradually diminished as the dry periods continued our calculation of water balance for the 11 1 12 31 2017 showed that both p and et were small due to dry and cold weather and thus had much less influence on water balance of the peatland under this condition the ct gully was the main pathway of water output from the peatland even if water was supplied to it from its ambient areas while the nct gully did not have significant net water movement fig 13 thus a higher amount of stored water decreased in the ct sub zone 35 67 mm than that in the nct 29 35 mm and ng 21 76 mm sub zones this extended analysis reveals the impact of long term climate change on peat groundwater storage specified as follow first the role of ct gullies in draining additional stored water in peats takes effect over the prolonged dry period in winter and spring in the zoige basin second nct gullies have very limited effect on δs thus it is very important to control development of deep gullies for restoring peatland ecosystem 4 3 climatic and gully impact on groundwater flow in the disturbed peatland our results showed that hgw was about 10 times higher than vgw this suggests that groundwater exchange between the peat i e upper and soil lower layers is not the main hydrological process affecting water storage in peats possibly due to the fact that the study peatland is topographically controlled by a relatively steep slope hare et al 2017 millar et al 2018 yet both vgw and hgw were subject to the coupled impact of climate change and gullies over the entire simulation zone vgw flows were downward during the rain periods with very low rates and mostly upward with the rate increasing as et increases these patterns were essentially controlled by wt levels that demonstrated similar patterns suggesting that the impact of climate change on vgw flows was achieved by altering wt levels which essentially changed vertical hydraulic heads of peats li and gao 2019 although the strong wt vgw correlation in the three sub zones suggests that the controlling role of wt on vgw was not changed by gullies either ct or nct the impact of gullies on the vgw flows was evidenced by the consistent patterns of vgw flows among the three sub zone in both rain and dry periods vgw flows in the ct sub zone always moved upward even during the rainfall periods when these flows moved downward in nct and ng sub zones this means that the hydrological role of the ct gully is lowering wt levels by allowing more groundwater seep into it such that hydraulic heads in the peat layer was mostly lower than that in the underlined soil layer the climatic impact adding to that of gullies on vgw flows was highlighted by much higher upward vgw flows in the dry periods than in the rainfall periods for the ct sub zone and inversion of vgw flow direction between the upward and downward directions during the two types of periods for ng and nct periods inasmuch as groundwater flow is dominated by hgw flows their variations under the influence of both climate change and gullies should be more important for understanding dynamic changes of water storage in peats gullies clearly affected hgw flows along the lateral distance away from them in general hgw flowed toward the ct gully during both rain and dry periods but it decreased as the distance away from the gully increased with the rate of decrease declined obviously after the distance about 8 m away from the ct gully fig 9 hgw in the nct gully along the lateral direction generally flowed away from the gully in the distance near the gully and then may flip the flow direction at the distance around the similar distance away from the gully it appears that the distance of about 8 m away from the gully is a threshold within this distance the magnitude of hwg flow for the rain periods was always larger around the ct gully than the nct one yet beyond this distance hwg around the ct gully still flowed in the same direction during the rain periods while it reversed the direction around the nct gully during the dry periods this threshold distance merely existed with et values in class 1 fig 9 nonetheless hwg mostly flowed toward the ct gully and away from the nct gully except for et values in class 4 this threshold behavior is consistent with the distance decay effect of wt drawdown allott et al 2009 holden et al 2006 luscombe et al 2016 nonetheless our results manifested that this effect mainly occurred around the ct gully furthermore hgw consistently flowed out of the ct gully during the dry periods explained the larger amount of stored water lost around the ct gully fig 13 5 conclusions groundwater storage and flow in peatland are very sensitive to climate change both short and long terms and topographic disturbance their spatial and temporal responses to these two factors are extremely hard to capture by in situ measurements alternatively this study took on this issue by combining modeling analysis with limited but sufficient field sampling we investigated temporal changes of groundwater storage in the zoige peatland and dynamic patterns of groundwater flows under the coupled influence of climate change and gullies it was achieved by using visual modflow to simulate dynamics of groundwater movement in a peat zone with the area of 3 89 104 m2 that included two deep ct gullies and a few shallow nct gullies as well as three sub zones that had no gullies ng one nct gully nct and a ct gully ct the subsequent construction of water budget and analyses of vertical and horizontal groundwater flow provided new insight into the complex impact of climate change and gullies on groundwater storage and flows the short term climate change is characterized by the oscillation of the difference between p and et wp et it controlled the frequent shift of loss and gain of groundwater storage in peatland during the wet season of a year yet the fact that changes of groundwater storage δs during inter rain periods were not correlated with et values suggested that this control effect is more complicated values of δs during a given inter rain period are not only determined by the et value but also the δs value in its immediately earlier rain period we call this as a hysteresis effect in groundwater processes this effect is further confirmed by the fact that during inter rain periods peats in ng sub zone lost more groundwater than nct and ct sub zones during the wet season though the impact of short term climate change outweighed that of gullies on δs values deep gullies significantly caused higher horizontal groundwater hgw flows in the areas near the gully which is consistent with the well known water table dropdown effect water table wt levels were strongly correlated with vertical groundwater vgw flows however δs values should not be significantly affected by variations of wt levels because vgw is negligible compared with hgw flows which further raises question of determining δs using the product of peat specific yield and the change of wt levels the effect of long term climate change on δs values was represented by the continuous decrease of δs during the prolonged dry period this impact is enhanced by deep gullies that may produce sustainable hgw flows though the magnitudes of these flows may be small clearly our findings highlight the critical role of deep gullies in reducing peat groundwater storage under both short term and long term climate changes future peatland restoration in the zoige basin of china should focus on restricting development of existing deep gullies and preventing creation of new artificial ditches declaration of competing interest

6365,climate change and gullies and ditches on peatlands are well known factors altering peat hydrology yet exactly how this alteration emerges from interaction of these factors with groundwater dynamics is still not fully understood in this study we tackled this issue by coupling field measurement with model simulation using visual modflow groundwater processes and the associated water budget during five months of the wet season 2017 were examined in the zoige peatland located on the northeastern side of qinghai tibet plateau china with elevations of 3400 3900 m simulations were performed for a peatland area of 3 89 104 m2 and three sub zones within it representing peatland with no gullies ng a deep gully cutting through the peat layer ct and a shallow gully whose bed is within the peat layer nct model input parameters were calibrated and validated using the field measured data modeling outcomes led to water budget showing relative contributions of main hydrological pathways mhps i e precipitation p evapotranspiration et gully groundwater flow and boundary to changes of water storage in peats δs although these mhps varied differently during rain and inter rain periods δs values were mainly controlled by the oscillated trend of the difference between p and et variations of mhps caused by nct and ct were secondary to those due to those of p and et during the wet season referred to as the short term climate change vertical groundwater vgw flows were strongly correlated with water table wt levels in both rain and inter rain periods but their directions had different patterns in the two periods horizontal groundwater hgw flows tended to move into the deep ct gully while move from the shallow nct gully to the neighbor peats during both periods since hgw flows were about ten times greater than vgw ones their effect on δs was significant during the long dry season this would lead to continuous loss of groundwater stored in peats demonstrating the coupled effect of long term climate change and gullies on δs these findings underline the necessity of controlling gully development and avoiding ditch excavation in future zoige peatland management practices keywords groundwater flow groundwater storage change water budget disturbed peatland climate change modflow 1 introduction the unique physical properties of peats make peatlands rich of water carbon and nutrient shi et al 2015 therefore peatland degradation due to natural processes such as climate change and development of gullies and anthropogenic influence such as ditch excavation and grazing negatively affects peatland ecosystems and ecological functions holden et al 2004 wilson et al 2011 particularly those more vulnerable such as the zoige basin in the qinghai tibet plateau china zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 although degradation of peatland essentially refers to transformation of organics to inorganic mineral soils decomposition caused by biogeochemical processes and microbial activities holden et al 2007 ramchunder et al 2009 these processes and activities are closely related to changes of peatland hydrology for a given peatland unit a site plot or catchment peatland hydrology includes surface runoff subsurface flow that mainly consists of macropore and pipe flows and groundwater flow labadz et al 2010 these flow paths are controlled by precipitation and evapotranspiration interaction between these flow paths and control factors drives the change of groundwater storage in peatland which finally affects physical properties of peats e g porosity moisture contents specific yield and hydraulic conductivity price and whitehead 2001 therefore determining groundwater storage and its change in peatland is essential for revealing the complex mechanisms that cause peatland degradation theoretically groundwater storage change δs for a given time interval is a function of peat specific yield sy and the associated water table wt change assuming peatland is an unconfined aquifer however many field studies and modeling analyses indicated that values of sy vary spatially and temporally not only among different peatlands but also within itself particularly they vary along peat vertical profiles with inconsistent patterns among different peatlands price 1992 price 1996 ronkanen and klove 2005 sumner 2007 moreover wt varies spatially and temporally holden et al 2011 luscombe et al 2016 the spatial variation may be due to topography at the local scale or caused by natural gullies and artificial ditches leading to the lateral dropdown effect and unevenly distributed wt levels on both sides of ditches the temporal variation could be either varying between day and night or seasonally evans and warburton 2007 thus determining sy and wt variation involve various uncertainties in addition to these uncertainties a more fundamental challenge lies in the fact that changes of wt can also be caused by peat expansion and compaction which could contribute up to 60 of δs values kellner and halldin 2002 price and schlotzhauer 1999 these uncertainties and challenges undermine the reliability of direct calculating δs in peatlands that have relatively large areas an alternative approach to determining δs relies on constructing water balance of a peatland fraser et al 2001b price 1996 van seters and price 2001 1 p e t r δ s ε where p is the precipitation et is the evapotranspiration r is the runoff and ɛ is the residual term this approach implicitly assumes that the groundwater gw exchange is small such that it may be ignored and lumped into the residual term evans and warburton 2007 nonetheless even during rainfall events vertical gw exchanges may be measurable fraser et al 2001a in the inter rain periods the impact of gw flows on δs may not be negligible for instance diffuse seepage of gw was observed in ditches cutting through the peat layer rossi et al 2012 suggesting relatively strong movement of gw flows which may possibly contribute to δs however the interaction between gw flows and δs under the influence of ditches is apparently intricate and still not well known since natural gullies and or artificial ditches are widespread in peatlands all over the world fisher et al 1996 gatis et al 2016 joosten et al 2008 labadz et al 2010 li et al 2018 ronkanen and klove 2005 sikstrom and hokka 2016 whittington and price 2006 understanding hydrological processes controlling this complex interaction is valuable for better managing peatland ecosystem dahl et al 2007 particularly in remote alpine peatland where deploying an intensive sampling campaign is often challenging in this study we examined this interaction in a small peatland catchment in the zoige basin china using visual modflow model calibrated and validated by field measured data based on simulated results spanning over 124 days from may 17 to september 17 2017 we elaborated quantitative contribution of each hydrological and climatic factor to water balance of the peatland then we demonstrated different responses of δs to the climate change represented as the rain and inter rain periods and gullies which was followed by examining responses of both vertical and horizontal gw flows to these two factors the study was closed by revealing the impact of long term climate change and deep gullies on δs and gw flows our findings provided first hand knowledge of groundwater hydrology in this rare alpine peatland that has not been studied from the process based perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area zoige basin is situated in the yellow river source region on the northeastern side of qinghai tibet plateau china fig 1 a and b where it develops the world s largest alpine peatland at the elevations of 3400 3900 m the annual average rainfall of zoige basin is about 765 mm most of which is mainly concentrated in the june september period since 1950s the air temperature has increased by about 0 2 c per decade and the annual rainfall has varied with no distinct trend yang et al 2017 li et al 2015 evapotranspiration is related to land use types and climate change ranging between 450 and 550 mm per year with a slightly increasing trend annually zhao et al 2014 the area of zoige peatland is about 5098 km2 accounting for 49 of the total peatland area in china and the organic carbon storage in this region is roughly 0 477 pg accounting for 32 of that stored in the qinghai tibet plateau wang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 in addition zoige peatland stores groundwater up to several billions of cubic meters unfortunately affected by climate change and human activities zoige peatland has experienced degradation since the 1950s with an annual degradation rate of about 10 jeopardizing local aquatic ecosystems and water resources utilization in the upper yellow river system bai et al 2008 huo et al 2013 li et al 2010 yang et al 2017 as ombrotrophic mires zoige peats are annually replenished by precipitation and their stored water is reduced by evapotranspiration and further drained out by natural gullies and artificial ditches li et al 2018 li et al 2015 thus understanding dynamic changes of stored groundwater in zoige peatland is crucial for developing best management practices to stop degradation our study catchment is located in a small tributary of the upper black river with the area of about 0 151 km2 fig 1c its west and east sides are surrounded by hillsides and the south side is the high end of this catchment the mainstream of the catchment flows into the north from the southwest direction converged by a few tributaries with variable sizes since all of the channels are developed on upland of the upper black river they may be geomorphologically treated as gullies the peat layer within the catchment varies between 0 and 2 m thick underlain by a sandy silt layer with the median diameter varying between 0 039 mm and 0 651 mm in this study gullies are divided into two categories in the first category deep gullies cut through the peat layer making their beds lower than the bottom of the peat layer and hence possibly allowing more groundwater to seep out from the boundary between the top peat and bottom soil layers in the second one shallow gullies have the bed whose depth is less than the peat layer thickness such that the entire gully is within the peat layer hereafter these two types of gullies are referred to as the ct fig 1d and nct fig 1e gullies respectively according to this definition the mainstream and the longest tributary are the ct gullies with the total length of about 1014 4 m the mean width of 1 3 m and the deepest depth up to 1 5 m while others are nct gullies with the total length of 1458 6 m and very shallow depths fig 1c 2 2 data acquisition we measured topography peat layer thickness wt levels specific yield and hydraulic conductivity in 2016 and 2017 in the study catchment using a differential gps trimble r2 that has vertical and horizontal accuracies of 0 85 and 0 50 m respectively we collected 831 elevation points across the catchment and converted them using a kriging interpolation method into dem data that had a mean plane resolution of 13 m fig 1c peats in the study area were generally deep in and near the valley and shallow toward the east and west edges with relatively steep slopes we measured peat depths at 119 locations and interpolated them throughout the entire study area to obtain spatially variable distribution of peat thickness both dem and peat depths in the simulation zone were used as a prototype for defining the simulated peat volume and constructing the conceptual model we also measured wt levels within the study catchment using self made dipwells each of which was 110 cm long and 0 02 m wide in diameter and was pushed or hammed into the peat for at least 1 m deep on may 17th 20th and 23th july 17th and september 18th wt levels at 114 103 105 77 and 81 locations distributed within the student catchment were manually measured respectively fig 2 a furthermore several automatic water loggers hobo were installed in gullies and inserted under the peat surface to measured continuous wt levels fig 2a some of these data were used to determine daily water levels in the gully and to create dynamic wt levels along the boundary of the simulation zone i e the boundary conditions specific yield sy of peats was measured by taking a total of 36 samples from three different locations and in different peat depths using the method described by price 1992 the measured sy values did not show much variation along the peat depth and its mean among three locations ranged between 0 02 and 0 05 hydraulic conductivity k was measured using self made piezometers following the procedure laid out by chason and siegel 1986 this procedure does not distinguish horizontal from vertical k and thus is a comprehensive k measured values of k varied in the range of 0 35 0 89 10 6 m s 1 generally the sandy silt layer beneath the peats has less permeability since the median size of the sandy silts was about 0 039 mm the value of k should be between 1 and 2 10 5 m s 1 zheng and bennett 2002 given that k in a silt layer is typically 10 1 100 1 times less than that in a peat layer ronkanen and kløve 2008 it is reasonable to set k 1 10 8 m s 1 for the sandy silt layer 2 3 model overview we used visual modflow modular three dimensional finite difference ground water flow model to simulate groundwater movement within peatlands in the study catchment and construct water budget from may to september 2017 using modeling outcomes this software has been widely used to simulate three dimensional groundwater flow and pollutant transport due to its easy to use simulation environment bujakowski et al 2014 cruz fuentes et al 2014 grapes et al 2006 lautz and siegel 2006 xue et al 2018 it adopts a three dimensional model equation of ground motion in porous media harbaugh et al 2000 2 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z w s s h t where kx ky and kz are the hydraulic conductivity m s 1 in horizontal transverse and vertical directions h is the pressure head m w is the rate at which the source and sink flow input and output per unit time s 1 ss is the unit water storage rate m 1 and t is the time s in the model the simulated peatland is treated as a series of discretized three dimensional cells and eq 2 is applied to these cells to simulate the temporal and spatial variations of continuous water volume within the peatland the finite difference method was used in the model to obtain an approximate solution for each cell if the solution may be achieved within a given error range then an output stable water head is produced to represent average groundwater head around the cell simulation requires that each of these three dimensional cells is set for soil parameters and initial water head distribution input parameters of the model include rainfall evapotranspiration boundary water head topographic feature geometrical information of gullies hydraulic conductivity specific storage specific yield effective porosity total porosity and initial water head results of model simulation lead to a water balance formula for calculating the net change of the groundwater in the peatland i e groundwater storage change δs 3 δ s p e t n b w n g w s r where p is the total precipitation of the rainy season et is the total amount of evapotranspiration over the same period nbw is the net change of the amount of groundwater in the boundary ngw is the net change of the groundwater volume of peatland discharged by the gullies and sr is the surface runoff in the rainy season 2 4 model setup and input data since the peat layer in the study catchment becomes thinner as moving toward locations with higher elevations on both western and eastern sides modeling groundwater flow in these thin peats is very difficult if not impossible so we selected a peat zone in the middle of the catchment as the modeling zone i e prototype with the area of 3 89 104 m2 fig 2a its boundary fig 2b was determined in terms of three reasons first it includes both types of gullies which enables examining the impact of gullies on groundwater dynamics and groundwater storage changes second it involves sufficient number of measured discrete water table wt levels which may be used for model calibration and validation third it contains several locations where continuous wt levels were recorded by hobo water level data loggers which allowed for the simulation under the transient head boundary condition peat thickness within the modeling zone varied between 2 90 m and 0 00 m giving rise to the peat volume of 6 79 104 m3 in the preliminary runs the upper peat layer within the simulation zone was divided into a grid of cells whose size was 2 2 m and split vertically in two layers this arrangement resulted in 160 76 cells with the density of 3 2 m2 much less than that set by brixel 2010 and ronkanen and kløve 2008 which was 80 and 9 25 m2 respectively thus the spatial resolution of our model structure is relatively high unfortunately modeling failed because simulation could not converge as such the whole peat layer was treated as one layer and discretized into a series of three dimensional cubes with the size of 2 m2 d m where d is the mean peat thickness within each cube the underneath sandy silt layer was set with the thickness of 20 m therefore the conceptual model is the peatland volume bounded by the orange polygon in fig 2b that contains the peat upper layer and soil lower layer visual modflow requires input of three parameters describing physical properties of peats in the simulation zone sy k and porosity ϕ based on our field measurement the value of sy was set as 0 05 and specific storage ss is 0 001 m 1 values of k we measured in the field were the comprehensive k thus we assume kx ky kz k and set it as 3 89 10 4 m s 1 values of effective and total porosity were not measured directly in the field alternatively we set them as 30 and 80 respectively based on earlier studies heathwaite and göttlich 1993 reeve et al 2000 peatland topography was represented by the mean elevation of each cube which was determined by interpolating the field measured elevation points and taking the average for those falling within each cube the initial boundary condition for simulation was represented by wt levels along the boundary which were determined using the measured wt levels on may 17 2017 using time series of wt levels measured at several locations on the boundary we created temporally variable wt levels along the boundary to provide the transitional head condition for model simulation elevations of the gully bed in the ct sub zone were reconstructed based on field observation and measurements showing that a large proportion of it bottom of gully bog was below the peat layer bottom of peat bop fig 2c in the nct sub zone the bog was well above the bop fig 2d the initial water level in the ct gully was set as 1 m below the peat surface sop and its variation during the simulation period was determined based on the water levels recorded by an installed water logger in the nct gully it was set as 0 2 m below the sop and varied between 0 03 and 0 23 m based on measured wt levels from a nearby dipwell during the simulation period rainfall is the main water input in the zoige peatland in this study hourly precipitation for the simulation period i e may 17 september 17 2017 was approximated using the compiled precipitation data from the nearest weather station hongyuan county meteorological observatory 32 48 n 102 33 e evapotranspiration et in the simulation zone was also estimated from the same weather station using meteorological data including temperature sunshine hours wind speed air pressure and relative humidity values of et in wetlands have been widely calculated using a modified penman monteith p m formula commonly referred to as the fao56 p m method abtew et al 2011 jacobs et al 2002 lott and hunt 2001 mao et al 2002 wossenu 1996 however the et value calculated in this way is only for a reference crop defined as a hypothetical crop with a height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and a reflectivity of 0 23 allen et al 1998 to calculate the true et values for peatland this one needs to be multiplied by a correction factor cp using independently determined cp values which vary seasonally li et al 2013 we calculated hourly et values for the simulating period see detailed calculation in li and gao 2019 under review surface runoff is not specifically simulated in visual modflow instead it is approximated by the drain module imbedded in the model and estimated as a lumped amount of water moving out of the simulation zone without taking part in any hydrological process reeve and gracz 2008 grapes et al 2006 reeve et al 2000 rossi et al 2014 therefore this component was included in the subsequent water budget calculation to understand gully impact on both δs and groundwater flows we selected three sub zones within the simulation zone fig 2b the ct sub zone includes a proportion of the ct gully the nct sub zone contains a proportion of the nct gully and the ng sub zone has no gully within it at all their areas were 3605 99 3594 46 and 1800 00 m2 respectively in addition to the entire simulation zone visual modflow was also used in these three sub zones for the same time periods with the same input parameters 2 5 model calibration and validation the initial wt levels in the simulated area were set at the peat surface to allow free movement of groundwater from january 1 to april 24 2017 then the available p and et data were used as true input data and wt levels along boundaries were remained unchanged until may 17 the beginning of the formal simulation this pre modeling treatment provided sufficient time for groundwater to distribute within the sandy silt i e lower layer the difference between calculated wt levels cal and observed ones obs was used to test the goodness of fit parameters required as input data in the model were calibrated by comparing the 48 and 31 pairs of cal and obs in the simulation area on may 17 and july 17 2017 respectively fig 3 a the resultant rmses were 0 27 and 0 20 m for the two days respectively given that variation of wt levels could be more than 1 m based on our measured continuous water table level data these rmse values are very low in addition the shape of the residuals suggests that there was no spatial autocorrelation that may affect the assessment burt and barber 2009 these calibrated parameters were subsequently validated using the measured wt levels in may 20 34 points may 23 36 points and september 17 26 points the rmses were 0 33 0 31 and 0 12 m for the three days respectively both these relatively low rmses and their error shapes fig 3b indicated that the model was robust for predicting wt levels and groundwater flows in the study area 2 6 analysis water budget that included net input and output of hydrological components was analyzed for both the entire simulation zone and three sub zones the short term climate change during the simulation period i e the wet season was reflected by net water change from the air which was quantitatively expressed as the difference between p and et wp et to specifically characterize its impact on both δs and groundwater flow the entire simulation period that amounted to 124 days was divided into a group of rain periods and that of inter rain periods based on temporal distribution of precipitation in addition all these small periods were further categorized into four classes based on the nature of the distributed et values class 1 et 2 mm class 2 2 mm et 3 mm class 3 3 mm et 4 mm class 4 et 4 mm water budget was subsequently analyzed during these two distinct periods to show different responses of δs to rain and inter rain periods groundwater flows were examined in the vertical direction between the peat layer and its underlying sandy silt layer and the horizontal direction in the peat layer vertical groundwater vgw flows in the four et classes were compared among each other and linked statistically to the associated wt levels during the two types i e rain and inter rain of periods for not only the entire simulation peat zone but also three small sub zones horizontal groundwater hgw flows were examined only for the ct and nct sub zones to reveal their responses to the two different types of gullies along the lateral distances away from the two gullies 3 results and analysis 3 1 water storage change and its dynamic variations 3 1 1 the entire simulation zone during the study period 5 17 2017 9 17 2017 the dominant water input was precipitation p taking 97 42 of the total input this left only 2 58 supplied from the boundary as groundwater gw flow fig 4 a the amount of lost water from the peats was largely from evapotranspiration et 71 62 about 21 03 of it was in the form of surface runoff flowing out of the simulated peatland area gullies developed within the simulated peatland area drained as gw flow about 7 35 of the total out of the system these hydrological paths resulted in the increase of water storage by 487 64 m3 taking about 2 73 of the original stored water i e that on may 17 2017 in the simulated peatland body these values showed that p and et were clearly two dominant factors controlling the change of groundwater storage δs during the inter rain periods input water to the peat layer was predominantly from groundwater moving in from outside of the simulation zone through the boundary and the gullies taking 58 43 and 38 39 respectively fig 4b water loss was almost all due to et the net result was the reduction of stored water i e δs by 2359 47 m3 taking about 13 20 of the original δs value for all individual rain periods the mean δs values were not correlated with the four et classes fig 5 although they were statistically similar based on the analysis of variance anova test individual δs values in particular those in the highest et class may vary greatly for the inter rain periods all δs values and their means in the four et classes were less than zero fig 5 and their means remained statistically similar clearly δs values were more variable in the rain periods than in their counterparts fig 5 3 1 2 the three sub zones although p was still the dominant water input source during the whole periods its contribution to the three sub zones varied from 100 in the ng to 86 36 and 86 55 in the ct and nct sub zones respectively fig 6 a the latter were obviously different from that of the entire simulation zone the remaining 13 84 to the ct sub zone was supplied from the boundary while that of 10 45 in the nct sub zone was supplied from the gully the main water loss was also primarily contributed from et with 72 54 and 72 03 in the ng and nct sub zones respectively this pattern was similar to that of the entire zone but only 48 05 of the total loss was from et in the ct sub zone fig 6a the second largest water loss was from surface runoff in the ng from the gully in the ct and from the boundary in the nct sub zones taking about 20 03 42 32 and 18 50 respectively because wt levels in the ct gully were measured in situ these values measured during rainfall periods were indeed mostly contributed from surface runoff because overland flow moves much faster than gw flow yet the ng sub zone lost water from the boundary by 7 43 while the ct sub zone received water via the boundary thus different types of gullies apparently alter distributions of hydrological components in peatland differently these differences collectively led to different values of δs in the ng ct and nct sub zones which were 6 35 3 17 and 3 95 respectively signifying that gullies in peatlands could also change the variations of water storage in peats the impact of gullies on hydrological components in peats also prevailed in the inter rain periods the ng sub zone had no input water at all while small amount of water moved into the ct sub zone from boundary 65 62 and the gully 32 86 and much more water was seeped through the gully into the nct sub zone fig 6b although et was the main pathway of water loss for all three sub zones 10 26 and 23 25 of the total loss was still through the boundary in the ng and nct sub zones consequently the inter rain periods caused the decrease of δs by 78 56 32 67 and 47 04 mm in the ng ct and nct sub zones taking 16 37 6 81 and 9 80 of the original δs value respectively it should be noted that gullies played different roles during the rain and inter rain periods the nct gully supplied water to the sub zone in both periods with a higher contribution during the inter rain periods fig 6a and b the ct gully received water from the sub zone during the rain periods while supplied water to the sub zone during the inter rain periods among the three sub zones δs values were not well correlated with the four et classes fig s1 which is similar to the case for the entire study watershed suggesting that et and gullies had independent impact on hydrological components and δs in peats 3 2 changes of water table levels and groundwater flows 3 2 1 vertical groundwater vgw flows over the entire simulation zone and three sub zones over the entire simulation zone the mean water table wt levels during the inter rain periods decreased quickly from 0 14 to 0 45 m below the peat surface with the increase of the et classes showing a clear correlation between the two variables fig 7 a during the rain periods however the mean wt levels did not change with the et classes and remained in a range between 0 13 and 0 24 m below the peat surface fig 7b anova test showed that they were statistically similar their pattern over the four et classes was indeed very similar to that of the mean precipitations in the same classes during the inter rain periods the mean vgw flows in the four et classes showed a similar trend to that of the mean wt levels fig 7a in the lowest et class the vgw moved downward with a very small rate but it reversed the flow direction in the remaining higher et classes and gradually increased with the increase of et during the rain periods all of the mean vgw flows in the four et classes moved downward fig 7b which was very different from those during the inter rain periods yet these values showed a similar pattern to those of wt levels in the four et classes indicating a general correlation between wt values and vgw flows the positive relationship only appeared during the inter rain periods these correlations may be further confirmed by strong linear relationships between vgw and et for both inter rain and rain periods fig s2 nonetheless the magnitudes of these mean vgw flows were very low ranging between 0 009 and 0 013 mm d 1 comparing with them the means of vgw flows in the inter rain period were mostly greater ranging between 0 015 and 0 026 mm d 1 except that in the first et class which was 0 004 mm d 1 therefore the vgw flows at the larger spatial scale were generally small but they were well correlated with wt levels during the inter rain periods the mean wt levels were negative in all three sub zones with the lowest ones emerging in the ct sub zone fig 8 a in addition they decreased at a similar rate in the nct and ng sub zones while remained almost unchanged in the ct sub zone anova test was not significant fig 8a the discernable different patterns of wt levels between the former i e the nct and ng sub zones and the latter also echoed in their vgw flows for the nct and ng sub zones the means of vgw flows had very similar patterns fig 8b in the lowest et class they moved downward with relatively low rates while in other higher et classes they changed the direction moving upward yet the means of the vgw flows for the ct sub zone in the four et classes remained roughly unchanged fig 8b the similar patterns between mean wt values and means of vgw flows indicated their correlations that may be evidenced by their linear relationships in all three sub zones fig s3 consistent with that for the entire study area fig s2 during the rain periods the wt levels and mean vgw flows demonstrated different trends fig 8c and d the wt levels were still the lowest in the ct sub zone while higher but showing no trend with the four et classes in the nct and ng sub zones fig 8c although vgw flows for the ct sub zone were still obviously different from those in the other two sub zones they slightly increased with the increase of the et classes fig 8d furthermore vgw flows for the nct and ng sub zones moved downward for all et classes with relatively high rates both changes of vgw flows and wt levels tended to be driven by the changes of mean p values in the four et classes overall these results showed the distinct impact of deeper ct gullies on both wt levels and vgw flows 3 2 2 horizontal groundwater flows around the ct and nct gullies horizontal groundwater hgw flows showed variable trends between the two types of gullies in the four et classes during the inter rain periods fig 9 in the lowest et class the hgw flows at the distance very close to the ct gully moved into the gully with the highest rates as the distance away from the gully on both sides increased the hgw flow continuously moved toward the gully but with decreased rates fig 9a along the lateral direction of the nct gully the hgw flow still moved into the gully within the distance about 8 m away from the gully but the rates of the flow were much less than those around the ct gully fig 9a as this distance further increased the hgw gradually switched its flow direction moving away from the gully this lateral trend was obviously different from that around the ct gully in the second and third et classes the hgw flow generally moved toward the ct gully along the lateral distance away from it fig 9b and c also the hgw flows changed little with their means similar in the two et classes around the nct gully the hgw flow commonly moved away from it with the flow rate higher at the location closest to the gully and lower in other locations in the highest et class the hgw at the location closest to the ct gully flowed away from it with a relatively small rate fig 9d as the distance away from the ct gully increased the hgw flow gradually reduced to zero and then slightly moved toward the gully the hgw flow around the nct gully however moved away from the gully in all modeled locations within 15 m away from the gully fig 9d the flow rate was relatively high at the location closest to the gully and then reduced moving away from the gully there was no clear trend between the spatial patterns of the hgw flows and the et classes during the rain periods the mean hgw flows along the lateral distance away from the ct gully were generally higher than those around the nct gully fig 9e h in the four et classes the mean hgw flows demonstrated a similar pattern starting with a high value at the closest location decreasing quickly till the location of 9 m away from the ct gully and gradually decreasing further with a lower rate the hgw always flowed toward the ct gully even in the highest et class around the nct gully the decreasing pattern of the mean hgw flows was also similar among the four different et classes with the hgw changed the flow direction at the location roughly 9 m away from the nct gully in all four et classes the variation around the mean hgw flows was the highest at the closest location to the ct gully fig 9e h and then decreased quickly moving away from the gully around the nct gully the variation of the hgw flows at the closest location was still the highest one among that along the lateral distance but was less than that around the ct gully at the same location in general the hgw flow moved toward the ct gully and its magnitude either decreased or remained unchanged as the distance away from the ct gully increased 4 discussions 4 1 model limitations and sensitivity analysis as a crucial parameter in groundwater modeling hydraulic conductivity k varies greatly in peats cunliffe et al 2013 holden and burt 2003 unfortunately it is very hard to directly measure its spatial distribution our attempts of using the subroutine in visual modflow i e pest to create anisotropic and heterogeneous k values within the peat layer were not successful because simulations could not converge alternatively we treated k values isotropic as many previous studies did and homogeneous as did in others molina et al 2013 reeve and gracz 2008 ritzema and jansen 2008 ronkanen and kløve 2008 given that our measured k values at different peat depths and different time were variable table 1 we chose to determine the appropriate k value for the model from the result of sensitivity analysis in which measured wt levels were compared with predicted ones for each of the k values within the measured range fig 10 on may 17 2017 and july 17 2017 the difference between predicted and measured wt levels increased generally with k but within a limited range increase of the k value by more than three times i e from 2 to 7 10 6 m s 1 would lead to no more than 42 increase of the difference on september 17 2107 the same increase of k values led to the decrease of the difference but only by 14 these trends indicated that 1 errors in prediction i e the differences were not very sensitive to the change of k values which was consistent with an earlier study ritzema and jansen 2008 and 2 the trends of errors were not always consistent over time thus k 3 89 10 6 m s 1 should be the most appropriate one although determining surface runoff using the drain module imbedded in visual modflow has been a common method grapes et al 2006 reeve and gracz 2008 reeve et al 2000 rossi et al 2014 it implicitly ignored a proportion of runoff moving into gullies within the study watershed during rainfall periods however water levels of flow in gullies used in the model were measured in situ which had included this proportion of runoff this inconsistency could lead to some errors in computation of water balance fortunately the temporal changes of water levels during the entire simulation period were within 0 2 m which mainly happened during rainfall periods thus this uncertainty would cause limited errors in determining δs values 4 2 climatic and gully impact on water storage in the disturbed peatlands for the entire simulation zone the amount of supplied groundwater from ambient areas only took about 3 of the total input water during the rain periods but more than 59 during the inter rain periods fig 4a and b nonetheless in both periods either p et or both dominated hydrological input and output thus values of δs were mainly controlled by relative magnitudes of p and et i e the difference between p and et wp et vicissitudes of rain and inter rain periods in the wet season may september which represents short term climate change could cause oscillation of δs between positive and negative values fig 11 during the rain periods the greater the wp et value the greater the increase of water storage while during the inter rain i e dry periods et caused the loss of water storage but the magnitude of the loss was not only controlled by et values for instance groundwater input could be an important contributing factor as shown in fig 4b the opposite trends of δs between rain and dry periods gave rise to a very complex temporal pattern of δs that is it altered temporally between positive and negative over the whole modeling period i e 124 days to understand these temporal changes over a long time period we calculated the actual daily amount of water stored in peats as follow after interpolating the measured wt levels on may 17 2017 using a kriging method we obtained the initial spatially distributed wt levels in the study watershed and subsequently calculated the volume of the saturated peats which was 596000 m3 assuming the effective porosity is 30 heathwaite and johnes 1996 reeve et al 2000 and pore water in the unsaturated upper peat layer is negligible we could determine the initial amount of stored water s 0 which was then unified by dividing the area of the study watershed i e 38859 m2 using s 0 and δs temporal changes of water storage may be finally determined up to the end of december 2017 fig 12 which clearly signified that the amount of water stored in the peat layer highly varied from time to time though the degree of variation was no more than 5 6 given that the annual climate change of the study area i e the zoige basin is featured by the cycle of dry and wet seasons this result i e fig 12 may be repeated for many years and thus provided a reasonable projection on the impact of long term climate change on water storage in peats nevertheless whether this degree of variation may have significant ecological impact on the peat degradation is yet unclear putra et al 2018 during the full modeling period water storage increased in all three sub zones suggesting that the impact of climatic changes i e wp et on water storage in peats is greater than that of gullies furthermore during the dry periods with et values in the three high classes the decreasing rate of storage water in the ng sub zone was higher than that in the nct sub zone which was higher than that in the ct sub zone fig s1 this apparently suggests that the disturbed peatland lost less stored water than the blanket peatland under the similar dry weather conditions which is at odds with our field observation that in many ct gullies groundwater seepage is discernable from the gully banks around the bottom of the peat layer li and gao 2019 indicating greater loss of stored water in peats we can examine this phenomenon from a different perspective over the dry periods both ct and nct gullies supplied water to their surrounding peats and the nct gully supplied much more water than the ct gully fig 6b suggesting that flow depths in the gully on average were higher than hydraulic heads of the neighboring peats and this difference was greater in the nct than in the ct gully the fact that gullies both ct and nct in the entire simulation zone supplied a significant amount water to the surrounding peats fig 4b suggested that the hydraulic gradient from gullies to the neighboring peats prevailed over the entire simulation zone during the dry periods the possible explanation is that sufficient water was supplied to the gullies during the rain periods such that gully flows were capable of retaining at relatively high levels during the dry periods despite of precedent fast draining this kind of hysteresis effect may be further corroborated by the fact that hgw flowed from the gully to the simulated peats most of time fig 9 however this trend of hydraulic gradient gradually diminished as the dry periods continued our calculation of water balance for the 11 1 12 31 2017 showed that both p and et were small due to dry and cold weather and thus had much less influence on water balance of the peatland under this condition the ct gully was the main pathway of water output from the peatland even if water was supplied to it from its ambient areas while the nct gully did not have significant net water movement fig 13 thus a higher amount of stored water decreased in the ct sub zone 35 67 mm than that in the nct 29 35 mm and ng 21 76 mm sub zones this extended analysis reveals the impact of long term climate change on peat groundwater storage specified as follow first the role of ct gullies in draining additional stored water in peats takes effect over the prolonged dry period in winter and spring in the zoige basin second nct gullies have very limited effect on δs thus it is very important to control development of deep gullies for restoring peatland ecosystem 4 3 climatic and gully impact on groundwater flow in the disturbed peatland our results showed that hgw was about 10 times higher than vgw this suggests that groundwater exchange between the peat i e upper and soil lower layers is not the main hydrological process affecting water storage in peats possibly due to the fact that the study peatland is topographically controlled by a relatively steep slope hare et al 2017 millar et al 2018 yet both vgw and hgw were subject to the coupled impact of climate change and gullies over the entire simulation zone vgw flows were downward during the rain periods with very low rates and mostly upward with the rate increasing as et increases these patterns were essentially controlled by wt levels that demonstrated similar patterns suggesting that the impact of climate change on vgw flows was achieved by altering wt levels which essentially changed vertical hydraulic heads of peats li and gao 2019 although the strong wt vgw correlation in the three sub zones suggests that the controlling role of wt on vgw was not changed by gullies either ct or nct the impact of gullies on the vgw flows was evidenced by the consistent patterns of vgw flows among the three sub zone in both rain and dry periods vgw flows in the ct sub zone always moved upward even during the rainfall periods when these flows moved downward in nct and ng sub zones this means that the hydrological role of the ct gully is lowering wt levels by allowing more groundwater seep into it such that hydraulic heads in the peat layer was mostly lower than that in the underlined soil layer the climatic impact adding to that of gullies on vgw flows was highlighted by much higher upward vgw flows in the dry periods than in the rainfall periods for the ct sub zone and inversion of vgw flow direction between the upward and downward directions during the two types of periods for ng and nct periods inasmuch as groundwater flow is dominated by hgw flows their variations under the influence of both climate change and gullies should be more important for understanding dynamic changes of water storage in peats gullies clearly affected hgw flows along the lateral distance away from them in general hgw flowed toward the ct gully during both rain and dry periods but it decreased as the distance away from the gully increased with the rate of decrease declined obviously after the distance about 8 m away from the ct gully fig 9 hgw in the nct gully along the lateral direction generally flowed away from the gully in the distance near the gully and then may flip the flow direction at the distance around the similar distance away from the gully it appears that the distance of about 8 m away from the gully is a threshold within this distance the magnitude of hwg flow for the rain periods was always larger around the ct gully than the nct one yet beyond this distance hwg around the ct gully still flowed in the same direction during the rain periods while it reversed the direction around the nct gully during the dry periods this threshold distance merely existed with et values in class 1 fig 9 nonetheless hwg mostly flowed toward the ct gully and away from the nct gully except for et values in class 4 this threshold behavior is consistent with the distance decay effect of wt drawdown allott et al 2009 holden et al 2006 luscombe et al 2016 nonetheless our results manifested that this effect mainly occurred around the ct gully furthermore hgw consistently flowed out of the ct gully during the dry periods explained the larger amount of stored water lost around the ct gully fig 13 5 conclusions groundwater storage and flow in peatland are very sensitive to climate change both short and long terms and topographic disturbance their spatial and temporal responses to these two factors are extremely hard to capture by in situ measurements alternatively this study took on this issue by combining modeling analysis with limited but sufficient field sampling we investigated temporal changes of groundwater storage in the zoige peatland and dynamic patterns of groundwater flows under the coupled influence of climate change and gullies it was achieved by using visual modflow to simulate dynamics of groundwater movement in a peat zone with the area of 3 89 104 m2 that included two deep ct gullies and a few shallow nct gullies as well as three sub zones that had no gullies ng one nct gully nct and a ct gully ct the subsequent construction of water budget and analyses of vertical and horizontal groundwater flow provided new insight into the complex impact of climate change and gullies on groundwater storage and flows the short term climate change is characterized by the oscillation of the difference between p and et wp et it controlled the frequent shift of loss and gain of groundwater storage in peatland during the wet season of a year yet the fact that changes of groundwater storage δs during inter rain periods were not correlated with et values suggested that this control effect is more complicated values of δs during a given inter rain period are not only determined by the et value but also the δs value in its immediately earlier rain period we call this as a hysteresis effect in groundwater processes this effect is further confirmed by the fact that during inter rain periods peats in ng sub zone lost more groundwater than nct and ct sub zones during the wet season though the impact of short term climate change outweighed that of gullies on δs values deep gullies significantly caused higher horizontal groundwater hgw flows in the areas near the gully which is consistent with the well known water table dropdown effect water table wt levels were strongly correlated with vertical groundwater vgw flows however δs values should not be significantly affected by variations of wt levels because vgw is negligible compared with hgw flows which further raises question of determining δs using the product of peat specific yield and the change of wt levels the effect of long term climate change on δs values was represented by the continuous decrease of δs during the prolonged dry period this impact is enhanced by deep gullies that may produce sustainable hgw flows though the magnitudes of these flows may be small clearly our findings highlight the critical role of deep gullies in reducing peat groundwater storage under both short term and long term climate changes future peatland restoration in the zoige basin of china should focus on restricting development of existing deep gullies and preventing creation of new artificial ditches declaration of competing interest

6366,unconfined aquifers sometimes overlie fractured bedrocks consisting of unconfined fractured aquifer systems pumping induced hydrodynamics in such aquifer systems has not received much attention as in other types of aquifer systems this paper aims to obtain semi analytical solutions of flow to a general well configuration in such an unconfined fractured two layer aquifer system the examples of general well configuration specifically discussed here include 1 a horizontal well 2 a vertical well 3 a vertical well with one horizontal collector and 4 a vertical well with two horizontal collectors which are perpendicular with each other the methodology is general and can be extended to other types of wells with minor modifications of solutions developed in this study the point sink source solution is first obtained using double infinite fourier and laplace transformations where sink is for pumping and source is for injection the line sink source solution is then obtained via integrating the point sink source along the desired direction and following the principle of superposition the de hoog numerical inverse laplace transform and gaussian quadrature are used to obtain time domain dimensionless drawdown solutions the instantaneous drainage of water table and the inter porosity flow of the underlying fractured aquifer are taken into account the effects of the length of horizontal well on dimensionless drawdown and dimensionless drawdown derivative and scaled sensitivity of the hydraulic parameters of the underlying fractured aquifer are explored the dimensionless drawdowns and drawdown derivatives of a vertical pumping well a vertical well with a single horizontal collector and a vertical well with two perpendicular horizontal collectors are also compared the scaled sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to the hydraulic parameters of the underlying fractured aquifer of these different pumping well structures is explored the results of this study can be used to evaluate the hydraulic parameters using the drawdown data collected during a pumping test performed in a general well configuration in a unconfined fractured two layer aquifer system furthermore the presented solutions can be utilized to design the pumping well to minimize drawdown in low permeability or thin aquifers by eliminating the inter porosity flow term from the underlying

permeable pleistocene limestone ayers and vacher 1986 in some parts of garden island australia the tamala limestone formation is overlain by the safety bay sand unconfined aquifer sedghi and zhan 2016 trefry and bekele 2004 in these island aquifers horizontal wells are recommended as they limit the drawdown and prevent saltwater intrusion todd and mays 2005 layered aquifer systems are subject of many groundwater studies in some of these studies leakage was imposed to the whole aquifer thickness hantush 1960 hantush 1967 hantush and jacob 1955 moench 1985 neuman and witherspoon 1969 in others the leakage was imposed through the aquitard aquifer interface only feng and zhan 2015 feng and zhan 2016 hunt 2005 sedghi et al 2012 sun and zhan 2006 in a layered aquifer system involving one or more aquitards the aquitard storage was not considered in some early work hantush and jacob 1955 but was generally included in many late works hantush 1960 moench 1985 neuman and witherspoon 1969 sedghi et al 2012 sun and zhan 2006 in the conceptual models of previous studies a constant head source was often assumed above an aquitard with an underneath aquifer of concern this assumption has been questioned by some investigators malama et al 2007 malama et al 2008 for not representing realistic situations instead they assumed a no flow boundary under the aquitard in these two works the source of leakage is the aquitard storage malama et al 2007 and the aquitard storage and the water stored in the underlying aquifer malama et al 2008 sedghi and samani 2015 and sedghi et al 2018 extended the malama et al 2007 and malama et al 2008 solutions for the unconfined fractured aquifer systems they did not consider horizontal wells however in their solutions horizontal wells offer many advantages over vertical wells because of larger contact areas with the targeting aquifers park and zhan 2003 sun and zhan 2006 zhan and park 2003 zhan et al 2001 zhan and zlotnik 2002 the first attempt to model the flow to collector wells i e a series of jointed horizontal wells was done by hantush and papadopulos 1962 they presented a long time approximation of drawdown near collector wells without detailed derivation numerical methods were also used to model drawdown near collector wells cunningham et al 1996 eberts and bair 1990 ophori and farvolden 1985 zhan et al 2001 obtained the analytical solution of flow to a horizontal well in an anisotropic aquifer they also presented the short time and late time approximations of their solution analytical solution of flow to a horizontal or slanted well installed in an unconfined aquifer was considered by zhan and zlotnik 2002 they investigated the effects of delayed and instantaneous water table drainage among other parameters on the dimensionless drawdown park and zhan 2003 investigated the influences of the wellbore storage and skin effects of a horizontal well installed in confined leaky and unconfined fractured aquifers a horizontal pumping well in a leaky aquifer was considered by sun and zhan 2006 and zhan and park 2003 samani et al 2006 extended the solution presented by zhan and zlotnik 2002 to calculate the drawdown and discharge of a horizontal drain qanat huang et al 2011 presented analytical solution of flow to a horizontal well in an unconfined aquifer near a fully penetrating stream they followed the residue theorem to obtain time domain solution huang et al 2012 obtained an analytical solution of flow to collector wells near a stream using fourier and laplace transformations they also calculated the rate of stream depletion and drawdown for pumping from collector wells of different configurations maroney and rehmann 2017 simplified a few integrals that appeared in the solution of huang et al 2012 to improve the computational efficiency they utilized their solution to calculate the rate of stream depletion with less computational effort comparing to the solution presented by huang et al 2012 the above mentioned solutions are not applicable for groundwater flow to a horizontal well in an unconfined aquifer overlying a fractured water bearing bedrock despite its importance no analytical solution exists for flow to a general well configuration in an unconfined aquifer overlying a fractured bedrock the aim of this work is therefore to present such a solution first we obtain the point source solution using the green s function method then the vertical and horizontal line sink source solutions are obtained by analytical and numerical integrations of the point source solution along the desired directions theoretical results of this study are presented using dimensionless drawdown time curves dimensionless drawdown derivative time curves scaled sensitivity time curves and drawdown distribution maps the presented solutions can be used to evaluate the hydraulic parameters of the unconfined fractured aquifer systems using the drawdown data collected during a pumping test performed in a general well configuration the results of this study can also be utilized to design the pumping operation to minimize drawdown in low permeability and or thin aquifers above a fractured bedrock 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem statement the conceptual model of the aquifer system fig 1 shows an unconfined aquifer overlying a fractured bedrock of finite thickness the origin of the coordinate system is at the initial water table over the central point of the horizontal well the z axis is positive upward the bottom of the overlying unconfined aquifer and the underlying fractured aquifer are at the depth of b 1 and b 2 respectively it is assumed that both aquifer layers have infinite horizontal extent a horizontal collector well along the x axis and or y

is slanted at y y 0 in the xz plane with an angle of ψ in respect to the x axis then f x l l cos ψ f y l y 0 and f z l l sin ψ the same method can be followed to simulate an arbitrary shaped snaked well in this case however head loss in wellbore may become significant because of the change of flow direction there therefore the mixed type boundary condition may be needed to simulate the pumping well in these cases nevertheless such coupled wellbore aquifer flow problems in snaked wells are out of the scope of this article and will be investigated separately 3 numerical evaluation of the solution the laplace domain solution presented in this work is used to obtain the time domain drawdown via de hoog et al 1982 fourier series based numerical inversion algorithm the improper hankel integral arising from inverse double fourier transformation was split into finite integrals between successive roots of the bessel function j 0 each finite integral is calculated numerically using gaussian quadrature algorithms abscissas and weight coefficients for lobatto quadrature calculated by michels 1963 are used finally sum of finite integrals is calculated using the ε series acceleration algorithm of wynn 1956 4 results and discussion in this work the condition of uniform flux is considered for horizontal and vertical parts of the pumping well this assumption is made in many other analytical solutions because of its simplicity huang et al 2012 malama et al 2008 sedghi and zhan 2018 zhan and zlotnik 2002 the uniform head condition for treating the screened sections of wellbore is closer to reality however it is more difficult to implement analytically zhan et al 2001 zhan et al 2001 compared the uniform head and uniform flux conditions for a horizontal well using visual modflow they concluded that the discrepancy between the uniform head and uniform flux conditions was less than 5 if the observation point is more than ten times of the horizontal well diameter away from the center of the well the actual wellbore should be a mixed type condition between above mentioned two extremes wang and zhan 2017b for this type of wellbore head loss inside the wellbore from friction bakker et al 2005 bakker and kuhlman 2011 kuhlman and neuman 2009 and inertia because of change of flow direction inside the well wang and zhan 2017a wang and zhan 2017b are considered for a horizontal well such head losses decrease as the length of the horizontal well is reduced blumenthal and zhan 2016 wang and zhan 2017b for vertical well the difference between constant head and mixed type well condition is negligible during the intermediate and late times wang and zhan 2017a the effects of mixed type well condition is not explored in this work and may be addressed in future works 4 1 comparison with the sedghi and samani 2015 solution the dimensionless drawdown time curve obtained using the presented solution for a partially penetrating vertical well eqs 16 19 is compared with that of sedghi and samani 2015 the values of default parameters introduced in table 2 are used to prepare this curve park and zhan 2003 sedghi and samani 2015 sedghi and zhan 2016 the results shown in fig 2 illustrate that the agreement between these solutions is satisfactory and show that the presented solution can simulate the vertical well solution via integrating the point sink source solution in the vertical direction 4 2 effects of length of the horizontal well and hydraulic parameters of the underlying aquifer fig 3 shows the effects of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity ratio of two aquifers kh 2 kh 1 on dimensionless drawdown time curve the values of default parameters introduced in table 2 are used to prepare this figure the dimensionless drawdown curves are compared to that of zhan and zlotnik 2002 to show the effects of the underlying fractured aquifer two horizontal wells with dimensionless lengths of lxd 10 black lines and lxd 2 red lines are compared fig 3 shows that increasing kh 2 kh 1 decreases the dimensionless drawdown from the intermediate to late times as kh 2 kh 1 increases the drawdown cone expansion increases in the underlying fractured aquifer therefore the volume of water released because of the inter porosity flow and recharge to the overlying unconfined aquifer becomes more significant and leads to lower intermediate time drawdown as increasing kh 2 decreases the resistance to horizontal flow in the underlying fractured aquifer water released from matrix blocks at further distances reaches the pumping well to decrease the late time drawdown these effects are also stated in some previous works malama et al 2008 sedghi and samani 2015 furthermore fig 3 shows that increasing the length of the horizontal well decreases the dimensionless drawdown from the early to late times because increasing the length of well screen reduces the strength of the well as a line sink i e q l that in turn reduces the dimensionless drawdown park and zhan 2003 zhan et al 2001 inspecting fig 3 also reveals that the effects of the length of the horizontal well are less marked during the late times we have further investigated the effects of horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the underlying fractured aquifer preparing the scaled sensitivity time curve fig 4 the scaled sensitivity is calculated as huang and yeh 2007 34 s pi p i o p i δ p i o p i δ p i where s pi is the scaled sensitivity p i is the input parameter e g s sm or parameter ratio e g kh 2 kh 1 o is the output function of the system e g s p d 1 and δ p i is the parameter or the parameter ratio increment that may be calculated as δ p i 10 3 p i the absolute sensitivity is calculated to avoid negative values fig 4 shows that the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to kh 2 kh 1 increases over time this figure shows that increasing the length of the horizontal well decreases the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to kh 2 kh 1 it also reveals that the effects of the length of the horizontal well on the sensitivity of drawdown are less marked during the late time the effects of kh 2 kh 1 are further investigated using the dimensionless drawdown derivative s 1 h d s 1 h d t d t d time curve fig 5 as it is shown in fig 5 the derivative curve of horizontal well in the unconfined aquifer zhan and zlotnik 2002 shows a depression after a hump during the intermediate time because of the effects of the water table drainage these curves level off during the late time at the value of about 1 0 because of the infinite acting radial flow for an unconfined fractured aquifer system the derivative curve shows two humps and depressions during the intermediate time from inter porosity flow and the water table drainage sedghi and samani 2015 increasing kh 2 kh 1 to 100 merges these two depressions into a single one as the effects of inter porosity flow overshadow the water table drainage fig 5 also shows that increasing the length of the horizontal well decreases the drawdown derivative during the intermediate time interestingly the effects of the length of the horizontal well on the drawdown derivative are diminished during the late time comparing figs 3 and 5 reveals that although the derivative curves differentiate the inter porosity flow and the water table drainage during the intermediate time they are less sensitive to the well length compared to the drawdown curves to explore the effects of the vertical hydraulic conductivity ratio of two aquifers kz 2 kz 1 fig 6 is prepared like fig 3 similar to horizontal hydraulic conductivity ratio increasing kz 2 kz 1 decreases the intermediate and late time dimensionless drawdowns sedghi and samani 2015 moreover the late time drawdown is less sensitive to kz 2 kz 1 than kh 2 kh 1 increasing the length of horizontal well reduces the dimensionless drawdown as in fig 3 the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to kz 2 kz 1increases over time as in fig 4 to investigate the effects of kz 2 kz 1 in dimensionless drawdown derivative time curve fig 7 is prepared in a similar way as fig 5 two humps and depressions have been observed during the intermediate time because of the inter porosity flow and resultant leakage from the underlying fractured aquifer and the water table drainage respectively increasing the kz 2 kz 1 ratio decreases the drawdown derivative during the first intermediate time depression and increases it during the second depression as the effects of the leakage from the underlying aquifer increases and dominates the effects of the water table drainage by increasing kz 2 kz 1 furthermore increasing the length of the horizontal well decreases the drawdown derivative during the early and intermediate times the late time drawdown derivative however is insensitive to kz 2 kz 1 and the horizontal well length to test the effects of the specific storage ratio of the matrix blocks of the underlying fractured aquifer to specific storage of the overlying unconfined aquifer ssm ss 1 fig 8 is prepared like fig 3 fig 8 illustrates that increasing the specific storage of the matrix blocks reduces the intermediate time dimensionless drawdown park and zhan 2003 sedghi and samani 2015 sedghi and zhan 2016 we have further investigated the effects of storativity of matrix blocks of the underlying fractured aquifer ssm ss 1 preparing the scaled sensitivity time curve fig 9 this figure shows that during the intermediate time the scaled sensitivity of the drawdown to ssm ss 1 increases this is more significant for the shorter horizontal well l 20 m because the strength of sink is more marked comparing to a longer horizontal well for more discussion on temporal variation of the scaled sensitivity of drawdown to hydraulic parameters of the underlying fractured aquifer one may read the following paper sedghi and zhan 2018 the overall shape of the dimensionless drawdown derivative time curve for different ratios of the specific storages of matrix blocks to specific storage of the overlying fractured aquifer is almost the same as that of kz 2 kz 1 as shown in fig 7 4 3 effects of well configurations the effects of the pumping well structure on the dimensionless drawdown are shown on fig 10 three well structures are compared a vertical well a vertical well with a single collector of 80 m length and a vertical well with two perpendicular collectors of 40 m length two observation points at a shallower depth of 1 m black lines and a deeper depth of 9 m red lines from the initial water table are considered at the depth of 1 m from the initial water table position the minimum drawdown is seen for the case with a single collector and the maximum drawdown occurs for the case with a vertical well without a horizontal collector the difference however is less marked during the early time when the cone of depression does not significantly expand this shows that a vertical well with a single horizontal collector is more effective in reducing the drawdown in the aquifer when compared with the scenarios of a vertical well without any collectors and a vertical well with two perpendicular collectors therefore constructing a single long collector instead of two perpendicular collectors with the same total length is recommended when a thin and or low permeability aquifer exists the dimensionless drawdown in the piezometer with the depth of 9 m from the initial water table is also lower for a vertical well with a single horizontal collector except during the early time as the horizontal part of the well is closer to the piezometer point because of the same reason the dimensionless drawdown is higher for the case with two perpendicular collectors compared with that of a vertical well without any collectors during the early and intermediate times we have further investigated the effects of well structure on the drawdown by preparing a 3d wireframe map using the late time drawdown td 10 7 calculated at the depth of 1 m from the initial elevation of the water table fig 11 the other parameters are set to default values table 2 the software surfer is used to prepare these maps the drawdown difference between the case of a vertical well with two horizontal collectors and a vertical well with a single horizontal collector is calculated and presented in fig 12 the red blue regions show parts of an aquifer where a vertical well with two horizontal collectors produce more less drawdown when compared to that of a vertical well with a single horizontal collector as illustrated in the figure the drawdown produced by two collectors is higher near the vertical well and along the x axis and is lower along the y axis where the single collector is located to compare the sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to ssm ss 1for different well constructions fig 13 is prepared using default parameter values table 2 as illustrated in the figure during the early time the highest scaled sensitivity occurs for the case that two horizontal collectors are considered the maximum strength of the sink occurs near the bottom of the vertical well for the case that two horizontal collectors are constructed at the bottom of the pumping well thus the maximum contribution of water stored in matrix blocks to pumped water occurs consequently the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to ssm ss 1increases during the early time because of the strength of the lowest sink near the bottom of the pumping well the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown is the lowest there for a vertical well with a single horizontal collector during the intermediate time when the drained water from the water table starts to contribute to pumping the lowest sensitivity to ssm ss 1 occurs for the case of a vertical well without any collectors because the maximum strength of the sink near water table occurs the effects of well structure on scaled sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to kz 2 kz 1 are shown in fig 14 as illustrated in fig 14 the maximum late time sensitivity to kz 2 kz 1 is seen for the case of a vertical pumping well as the vertical component of flow toward pumping well is more significant in this case comparing to other cases during the intermediate time however downward water table drainage which is more significant for a vertical pumped well reduces the upward vertical flow at the interface of the aquifer fractured bedrock and reduces the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to kz 2 kz 1 when compared to the case of a vertical well with two horizontal collectors the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to the horizontal hydraulic conductivity ratio of two aquifers kh 2 kh 1 is shown in fig 15 this figure indicates that the sensitivity is more significant for the case with a vertical well without any collectors during the late time and for case of a vertical well with two horizontal collectors during the intermediate time this shows that horizontal component of flow in addition to vertical flow fig 14 toward the vertical well is also more marked during the late time furthermore the water table drainage during the intermediate time has the same effect as shown in fig 14 the scaled sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to kh 2 kh 1 increases during the late time as the cone of depression keeps expanding in the underlying fractured bedrock aquifer butler and mcelwee 1990 sedghi and zhan 2018 5 applications the presented semi analytical solution can be used to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer system and the design of the pumping well among other applications it is also superior on numerical solutions because it has not experienced the temporal and spatial discretization error that may be significant near a pumping well furthermore to simulate head near a pumping well during the early time fine cells and short time steps are needed that significantly increases the computational time the computational time is a great concern especially when the parameter estimation involves many calls of the forward model sedghi and zhan 2019 in addition numerical models may not simulate the water table drainage with high accuracy as demonstrated previously samani et al 2004 5 1 aquifer parameter estimation the presented solution can be coupled with a parameter estimation code such as pest doherty et al 1994 to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer system using the drawdown data collected during a pumping test to do so a number of considerations are necessary for designing the test because of this research first the drawdown data collected from a shallow and deep piezometer are more valuable to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the underlying fractured aquifer i e kh 2 kz 2 and ssm and the parameters related to water table drainage i e sy and kz 1 respectively sedghi and samani 2015 furthermore the drawdown data collected during the intermediate and late times with td 1 are more valuable to estimate the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity values of the underlying fractured aquifer second as the shapes of the dimensionless drawdown derivative time curves are significantly different from the dimensionless drawdown curves especially during the intermediate time using the drawdown derivative data along with drawdown data in parameters estimation process may reduce the non uniqueness of the problem third the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to kh 2 kh 1 increases over time thus late time data are more valuable than the intermediate time to estimate kh 2 this is also true for kz 2 the late time drawdown derivative data are insensitive to kz 2 kz 1 therefore they cannot be used to estimate kz 2 to estimate ssm the intermediate time drawdown is more valuable fourth constructing the horizontal collector for the pumping well is not recommended if the well is constructed for the pumping test it reduces the sensitivity of the drawdown to the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer system the early and intermediate time data collected from the pumping test performed in a vertical pumping well with two perpendicular collectors are more valuable to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the underlying fractured aquifer compared to a vertical pumping well without any horizontal collectors and a vertical well with one horizontal collector fifth the presented solution is general and can be reduced to the leaky eliminating inter porosity term from the underlying fractured aquifer and unconfined eliminating the thickness of the underlying fractured aquifer aquifer thus it can be used for the case that the type and thickness of the underlying aquifer are unknown in these cases the estimated thickness and hydraulic parameters of the underlying aquifer will be helpful to identify the underlying aquifer and its properties 5 2 design of the pumping well as stated before the pumping well with a horizontal collector is not recommended for the case that it is designed to perform the pumping test the horizontal collector is recommended however for extraction in low permeability and or small thickness aquifers zhan et al 2001 this study shows that a single long collector is more effective for reducing drawdown than multiple collectors of the same total length this finding may be applicable in the design of the pumping well in small thickness and freshwater island aquifers 6 summary and conclusions in this paper the laplace domain point sink source solution of flow in an unconfined fractured aquifer system is obtained the point sink source solution is utilized to obtain line sink source solution of vertical horizontal and vertical pumping well with horizontal collectors the uniform flux condition is considered to simulate the pumping well the presented solution for unconfined fractured aquifer system is deviated from the solution for the single layer unconfined aquifer because of stored water in the underlying aquifer the following conclusions are drawn 1 increasing the length of the horizontal well decreases the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to the specific storage of the matrix blocks and horizontal and vertical values of hydraulic conductivity of fractures of the underlying fractured aquifer 2 drawdown derivative curves are insensitive to the length of the horizontal well during the late time 3 a vertical well with a single horizontal collector is more effective in reducing the dimensionless drawdown comparing to a vertical well with two perpendicular collectors of the same total length thus constructing a single horizontal collector will reduce drawdown in this type of aquifers 4 the drawdown produced by two collectors is higher near the vertical well and along the x axis and is lower along the y axis where the single collector is constructed 5 during the early time the highest absolute scaled sensitivity occurs for the case that two horizontal collectors are considered because of the lowest sink strength near the bottom of pumping well the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown is the lowest there for a vertical well with a single horizontal collector 6 during the intermediate time when the drained water from the water table starts to contribute to pumping the lowest sensitivity to specific storage of the matrix blocks occurs for the case of a vertical well as the maximum strength of sink near water table is seen in this case 7 during the late time the sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity values of the fractures of the underlying fractured aquifer is more marked for the case in which a vertical pumping well is considered when compared to the case that a vertical well with two horizontal collectors and a vertical well with a single horizontal collector is assumed 8 during the intermediate time gravity drainage of the water table reduces the scaled sensitivity of

6366,unconfined aquifers sometimes overlie fractured bedrocks consisting of unconfined fractured aquifer systems pumping induced hydrodynamics in such aquifer systems has not received much attention as in other types of aquifer systems this paper aims to obtain semi analytical solutions of flow to a general well configuration in such an unconfined fractured two layer aquifer system the examples of general well configuration specifically discussed here include 1 a horizontal well 2 a vertical well 3 a vertical well with one horizontal collector and 4 a vertical well with two horizontal collectors which are perpendicular with each other the methodology is general and can be extended to other types of wells with minor modifications of solutions developed in this study the point sink source solution is first obtained using double infinite fourier and laplace transformations where sink is for pumping and source is for injection the line sink source solution is then obtained via integrating the point sink source along the desired direction and following the principle of superposition the de hoog numerical inverse laplace transform and gaussian quadrature are used to obtain time domain dimensionless drawdown solutions the instantaneous drainage of water table and the inter porosity flow of the underlying fractured aquifer are taken into account the effects of the length of horizontal well on dimensionless drawdown and dimensionless drawdown derivative and scaled sensitivity of the hydraulic parameters of the underlying fractured aquifer are explored the dimensionless drawdowns and drawdown derivatives of a vertical pumping well a vertical well with a single horizontal collector and a vertical well with two perpendicular horizontal collectors are also compared the scaled sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to the hydraulic parameters of the underlying fractured aquifer of these different pumping well structures is explored the results of this study can be used to evaluate the hydraulic parameters using the drawdown data collected during a pumping test performed in a general well configuration in a unconfined fractured two layer aquifer system furthermore the presented solutions can be utilized to design the pumping well to minimize drawdown in low permeability or thin aquifers by eliminating the inter porosity flow term from the underlying

aquifer systems for example in fars province southwestern iran many unconfined aquifers overlie karstified limestone issar 1969 milanovic and aghili 1990 these aquifer systems are also commonly seen in other parts of the middle east where freshwater resources are scarce al shaibani 2008 sedghi and samani 2015 subyani 2004 wagner 2011 and thin aquifers exist in these regions horizontal wells are advantageous zhan et al 2001 unconfined fractured aquifer systems are common in other parts of the world as well for instance an unconfined alluvial aquifer of atoll island was found to overlie very permeable pleistocene limestone ayers and vacher 1986 in some parts of garden island australia the tamala limestone formation is overlain by the safety bay sand unconfined aquifer sedghi and zhan 2016 trefry and bekele 2004 in these island aquifers horizontal wells are recommended as they limit the drawdown and prevent saltwater intrusion todd and mays 2005 layered aquifer systems are subject of many groundwater studies in some of these studies leakage was imposed to the whole aquifer thickness hantush 1960 hantush 1967 hantush and jacob 1955 moench 1985 neuman and witherspoon 1969 in others the leakage was imposed through the aquitard aquifer interface only feng and zhan 2015 feng and zhan 2016 hunt 2005 sedghi et al 2012 sun and zhan 2006 in a layered aquifer system involving one or more aquitards the aquitard storage was not considered in some early work hantush and jacob 1955 but was generally included in many late works hantush 1960 moench 1985 neuman and witherspoon 1969 sedghi et al 2012 sun and zhan 2006 in the conceptual models of previous studies a constant head source was often assumed above an aquitard with an underneath aquifer of concern this assumption has been questioned by some investigators malama et al 2007 malama et al 2008 for not representing realistic situations instead they assumed a no flow boundary under the aquitard in these two works the source of leakage is the aquitard storage malama et al 2007 and the aquitard storage and the water stored in the underlying aquifer malama et al 2008 sedghi and samani 2015 and sedghi et al 2018 extended the malama et al 2007 and malama et al 2008 solutions for the unconfined fractured aquifer systems they did not consider horizontal wells however in their solutions horizontal wells offer many advantages over vertical wells because of larger contact areas with the targeting aquifers park and zhan 2003 sun and zhan 2006 zhan and park 2003 zhan et al 2001 zhan and zlotnik 2002 the first attempt to model the flow to collector wells i e a series of jointed horizontal wells was done by hantush and papadopulos 1962 they presented a long time approximation of drawdown near collector wells without detailed derivation numerical methods were also used to model drawdown near collector wells cunningham et al 1996 eberts and bair 1990 ophori and farvolden 1985 zhan et al 2001 obtained the analytical solution of flow to a horizontal well in an anisotropic aquifer they also presented the short time and late time approximations of their solution analytical solution of flow to a horizontal or slanted well installed in an unconfined aquifer was considered by zhan and zlotnik 2002 they investigated the effects of delayed and instantaneous water table drainage among other parameters on the dimensionless drawdown park and zhan 2003 investigated the influences of the wellbore storage and skin effects of a horizontal well installed in confined leaky and unconfined fractured aquifers a horizontal pumping well in a leaky aquifer was considered by sun and zhan 2006 and zhan and park 2003 samani et al 2006 extended the solution presented by zhan and zlotnik 2002 to calculate the drawdown and discharge of a horizontal drain qanat huang et al 2011 presented analytical solution of flow to a horizontal well in an unconfined aquifer near a fully penetrating stream they followed the residue theorem to obtain time domain solution huang et al 2012 obtained an analytical solution of flow to collector wells near a stream using fourier and laplace transformations they also calculated the rate of stream depletion and drawdown for pumping from collector wells of different configurations maroney and rehmann 2017 simplified a few integrals that appeared in the solution of huang et al 2012 to improve the computational efficiency they utilized their solution to calculate the rate of stream depletion with less computational effort comparing to the solution presented by huang et al 2012 the above mentioned solutions are not applicable for groundwater flow to a horizontal well in an unconfined aquifer overlying a fractured water bearing bedrock despite its importance no analytical solution exists for flow to a general well configuration in an unconfined aquifer overlying a fractured bedrock the aim of this work is therefore to present such a solution first we obtain the point source solution using the green s function method then the vertical and horizontal line sink source solutions are obtained by analytical and numerical integrations of the point source solution along the desired directions theoretical results of this study are presented using dimensionless drawdown time curves dimensionless drawdown derivative time curves scaled sensitivity time curves and drawdown distribution maps the presented solutions can be used to evaluate the hydraulic parameters of the unconfined fractured aquifer systems using the drawdown data collected during a pumping test performed in a general well configuration the results of this study can also be utilized to design the pumping operation to minimize drawdown in low permeability and or thin aquifers

origin of the coordinate system is at the initial water table over the central point of the horizontal well the z axis is positive upward the bottom of the overlying unconfined aquifer and the underlying fractured aquifer are at the depth of b 1 and b 2 respectively it is assumed that both aquifer layers have infinite horizontal extent a horizontal collector well along the x axis and or y

is slanted at y y 0 in the xz plane with an angle of ψ in respect to the x axis then f x l l cos ψ f y l y 0 and f z l l sin ψ the same method can be followed to simulate an arbitrary shaped snaked well in this case however head loss in wellbore may become significant because of the change of flow direction there therefore the mixed type boundary condition may be needed to simulate the pumping well in these cases nevertheless such coupled wellbore aquifer flow problems in snaked wells are out of the scope of this article and will be investigated separately 3 numerical evaluation of the solution the laplace domain solution presented in this work is used to obtain the time domain drawdown via de hoog et al 1982 fourier series based numerical inversion algorithm the improper hankel integral arising from inverse double fourier transformation was split into finite integrals between successive roots of the bessel function j 0 each finite integral is calculated numerically using gaussian quadrature algorithms abscissas and weight coefficients for lobatto quadrature calculated by michels 1963 are used finally sum of finite integrals is calculated using the ε series acceleration algorithm of wynn 1956 4 results and discussion in this work the condition of uniform flux is considered for horizontal and vertical parts of the pumping well this assumption is made in many other analytical solutions because of its simplicity huang et al 2012 malama et al 2008 sedghi and zhan 2018 zhan and zlotnik 2002 the uniform head condition for treating the screened sections of wellbore is closer to reality however it is more difficult to implement analytically zhan et al 2001 zhan et al 2001 compared the uniform head and uniform flux conditions for a horizontal well using visual modflow they concluded that the discrepancy between the uniform head and uniform flux conditions was less than 5 if the observation point is more than ten times of the horizontal well diameter away from the center of the well the actual wellbore should be a mixed type condition between above mentioned two extremes wang and zhan 2017b for this type of wellbore head loss inside the wellbore from friction bakker et al 2005 bakker and kuhlman 2011 kuhlman and neuman 2009 and inertia because of change of flow direction inside the well wang and zhan 2017a wang and zhan 2017b are considered for a horizontal well such head losses decrease as the length of the horizontal well is reduced blumenthal and zhan 2016 wang and zhan 2017b for vertical well the difference between constant head and mixed type well condition is negligible during the intermediate and late times wang and zhan 2017a the effects of mixed type well condition is not explored in this work and may be addressed in future works 4 1 comparison with the sedghi and samani 2015 solution the dimensionless drawdown time curve obtained using the presented solution for a partially penetrating vertical well eqs 16 19 is compared with that of sedghi and samani 2015 the values of default parameters introduced in table 2 are used to prepare this curve park and zhan 2003 sedghi and samani 2015 sedghi and zhan 2016 the results shown in fig 2 illustrate that the agreement between these solutions is satisfactory and show that the presented solution can simulate the vertical well solution via integrating the point sink source solution in the vertical direction 4 2 effects of length of the horizontal well and hydraulic parameters of the underlying aquifer fig 3 shows the effects of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity ratio of two aquifers kh 2 kh 1 on dimensionless drawdown time curve the values of default parameters introduced in table 2 are used to prepare this figure the dimensionless drawdown curves are compared to that of zhan and zlotnik 2002 to show the effects of the underlying fractured aquifer two horizontal wells with dimensionless lengths of lxd 10 black lines and lxd 2 red lines are compared fig 3 shows that increasing kh 2 kh 1 decreases the dimensionless drawdown from the intermediate to late times as kh 2 kh 1 increases the drawdown cone expansion increases in the underlying fractured aquifer therefore the volume of water released because of the inter porosity flow and recharge to the overlying unconfined aquifer becomes more significant and leads to lower intermediate time drawdown as increasing kh 2 decreases the resistance to horizontal flow in the underlying fractured aquifer water released from matrix blocks at further distances reaches the pumping well to decrease the late time drawdown these effects are also stated in some previous works malama et al 2008 sedghi and samani 2015 furthermore fig 3 shows that increasing the length of the horizontal well decreases the dimensionless drawdown from the early to late times because increasing the length of well screen reduces the strength of the well as a line sink i e q l that in turn reduces the dimensionless drawdown park and zhan 2003 zhan et al 2001 inspecting fig 3 also reveals that the effects of the length of the horizontal well are less marked during the late times we have further investigated the effects of horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the underlying fractured aquifer preparing the scaled sensitivity time curve fig 4 the scaled sensitivity is calculated as huang and yeh 2007 34 s pi p i o p i δ p i o p i δ p i where s pi is the scaled sensitivity p i is the input parameter e g s sm or parameter ratio e g kh 2 kh 1 o is the output function of the system e g s p d 1 and δ p i is the parameter or the parameter ratio increment that may be calculated as δ p i 10 3 p i the absolute sensitivity is calculated to avoid negative values fig 4 shows that the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to kh 2 kh 1 increases over time this figure shows that increasing the length of the horizontal well decreases the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to kh 2 kh 1 it also reveals that the effects of the length of the horizontal well on the sensitivity of drawdown are less marked during the late time the effects of kh 2 kh 1 are further investigated using the dimensionless drawdown derivative s 1 h d s 1 h d t d t d time curve fig 5 as it is shown in fig 5 the derivative curve of horizontal well in the unconfined aquifer zhan and zlotnik 2002 shows a depression after a hump during the intermediate time because of the effects of the water table drainage these curves level off during the late time at the value of about 1 0 because of the infinite acting radial flow for an unconfined fractured aquifer system the derivative curve shows two humps and depressions during the intermediate time from inter porosity flow and the water table drainage sedghi and samani 2015 increasing kh 2 kh 1 to 100 merges these two depressions into a single one as the effects of inter porosity flow overshadow the water table drainage fig 5 also shows that increasing the length of the horizontal well decreases the drawdown derivative during the intermediate time interestingly the effects of the length of the horizontal well on the drawdown derivative are diminished during the late time comparing figs 3 and 5 reveals that although the derivative curves differentiate the inter porosity flow and the water table drainage during the intermediate time they are less sensitive to the well length compared to the drawdown curves to explore the effects of the vertical hydraulic conductivity ratio of two aquifers kz 2 kz 1 fig 6 is prepared like fig 3 similar to horizontal hydraulic conductivity ratio increasing kz 2 kz 1 decreases the intermediate and late time dimensionless drawdowns sedghi and samani 2015 moreover the late time drawdown is less sensitive to kz 2 kz 1 than kh 2 kh 1 increasing the length of horizontal well reduces the dimensionless drawdown as in fig 3 the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to kz 2 kz 1increases over time as in fig 4 to investigate the effects of kz 2 kz 1 in dimensionless drawdown derivative time curve fig 7 is prepared in a similar way as fig 5 two humps and depressions have been observed during the intermediate time because of the inter porosity flow and resultant leakage from the underlying fractured aquifer and the water table drainage respectively increasing the kz 2 kz 1 ratio decreases the drawdown derivative during the first intermediate time depression and increases it during the second depression as the effects of the leakage from the underlying aquifer increases and dominates the effects of the water table drainage by increasing kz 2 kz 1 furthermore increasing the length of the horizontal well decreases the drawdown derivative during the early and intermediate times the late time drawdown derivative however is insensitive to kz 2 kz 1 and the horizontal well length to test the effects of the specific storage ratio of the matrix blocks of the underlying fractured aquifer to specific storage of the overlying unconfined aquifer ssm ss 1 fig 8 is prepared like fig 3 fig 8 illustrates that increasing the specific storage of the matrix blocks reduces the intermediate time dimensionless drawdown park and zhan 2003 sedghi and samani 2015 sedghi and zhan 2016 we have further investigated the effects of storativity of matrix blocks of the underlying fractured aquifer ssm ss 1 preparing the scaled sensitivity time curve fig 9 this figure shows that during the intermediate time the scaled sensitivity of the drawdown to ssm ss 1 increases this is more significant for the shorter horizontal well l 20 m because the strength of sink is more marked comparing to a longer horizontal well for more discussion on temporal variation of the scaled sensitivity of drawdown to hydraulic parameters of the underlying fractured aquifer one may read the following paper sedghi and zhan 2018 the overall shape of the dimensionless drawdown derivative time curve for different ratios of the specific storages of matrix blocks to specific storage of the overlying fractured aquifer is almost the same as that of kz 2 kz 1 as shown in fig 7 4 3 effects of well configurations the effects of the pumping well structure on the dimensionless drawdown are shown on fig 10 three well structures are compared a vertical well a vertical well with a single collector of 80 m length and a vertical well with two perpendicular collectors of 40 m length two observation points at a shallower depth of 1 m black lines and a deeper depth of 9 m red lines from the initial water table are considered at the depth of 1 m from the initial water table position the minimum drawdown is seen for the case with a single collector and the maximum drawdown occurs for the case with a vertical well without a horizontal collector the difference however is less marked during the early time when the cone of depression does not significantly expand this shows that a vertical well with a single horizontal collector is more effective in reducing the drawdown in the aquifer when compared with the scenarios of a vertical well without any collectors and a vertical well with two perpendicular collectors therefore constructing a single long collector instead of two perpendicular collectors with the same total length is recommended when a thin and or low permeability aquifer exists the dimensionless drawdown in the piezometer with the depth of 9 m from the initial water table is also lower for a vertical well with a single horizontal collector except during the early time as the horizontal part of the well is closer to the piezometer point because of the same reason the dimensionless drawdown is higher for the case with two perpendicular collectors compared with that of a vertical well without any collectors during the early and intermediate times we have further investigated the effects of well structure on the drawdown by preparing a 3d wireframe map using the late time drawdown td 10 7 calculated at the depth of 1 m from the initial elevation of the water table fig 11 the other parameters are set to default values table 2 the software surfer is used to prepare these maps the drawdown difference between the case of a vertical well with two horizontal collectors and a vertical well with a single horizontal collector is calculated and presented in fig 12 the red blue regions show parts of an aquifer where a vertical well with two horizontal collectors produce more less drawdown when compared to that of a vertical well with a single horizontal collector as illustrated in the figure the drawdown produced by two collectors is higher near the vertical well and along the x axis and is lower along the y axis where the single collector is located to compare the sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to ssm ss 1for different well constructions fig 13 is prepared using default parameter values table 2 as illustrated in the figure during the early time the highest scaled sensitivity occurs for the case that two horizontal collectors are considered the maximum strength of the sink occurs near the bottom of the vertical well for the case that two horizontal collectors are constructed at the bottom of the pumping well thus the maximum contribution of water stored in matrix blocks to pumped water occurs consequently the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to ssm ss 1increases during the early time because of the strength of the lowest sink near the bottom of the pumping well the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown is the lowest there for a vertical well with a single horizontal collector during the intermediate time when the drained water from the water table starts to contribute to pumping the lowest sensitivity to ssm ss 1 occurs for the case of a vertical well without any collectors because the maximum strength of the sink near water table occurs the effects of well structure on scaled sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to kz 2 kz 1 are shown in fig 14 as illustrated in fig 14 the maximum late time sensitivity to kz 2 kz 1 is seen for the case of a vertical pumping well as the vertical component of flow toward pumping well is more significant in this case comparing to other cases during the intermediate time however downward water table drainage which is more significant for a vertical pumped well reduces the upward vertical flow at the interface of the aquifer fractured bedrock and reduces the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to kz 2 kz 1 when compared to the case of a vertical well with two horizontal collectors the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to the horizontal hydraulic conductivity ratio of two aquifers kh 2 kh 1 is shown in fig 15 this figure indicates that the sensitivity is more significant for the case with a vertical well without any collectors during the late time and for case of a vertical well with two horizontal collectors during the intermediate time this shows that horizontal component of flow in addition to vertical flow fig 14 toward the vertical well is also more marked during the late time furthermore the water table drainage during the intermediate time has the same effect as shown in fig 14 the scaled sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to kh 2 kh 1 increases during the late time as the cone of depression keeps expanding in the underlying fractured bedrock aquifer butler and mcelwee 1990 sedghi and zhan 2018 5 applications the presented semi analytical solution can be used to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer system and the design of the pumping well among other applications it is also superior on numerical solutions because it has not experienced the temporal and spatial discretization error that may be significant near a pumping well furthermore to simulate head near a pumping well during the early time fine cells and short time steps are needed that significantly increases the computational time the computational time is a great concern especially when the parameter estimation involves many calls of the forward model sedghi and zhan 2019 in addition numerical models may not simulate the water table drainage with high accuracy as demonstrated previously samani et al 2004 5 1 aquifer parameter estimation the presented solution can be coupled with a parameter estimation code such as pest doherty et al 1994 to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer system using the drawdown data collected during a pumping test to do so a number of considerations are necessary for designing the test because of this research first the drawdown data collected from a shallow and deep piezometer are more valuable to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the underlying fractured aquifer i e kh 2 kz 2 and ssm and the parameters related to water table drainage i e sy and kz 1 respectively sedghi and samani 2015 furthermore the drawdown data collected during the intermediate and late times with td 1 are more valuable to estimate the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity values of the underlying fractured aquifer second as the shapes of the dimensionless drawdown derivative time curves are significantly different from the dimensionless drawdown curves especially during the intermediate time using the drawdown derivative data along with drawdown data in parameters estimation process may reduce the non uniqueness of the problem third the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to kh 2 kh 1 increases over time thus late time data are more valuable than the intermediate time to estimate kh 2 this is also true for kz 2 the late time drawdown derivative data are insensitive to kz 2 kz 1 therefore they cannot be used to estimate kz 2 to estimate ssm the intermediate time drawdown is more valuable fourth constructing the horizontal collector for the pumping well is not recommended if the well is constructed for the pumping test it reduces the sensitivity of the drawdown to the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer system the early and intermediate time data collected from the pumping test performed in a vertical pumping well with two perpendicular collectors are more valuable to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the underlying fractured aquifer compared to a vertical pumping well without any horizontal collectors and a vertical well with one horizontal collector fifth the presented solution is general and can be reduced to the leaky eliminating inter porosity term from the underlying fractured aquifer and unconfined eliminating the thickness of the underlying fractured aquifer aquifer thus it can be used for the case that the type and thickness of the underlying aquifer are unknown in these cases the estimated thickness and hydraulic parameters of the underlying aquifer will be helpful to identify the underlying aquifer and its properties 5 2 design of the pumping well as stated before the pumping well with a horizontal collector is not recommended for the case that it is designed to perform the pumping test the horizontal collector is recommended however for extraction in low permeability and or small thickness aquifers zhan et al 2001 this study shows that a single long collector is more effective for reducing drawdown than multiple collectors of the same total length this finding may be applicable in the design of the pumping well in small thickness and freshwater island aquifers 6 summary and conclusions in this paper the laplace domain point sink source solution of flow in an unconfined fractured aquifer system is obtained the point sink source solution is utilized to obtain line sink source solution of vertical horizontal and vertical pumping well with horizontal collectors the uniform flux condition is considered to simulate the pumping well the presented solution for unconfined fractured aquifer system is deviated from the solution for the single layer unconfined aquifer because of stored water in the underlying aquifer the following conclusions are drawn 1 increasing the length of the horizontal well decreases the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to the specific storage of the matrix blocks and horizontal and vertical values of hydraulic conductivity of fractures of the underlying fractured aquifer 2 drawdown derivative curves are insensitive to the length of the horizontal well during the late time 3 a vertical well with a single horizontal collector is more effective in reducing the dimensionless drawdown comparing to a vertical well with two perpendicular collectors of the same total length thus constructing a single horizontal collector will reduce drawdown in this type of aquifers 4 the drawdown produced by two collectors is higher near the vertical well and along the x axis and is lower along the y axis where the single collector is constructed 5 during the early time the highest absolute scaled sensitivity occurs for the case that two horizontal collectors are considered because of the lowest sink strength near the bottom of pumping well the sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown is the lowest there for a vertical well with a single horizontal collector 6 during the intermediate time when the drained water from the water table starts to contribute to pumping the lowest sensitivity to specific storage of the matrix blocks occurs for the case of a vertical well as the maximum strength of sink near water table is seen in this case 7 during the late time the sensitivity of the dimensionless drawdown to horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity values of the fractures of the underlying fractured aquifer is more marked for the case in which a vertical pumping well is considered when compared to the case that a vertical well with two horizontal collectors and a vertical well with a single horizontal collector is assumed 8 during the intermediate time gravity drainage of the water table reduces the scaled sensitivity of

6367,irrespective of the magnitude and spatial extend the consequences of a natural hazard are strongly connected to the vulnerability of elements at risk e g people buildings and infrastructure it is therefore obvious that an analysis and quantification of vulnerability is required for successful disaster risk reduction the need for vulnerability assessment is crucial due to the effects of climate change as well as the socio economic dynamics that may directly impact vulnerabilities and coping capacities of affected communities vulnerability is multidimensional physical social economic etc however the dimension which is mainly related to the direct costs and threat to human lives is the physical one we focus here on the physical vulnerability of buildings subject to torrential hazards occurring in small and steep mountain catchments these processes include fluvial sediment transport debris floods and debris flows furthermore we included flash flood hazards if these are related to torrential catchments physical vulnerability to torrential hazards in mountain areas is a topic that has been under scientific investigation over the last 20 years several methods to assess physical vulnerability of buildings towards flash floods debris flows and hyper concentrated flows can be found in the literature the plethora of methods and approaches may be classified under the following three categories vulnerability matrices vulnerability curves and vulnerability indices we provide a short review of these methods which became available over the last decade and which dominate the scientific debate in mountain hazard risk management giving an emphasis to vulnerability curves the approaches presented herein are highlighted through case studies from the european alps and beyond

exposure torrential hazards degree of loss buildings review 1 introduction mountain areas where 12 of the world s populations reside are high risk environments threatened by a range of natural hazards such as torrential flows landslides and snow avalanches fao 2011 we define torrential flows as constantly or temporarily flowing watercourses with strongly changing perennial or intermittent discharge and flow conditions originating within small and steep catchment areas aulitzky 1980 onr 2009 despite their differences in terms of time of onset duration frequency and recurrence interval torrential flows include a variety of different processes which can be distinguished by sediment concentration costa 1984 or peak discharge hungr et al 2001 these processes include fluvial sediment transport debris floods and debris flows furthermore even if defined by space time scales rather than sediment concentration we included flash floods in our assessment for those studies were these are related to torrential catchments borga et al 2014 all these processes are further referred to as torrential hazards climate change is expected to indirectly influence the frequency and the magnitude of these hazardous processes through changes in temperature and precipitation as well as through the effects of glacier retreat and permafrost degradation keiler et al 2010 borga et al 2014 moreover apart from the pressure posed by climatic conditions changes in land use and demography constitute also significant pressures for mountainous environments unep world conservation monitoring centre 2002 keiler and fuchs 2016 drivers and pressures such as economic degradation urbanization remoteness deforestation and overgrazing may strongly influence the impact of natural hazards on mountain communities zimmermann and keiler 2015 klein et al 2019 governments regional and local authorities and generally decision makers and the public are in search for solutions to minimize risks and negative consequences the paper focuses on recent progress of physical vulnerability research as far as torrential hazards are concerned and includes a review of studies published over the last ten years there exist different definitions of vulnerability thywissen 2006 fuchs and thaler 2018 derived from various disciplinary scholarly backgrounds physical vulnerability specifically is defined as the degree of loss to a given element or set of elements within the area affected by a hazard it is expressed on a scale of 0 no loss to 1 total loss undro 1984 nevertheless unisdr 2009 defines vulnerability in general as the characteristics and circumstances of a community system or asset that makes it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard while the first definition relates vulnerability to the physical and economic consequences of an event ex post the latter takes a wider viewpoint and considers vulnerability to be a pre existing condition ex ante which depends on the physical condition design and constructive characteristics as well as the surroundings of elements at risk fuchs 2009 the aim of this paper is to focus particularly on vulnerability curves used to measure physical vulnerability to take a closer look at alternative methods and to provide an outlook on challenges and recommendations for future research the present review is not the first of its kind but the most recent and detailed one focusing on advances in physical vulnerability assessment for exposed buildings in mountain environments general reviews such as the one of vamvatsikos et al 2010 concentrating on structural vulnerability assessment for buildings exposed to a variety of natural hazards including landslides are available moreover birkmann et al 2013 and ciurean et al 2013 reviewed vulnerability frameworks for different vulnerability dimensions e g physical social economic and hazards and fuchs 2009 provided an example for integrative vulnerability assessment in austria some reviews focused on alpine natural hazards in general papathoma köhle et al 2011 and some specifically on debris flows and a variety of methods for the assessment of physical vulnerability of buildings papathoma köhle et al 2017 short reviews can be also found in many papers and studies such as the ones of fuchs et al 2007 fuchs 2008 akbas et al 2009 and totschnig and fuchs 2013 who provide short discussions on vulnerability curves there is however an increasing amount of new studies dealing with the topic leading to improvements in data quantity and quality these studies are discussed in this paper 2 the diversity of vulnerability assessment methods before the 1950s efforts to reduce the impact of natural hazards were concentrated on engineering hazard mitigation and risk reduction however during the 1980s and 1990s focus on the understanding assessment and eventually reduction of exposure and vulnerability increased e g holub fuchs 2009 fuchs et al 2015 2017 nowadays research on vulnerability is still an essential part of risk research fuchs et al 2011 there are ongoing efforts to comprehend analyse measure and if possible visualise vulnerability fuchs and thaler 2018 knowledge regarding the vulnerability hotspots the location of vulnerable groups and buildings as well as infrastructure is essential for emergency and land use planning as well as budget allocation for mitigation and adaptation a closer look to the interaction between different vulnerability dimensions is also essential as the focus often is still on individual dimensions of vulnerability physical social economical institutional fuchs thaler 2018 last but not least vulnerability has to be considered as a dynamic concept because changes through time as well as the drivers of these changes are apparent due to environmental and socio economic dynamics and dynamics of the political system mazzorana et al 2012 fuchs et al 2013 the first efforts to measure and assess physical vulnerability were the development of matrices a qualitative method to relate hazard process intensities to associated consequences such as loss these matrices were evolved to the more quantitative vulnerability curves and more recently vulnerability indicators were employed for the assessment of physical vulnerability of buildings although vulnerability curves or functions are still very popular recently studies using alternative methods are growing in number the advantages and disadvantages of these three methodological approaches are shown in table 1 papathoma köhle et al 2017 3 assessing physical vulnerability using vulnerability functions recent advances pros and cons 3 1 what are vulnerability functions vulnerability functions constitute the only quantitative method for assessing the vulnerability of buildings they are widely used for assessing risk from earthquake and riverine flood hazards where the number of affected buildings is great and capable to create a reliable curve according to tarbotton et al 2015 vulnerability functions are continuous curves that relate the intensity of a hazardous process x axis to the damage state of a building y axis hence these functions are based on the relationship between the magnitude of the event and the degree of loss per building vulnerability curves are not to be confused with fragility curves that express the relationship between intensity and probability of damage in the case of riverine floods intensity on the x axis is often expressed as the inundation height in torrential hazards however dynamic processes cause possible damage patterns that may be different from static inundation although the flow height of debris is mostly used viscosity velocity orientation and duration of the flow are also important in order to derive a curve we need to know the intensity value per building since this is spatially variable however this value is rarely available or captured by event documentation alternatively the values of the hazard intensity per building can be acquired through modelling however recent studies unveiled limitations during model application with respect to the spatial extent of depositions as well as deposition heights chow et al 2018 on the other hand the damage state of the building y axis is often expressed as degree of loss meaning the ratio between damage costs and the value of each individual element at risk and can be assigned with values from 0 to 1 thus the first step in estimating the degree of loss is to calculate the value of the building this value should represent the reconstruction value rather than the market value that may also depend on other factors e g location view proximity to public transport fuchs and mcalpin 2005 the value of the elements at risk mirrors also the land value which remains typically unaffected by floods in case of affected buildings insurance companies tax offices and engineering reports provide these values or methods to calculate them directly based on the size of the building e g fuchs et al 2015 papathoma köhle et al 2015 röthlisberger et al 2018 the next step is to determine the damage costs per building the damage costs in most of the cases include the costs of reconstructing a building and bringing it back to its initial condition excluding its household contents such as furniture household appliances and consumer electronics e g mosimann et al 2018 the costs do not always equal the compensation that is given from the state information regarding the damage costs may be provided by authorities and insurance companies or calculated individually when information regarding the damage the size of the building and the costs of the repair works are available the shape of the final curve depends on the number of points as well as the type of function chosen in more detail once individual buildings are represented as points on a xy axis system then the function that ensures the best fit may be chosen this function must fulfill a number of criteria that are defined by the developer of the curve the function should run through the 0 0 point meaning that zero intensity causes zero degree of loss additionally the function should not exceed the limit of degree of loss 1 since degree of loss more than one is only possible if costs other than direct damage costs are included the type of function and the associated error statistics such as r2 coefficient of determination or rmse root mean square error define its reliability it is obvious that all these methods and approaches above depend on data availability and data quality a detailed building inventory is necessary as well as detailed information regarding the building value the intensity of the hazard event per building and the damage costs this implies that detailed event documentation is required the resulting vulnerability function may then be used in areas with similar housing to compute the costs of future scenarios 3 2 review of existing vulnerability functions a list of recent vulnerability studies regarding torrential hazards is reported in table 2 eighteen studies were analyzed focusing on the computation of vulnerability curves dating from 2007 to 2019 including case studies from europe and asia the table contains the calculation technique for variables including intensity building value and degree of loss as well as the data acquisition method for each study table 2 also includes some fragility curves these curves express the relationship between the intensity of the process and the probability of an element at risk to exceed a specific damage state hazus 2006 has provided a number of fragility curves based on us data for earthquakes these fragility curves represent the probability of different damage states as a function of the spectral displacement haugen and kaynia 2008 used these curves to assess the vulnerability of wooden and concrete buildings to debris flows the most recent fragility curves for debris flows are published by prieto et al 2018 who based the curves on the hydrodynamic forces of the process and the structural resistance of the building they used more than one intensity parameter to express the lateral force including momentum flux debris flow density drag coefficient and debris impact force coefficient as far as the structural resistance is concerned physical characteristics including weight to breadth ratio and lateral capacity parameters were considered focusing on the vulnerability curves fuchs et al 2007 and akbas et al 2009 published curves based on empirical data from torrential hazards in austria and italy quan luna et al 2011 provided vulnerability curves using different expressions of the intensity including debris height velocity and viscosity of the flow to overcome reported biases in cases where buildings affected by torrential hazards are exceptionally high totschnig et al 2011 published vulnerability curves based on relative intensities expressing the process intensity as a relation between debris height and the height of the building a quantification of the uncertainties associated with vulnerability curves for torrential hazards was included in a subsequent study by totschnig and fuchs 2013 papathoma köhle et al 2012 tackled the challenge of limited data by using photographic documentation to assess the hazard intensity and the damage of buildings based on a case study in italy the monetary loss was calculated on the basis of the reconstruction works needed for the restoration of the building the resulting vulnerability curve was later updated using additional data from other events in the european alps papathoma köhle et al 2015 later on bermúdez and zischg 2018 used the curves of totschnig et al 2011 and papathoma köhle et al 2015 among other flood vulnerability curves in combination with inundation modelling to develop a flood loss model this model was tested in switzerland and triggered a short discussion on the transferability of vulnerability functions to other geographical settings than those where these curves had been developed simultaneously fuchs et al 2019 presented a model to predict flood loss in mountain areas based on data from studies on physical vulnerability available for the eastern european alps and also published the model code so that other scholars may further develop this model and enhance the overall predictive power at the same time rheinberger et al 2013 used swiss data from 132 buildings damaged in five debris flow events to develop so called proportional loss functions ratio of observed damage to total building value including household contents according to this study flow depth flow velocity and their interaction were the most important factors that influence the damage degree of buildings the proportional loss functions were calculated for different flow velocities and compared to existing vulnerability curves totschnig et al 2011 totschnig and fuchs 2013 the results showed that although for some flow velocities the loss prediction was significantly lower in general the results were in good agreement with the existing functions rheinberger et al 2013 also considered factors that characterize the element at risk such as the usage type the type of construction and local structural protection measures godfrey et al 2015 attempted a combination of vulnerability curves and vulnerability indicators based on the characteristics of the buildings they developed a vulnerability index in combination with a generic vulnerability curve for their romanian study area another example of curves based on data from areas beyond the european alps is the study of karagiorgos et al 2016a b c that concentrates on flash flood events in greece these studies show vulnerability curves for commercial and residential buildings with and without cellar based on these studies and some older ones such as the one of fuchs et al 2007 and papathoma köhle et al 2012 azmeri and isa 2018 published a number of curves order 2 and 3 polynomial for flash floods in indonesia the differences to existing curves were attributed to differences in process characteristics between the study areas two older studies from asia added two important aspects to the vulnerability discussion the first one from lo et al 2012 considered the additional household contents loss to the structural damage of the building and the study by kang and kim 2016 based on a large data set of empirical data presented several vulnerability curves for different building types building on the vulnerability curves of kang and kim 2016 kim et al 2017 proposed a quantitative model to assess vulnerability considering the physical as well as the social vulnerability using census data rather than individual buildings for their assessment even if an event is well documented the interaction between exposed buildings and the process is very difficult to record and to investigate closely zhang et al 2016 used laboratory experiments to capture this interaction for brick and concrete structures using an iron sphere to simulate the impact on the wall they concluded that among three expressions of intensity momentum maximum impact force and maximum impact bending moment the latter was the most suitable to use for the development of a vulnerability curve finally one of the most recent examples of vulnerability curves is the one by ciurean et al 2017 for buildings subject to debris flows at local and regional scale they used the market value of the buildings and photographic documentation to calculate the degree of loss damage ratio to include the uncertainties two curves maximum and minimum were plotted the average curve is in accordance to other existing curves in the literature for the regional scale ciurean et al 2017 also used a model which is based on indicators parametric vulnerability assessment nearly all the curves that can be found in the literature are made for buildings as far as infrastructure is concerned and particularly road networks curves are not a very popular method for the assessment of physical vulnerability an exception is the study of winter et al 2013 that developed fragility curves for roads subject to debris flows expressing the intensity as volume of debris m3 3 3 uncertainties and challenges related to vulnerability functions uncertainties related to the vulnerability curves are partly related to the assessment of the process intensity a torrential hazard is characterised by a number of properties including the height of the water and debris the direction of the flow as well as its velocity viscosity and the duration of the process this information is usually not available in the necessary resolution moreover vulnerability curves are often based on event specific data making the curve type and shape highly location specific as a result curves based on events with very low intensities are less reliable than curves that are based on data showing a larger spread additionally although information on the monetary damage per building is required for the computation of vulnerability curves such data are not always available to overcome this gap monetary damage has been assessed by calculating the cost of the necessary repair works e g holub and fuchs 2008 papathoma köhle et al 2012 golz et al 2015 neubert et al 2016 schinke et al 2016 regarding a specific building uncertainties may differ significantly because of the methodology due to the building type approach uncertainties arise elsewhere in the model in the case of debris flows monetary damage data often also includes additional compensation for the content of buildings or auxiliary buildings in the property the comparison of the vulnerability curves presented in table 2 is nearly impossible since each study uses another approach for the calculation of the value of the building in some cases e g ciurean et al 2017 the market value is used while in other cases totschnig et al 2011 papathoma köhle et al 2012 calculations are based on the reconstruction value the value of the building is connected to its size which is also calculated in a different way for each study for example the values of the basement and the attic of the house are often included in the studies with a relatively high bias due to unknown extent and use furthermore the degree of loss the ratio between the monetary damage and the value of the building is often misleading since some buildings have an unusually high value due to a high number of floors which influences the degree of loss in a negative way an alternative approach to calculating loss e g damage m2 per affected floor may be the key in the future to reduce uncertainties in this respect as far as the function type is concerned most of the studies have chosen a regression curve to express the relationship between the degree of loss and the process intensity in some cases a linear relationship has been chosen godfrey et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 however most of the studies have chosen a non linear function which best fits the data a number of recently published vulnerability functions used to assess risk from torrential hazards is presented in table 3 a variety of non linear regression approaches have been used to analyse the relationship between degree of loss and intensity of the process a considerable amount of studies has used the weibull distribution whereas a few others have used second or third order polynomial function or logistic regression all these functions have some common characteristics but also a couple of significant differences they all go through the point 0 0 which is a prerequisite for the assessment of vulnerability since by 0 debris height there is no loss on the other hand results obtained using weibull or logistic functions are within the interval 0 1 while polynomial functions are not limited to a certain interval fig 1 some studies also provide an r2 for the function to confirm the reliability of the curve the coefficient of determination r2 varies from 0 99 to 0 86 table 3 which can be considered satisfactory the number of the buildings used to compute the function is also variable and therefore determines the level of uncertainty fig 1 displays the vulnerability curves of table 3 that use flow depth and or deposition height to express intensity it is obvious that apart from the curve of karagiorgos et al 2016c the other curves show consistent increase in degree of loss between 1 m and 3 m process intensity differences in the shape of the curves may be attributed to differences in architectural style and material in the case studies or differences in the process varying ratio between water and material although a direct comparison between the available vulnerability curves would be challenging it is clear from table 3 and fig 1 that different curves predict different intensities as capable to cause total destruction degree of loss 1 to a building these intensities vary significantly among the studies according to fuchs et al 2007 a building can be totally destroyed with 3 15 m flow height whereas according to papathoma köhle et al 2015 7 85 m flow height is needed for the total destruction of buildings table 3 these differences are associated with differences in the architecture of buildings the content of solid materials and debris in the flow but also with differences in the spread of values of the various datasets a closer look at the uncertainties related to vulnerability curves has been carried out by eidsvig et al 2014 using uncertainty bands to communicate the uncertainties of vulnerability curve to stakeholders to assist them in decision making moreover empirical data of a vulnerability curve were used to determine the probability distribution of damage for different intensity values 4 alternative methods to vulnerability functions and supporting laboratory experiments natural and social scientists economists urban planners and authorities are in search of alternative methods for vulnerability assessment to avoid the drawbacks of the vulnerability curves since physical vulnerability is dependent on building characteristics the use of vulnerability indicators could be useful to qualitatively assess vulnerability the studies applying indicator based methodologies are continuously increasing kappes et al 2012 thouret et al 2014 ettinger et al 2016 thennavan et al 2016 carlier et al 2018 papathoma köhle et al 2019 although these studies mainly involve buildings some recent attempts have been made to assess the vulnerability of the road network to debris flow using indicators zou et al 2018 nevertheless additional research is needed for a better selection of indicators an improved and reliable weighting and aggregation and for reliable scenarios as a basis of the assessment moreover as indicator based approaches require detailed inventories of elements at risk alternative ways of data mining such as using questionnaires and remotely sensed data e g google street view increasingly gain importance yu et al 2018 despite the numerous studies on the physical vulnerability of buildings there is still a gap concerning the interaction of buildings and the natural process laboratory experiments and numerical modelling may be used to overcome this gap gems et al 2016 the information acquired may replace empirical data as shown for flood vulnerability armanini and scotton 1993 armanini et al 2010 scheidl et al 2013 mazzorana et al 2014 gems et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 however similar studies focusing on torrential hazards are still scarce regarding laboratory experiments a remarkable effort to record and understand the interaction between buildings and torrential hazards has been made by sturm et al 2018a b they used a scaled fan model including building stock to capture the process impact pressure on the walls using measuring devices under different scenarios the results of the measurements not only provided information on impact pressure and flow heights per building but they also demonstrated the importance of scale in vulnerability assessment while some of the buildings acted as protective shields for neighbouring buildings they redirected the flow and finally increased the intensity for other buildings moreover it was shown that windows and other openings reduce the impact pressure on the walls decreasing at the same time the probability of a wall to collapse nevertheless as proven by empirical data material intrusion may raise the damage costs considerably finally milanesi et al 2018 focused on the interaction between the walls of a building and a potential hyperconcentrated flow they studied the collapse mechanisms and the stability thresholds of traditional alpine masonry buildings using limit analysis and the results were compared to the results of finite element analysis the study of milanesi et al 2018 can have many applications including the validation of the skew of empirical vulnerability functions such as the ones presented here moreover the results of such studies can enhance the knowledge on building retrofitting and local structural protection as shown by holub et al 2012 with respect to an idealised hazard proof residential building 5 challenges in vulnerability assessment and the way forward the development of vulnerability curves is based on available empirical data which are related to the damage pattern of buildings following disastrous events a continuous thorough and standardised post event documentation will enable the development of multiple curves for different building types or even for buildings with common characteristics e g buildings with basement brick buildings reinforced concrete buildings citizen science and mobile applications can support better real time documentation during the event and information regarding the process intensity so that different characteristics of the process may be captured numerous reviews of existing application of citizen science and crowdsourcing for disaster management kocaman et al 2018 haworth and bruce 2015 demonstrate the utility and significance of existing methods e g vgi volunteer geographic information a large amount of information may be collected in short time and at low cost and be used for disaster management purposes nevertheless the role of vgi is currently limited in the post event phase and should probably be strengthened in the phases before an event preparedness haworth and bruce 2015 however there is a downside to data collection by volunteers and the affected population according to poser and dransch 2010 there is a need for further research as far as the quality control of the collected information is concerned the vast amount of unstructured information following an event has to be turned into useful information last but not least motives have to be given to citizens so that they contribute to the gathering of disaster information regarding preparedness the predictive capacity of vulnerability curves described here could be enhanced using complementary empirical data based on a classification of elements at risk in particular a building type based approach that uses dependencies between hazard and damage patterns for specific classes of buildings e g golz et al 2015 schinke et al 2016 can be helpful to estimate potential damage costs prior to disastrous events provided it will be extended for torrential hazards additionally no physical vulnerability assessment is complete without the consideration of buildings of special use and infrastructure critical infrastructure buildings such as hospitals or industrial units cannot be included in the traditional vulnerability curves with residential or commercial buildings studies of vulnerability curves for roads or other transport networks are also limited e g schlögl et al 2019 and future research should be conducted in this direction moreover climate change and socio economic change are expected to have a direct effect on the shape and form of the vulnerability curves finally yet importantly a significant challenge that vulnerability curve developers and practitioners have to face is the fact that vulnerability curves are site specific and not always transferable more research is necessary to understand the importance of the type of housing and local architecture to the consequences of torrential hazards on buildings it is clear that the vulnerability of the buildings although named physical is dependent on a large number of factors that may be social economic cultural etc the level of income of citizens reflect on the robustness of their homes similarly building codes and legislation relates directly to the quality of housing and corruption or lack of democracy may negatively affect their implementation these facts indicate the need to approach vulnerability as a whole and not as separate dimensions of it physical social economic vulnerability more specifically we strongly believe that the institutional dimension of vulnerability is the umbrella dimension which influences strongly all the other vulnerabilities including the physical one an institutional approach to vulnerability research may be the key to the understanding of vulnerability and its reduction 6 conclusions the recent advances in vulnerability assessment methods for buildings threatened by torrential hazards presented in this paper clearly show that there is still a need for further research in this field existing vulnerability curves may be improved with the availability of additional damage data and alternative methods may be used alone or in combination to shed light on the interaction between natural processes and elements at risk all this knowledge will contribute to the enhanced assessment of risk and to the design of adequate risk reduction strategies declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements maria papathoma köhle has been supported by the austrian

reviews focused on alpine natural hazards in general papathoma köhle et al 2011 and some specifically on debris flows and a variety of methods for the assessment of physical vulnerability of buildings papathoma köhle et al 2017 short reviews can be also found in many papers and studies such as the ones of fuchs et al 2007 fuchs 2008 akbas et al 2009 and totschnig and fuchs 2013 who provide short discussions on vulnerability curves there is however an increasing amount of new studies dealing with the topic leading to improvements in data quantity and quality these studies are discussed in this paper 2 the diversity of vulnerability assessment methods before the 1950s efforts to reduce the impact of natural hazards were concentrated on engineering hazard mitigation and risk reduction however during the 1980s and 1990s focus on the understanding assessment and eventually reduction of exposure and vulnerability increased e g holub fuchs 2009 fuchs et al 2015 2017 nowadays research on vulnerability is still an essential part of risk research fuchs et al 2011 there are ongoing efforts to comprehend analyse measure and if possible visualise vulnerability fuchs and thaler 2018 knowledge regarding the vulnerability hotspots the location of vulnerable groups and buildings as well as infrastructure is essential for emergency and land use planning as well as budget allocation for mitigation and adaptation a closer look to the interaction between different vulnerability dimensions is also essential as the focus often is still on individual dimensions of vulnerability physical social economical institutional fuchs thaler 2018 last but not least vulnerability has to be considered as a dynamic concept because changes through time as well as the drivers of these changes are apparent due to environmental and socio economic dynamics and dynamics of the political system mazzorana et al 2012 fuchs et al 2013 the first efforts to measure and assess physical vulnerability were the development of matrices a qualitative method to relate hazard process intensities to associated consequences such as loss these matrices were evolved to the more quantitative vulnerability curves and more recently vulnerability indicators were employed for the assessment of physical vulnerability of buildings although vulnerability curves or functions are still very popular recently studies using alternative methods are growing in number the advantages and disadvantages of these three methodological approaches are shown in table 1 papathoma köhle et al 2017 3 assessing physical vulnerability using vulnerability functions recent advances pros and cons 3 1 what are vulnerability functions vulnerability functions constitute the only quantitative method for assessing the vulnerability of buildings they are widely used for assessing risk from earthquake and riverine flood hazards where the number of affected buildings is great and capable to create a reliable curve according to tarbotton et al 2015 vulnerability functions are continuous curves that relate the intensity of a hazardous process x axis to the damage state of a building y axis hence these functions are based on the relationship between the magnitude of the event and the degree of loss per building vulnerability curves are not to be confused with fragility curves that express the relationship between intensity and probability of damage in the case of riverine floods intensity on the x axis is often expressed as the inundation height in torrential hazards however dynamic processes cause possible damage patterns that may be different from static inundation although the flow height of debris is mostly used viscosity velocity orientation and duration of the flow are also important in order to derive a curve we need to know the intensity value per building since this is spatially variable however this value is rarely available or captured by event documentation alternatively the values of the hazard intensity per building can be acquired through modelling however recent studies unveiled limitations during model application with respect to the spatial extent of depositions as well as deposition heights chow et al 2018 on the other hand the damage state of the building y axis is often expressed as degree of loss meaning the ratio between damage costs and the value of each individual element at risk and can be assigned with values from 0 to 1 thus the first step in estimating the degree of loss is to calculate the value of the building this value should represent the reconstruction value rather than the market value that may also depend on other factors e g location view proximity to public transport fuchs and mcalpin 2005 the value of the elements at risk mirrors also the land value which remains typically unaffected by floods in case of affected buildings insurance companies tax offices and engineering reports provide these values or methods to calculate them directly based on the size of the building e g fuchs et al 2015 papathoma köhle et al 2015 röthlisberger et al 2018 the next step is to determine the damage costs per building the damage costs in most of the cases include the costs of reconstructing a building and bringing it back to its initial condition excluding its household contents such as furniture household appliances and consumer electronics e g mosimann et al 2018 the costs do not always equal the compensation that is given from the state information regarding the damage costs may be provided by authorities and insurance companies or calculated individually when information regarding the damage the size of the building and the costs of the repair works are available the shape of the final curve depends on the number of points as well as the type of function chosen in more detail once individual buildings are represented as points on a xy axis system then the function that ensures the best fit may be chosen this function must fulfill a number of criteria that are defined by the developer of the curve the function should run through the 0 0 point meaning that zero intensity causes zero degree of loss additionally the function should not exceed the limit of degree of loss 1 since degree of loss more than one is only possible if costs other than direct damage costs are included the type of function and the associated error statistics such as r2 coefficient of determination or rmse root mean square error define its reliability it is obvious that all these methods and approaches above depend on data availability and data quality a detailed building inventory is necessary as well as detailed information regarding the building value the intensity of the hazard event per building and the damage costs this implies that detailed event documentation is required the resulting vulnerability function may then be used in areas with similar housing to compute the costs of future scenarios 3 2 review of existing vulnerability functions a list of recent vulnerability studies regarding torrential hazards is reported in table 2 eighteen studies were analyzed focusing on the computation of vulnerability curves dating from 2007 to 2019 including case studies from europe and asia the table contains the calculation technique for variables including intensity building value and degree of loss as well as the data acquisition method for each study table 2 also includes some fragility curves these curves express the relationship between the intensity of the process and the probability of an element at risk to exceed a specific damage state hazus 2006 has provided a number of fragility curves based on us data for earthquakes these fragility curves represent the probability of different damage states as a function of the spectral displacement haugen and kaynia 2008 used these curves to assess the vulnerability of wooden and concrete buildings to debris flows the most recent fragility curves for debris flows are published by prieto et al 2018 who based the curves on the hydrodynamic forces of the process and the structural resistance of the building they used more than one intensity parameter to express the lateral force including momentum flux debris flow density drag coefficient and debris impact force coefficient as far as the structural resistance is concerned physical characteristics including weight to breadth ratio and lateral capacity parameters were considered focusing on the vulnerability curves fuchs et al 2007 and akbas et al 2009 published curves based on empirical data from torrential hazards in austria and italy quan luna et al 2011 provided vulnerability curves using different expressions of the intensity including debris height velocity and viscosity of the flow to overcome reported biases in cases where buildings affected by torrential hazards are exceptionally high totschnig et al 2011 published vulnerability curves based on relative intensities expressing the process intensity as a relation between debris height and the height of the building a quantification of the uncertainties associated with vulnerability curves for torrential hazards was included in a subsequent study by totschnig and fuchs 2013 papathoma köhle et al 2012 tackled the challenge of limited data by using photographic documentation to assess the hazard intensity and the damage of buildings based on a case study in italy the monetary loss was calculated on the basis of the reconstruction works needed for the restoration of the building the resulting vulnerability curve was later updated using additional data from other events in the european alps papathoma köhle et al 2015 later on bermúdez and zischg 2018 used the curves of totschnig et al 2011 and papathoma köhle et al 2015 among other flood vulnerability curves in combination with inundation modelling to develop a flood loss model this model was tested in switzerland and triggered a short discussion on the transferability of vulnerability functions to other geographical settings than those where these curves had been developed simultaneously fuchs et al 2019 presented a model to predict flood loss in mountain areas based on data from studies on physical vulnerability available for the eastern european alps and also published the model code so that other scholars may further develop this model and enhance the overall predictive power at the same time rheinberger et al 2013 used swiss data from 132 buildings damaged in five debris flow events to develop so called proportional loss functions ratio of observed damage to total building value including household contents according to this study flow depth flow velocity and their interaction were the most important factors that influence the damage degree of buildings the proportional loss functions were calculated for different flow velocities and compared to existing vulnerability curves totschnig et al 2011 totschnig and fuchs 2013 the results showed that although for some flow velocities the loss prediction was significantly lower in general the results were in good agreement with the existing functions rheinberger et al 2013 also considered factors that characterize the element at risk such as the usage type the type of construction and local structural protection measures godfrey et al 2015 attempted a combination of vulnerability curves and vulnerability indicators based on the characteristics of the buildings they developed a vulnerability index in combination with a generic vulnerability curve for their romanian study area another example of curves based on data from areas beyond the european alps is the study of karagiorgos et al 2016a b c that concentrates on flash flood events in greece these studies show vulnerability curves for commercial and residential buildings with and without cellar based on these studies and some older ones such as the one of fuchs et al 2007 and papathoma köhle et al 2012 azmeri and isa 2018 published a number of curves order 2 and 3 polynomial for flash floods in indonesia the differences to existing curves were attributed to differences in process characteristics between the study areas two older studies from asia added two important aspects to the vulnerability discussion the first one from lo et al 2012 considered the additional household contents loss to the structural damage of the building and the study by kang and kim 2016 based on a large data set of empirical data presented several vulnerability curves for different building types building on the vulnerability curves of kang and kim 2016 kim et al 2017 proposed a quantitative model to assess vulnerability considering the physical as well as the social vulnerability using census data rather than individual buildings for their assessment even if an event is well documented the interaction between exposed buildings and the process is very difficult to record and to investigate closely zhang et al 2016 used laboratory experiments to capture this interaction for brick and concrete structures using an iron sphere to simulate the impact on the wall they concluded that among three expressions of intensity momentum maximum impact force and maximum impact bending moment the latter was the most suitable to use for the development of a vulnerability curve finally one of the most recent examples of vulnerability curves is the one by ciurean et al 2017 for buildings subject to debris flows at local and regional scale they used the market value of the buildings and photographic documentation to calculate the degree of loss damage ratio to include the uncertainties two curves maximum and minimum were plotted the average curve is in accordance to other existing curves in the literature for the regional scale ciurean et al 2017 also used a model which is based on indicators parametric vulnerability assessment nearly all the curves that can be found in the literature are made for buildings as far as infrastructure is concerned and particularly road networks curves are not a very popular method for the assessment of physical vulnerability an exception is the study of winter et al 2013 that developed fragility curves for roads subject to debris flows expressing the intensity as volume of debris m3 3 3 uncertainties and challenges related to vulnerability functions uncertainties related to the vulnerability curves are partly related to the assessment of the process intensity a torrential hazard is characterised by a number of properties including the height of the water and debris the direction of the flow as well as its velocity viscosity and the duration of the process this information is usually not available in the necessary resolution moreover vulnerability curves are often based on event specific data making the curve type and shape highly location specific as a result curves based on events with very low intensities are less reliable than curves that are based on data showing a larger spread additionally although information on the monetary damage per building is required for the computation of vulnerability curves such data are not always available to overcome this gap monetary damage has been assessed by calculating the cost of the necessary repair works e g holub and fuchs 2008 papathoma köhle et al 2012 golz et al 2015 neubert et al 2016 schinke et al 2016 regarding a specific building uncertainties may differ significantly because of the methodology due to the building type approach uncertainties arise elsewhere in the model in the case of debris flows monetary damage data often also includes additional compensation for the content of buildings or auxiliary buildings in the property the comparison of the vulnerability curves presented in table 2 is nearly impossible since each study uses another approach for the calculation of the value of the building in some cases e g ciurean et al 2017 the market value is used while in other cases totschnig et al 2011 papathoma köhle et al 2012 calculations are based on the reconstruction value the value of the building is connected to its size which is also calculated in a different way for each study for example the values of the basement and the attic of the house are often included in the studies with a relatively high bias due to unknown extent and use furthermore the degree of loss the ratio between the monetary damage and the value of the building is often misleading since some buildings have an unusually high value due to a high number of floors which influences the degree of loss in a negative way an alternative approach to calculating loss e g damage m2 per affected floor may be the key in the future to reduce uncertainties in this respect as far as the function type is concerned most of the studies have chosen a regression curve to express the relationship between the degree of loss and the process intensity in some cases a linear relationship has been chosen godfrey et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 however most of the studies have chosen a non linear function which best fits the data a number of recently published vulnerability functions used to assess risk from torrential hazards is presented in table 3 a variety of non linear regression approaches have been used to analyse the relationship between degree of loss and intensity of the process a considerable amount of studies has used the weibull distribution whereas a few others have used second or third order polynomial function or logistic regression all these functions have some common characteristics but also a couple of significant differences they all go through the point 0 0 which is a prerequisite for the assessment of vulnerability since by 0 debris height there is no loss on the other hand results obtained using weibull or logistic functions are within the interval 0 1 while polynomial functions are not limited to a certain interval fig 1 some studies also provide an r2 for the function to confirm the reliability of the curve the coefficient of determination r2 varies from 0 99 to 0 86 table 3 which can be considered satisfactory the number of the buildings used to compute the function is also variable and therefore determines the level of uncertainty fig 1 displays the vulnerability curves of table 3 that use flow depth and or deposition height to express intensity it is obvious that apart from the curve of karagiorgos et al 2016c the other curves show consistent increase in degree of loss between 1 m and 3 m process intensity differences in the shape of the curves may be attributed to differences in architectural style and material in the case studies or differences in the process varying ratio between water and material although a direct comparison between the available vulnerability curves would be challenging it is clear from table 3 and fig 1 that different curves predict different intensities as capable to cause total destruction degree of loss 1 to a building these intensities vary significantly among the studies according to fuchs et al 2007 a building can be totally destroyed with 3 15 m flow height whereas according to papathoma köhle et al 2015 7 85 m flow height is needed for the total destruction of buildings table 3 these differences are associated with differences in the architecture of buildings the content of solid materials and debris in the flow but also with differences in the spread of values of the various datasets a closer look at the uncertainties related to vulnerability curves has been carried out by eidsvig et al 2014 using uncertainty bands to communicate the uncertainties of vulnerability curve to stakeholders to assist them in decision making moreover empirical data of a vulnerability curve were used to determine the probability distribution of damage for different intensity values 4 alternative methods to vulnerability functions and supporting laboratory experiments natural and social scientists economists urban planners and authorities are in search of alternative methods for vulnerability assessment to avoid the drawbacks of the vulnerability curves since physical vulnerability is dependent on building characteristics the use of vulnerability indicators could be useful to qualitatively assess vulnerability the studies applying indicator based methodologies are continuously increasing kappes et al 2012 thouret et al 2014 ettinger et al 2016 thennavan et al 2016 carlier et al 2018 papathoma köhle et al 2019 although these studies mainly involve buildings some recent attempts have been made to assess the vulnerability of the road network to debris flow using indicators zou et al 2018 nevertheless additional research is needed for a better selection of indicators an improved and reliable weighting and aggregation and for reliable scenarios as a basis of the assessment moreover as indicator based approaches require detailed inventories of elements at risk alternative ways of data mining such as using questionnaires and remotely sensed data e g google street view increasingly gain importance yu et al 2018 despite the numerous studies on the physical vulnerability of buildings there is still a gap concerning the interaction of buildings and the natural process laboratory experiments and numerical modelling may be used to overcome this gap gems et al 2016 the information acquired may replace empirical data as shown for flood vulnerability armanini and scotton 1993 armanini et al 2010 scheidl et al 2013 mazzorana et al 2014 gems et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 however similar studies focusing on torrential hazards are still scarce regarding laboratory experiments a remarkable effort to record and understand the interaction between buildings and torrential hazards has been made by sturm et al 2018a b they used a scaled fan model including building stock to capture the process impact pressure on the walls using measuring devices under different scenarios the results of the measurements not only provided information on impact pressure and flow heights per building but they also demonstrated the importance of scale in vulnerability assessment while some of the buildings acted as protective shields for neighbouring buildings they redirected the flow and finally increased the intensity for other buildings moreover it was shown that windows and other openings reduce the impact pressure on the walls decreasing at the same time the probability of a wall to collapse nevertheless as proven by empirical data material intrusion may raise the damage costs considerably finally milanesi et al 2018 focused on the interaction between the walls of a building and a potential hyperconcentrated flow they studied the collapse mechanisms and the stability thresholds of traditional alpine masonry buildings using limit analysis and the results were compared to the results of finite element analysis the study of milanesi et al 2018 can have many applications including the validation of the skew of empirical vulnerability functions such as the ones presented here moreover the results of such studies can enhance the knowledge on building retrofitting and local structural protection as shown by holub et al 2012 with respect to an idealised hazard proof residential building 5 challenges in vulnerability assessment and the way forward the development of vulnerability curves is based on available empirical data which are related to the damage pattern of buildings following disastrous events a continuous thorough and standardised post event documentation will enable the development of multiple curves for different building types or even for buildings with common characteristics e g buildings with basement brick buildings reinforced concrete buildings citizen science and mobile applications can support better real time documentation during the event and information regarding the process intensity so that different characteristics of the process may be captured numerous reviews of existing application of citizen science and crowdsourcing for disaster management kocaman et al 2018 haworth and bruce 2015 demonstrate the utility and significance of existing methods e g vgi volunteer geographic information a large amount of information may be collected in short time and at low cost and be used for disaster management purposes nevertheless the role of vgi is currently limited in the post event phase and should probably be strengthened in the phases before an event preparedness haworth and bruce 2015 however there is a downside to data collection by volunteers and the affected population according to poser and dransch 2010 there is a need for further research as far as the quality control of the collected information is concerned the vast amount of unstructured information following an event has to be turned into useful information last but not least motives have to be given to citizens so that they contribute to the gathering of disaster information regarding preparedness the predictive capacity of vulnerability curves described here could be enhanced using complementary empirical data based on a classification of elements at risk in particular a building type based approach that uses dependencies between hazard and damage patterns for specific classes of buildings e g golz et al 2015 schinke et al 2016 can be helpful to estimate potential damage costs prior to disastrous events provided it will be extended for torrential hazards additionally no physical vulnerability assessment is complete without the consideration of buildings of special use and infrastructure critical infrastructure buildings such as hospitals or industrial units cannot be included in the traditional vulnerability curves with residential or commercial buildings studies of vulnerability curves for roads or other transport networks are also limited e g schlögl et al 2019 and future research should be conducted in this direction moreover climate change and socio economic change are expected to have a direct effect on the shape and form of the vulnerability curves finally yet importantly a significant challenge that vulnerability curve developers and practitioners have to face is the fact that vulnerability curves are site specific and not always transferable more research is necessary to understand the importance of the type of housing and local architecture to the consequences of torrential hazards on buildings it is clear that the vulnerability of the buildings although named physical is dependent on a large number of factors that may be social economic cultural etc the level of income of citizens reflect on the robustness of their homes similarly building codes and legislation relates directly to the quality of housing and corruption or lack of democracy may negatively affect their implementation these facts indicate the need to approach vulnerability as a whole and not as separate dimensions of it physical social economic vulnerability more specifically we strongly believe that the institutional dimension of vulnerability is the umbrella dimension which influences strongly all the other vulnerabilities including the physical one an institutional approach to vulnerability research may be the key to the understanding of vulnerability and its reduction 6 conclusions the recent advances in vulnerability assessment methods for buildings threatened by torrential hazards presented in this paper clearly show that there is still a need for further research in this field existing vulnerability curves may be improved with the availability of additional damage data and alternative methods may be used alone or in combination to shed light on the interaction between natural processes and elements at risk all this knowledge will contribute to the enhanced assessment of risk and to the design of adequate risk reduction strategies declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements maria papathoma köhle has been supported by the austrian

6368,we present a novel ensemble extension of the conditional bias penalized kalman filter referred to herein as the conditional bias penalized ensemble kalman filter cbenkf and apply it to flood forecasting the cbenkf differs from most data assimilation da techniques in that it minimizes a weighted sum of the error variance and the expected value of the type ii conditional bias squared for improved estimation and prediction of extremes to assess the ability of the cbenkf to improve flood prediction we carried out real world da experiments in which the cbenkf and the enkf were applied under identical conditions for assimilation of hourly streamflow observations into the lumped sacramento soil moisture accounting and unit hydrograph models ten headwater basins in texas whose drainage areas and times to peak range from 137 to 1037 km2 and from 3 to 21 hrs respectively were used in the twin experiments all events in a 10 yr period with peak flow exceeding 100 m3 s were used verification of the ensemble mean predictions indicates that the cbenkf improves the multi basin mean of the mean square error skill score over the enkf by about 0 15 over lead times of up to the time to peak of the basin verification of the ensemble predictions indicates that the cbenkf improves the mean continuous ranked probability skill score by about 0 2 on average over the enkf for all ranges of flow within the significant events and by about 0 3 for flows exceeding the 95th percentile in those events that the gain in skill is larger for larger flows makes the cbenkf very appealing despite the significantly higher computational cost keywords conditional bias data assimilation flood forecasting enkf cbenkf 1 introduction accurate forecasting of floods is a long standing challenge in hydrology the skill of hydrologic models which serve as the main tool for producing streamflow predictions is limited by the uncertainties in inputs model physics model parameters and initial and boundary conditions model calibration helps reduce parametric uncertainties but its efficacy varies greatly depending on the magnitude of dynamically varying errors in observed and forecast forcings mis or under representation of the hydrologic processes and uncertainties in model state variables clark et al 2016 rakovec et al 2016 data assimilation da aims at improving forecast accuracy by adaptively updating the model states in real time by co utilizing the model prediction and observations while accounting for uncertainties in both reichle et al 2002 de lannoy et al 2007b liu and gupta 2007 liu et al 2012 da has been playing an increasingly important role in hydrologic predictions in recent years e g houser et al 1998 reichle et al 2002 seo et al 2003 2009 moradkhani et al 2005 crow and ryu 2009 liu et al 2012 lahoz and schneider 2014 lee et al 2016 and references therein liu et al 2012 provide a thorough review of the current state and associated challenges a particular challenge concerns the ability of da to improve the prediction of hydrologic extremes that have large impacts on society these extremes include but are not limited to high flows during catastrophic floods and low soil moisture states under severe droughts of these improving the prediction of discharge during flooding is a well recognized challenge for da liu et al 2012 chen et al 2014 chen et al 2014 applied the soil moisture analysis rainfall tool smart crow et al 2011 in correcting remotely sensed rainfall and assimilating satellite based soil moisture estimates using the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 and smoother enks evensen and van leeuwen 2000 they showed that the streamflow prediction from the da experiment tends to be severely underestimated and that the underestimation can be attributed at least partially to the variance minimization on which most contemporary da techniques are based it is well known in the statistics and econometrics literature that in the presence of measurement error variance minimization tends to introduce negative and positive biases over the upper and lower tails of the predicted variables or predictands respectively fuller 1987 seber and wild 1989 hausman 2001 in regression the above effect is referred to as regression dilution or attenuation which results in attenuation bias in the estimated regression coefficients hughes 1993 frost and thompson 2000 such bias may not be an issue when prediction is made for the same predictands via the same regression model using new observations from the same observing systems or instruments this is because one may desire the predictands to be subject to the same uncertainty characteristics as the observed outcomes of the predictands used in the regression analysis itself in da however the goal is to estimate the true state of the system and its uncertainty as accurately as possible for initialization of the model for forward integration because observations almost always have uncertainties presence of attenuation biases is the norm rather than the exception in the real world therefore reducing such bias is important to providing the model with the most accurate initial conditions for prediction particularly when the modelled system is in a non normal state ciach et al 2000 refer to attenuation bias in radar rainfall estimation as the conditional bias cb they found that minimizing the mean square error mse in radar rainfall estimates increases the cb and that there is a trade off to consider between minimizing the mse and reducing the cb when estimating extremes is of interest in general the cb may be differentiated into type i and type ii the type i cb defined as e x x x x where x x and x denote the unknown truth the estimate and the realization of x respectively joliffe and stephenson 2003 is associated with false alarm the type ii cb defined as e x x x x where x denotes the realization of x is associated with failure to detect an event a tendency to cry wolf when in fact there is no wolf represents the type i cb whereas a tendency to fail to see the wolf when there in fact is one represents the type ii cb whereas the type i cb may be reduced by calibration kim et al 2016 the type ii cb cannot wilks 2006 seo et al 2018a b to address the detrimental impacts of the type ii cb on estimation of extremes seo 2012 and seo et al 2014 introduced a new linear optimal estimation method that minimizes a weighted sum of the error variance and expectation of the cb squared when cast in the context of kriging the method yields cb penalized kriging cbpk which has been shown to broadly outperform conventional kriging in hydrologic prediction and estimation of heavy to extreme rainfall brown and seo 2012 seo 2012 seo et al 2014 kim et al 2016 when cast in the context of the kalman filter kf the method yields the cb penalized kalman filter cbpkf seo et al 2018a b shen et al 2019 which reduces the cb in state estimation using observations and dynamical model prediction seo et al 2018a b and shen et al 2019 applied the cbpkf to one dimensional linear state estimation and compared with the kf in idealized synthetic experiments the results confirmed that the cbpkf significantly improves over the kf over the tails of the distribution of the true state while increasing the unconditional mse only slightly in this paper we describe the ensemble extension of the cbpkf or conditional bias penalized ensemble kalman filter cbenkf toward addressing conditional bias in hydrologic da ensemble forecasting has been fast gaining acceptance in operational water forecasting for uncertainty quantification and risk based decision making cloke and pappenberger 2009 demargne et al 2014 as in single valued forecasting effective real time da is critical in ensemble forecasting to keeping the model states in line with the unfolding reality and hence to increasing predictive skill noh et al 2018 the potency of manual adjustment of model states seo et al 2003 2009 is well recognized in single valued forecasting in particular of extreme events in ensemble forecasting however such manual da may not be considered feasible due to the higher order nature of the information content the purpose of the cbenkf is to offer an ensemble da technique which is superior to the enkf for prediction of extreme events such as floods in this work we apply the cbenkf for streamflow da using the lumped sacramento soil moisture accounting sac burnash et al 1973 and unit hydrograph uh chow et al 1988 models we then comparatively evaluate the cbenkf with the enkf in a set of twin experiments wherein streamflow precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pe observations are assimilated into the sac uh for high flow events the da experiments are carried out for ten headwater catchments in texas u s in diverse climatological regions and of contrasting hydrologic response characteristics the new and significant contributions of this paper are the development of the cbenkf technique comprehensive comparative evaluation of the cbenkf with the enkf for prediction of high flows using widely used and extensively studied hydrologic models and the attribution and interpretation of the skill added by the cbenkf we note here that the cbpkf and cbenkf are not bias aware techniques used to address unconditional bias dee and da silva 1998 dee 2005 drecourt et al 2006 de lannoy et al 2007a de lannoy et al 2007b pauwels and de lannoy 2015 as with the kf or enkf it is readily possible to render the cbpkf or cbenkf respectively bias aware via state augmentation in this work we deal with systematic biases by introducing and estimating time varying biases in the control variables in both the enkf and cbenkf in an identical manner the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methodology section 3 describes the study basins evaluation metrics and observational uncertainty modelling section 4 presents the results and discussion section 5 provides the conclusions and future research recommendations 2 methodology this section describes the da problem the cbenkf solution algorithmic considerations for implementation the hydrologic models used and the sequential assimilation approach based on fixed lag smoothing 2 1 problem description and formulation the assimilation problem at hand may be described as follows given the a priori model soil moisture states and observations of streamflow precipitation and pe update the model soil moisture states and multiplicative biases for observed precipitation and pe by assimilating observed streamflow precipitation and pe this nonlinear da problem may be solved via a number of different techniques including enkf with state augmentation lorentzen and nævdal 2011 the main motivation for an ensemble approach is to capture the nonlinear model dynamics without having to approximate them among the ensemble techniques enkf is by far the most popular owing to its simplicity and hence serves as a benchmark in this work the purpose of state augmentation is to render the nonlinear observation equation nominally linear for the kf solution for an ensemble technique with state augmentation one may write the dynamical and observation equations or models as follows the nonlinear dynamical model is written as 1 x k m x k 1 w k 1 where x k denotes the n c 1 model state or control vector where n c denotes the number of variables in the control vector m denotes the dynamical model for the state variables and wk 1 denotes the dynamical model error at time step k 1 the observational model is written as 2 z k h k y k v k where zk denotes the n 1 observation vector where n denotes the total number of observations the n m observation matrix hk where m nc n consists of the n n c zero matrix and n n identity matrix i e h k 0 i the m 1 augmented state vector yk is given by y k x k g x k t where xk denotes the n c 1 state vector defined in eq 1 and g xk denotes the generally nonlinear function which maps the state variables to the n 1 augmented state subvector the above state augmentation reflects the nonlinear relations between the state variables and the observed variables such as those between the state variables xk and the observed flow z k q while keeping the observation equation linear in appearance evensen 2003 clark et al 2008 lorentzen and nævdal 2011 houtekamer and zhang 2016 lastly v k denotes the n 1 observation error vector at time step k with its covariance matrix r because the observations of streamflow precipitation and pe are generally uncertain one may expect the da solutions based solely on minimizing error variance such as the kf or enkf to be conditionally biased as explained in the introduction section the objective of the cbpkf or cbenkf is to reduce the type ii cb by minimizing the weighted sum of the error covariance and the expectation of the type ii cb squared seo et al 2018a b shen et al 2019 as shown below 3 σ k e y k y k y k y k y k y k t α e y k y k e y k y k y k y k e y k y k y k t where y denotes the vector of the

or enkf respectively 2 2 conditional bias penalized ensemble kalman filter cbenkf because the hydrologic model dynamics in eq 1 are generally nonlinear one may not apply the cbpkf directly instead an ensemble filter is necessary the formulation of the ensemble version of the cbpkf or cbenkf is identical to that of the enkf except for the kalman gain and the filtered error covariance for a general description of enkf the reader is referred to lorentzen and nævdal 2011 for a description in the context of the da problem at hand the reader is referred to rafieeinasab et al 2014 below we describe

reader is referred to seo et al 2018a b and shen et al 2019 2 3 algorithmic considerations because α in eq 3 can take on any nonnegative value the cbpkf does not guarantee σ k k σ k k 1 a priori it is hence necessary to check the above inequality or a less stringent necessary condition or conditions and if not satisfied reduce α and repeat the calculations for the cbenkf however sampling errors in both σ k k and σ k k 1 render the above check impractical particularly when the ensemble size is small for this reason instead we check if the sample σ k k lies within the theoretically expected bounds using the apparent cbpkf error covariance σ k k a which represents eq 3 at minimum 13 σ k k a b ϖ 1 k h k ϖ 2 k 1 where the m m scaling matrix b is given by b α σ k k 1 ϖ 1 k h 1 k ϖ 2 k i because it represents the sum of error covariance and expectation of cb squared eq 13 represents an upper bound for σ k k a lower bound for σ k k may also be obtained from eq 13 by setting α 0 or equivalently b i with the above we have 14 ϖ 1 k h k ϖ 2 k 1 σ k k b ϖ 1 k h k ϖ 2 k 1 for solving the linear systems in the kf or the enkf the least computationally expensive method is the cholesky decomposition press et al 2007 krishnamoorthy and menon 2011 in the cbpkf or cbenkf the linear systems may or may not be positive semidefinite if the cholesky decomposition is not successful in inverting λ 11 k or γ 22 k 1 or solving for kk or c k it is necessary to use the lu decomposition press et al 2007 finally if eq 14 is not satisfied it is necessary to reduce α and repeat the steps the initial value of α or α 0 should be chosen carefully so that it is large enough to effect the cb penalty but not too large to incur too many iterations for successive reduction or over correct the cb an effective strategy is to start with a sufficiently large α 0 and apply the filter in a hindcast mode over a sufficiently long analysis period and examine the distribution of the final α a good choice for α 0 should result in iterative reduction of α only for a small fraction of the times for computational economy we are currently exploring adaptive approaches for prescribing α for improved performance and reduced computing time and the interested reader is referred to shen et al 2019 2 4 hydrologic models we used the sac burnash et al 1973 for rainfall runoff modeling and the uh chow et al 1988 for runoff routing the sac is a conceptual soil moisture accounting model and uses two layers of conceptual soil storages i e the upper zone and lower zone to model soil water balance in the vertical the lower zone is usually much thicker than the upper zone and provides moisture to meet the evapotranspiration demands koren et al 2004 each soil layer includes tension and free water contents specifically the upper zone tension water content uztwc upper zone free water content uzfwc lower zone tension water content lztwc lower zone free primary content lzfpc and lower zone free supplemental content lzfsc the uztwc is directly fed by rainfall rainfall exceeding the tension water capacity becomes the uzfwc which generates interflow or percolates into the lower zone surface runoff is generated from free water contents depending on the capacities of upper zone free water and lower zone tension and free water surface runoff includes both fast and slow runoffs fast runoff consists of the rainfall intensity dependent surface runoff from the unsaturated area direct runoff from the saturated area and impervious runoff from the impervious area slow runoff processes produce interflow supplemental baseflow and primary baseflow the uh model is used to route the runoff components to produce streamflow at the outlet of the basin the sac is a long standing operational model used by the national weather service nws for hydrologic forecasting at most river forecast centers the input forcings of the model include mean areal precipitation map and mean areal potential evapotranspiration mape in this work we use a 1 hr time step for all basins given the flashiness and short response time of many of the basins to refine the sac parameters and to estimate uhs that are valid at a 1 hr time step we used the adjoint based optimizer ab opt seo et al 2009 which corrects long term biases in map and mape derives empirical unit hydrographs and locally optimizes the sac parameters in this way systematic biases in inputs systematic timing errors and model parametric uncertainties are reduced as much as possible so that da may address the initial condition uncertainties as intended 2 5 assimilation approach the cbenkf and the enkf are applied as sequential assimilators but using the fixed lag smoother formulation fig 1 schweppe 1973 the size of the fixed lag or the assimilation window is chosen to be the same as the length of the uh see table 1 in this way the time lag between runoff generation and the resulting flow at the basin outlet is captured in the da process seo et al 2009 rafieeinasab et al 2014 the motivation for the fixed lag smoother approximation using a filter formulation as opposed to directly using a smoother formulation evensen and van leeuwen 2000 is to handle both cold and warm restarts with a clearly identifiable assimilation window so that human forecasters may easily interpret the results and make decisions seo et al 2009 in this approach the control vector in eq 1 consists of x k x k s x k p x k e x k r t i e the six sac states x k s the multiplicative adjustment factors for map and mape x k p and x k e respectively and the additive error to the total channel inflow tci x k r see fig 1 and table 2 in the above x k s is valid at the beginning of the assimilation window x k p x k e and x k r are valid over the entire assimilation window and x k e and x k p represent time varying systematic biases in pe and precipitation data gourley and vieux 2005 stisen and sandholt 2010 habib et al 2013 the time evolution of x k s is given by the sac the time evolution of x k p x k e and x k r is modeled as autoregressive 1 with a lag 1 hr serial correlation coefficient of 0 96 for all three smith and krajewski 1991 anagnostou et al 1998 seo et al 1999 the observation vector in eq 2 consists of z k z k p z k e z k r z k q t i e the observed map z k p the climatological mape z k e the observed additive error in tci z k r and the streamflow observations z k q the observation error vector v k v k p v k e v k r v k q t consists of the observation errors associated with z k z k p z k e z k r z k q t it is assumed that the elements of vk are uncorrelated among themselves and with xk and have mean of zero and covariance of rk the nonlinear observation equation g x k consists of the model simulated observations of map or z k p x k p mape or z k e x k e additive error in tci or x k r and streamflow or x k q in reality z k r is not observed as such we set it to zero under the assumption that the model simulated tci is unbiased at all scales the observations to be assimilated for each cycle include the map mape and streamflow valid over the assimilation window the motivation for updating the multiplicative adjustment factors for map and mape is to account for dynamically varying biases in the two forcing variables in sac static adjustment factors already exist for map and mape referred to as pxadj and peadj respectively seo et al 2009 in this work we include the two factors in the control vector and allow them to vary dynamically in the da process the map observations used in this work are from the multisensor precipitation estimator seo et al 2010 they are subject to various sources of error which manifest themselves as time varying biases as well as random errors smith et al 1996 fulton et al 1998 because map is a spatially averaged quantity purely random errors tend to cancel out whereas systematic biases do not as such it is important in streamflow da to correct dynamically varying biases in map over the assimilation window so that the sac states valid at the prediction time and the tcis valid over the assimilation window are as accurate as possible seo et al 2003 2009 the motivation for the additive error to tci is to allow for the time varying errors in sac uh that cannot be addressed by adjusting the model states pxadj and peadj alone the above formulation has proven very effective in several previous da studies seo et al 2003 2009 lee et al 2011 2012 2016 lee and seo 2014 rafieeinasab et al 2014 in this work the adjustment factors and the additive error in tci are assumed to be temporally uniform within the assimilation window following lee et al 2012 who found that the use of temporally varying errors does not significantly improve performance while substantially increasing the computational amount an assimilation cycle results in updated sac states valid at the end of the assimilation window or the prediction time and updated tcis valid over the assimilation window see fig 1 in the forecast generation process the da solution is used only for the initial conditions of the sac and the tcis valid over the assimilation window whereas all other control variables assume their default values accordingly pxadj and peadj are set to unity and the additive error to tci is to zero for simulation over the forecast horizon for assimilation and validation we used the us geological survey hourly streamflow data at the outlets of all study basins our focus in this work is on flood forecasting as such we identified only the significant events from the observed streamflow data and used the resulting partial duration time series where a significant event is defined as a hydrograph whose peak exceeds 100 m3 s once a significant event is identified the beginning and ending hours of that event are determined by subtracting and adding 72 h from and to the first and last hours of the flow duration over 100 m3 s respectively in this way the comparative evaluation is focused on the performance of da for relatively large events only for which streamflow da is likely to be affected by significant cb in the state variables the map data used were operationally produced by the west gulf river forecast center using the multisensor precipitation estimator seo et al 2010 for mape the monthly climatology of daily estimates was used because the da cycles consist only of the periods of significant flow pe does not play a significant role and hence the lack of dynamically varying mape is unlikely to impact the outcome in any significant way because both the cbenkf and the enkf solve unconstrained minimization there is no guarantee a priori that the updated states of all members lie within the feasible region of the sac states various approaches have been reported in the literature to solve constrained kf and enkf gupta and houser 2007 wang et al 2009 in this work we use the trial and error approach of wang et al 2009 if not all updated ensemble members are in the feasible region we additionally sample random perturbations for the infeasible members and update the states until all members are feasible the above strategy was used for both the cbenkf and the enkf in an identical manner to initiate ensemble da each sac state is perturbed by sampling from a lognormal distribution with mean and standard deviation given by the current sac state and approximately 17 of the square root of the maximum soil water content respectively the perturbations for pxadj and peadj are sampled from a lognormal distribution with mean and standard deviation given by the current state and 0 17 respectively the perturbations for the additive error of the tci are sampled from a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation in mm hr as above the model states are randomly perturbed independently of one another for simplicity similarly the zero mean dynamical model errors wk 1 in eq 1 are assumed to be independent of one another and have the standard deviation of approximately 4 of the current state for the sac states and 0 03 for all other variables the ensemble size is 30 throughout this work the above setup was identical for both the enkf and the cbenkf for additional details on perturbation and ensemble generation the reader is referred to rafieeinasab et al 2014 3 study basins evaluation metrics and observational uncertainty modelling in this section we describe the study basins evaluation metrics and observational uncertainty modelling 3 1 study basins ten hydroclimatologically diverse headwater basins in texas u s are used see fig 2 these catchments are a subset of the basins identified as particularly challenging in operational forecasting by the nws west gulf river forecast center the basins have been used by the authors and their collaborators for hydrologic da and related research in recent years seo et al 2009 lee et al 2011 2012 2016 lee and seo 2014 rafieeinasab et al 2014 the basins are wetter in the east and drier in the west as indicated by the dryness index calculated for the period of 1996 to 2005 see table 1 where the dryness index is defined as the ratio of mean annual pe to mean annual precipitation budyko 1974 table 1 also presents the time to peak tp and the 95th percentile observed flow within the selected events q95 s compared to the basins in the humid region those in the semi arid region pose larger challenges in streamflow forecasting due to the generally quicker catchment response larger uncertainties in the initial conditions possible structural uncertainties associated with unmodeled processes such as infiltration into dry channel beds and larger parametric uncertainties due to the above factors and the limited number of large events available for calibration in addition the large spatio temporal variability of precipitation from highly convective storms adds large uncertainties in lumped modelling particularly for large basins as such the study basins offer an extremely challenging test for streamflow da 3 2 evaluation metrics to evaluate the comparative performance of the cbenkf with the enkf we verified both ensemble mean and ensemble streamflow forecasts from hindcasting experiments for ensemble mean forecasts we used the root mean square error maximum errors of under and over prediction correlation coefficient and mean square error skill score mse ss lee et al 2011 2012 lee and seo 2014 the results indicate that the mse ss represents the overall comparative performance very well and we hence focus below on the mse ss results the mse ss for the cbenkf ensemble mean in reference to the enkf ensemble mean is given by 15 mse ss 1 1 n k 1 n q k cbenkf z k q 2 1 n k 1 n q k enkf z k q 2 where q k cbenkf q k enkf z k q and n denote the cbenkf ensemble mean flow enkf ensemble mean flow verifying observed flow and the number of paired sets of z k q and q k cbenkf respectively a perfect ensemble mean forecast would yield an mse ss of unity no improvement in the ensemble mean forecast by the cbenkf over the enkf would yield an mse ss of zero for ensemble forecasts we used a large number of verification measures available in the ensemble verification system evs brown et al 2010 including the brier score brier skill score continuous ranked probability score crps crps decomposition hersbach 2000 continuous ranked probability skill score crpss brown et al 2014 reliability diagram relative operating characteristic and others the results indicate that the mean crps its decomposition and mean crpss represent the comparative performance very well and hence we focus on their results in this paper the crps measures the integral squared difference between the cumulative distribution function cdf of ensemble forecast and that of the verifying observation a more skilful ensemble forecast will produce a smaller crps than the reference ensemble forecast the mean crpss of the cbenkf based ensemble forecast in reference to the enkf based is given by 16 crpss 1 crps cbenkf crps enkf 1 1 n i 1 n 0 f i cbenkf q f i obs q 2 d q 1 n i 1 n 0 f i enkf q f i obs q 2 d q where the crp s cbenkf and crp s enkf denote the mean crps of the cbenkf and the enkf ensemble forecast respectively f i cbenkf q and f i enkf q denote the cdfs of the i th cbenkf and enkf ensemble forecast respectively and f i obs q denotes the cdf of the verifying observation i e the heaviside step function a perfect ensemble forecast would yield a crpss of unity no improvement by the cbenkf over the enkf ensemble forecast would yield a crpss of zero following hersbach 2000 the crps can be decomposed into reliability rel resolution res and uncertainty unc or into rel and potential crps crpspot 17 crps r e l r e s u n c r e l c r p s pot smaller rel indicates more reliable ensembles desirable and larger res means better resolution desirable the res component unc crpspot is positive if the ensemble forecast is better than the climatological ensemble forecast hersbach 2000 the unc component reflects climatologic uncertainties in the observations and does not relate to forecast attributes the crpspot represents the crps achievable by calibrating forecast probabilities for perfect reliability hersbach 2000 similarly to the crps smaller crpspot indicates improved performance by the subject ensemble forecast 3 3 observational uncertainty modelling observational errors are generally heteroscedastic and correlated in time lee et al 2011 due to lack of observed truth however their modeling is a large challenge in this work we assume that all observational errors are temporally uncorrelated and homoscedastic and use a wide range of settings for their variances in this way one may assess the comparative performance of the cbenkf with the enkf under widely varying but identical conditions of the quality of the observations being assimilated and that of the model used generally speaking one would expect the observation error variance for mape σ e 2 to be smaller than that for map σ p 2 given that we are using climatological mape rather than dynamically estimated values however we assumed σ e 2 σ p 2 for simplicity we then used the settings of 10 100 and 1000 mm hr 2 for σ e 2 σ p 2 to represent small medium and large uncertainties respectively in input forcings the same three settings were used for the error variance to represent small medium and large model uncertainties in the sac uh table 3 lists the resulting 9 possible combinations of σ p 2 and σ r 2 represented by c1 through c9 harmel et al 2006 report streamflow measurement errors for small watersheds of 42 19 10 6 and 3 for the worst case typical maximum typical average typical minimum and the best case scenarios respectively baldassarre and montanari 2009 report that the overall error affecting river discharge observations ranges from 6 2 to 42 8 at the 95 confidence level with an average value of 25 6 given the dependence of streamflow observation errors on the flow one may consider prescribing larger or smaller σ q 2 depending on the magnitude of the observed flow the error associated with z k q in z k in eq 2 however reflects not only the observational error of streamflow but also the modeling errors associated with the simulated flow in g xk note that whereas the da formulation addresses uncertain sac states biases in map and mape and errors in the tci it does not address errors arising from model deficiencies such as timing errors liu et al 2011 as such a larger σ q 2 would be more appropriate if the model has large simulation errors which the da procedure cannot address even though the basin produces smaller peak flows for this reason a priori determination of σ q 2 is not readily possible and some form of sensitivity analysis is usually necessary in this work we used σ q 2 of 100 and 1 000 m3 s 2 carried out assimilation experiments using both settings of σ q 2 and compare the relative performance for each basin to illustrate the above process we show in fig 3 the mse ss results for midfield for c1 through c9 in table 3 for σ q 2 of 100 and 1 000 m3 s 2 the figure shows that the cbenkf improves over the enkf in the ensemble mean sense for all cases but that the margin of improvement is larger with σ q 2 100 m3 s 2 similar results for all other basins suggest σ q 2 of 100 m3 s 2 for justin houston greenville and brays bayou and σ q 2 of 1 000 m3 s 2 for lyons mckinney madisonville quinlan and schroeder in terms of the observed 95th percentile flow schroeder madisonville midfield and justin produce the largest peak flows whereas greenville houston and brays bayou produce the smallest comparison of the basin groupings based on the choice of σ q 2 and those based on the 95th percentile flow suggests that the smaller σ q 2 of 100 m3 s 2 might not be appropriate for justin and midfield which produce the largest peak flows examination of the hydrographs indicated however that the above two basins have significantly smaller timing errors liu et al 2011 which makes the smaller σ q 2 more realistic in the opposite case quinlan has significantly larger timing errors though its 95th percentile flow is not very large which makes the larger σ q 2 of 1 000 m3 s 2 more appropriate with the above choices we arrive at the nine cases for each of the two groups of σ q 2 100 m3 s 2 and σ q 2 1 000 m3 s 2 as shown in table 3 it is worth noting that the resulting upper bounds for the observation error variances are at least an order of magnitude larger than those used in rafieeinasab et al 2014 the rationale for the larger bounds is to use uncertainty estimates that are realistic for large events and to assess the relative performance between the cbenkf and the enkf under the limiting conditions of very large and very small observational and modeling uncertainties 4 results and discussion in this section we present the comparative evaluation results for each basin the cbenkf and enkf were applied for prediction of all events whose peak flow exceeds 100 m3 s within the 10 yr period of record we first present illustrative examples of the cbenkf and enkf results in section 4 1 we then describe comparative verification of ensemble mean and ensemble predictions in sections 4 2 and 4 3 respectively 4 1 illustrative examples to help intuitive understanding of how the cbenkf and enkf predictions may compare we first present in fig 4 illustrative examples of predicted hydrographs for selected events only for a subset of the basins due to space limitations in the figure it is readily seen that the cbenkf ensembles are of higher quality than the enkf in terms of both ensemble mean and spread in general the cbenkf ensembles are able to encompass the observed peak flow whereas the enkf ensembles are not examination of the hydrographs for all basins may be summarized as follows for greenville and quinlan the overall shape of the simulated hydrograph indicated the presence of timing errors for mckinney and midfield it was observed that the enkf ensembles lack spread in the recession phase the above suggests that one or more sac states for the soil water contents may have been completely full thereby suppressing the ensemble spread the above observations point out the need for parametric uncertainty modeling to mitigate the negative impact of timing errors and to account for the uncertainties in the soil water holding capacities of the soil moisture accounting model fig 5 shows an example set of ensemble mean results for a single event at lyons the figure shows the open loop and da updated streamflow uztwc uzfwc lztwc lzfsc lzfpc precipitation pe and the tci they illustrate how the cbenkf and enkf updated states may compare during the course of an event for streamflow the verifying observations are also shown in the figure each time step represents the ending hour of the assimilation window and the associated results represent the updated states and the model simulated flow valid at that hour i e the prediction time the figure hence represents the time series of the analysis results from successive da cycles during the course of the event the observation uncertainty parameters associated with fig 5 are σ q 2 1 000 m3 s 2 and σ p 2 σ e 2 σ r 2 1 000 mm h 2 it is seen that both the cbenkf and enkf streamflow analyses are much closer to the observed than the open loop analysis and that the cbenkf streamflow analysis tracks the observed more closely than the enkf upper left the corresponding cbenkf and enkf analyses of the state variables may at first appear similar but significant differences exist in the lower zone soil moisture states throughout the event as well as in the uzfwc and the additive error in the tci at certain da cycles because there are no truths available it is not possible to assess the accuracy of the state variables one may nevertheless observe that compared to the enkf the cbenkf solutions are closer to those of the open loop simulation especially in the three lower zone soil moisture states of lztwc lzfsc and lzfpc precipitation and the tci while producing more accurate streamflow analysis visual examination of many results similar to fig 5 suggests that the cbenkf and enkf updated states differ by varying degrees among different combinations of the observational uncertainty parameters and different state variables but that in general the cbenkf updated states tend to maintain the joint relationships among the different states of the open loop simulation more closely than the enkf updated to illustrate the above point we show in fig 6 the scatter plots between the uzfwc and lzfpc the fastest and the slowest varying sac states respectively from the open loop enkf updated and cbenkf updated ensemble results in the top left plot of fig 6 each stripe of data points represents an open loop simulation associated with the peak flow portion of the hydrograph associated with a significant event see the bottom plot in fig 6 the herringbone like patterns are due to the ensemble members from the same assimilation cycle possessing similar updated states fig 6 indicates that the cbenkf updated states resemble the joint relationships between the uzfwc and lzfpc in the open loop states more closely than the enkf updated even though the locations of the stripes are quite different among the three results in the bivariate phase space observations from figs 5 and 6 and many similar results suggest that the cbenkf retains the open loop model dynamics among the different soil moisture states more closely than the enkf and that when both the cbenkf and enkf produce streamflow analyses of similar quality the cbenkf updated states stay closer to the open loop states than the enkf states this supports the argument that the improved skill by the cbenkf is due in part to the updated states being more in line with the open loop model dynamics similar results were also obtained by noh et al 2018 in which a multi scale version of the fixed lag smoother see fig 1 was compared for streamflow da with the single scale version as implemented in this work but using variational assimilation rather than the enkf or cbenkf they showed that minimizing adjustment to the model states while producing high quality streamflow analyses significantly improves predictive skill in da solutions albeit at a substantially higher computational cost 4 2 ensemble mean streamflow evaluation here we present the scatter plots and mse ss results to assess the performance of ensemble mean predictions fig 7 shows the scatter and quantile quantile plots of 3 hr ahead ensemble mean streamflow forecast vs verifying observation also shown in the figure are the sample cbs computed over the 10 sub ranges that equally divide the entire range of observed flow it is seen that the cbenkf further reduces cbs in the ensemble mean sense beyond what the enkf is able to for the entire range of flow table 4 summarizes the mean absolute cb and rmse of 3 hr ahead ensemble mean streamflow forecasts shown in fig 7 the table shows that the cbenkf generally reduces both the mean absolute cb and rmse further than the enkf for justin and midfield the reduction in both the mean absolute cb and rmse by the enkf over open loop simulation is already very large and that for the cbenkf is similarly large fig 8 shows the mse ss of the cbenkf ensemble mean forecast for a subset of the basins for all verifying observed flow within the periods of significant events as a function of lead time the reference forecast is the enkf ensemble mean forecast the positive mse ss means that the cbenkf outperforms the enkf in the ensemble mean sense in each plot there are 9 mse ss curves representing the 9 different cases in table 3 the multi basin mean for all 10 basins of the mse ss of the cbenkf over the enkf is 0 37 for lead time of 1 hr and 0 15 over lead times of up to the time to peak of the basin for houston and brays bayou the two most quickly responding small urban basins in the humid region the positive impact of the cbenkf over the enkf diminishes rather quickly due to the short basin memory and relatively small cb in the base simulation for houston see also fig 7 for larger basins the positive impact extends to longer lead times for lyons mckinney and madisonville the increased skill in the cbenkf ensemble mean forecast remains significantly high well beyond the first 24 hrs of lead time for a number of observational uncertainty parameter combinations for the largest basin justin on the other hand the skill dissipates rather quickly due to the short time to peak associated with rain falling in the lower part of this very elongated basin which dominates the generation of large flows at the outlet see fig b1 of seo et al 2009 fig 8 also shows that the cbenkf improves over the enkf in the ensemble mean sense under widely varying combinations of σ p 2 σ e 2 and σ r 2 the above observations indicate that the cbenkf is robust and may be expected to perform well even if the uncertainty parameters are not prescribed with accuracy an important consideration for real world applications 4 3 ensemble streamflow evaluation here we present the ensemble verification results to assess the performance of ensemble predictions fig 9 shows the mean crpss of the cbenkf ensemble forecast for a subset of the basins the reference is the enkf ensemble forecast all results in fig 9 are conditional on the verifying observation exceeding the 95th percentile flow of the associated basin within the significant events see table 1 as such the figure assesses comparative skill specifically for prediction of large flows for which there exists only limited hydrologic memory for da to rely on for each basin there are 9 mean crpss curves corresponding to the 9 combinations of σ p 2 σ e 2 and σ r 2 given the basin specific σ q 2 see table 3 fig 9 shows that the cbenkf considerably improves over the enkf for all basins shown for short lead times as with the mse ss the increased skill quickly dissipates for houston and brays bayou for the larger basins lyons mckinney and madisonville the increase skill persists into significantly longer lead times for the rest of the basins justin greenville midfield quinlan and schroeder the increased skill stays significant for the first several hours or more but dissipates within the first 24 h or so it is observed in fig 9 that for some mean crpss curves for midfield the skill is lower at lead time of zero i e analysis than at lead time of 1 hr examination of the comprehensive verification results from the evs indicates that for large basins such as midfield the analysis ensembles are not always as reliable as the 1 hr forecast ensembles the above observations point out the need for improving uncertainty modeling particularly for large basins a topic left as a future endeavor for attribution of the increased skill in cbenkf ensembles we carried out mean crps decomposition for 1 6 hr ahead streamflow ensemble forecasts fig 10 shows the mean crpss crps rel res and crpspot for all basins for each basin there are 9 data points representing the 9 combinations of σ p 2 σ e 2 and σ r 2 given the basin specific σ q 2 in the figure the results are connected across all basins only to aid visualization of the differences between the cbenkf and enkf results the figure shows that the cbenkf generally improves both reliability and resolution of ensemble forecasts over the enkf for all basins the mean crpss varies from 0 06 to 0 19 with a mean of 0 12 the mean improvement for all basins in the rel res crpspot and crps by the cbenkf over the enkf are 17 7 10 and 11 respectively because the magnitude of the res is generally much larger than that of the rel at short lead time the above reduction in the rel and increase in the res are comparable in magnitude in terms of reducing the mean crps of the cbenkf ensembles fig 11 shows the mean crpss of 1 hr ahead cbenkf ensemble forecast in reference to the 1 hr ahead enkf forecast for all basins as a function of the conditioning threshold for each threshold on the x axis a total of 90 data points are represented in the vertical which include 9 cases for each of the 10 basins the figure shows that the larger the verifying flow is the larger the margin of improvement by the cbenkf is the mean crpss of the cbenkf ensembles in reference to the enkf is about 0 2 for all ranges of verifying flow and increases to about 0 3 or larger for observed flows at or above the 95th percentile flow within the significant events see table 1 that the gain in skill increases as the threshold increases is an extremely appealing attribute of the cbenkf and is consistent with the cbpkf results seo et al 2018a b shen et al 2019 the above indicates that sac uh simulations of floods generally contain significant cb for the study area and that the cbenkf is able to reduce its ill effects and significantly improve prediction the results presented above pertain only to prediction of significant events when the assimilation cycles include both the storm and inter storm periods the skill of the cbenkf predictions in reference to the enkf is expectedly smaller for example for c5 and c9 at madisonville the mean crpss for flood periods only and for all periods are about 0 35 and 0 20 respectively when the assimilation cycles include only the inter storm periods the cbenkf shows little improvement over the enkf when only the periods of extremely low flows are included however the cbenkf improves over the enkf the above results are fully expected in that the enkf already provides the optimal solution when the true state of the system is at or near median which corresponds generally to low flow conditions and that the cbenkf provides improvement over the tails of the distribution seo et al 2018a b shen et al 2019 the above observations suggests that in real time operation one may normally run the enkf and supersede it with the cbenkf only in non normal conditions 5 conclusions and future research recommendations the conditional bias penalized ensemble kalman filter cbenkf is developed and evaluated for real time assimilation of streamflow data to improve flood forecasting the ensemble mean results show that for the ten basins in tx the cbenkf improves the mean square error skill score see eq 15 over the enkf on average by about 0 15 over lead times of up to the time to peak of the basin the ensemble results show that on average the cbenkf improves the mean continuous ranked probability skill score see eq 16 over the enkf by about 0 2 for all observed flows in significant events and by about 0 3 or larger for observed flows exceeding the 95th percentile in those events that the margin of improvement is larger for larger flows is a particularly appealing aspect of the cbenkf both the ensemble mean and ensemble results show that the considerable improvement by the cbenkf over the enkf is realized over a wide range of combinations of observational uncertainties as such one may expect the cbenkf to improve over the enkf even if the uncertainty modeling may not be very accurate an important consideration in operational forecasting visual comparison of forecast hydrographs with verifying observations indicates that the cbenkf ensemble forecasts are generally of higher quality in the mean and spread than the enkf ensembles but that for a few basins the quality of both the cbenkf and enkf ensembles is compromised by phase errors in the uh and lack of parametric uncertainty modeling in the maximum soil water storages of the sac the crps decomposition indicates that the improved skill in cbenkf ensembles is due to improvement in both reliability and resolution and that their contributions are comparable in magnitude at short lead times the examination of the updated and open loop states indicates that the cbenkf is able to improve the quality of streamflow analysis over the enkf by adjusting the model states beyond what the enkf is able to and that when the cbenkf and enkf produce streamflow analyses of comparable quality the cbenkf generally makes smaller adjustments to the open loop state variables than the enkf while still outperforming the enkf in streamflow prediction the last observation is supported by the examination of the joint relationships of the sac states with and without da in that the cbenkf updated states tend to follow the patterns of the open loop states more closely than the enkf updated it is hence surmised that the improved skill is due in part to the cbenkf updated states being more in line with the open loop model dynamics than the enkf updated the cbenkf in its current form is computationally expensive shen et al 2019 compared to the enkf the cbenkf additionally requires inverting an n n and two m m matrices in each assimilation cycle where m and n denote the number of state variables and observations respectively toward remedying the situation at least two approaches seem possible the first is to build a hybrid filter which runs the enkf in normal conditions but switches to the cbenkf in non normal conditions the second is to reduce the dimensionality of the linear systems via the singular value decomposition or its variant the latter will also allow assessment of dynamically varying information content in the observation and forecast error covariance matrices the state augmentation approach used in this work renders the dimensionality of the state vector very large alternative approaches are possible which greatly reduces dimensionality but at some expense of reduced accuracy the weight for the cb penalty α is specified in this work by prescribing the initial value α 0 and reducing successively until a valid solution is obtained if α could be specified adaptively without iterations based on the state of the dynamical system the computational burden associated with the cbenkf would be significantly reduced shen et al 2019 we are currently evaluating lower dimensional reformulation of the da problem the use of the randomized decomposition approaches for rank reduction halko et al 2011 and machine learning based state classification approaches for adaptive filtering and the results will be reported in the near future declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this

6368,we present a novel ensemble extension of the conditional bias penalized kalman filter referred to herein as the conditional bias penalized ensemble kalman filter cbenkf and apply it to flood forecasting the cbenkf differs from most data assimilation da techniques in that it minimizes a weighted sum of the error variance and the expected value of the type ii conditional bias squared for improved estimation and prediction of extremes to assess the ability of the cbenkf to improve flood prediction we carried out real world da experiments in which the cbenkf and the enkf were applied under identical conditions for assimilation of hourly streamflow observations into the lumped sacramento soil moisture accounting and unit hydrograph models ten headwater basins in texas whose drainage areas and times to peak range from 137 to 1037 km2 and from 3 to 21 hrs respectively were used in the twin experiments all events in a 10 yr period with peak flow exceeding 100 m3 s were used verification of the ensemble mean predictions indicates that the cbenkf improves the multi basin mean of the mean square error skill score over the enkf by about 0 15 over lead times of up to the time to peak of the basin verification of the ensemble predictions indicates that the cbenkf improves the mean continuous ranked probability skill score by about 0 2 on average over the enkf for all ranges of flow within the significant events and by about 0 3 for flows exceeding the 95th percentile in those events that the gain in skill is larger for larger flows makes the cbenkf very appealing despite the significantly higher computational cost keywords conditional bias data assimilation flood forecasting enkf cbenkf 1 introduction accurate forecasting of floods is a long standing challenge in hydrology the skill of hydrologic models which serve as the main tool for producing streamflow predictions is limited by the uncertainties in inputs model physics model parameters and initial and boundary conditions model calibration helps reduce parametric uncertainties but its efficacy varies greatly depending on the magnitude of dynamically varying errors in observed and forecast forcings mis or under representation of the hydrologic processes and uncertainties in model state variables clark et al 2016 rakovec et al 2016 data assimilation da aims at improving forecast accuracy by adaptively updating the model states in real time by co utilizing the model prediction and observations while accounting for uncertainties in both reichle et al 2002 de lannoy et al 2007b liu and gupta 2007 liu et al 2012 da has been playing an increasingly important role in hydrologic predictions in recent years e g houser et al 1998 reichle et al 2002 seo et al 2003 2009 moradkhani et al 2005 crow and ryu 2009 liu et al 2012 lahoz and schneider 2014 lee et al 2016 and references therein liu et al 2012 provide a thorough review of the current state and associated challenges a particular challenge concerns the ability of da to improve the prediction of hydrologic extremes that have large impacts on society these extremes include but are not limited to high flows during catastrophic floods and low soil moisture states under severe droughts of these improving the prediction of discharge during flooding is a well recognized challenge for da liu et al 2012 chen et al 2014 chen et al 2014 applied the soil moisture analysis rainfall tool smart crow et al 2011 in correcting remotely sensed rainfall and assimilating satellite based soil moisture estimates using the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 and smoother enks evensen and van leeuwen 2000 they showed that the streamflow prediction from the da experiment tends to be severely underestimated and that the underestimation can be attributed at least partially to the variance minimization on which most contemporary da techniques are based it is well known in the statistics and econometrics literature that in the presence of measurement error variance minimization tends to introduce negative and positive biases over the upper and lower tails of the predicted variables or predictands respectively fuller 1987 seber and wild 1989 hausman 2001 in regression the above effect is referred to as regression dilution or attenuation which results in attenuation bias in the estimated regression coefficients hughes 1993 frost and thompson 2000 such bias may not be an issue when prediction is made for the same predictands via the same regression model using new observations from the same observing systems or instruments this is because one may desire the predictands to be subject to the same uncertainty characteristics as the observed outcomes of the predictands used in the regression analysis itself in da however the goal is to estimate the true state of the system and its uncertainty as accurately as possible for initialization of the model for forward integration because observations almost always have uncertainties presence of attenuation biases is the norm rather than the exception in the real world therefore reducing such bias is important to providing the model with the most accurate initial conditions for prediction particularly when the modelled system is in a non normal state ciach et al 2000 refer to attenuation bias in radar rainfall estimation as the conditional bias cb they found that minimizing the mean square error mse in radar rainfall estimates increases the cb and that there is a trade off to consider between minimizing the mse and reducing the cb when estimating extremes is of interest in general the cb may be differentiated into type i and type ii the type i cb defined as e x x x x where x x and x denote the unknown truth the estimate and the realization of x respectively joliffe and stephenson 2003 is associated with false alarm the type ii cb defined as e x x x x where x denotes the realization of x is associated with failure to detect an event a tendency to cry wolf when in fact there is no wolf represents the type i cb whereas a tendency to fail to see the wolf when there in fact is one represents the type ii cb whereas the type i cb may be reduced by calibration kim et al 2016 the type ii cb cannot wilks 2006 seo et al 2018a b to address the detrimental impacts of the type ii cb on estimation of extremes seo 2012 and seo et al 2014 introduced a new linear optimal estimation method that minimizes a weighted sum of the error variance and expectation of the cb squared when cast in the context of kriging the method yields cb penalized kriging cbpk which has been shown to broadly outperform conventional kriging in hydrologic prediction and estimation of heavy to extreme rainfall brown and seo 2012 seo 2012 seo et al 2014 kim et al 2016 when cast in the context of the kalman filter kf the method yields the cb penalized kalman filter cbpkf seo et al 2018a b shen et al 2019 which reduces the cb in state estimation using observations and dynamical model prediction seo et al 2018a b and shen et al 2019 applied the cbpkf to one dimensional linear state estimation and compared with the kf in idealized synthetic experiments the results confirmed that the cbpkf significantly improves over the kf over the tails of the distribution of the true state while increasing the unconditional mse only slightly in this paper we describe the ensemble extension of the cbpkf or conditional bias penalized ensemble kalman filter cbenkf toward addressing conditional bias in hydrologic da ensemble forecasting has been fast gaining acceptance in operational water forecasting for uncertainty quantification and risk based decision making cloke and pappenberger 2009 demargne et al 2014 as in single valued forecasting effective real time da is critical in ensemble forecasting to keeping the model states in line with the unfolding reality and hence to increasing predictive skill noh et al 2018 the potency of manual adjustment of model states seo et al 2003 2009 is well recognized in single valued forecasting in particular of extreme events in ensemble forecasting however such manual da may not be considered feasible due to the higher order nature of the information content the purpose of the cbenkf is to offer an ensemble da technique which is superior to the enkf for prediction of extreme events such as floods in this work we apply the cbenkf for streamflow da using the lumped sacramento soil moisture accounting sac burnash et al 1973 and unit hydrograph uh chow et al 1988 models we then comparatively evaluate the cbenkf with the enkf in a set of twin experiments wherein streamflow precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pe observations are assimilated into the sac uh for high flow events the da experiments are carried out for ten headwater catchments in texas u s in diverse climatological regions and of contrasting hydrologic response characteristics the new and significant contributions of this paper are the development of the cbenkf technique comprehensive comparative evaluation of the cbenkf with the enkf for prediction of high flows using widely used and extensively studied hydrologic models and the attribution and interpretation of the skill added by the cbenkf we note here that the cbpkf and cbenkf are not bias aware techniques used to address unconditional bias dee and da silva 1998 dee 2005 drecourt et al 2006 de lannoy et al 2007a de lannoy et al 2007b pauwels and de lannoy 2015 as with the kf or enkf it is readily possible to render the cbpkf or cbenkf respectively bias aware via state augmentation in this work we deal with systematic biases by introducing and estimating time varying biases in the control variables in both the enkf and cbenkf in an identical manner the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methodology section 3 describes the study basins evaluation metrics and observational uncertainty modelling section 4 presents the results and discussion section 5 provides the conclusions and future research recommendations 2 methodology this section describes the da problem the cbenkf solution algorithmic considerations for implementation the hydrologic models used and the sequential assimilation approach based on fixed lag smoothing 2 1 problem description and formulation the assimilation problem at hand may be described as follows given the a priori model soil moisture states and observations of streamflow precipitation and pe update the model soil moisture states and multiplicative biases for observed precipitation and pe by assimilating observed streamflow precipitation and pe this nonlinear da problem may be solved via a number of different techniques including enkf with state augmentation lorentzen and nævdal 2011 the main motivation for an ensemble approach is to capture the nonlinear model dynamics without having to approximate them among the ensemble techniques enkf is by far the most popular owing to its simplicity and hence serves as a benchmark in this work the purpose of state augmentation is to render the nonlinear observation equation nominally linear for the kf solution for an ensemble technique with state augmentation one may write the dynamical and observation equations or models as follows the nonlinear dynamical model is written as 1 x k m x k 1 w k 1 where x k denotes the n c 1 model state or control vector where n c denotes the number of variables in the control vector m denotes the dynamical model for the state variables and wk 1 denotes the dynamical model error at time step k 1 the observational model is written as 2 z k h k y k v k where zk denotes the n 1 observation vector where n denotes the total number of observations the n m observation matrix hk where m nc n consists of the n n c zero matrix and n n identity matrix i e h k 0 i the m 1 augmented state vector yk is given by y k x k g x k t where xk denotes the n c 1 state vector defined in eq 1 and g xk denotes the generally nonlinear function which maps the state variables to the n 1 augmented state subvector the above state augmentation reflects the nonlinear relations between the state variables and the observed variables such as those between the state variables xk and the observed flow z k q while keeping the observation equation linear in appearance evensen 2003 clark et al 2008 lorentzen and nævdal 2011 houtekamer and zhang 2016 lastly v k denotes the n 1 observation error vector at time step k with its covariance matrix r because the observations of streamflow precipitation and pe are generally uncertain one may expect the da solutions based solely on minimizing error variance such as the kf or enkf to be conditionally biased as explained in the introduction section the objective of the cbpkf or cbenkf is to reduce the type ii cb by minimizing the weighted sum of the error covariance and the expectation of the type ii cb squared seo et al 2018a b shen et al 2019 as shown below 3 σ k e y k y k y k y k y k y k t α e y k y k e y k y k y k y k e y k y k y k t where y denotes the vector of the estimated states the first and second terms represent the error covariance and the cb penalty respectively and α denotes the weight given to the latter if α 0 the cbpkf or cbenkf is reduced to the kf or enkf respectively 2 2 conditional bias penalized ensemble kalman filter cbenkf because the hydrologic model dynamics in eq 1 are generally nonlinear one may not apply the cbpkf directly instead an ensemble filter is necessary the formulation of the ensemble version of the cbpkf or cbenkf is identical to that of the enkf except for the kalman gain and the filtered error covariance for a general description of enkf the reader is referred to lorentzen and nævdal 2011 for a description in the context of the da problem at hand the reader is referred to rafieeinasab et al 2014 below we describe the cbenkf solution which reflects the important corrections to seo et al 2018a as reported in seo et al 2018b as in the enkf the updated state vector of the i th ensemble member y k k i is given by 4 y k k i y k k 1 i k k z k h k y k k 1 i where y k k 1 i denotes the m 1 forecast state vector of the i th ensemble member kk denotes the m n cb penalized kalman gain matrix zk denotes the n 1

reader is referred to seo et al 2018a b and shen et al 2019 2 3 algorithmic considerations because α in eq 3 can take on any nonnegative value the cbpkf does not guarantee σ k k σ k k 1 a priori it is hence necessary to check the above inequality or a less stringent necessary condition or conditions and if not satisfied reduce α and repeat the calculations for the cbenkf however sampling errors in both σ k k and σ k k 1 render the above check impractical particularly when the ensemble size is small for this reason instead we check if the sample σ k k lies within the theoretically expected bounds using the apparent cbpkf error covariance σ k k a which represents eq 3 at minimum 13 σ k k a b ϖ 1 k h k ϖ 2 k 1 where the m m scaling matrix b is given by b α σ k k 1 ϖ 1 k h 1 k ϖ 2 k i because it represents the sum of error covariance and expectation of cb squared eq 13 represents an upper bound for σ k k a lower bound for σ k k may also be obtained from eq 13 by setting α 0 or equivalently b i with the above we have 14 ϖ 1 k h k ϖ 2 k 1 σ k k b ϖ 1 k h k ϖ 2 k 1 for solving the linear systems in the kf or the enkf the least computationally expensive method is the cholesky decomposition press et al 2007 krishnamoorthy and menon 2011 in the cbpkf or cbenkf the linear systems may or may not be positive semidefinite if the cholesky decomposition is not successful in inverting λ 11 k or γ 22 k 1 or solving for kk or c k it is necessary to use the lu decomposition press et al 2007 finally if eq 14 is not satisfied it is necessary to reduce α and repeat the steps the initial value of α or α 0 should be chosen carefully so that it is large enough to effect the cb penalty but not too large to incur too many iterations for successive reduction or over correct the cb an effective strategy is to start with a sufficiently large α 0 and apply the filter in a hindcast mode over a sufficiently long analysis period and examine the distribution of the final α a good choice for α 0 should result in iterative reduction of α only for a small fraction of the times for computational economy we are currently exploring adaptive approaches for prescribing α for improved performance and reduced computing time and the interested reader is referred to shen et al 2019 2 4 hydrologic models we used the sac burnash et al 1973 for rainfall runoff modeling and the uh chow et al 1988 for runoff routing the sac is a conceptual soil moisture accounting model and uses two layers of conceptual soil storages i e the upper zone and lower zone to model soil water balance in the vertical the lower zone is usually much thicker than the upper zone and provides moisture to meet the evapotranspiration demands koren et al 2004 each soil layer includes tension and free water contents specifically the upper zone tension water content uztwc upper zone free water content uzfwc lower zone tension water content lztwc lower zone free primary content lzfpc and lower zone free supplemental content lzfsc the uztwc is directly fed by rainfall rainfall exceeding the tension water capacity becomes the uzfwc which generates interflow or percolates into the lower zone surface runoff is generated from free water contents depending on the capacities of upper zone free water and lower zone tension and free water surface runoff includes both fast and slow runoffs fast runoff consists of the rainfall intensity dependent surface runoff from the unsaturated area direct runoff from the saturated area and impervious runoff from the impervious area slow runoff processes produce interflow supplemental baseflow and primary baseflow the uh model is used to route the runoff components to produce streamflow at the outlet of the basin the sac is a long standing operational model used by the national weather service nws for hydrologic forecasting at most river forecast centers the input forcings of the model include mean areal precipitation map and mean areal potential evapotranspiration mape in this work we use a 1 hr time step for all basins given the flashiness and short response time of many of the basins to refine the sac parameters and to estimate uhs that are valid at a 1 hr time step we used the adjoint based optimizer ab opt seo et al 2009 which corrects long term biases in map and mape derives empirical unit hydrographs and locally optimizes the sac parameters in this way systematic biases in inputs systematic timing errors and model parametric uncertainties are reduced as much as possible so that da may address the initial condition uncertainties as intended 2 5 assimilation approach the cbenkf and the enkf are applied as sequential assimilators but using the fixed lag smoother formulation fig 1 schweppe 1973 the size of the fixed lag or the assimilation window is chosen to be the same as the length of the uh see table 1 in this way the time lag between runoff generation and the resulting flow at the basin outlet is captured in the da process seo et al 2009 rafieeinasab et al 2014 the motivation for the fixed lag smoother approximation using a filter formulation as opposed to directly using a smoother formulation evensen and van leeuwen 2000 is to handle both cold and warm restarts with a clearly identifiable assimilation window so that human forecasters may easily interpret the results and make decisions seo et al 2009 in this approach the control vector in eq 1 consists of x k x k s x k p x k e x k r t i e the six sac states x k s the multiplicative adjustment factors for map and mape x k p and x k e respectively and the additive error to the total channel inflow tci x k r see fig 1 and table 2 in the above x k s is valid at the beginning of the assimilation window x k p x k e and x k r are valid over the entire assimilation window and x k e and x k p represent time varying systematic biases in pe and precipitation data gourley and vieux 2005 stisen and sandholt 2010 habib et al 2013 the time evolution of x k s is given by the sac the time evolution of x k p x k e and x k r is modeled as autoregressive 1 with a lag 1 hr serial correlation coefficient of 0 96 for all three smith and krajewski 1991 anagnostou et al 1998 seo et al 1999 the observation vector in eq 2 consists of z k z k p z k e z k r z k q t i e the observed map z k p the climatological mape z k e the observed additive error in tci z k r and the streamflow observations z k q the observation error vector v k v k p v k e v k r v k q t consists of the observation errors associated with z k z k p z k e z k r z k q t it is assumed that the elements of vk are uncorrelated among themselves and with xk and have mean of zero and covariance of rk the nonlinear observation equation g x k consists of the model simulated observations of map or z k p x k p mape or z k e x k e additive error in tci or x k r and streamflow or x k q in reality z k r is not observed as such we set it to zero under the assumption that the model simulated tci is unbiased at all scales the observations to be assimilated for each cycle include the map mape and streamflow valid over the assimilation window the motivation for updating the multiplicative adjustment factors for map and mape is to account for dynamically varying biases in the two forcing variables in sac static adjustment factors already exist for map and mape referred to as pxadj and peadj respectively seo et al 2009 in this work we include the two factors in the control vector and allow them to vary dynamically in the da process the map observations used in this work are from the multisensor precipitation estimator seo et al 2010 they are subject to various sources of error which manifest themselves as time varying biases as well as random errors smith et al 1996 fulton et al 1998 because map is a spatially averaged quantity purely random errors tend to cancel out whereas systematic biases do not as such it is important in streamflow da to correct dynamically varying biases in map over the assimilation window so that the sac states valid at the prediction time and the tcis valid over the assimilation window are as accurate as possible seo et al 2003 2009 the motivation for the additive error to tci is to allow for the time varying errors in sac uh that cannot be addressed by adjusting the model states pxadj and peadj alone the above formulation has proven very effective in several previous da studies seo et al 2003 2009 lee et al 2011 2012 2016 lee and seo 2014 rafieeinasab et al 2014 in this work the adjustment factors and the additive error in tci are assumed to be temporally uniform within the assimilation window following lee et al 2012 who found that the use of temporally varying errors does not significantly improve performance while substantially increasing the computational amount an assimilation cycle results in updated sac states valid at the end of the assimilation window or the prediction time and updated tcis valid over the assimilation window see fig 1 in the forecast generation process the da solution is used only for the initial conditions of the sac and the tcis valid over the assimilation window whereas all other control variables assume their default values accordingly pxadj and peadj are set to unity and the additive error to tci is to zero for simulation over the forecast horizon for assimilation and validation we used the us geological survey hourly streamflow data at the outlets of all study basins our focus in this work is on flood forecasting as such we identified only the significant events from the observed streamflow data and used the resulting partial duration time series where a significant event is defined as a hydrograph whose peak exceeds 100 m3 s once a significant event is identified the beginning and ending hours of that event are determined by subtracting and adding 72 h from and to the first and last hours of the flow duration over 100 m3 s respectively in this way the comparative evaluation is focused on the performance of da for relatively large events only for which streamflow da is likely to be affected by significant cb in the state variables the map data used were operationally produced by the west gulf river forecast center using the multisensor precipitation estimator seo et al 2010 for mape the monthly climatology of daily estimates was used because the da cycles consist only of the periods of significant flow pe does not play a significant role and hence the lack of dynamically varying mape is unlikely to impact the outcome in any significant way because both the cbenkf and the enkf solve unconstrained minimization there is no guarantee a priori that the updated states of all members lie within the feasible region of the sac states various approaches have been reported in the literature to solve constrained kf and enkf gupta and houser 2007 wang et al 2009 in this work we use the trial and error approach of wang et al 2009 if not all updated ensemble members are in the feasible region we additionally sample random perturbations for the infeasible members and update the states until all members are feasible the above strategy was used for both the cbenkf and the enkf in an identical manner to initiate ensemble da each sac state is perturbed by sampling from a lognormal distribution with mean and standard deviation given by the current sac state and approximately 17 of the square root of the maximum soil water content respectively the perturbations for pxadj and peadj are sampled from a lognormal distribution with mean and standard deviation given by the current state and 0 17 respectively the perturbations for the additive error of the tci are sampled from a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation in mm hr as above the model states are randomly perturbed independently of one another for simplicity similarly the zero mean dynamical model errors wk 1 in eq 1 are assumed to be independent of one another and have the standard deviation of approximately 4 of the current state for the sac states and 0 03 for all other variables the ensemble size is 30 throughout this work the above setup was identical for both the enkf and the cbenkf for additional details on perturbation and ensemble generation the reader is referred to rafieeinasab et al 2014 3 study basins evaluation metrics and observational uncertainty modelling in this section we describe the study basins evaluation metrics and observational uncertainty modelling 3 1 study basins ten hydroclimatologically diverse headwater basins in texas u s are used see fig 2 these catchments are a subset of the basins identified as particularly challenging in operational forecasting by the nws west gulf river forecast center the basins have been used by the authors and their collaborators for hydrologic da and related research in recent years seo et al 2009 lee et al 2011 2012 2016 lee and seo 2014 rafieeinasab et al 2014 the basins are wetter in the east and drier in the west as indicated by the dryness index calculated for the period of 1996 to 2005 see table 1 where the dryness index is defined as the ratio of mean annual pe to mean annual precipitation budyko 1974 table 1 also presents the time to peak tp and the 95th percentile observed flow within the selected events q95 s compared to the basins in the humid region those in the semi arid region pose larger challenges in streamflow forecasting due to the generally quicker catchment response larger uncertainties in the initial conditions possible structural uncertainties associated with unmodeled processes such as infiltration into dry channel beds and larger parametric uncertainties due to the above factors and the limited number of large events available for calibration in addition the large spatio temporal variability of precipitation from highly convective storms adds large uncertainties in lumped modelling particularly for large basins as such the study basins offer an extremely challenging test for streamflow da 3 2 evaluation metrics to evaluate the comparative performance of the cbenkf with the enkf we verified both ensemble mean and ensemble streamflow forecasts from hindcasting experiments for ensemble mean forecasts we used the root mean square error maximum errors of under and over prediction correlation coefficient and mean square error skill score mse ss lee et al 2011 2012 lee and seo 2014 the results indicate that the mse ss represents the overall comparative performance very well and we hence focus below on the mse ss results the mse ss for the cbenkf ensemble mean in reference to the enkf ensemble mean is given by 15 mse ss 1 1 n k 1 n q k cbenkf z k q 2 1 n k 1 n q k enkf z k q 2 where q k cbenkf q k enkf z k q and n denote the cbenkf ensemble mean flow enkf ensemble mean flow verifying observed flow and the number of paired sets of z k q and q k cbenkf respectively a perfect ensemble mean forecast would yield an mse ss of unity no improvement in the ensemble mean forecast by the cbenkf over the enkf would yield an mse ss of zero for ensemble forecasts we used a large number of verification measures available in the ensemble verification system evs brown et al 2010 including the brier score brier skill score continuous ranked probability score crps crps decomposition hersbach 2000 continuous ranked probability skill score crpss brown et al 2014 reliability diagram relative operating characteristic and others the results indicate that the mean crps its decomposition and mean crpss represent the comparative performance very well and hence we focus on their results in this paper the crps measures the integral squared difference between the cumulative distribution function cdf of ensemble forecast and that of the verifying observation a more skilful ensemble forecast will produce a smaller crps than the reference ensemble forecast the mean crpss of the cbenkf based ensemble forecast in reference to the enkf based is given by 16 crpss 1 crps cbenkf crps enkf 1 1 n i 1 n 0 f i cbenkf q f i obs q 2 d q 1 n i 1 n 0 f i enkf q f i obs q 2 d q where the crp s cbenkf and crp s enkf denote the mean crps of the cbenkf and the enkf ensemble forecast respectively f i cbenkf q and f i enkf q denote the cdfs of the i th cbenkf and enkf ensemble forecast respectively and f i obs q denotes the cdf of the verifying observation i e the heaviside step function a perfect ensemble forecast would yield a crpss of unity no improvement by the cbenkf over the enkf ensemble forecast would yield a crpss of zero following hersbach 2000 the crps can be decomposed into reliability rel resolution res and uncertainty unc or into rel and potential crps crpspot 17 crps r e l r e s u n c r e l c r p s pot smaller rel indicates more reliable ensembles desirable and larger res means better resolution desirable the res component unc crpspot is positive if the ensemble forecast is better than the climatological ensemble forecast hersbach 2000 the unc component reflects climatologic uncertainties in the observations and does not relate to forecast attributes the crpspot represents the crps achievable by calibrating forecast probabilities for perfect reliability hersbach 2000 similarly to the crps smaller crpspot indicates improved performance by the subject ensemble forecast 3 3 observational uncertainty modelling observational errors are generally heteroscedastic and correlated in time lee et al 2011 due to lack of observed truth however their modeling is a large challenge in this work we assume that all observational errors are temporally uncorrelated and homoscedastic and use a wide range of settings for their variances in this way one may assess the comparative performance of the cbenkf with the enkf under widely varying but identical conditions of the quality of the observations being assimilated and that of the model used generally speaking one would expect the observation error variance for mape σ e 2 to be smaller than that for map σ p 2 given that we are using climatological mape rather than dynamically estimated values however we assumed σ e 2 σ p 2 for simplicity we then used the settings of 10 100 and 1000 mm hr 2 for σ e 2 σ p 2 to represent small medium and large uncertainties respectively in input forcings the same three settings were used for the error variance to represent small medium and large model uncertainties in the sac uh table 3 lists the resulting 9 possible combinations of σ p 2 and σ r 2 represented by c1 through c9 harmel et al 2006 report streamflow measurement errors for small watersheds of 42 19 10 6 and 3 for the worst case typical maximum typical average typical minimum and the best case scenarios respectively baldassarre and montanari 2009 report that the overall error affecting river discharge observations ranges from 6 2 to 42 8 at the 95 confidence level with an average value of 25 6 given the dependence of streamflow observation errors on the flow one may consider prescribing larger or smaller σ q 2 depending on the magnitude of the observed flow the error associated with z k q in z k in eq 2 however reflects not only the observational error of streamflow but also the modeling errors associated with the simulated flow in g xk note that whereas the da formulation addresses uncertain sac states biases in map and mape and errors in the tci it does not address errors arising from model deficiencies such as timing errors liu et al 2011 as such a larger σ q 2 would be more appropriate if the model has large simulation errors which the da procedure cannot address even though the basin produces smaller peak flows for this reason a priori determination of σ q 2 is not readily possible and some form of sensitivity analysis is usually necessary in this work we used σ q 2 of 100 and 1 000 m3 s 2 carried out assimilation experiments using both settings of σ q 2 and compare the relative performance for each basin to illustrate the above process we show in fig 3 the mse ss results for midfield for c1 through c9 in table 3 for σ q 2 of 100 and 1 000 m3 s 2 the figure shows that the cbenkf improves over the enkf in the ensemble mean sense for all cases but that the margin of improvement is larger with σ q 2 100 m3 s 2 similar results for all other basins suggest σ q 2 of 100 m3 s 2 for justin houston greenville and brays bayou and σ q 2 of 1 000 m3 s 2 for lyons mckinney madisonville quinlan and schroeder in terms of the observed 95th percentile flow schroeder madisonville midfield and justin produce the largest peak flows whereas greenville houston and brays bayou produce the smallest comparison of the basin groupings based on the choice of σ q 2 and those based on the 95th percentile flow suggests that the smaller σ q 2 of 100 m3 s 2 might not be appropriate for justin and midfield which produce the largest peak flows examination of the hydrographs indicated however that the above two basins have significantly smaller timing errors liu et al 2011 which makes the smaller σ q 2 more realistic in the opposite case quinlan has significantly larger timing errors though its 95th percentile flow is not very large which makes the larger σ q 2 of 1 000 m3 s 2 more appropriate with the above choices we arrive at the nine cases for each of the two groups of σ q 2 100 m3 s 2 and σ q 2 1 000 m3 s 2 as shown in table 3 it is worth noting that the resulting upper bounds for the observation error variances are at least an order of magnitude larger than those used in rafieeinasab et al 2014 the rationale for the larger bounds is to use uncertainty estimates that are realistic for large events and to assess the relative performance between the cbenkf and the enkf under the limiting conditions of very large and very small observational and modeling uncertainties 4 results and discussion in this section we present the comparative evaluation results for each basin the cbenkf and enkf were applied for prediction of all events whose peak flow exceeds 100 m3 s within the 10 yr period of record we first present illustrative examples of the cbenkf and enkf results in section 4 1 we then describe comparative verification of ensemble mean and ensemble predictions in sections 4 2 and 4 3 respectively 4 1 illustrative examples to help intuitive understanding of how the cbenkf and enkf predictions may compare we first present in fig 4 illustrative examples of predicted hydrographs for selected events only for a subset of the basins due to space limitations in the figure it is readily seen that the cbenkf ensembles are of higher quality than the enkf in terms of both ensemble mean and spread in general the cbenkf ensembles are able to encompass the observed peak flow whereas the enkf ensembles are not examination of the hydrographs for all basins may be summarized as follows for greenville and quinlan the overall shape of the simulated hydrograph indicated the presence of timing errors for mckinney and midfield it was observed that the enkf ensembles lack spread in the recession phase the above suggests that one or more sac states for the soil water contents may have been completely full thereby suppressing the ensemble spread the above observations point out the need for parametric uncertainty modeling to mitigate the negative impact of timing errors and to account for the uncertainties in the soil water holding capacities of the soil moisture accounting model fig 5 shows an example set of ensemble mean results for a single event at lyons the figure shows the open loop and da updated streamflow uztwc uzfwc lztwc lzfsc lzfpc precipitation pe and the tci they illustrate how the cbenkf and enkf updated states may compare during the course of an event for streamflow the verifying observations are also shown in the figure each time step represents the ending hour of the assimilation window and the associated results represent the updated states and the model simulated flow valid at that hour i e the prediction time the figure hence represents the time series of the analysis results from successive da cycles during the course of the event the observation uncertainty parameters associated with fig 5 are σ q 2 1 000 m3 s 2 and σ p 2 σ e 2 σ r 2 1 000 mm h 2 it is seen that both the cbenkf and enkf streamflow analyses are much closer to the observed than the open loop analysis and that the cbenkf streamflow analysis tracks the observed more closely than the enkf upper left the corresponding cbenkf and enkf analyses of the state variables may at first appear similar but significant differences exist in the lower zone soil moisture states throughout the event as well as in the uzfwc and the additive error in the tci at certain da cycles because there are no truths available it is not possible to assess the accuracy of the state variables one may nevertheless observe that compared to the enkf the cbenkf solutions are closer to those of the open loop simulation especially in the three lower zone soil moisture states of lztwc lzfsc and lzfpc precipitation and the tci while producing more accurate streamflow analysis visual examination of many results similar to fig 5 suggests that the cbenkf and enkf updated states differ by varying degrees among different combinations of the observational uncertainty parameters and different state variables but that in general the cbenkf updated states tend to maintain the joint relationships among the different states of the open loop simulation more closely than the enkf updated to illustrate the above point we show in fig 6 the scatter plots between the uzfwc and lzfpc the fastest and the slowest varying sac states respectively from the open loop enkf updated and cbenkf updated ensemble results in the top left plot of fig 6 each stripe of data points represents an open loop simulation associated with the peak flow portion of the hydrograph associated with a significant event see the bottom plot in fig 6 the herringbone like patterns are due to the ensemble members from the same assimilation cycle possessing similar updated states fig 6 indicates that the cbenkf updated states resemble the joint relationships between the uzfwc and lzfpc in the open loop states more closely than the enkf updated even though the locations of the stripes are quite different among the three results in the bivariate phase space observations from figs 5 and 6 and many similar results suggest that the cbenkf retains the open loop model dynamics among the different soil moisture states more closely than the enkf and that when both the cbenkf and enkf produce streamflow analyses of similar quality the cbenkf updated states stay closer to the open loop states than the enkf states this supports the argument that the improved skill by the cbenkf is due in part to the updated states being more in line with the open loop model dynamics similar results were also obtained by noh et al 2018 in which a multi scale version of the fixed lag smoother see fig 1 was compared for streamflow da with the single scale version as implemented in this work but using variational assimilation rather than the enkf or cbenkf they showed that minimizing adjustment to the model states while producing high quality streamflow analyses significantly improves predictive skill in da solutions albeit at a substantially higher computational cost 4 2 ensemble mean streamflow evaluation here we present the scatter plots and mse ss results to assess the performance of ensemble mean predictions fig 7 shows the scatter and quantile quantile plots of 3 hr ahead ensemble mean streamflow forecast vs verifying observation also shown in the figure are the sample cbs computed over the 10 sub ranges that equally divide the entire range of observed flow it is seen that the cbenkf further reduces cbs in the ensemble mean sense beyond what the enkf is able to for the entire range of flow table 4 summarizes the mean absolute cb and rmse of 3 hr ahead ensemble mean streamflow forecasts shown in fig 7 the table shows that the cbenkf generally reduces both the mean absolute cb and rmse further than the enkf for justin and midfield the reduction in both the mean absolute cb and rmse by the enkf over open loop simulation is already very large and that for the cbenkf is similarly large fig 8 shows the mse ss of the cbenkf ensemble mean forecast for a subset of the basins for all verifying observed flow within the periods of significant events as a function of lead time the reference forecast is the enkf ensemble mean forecast the positive mse ss means that the cbenkf outperforms the enkf in the ensemble mean sense in each plot there are 9 mse ss curves representing the 9 different cases in table 3 the multi basin mean for all 10 basins of the mse ss of the cbenkf over the enkf is 0 37 for lead time of 1 hr and 0 15 over lead times of up to the time to peak of the basin for houston and brays bayou the two most quickly responding small urban basins in the humid region the positive impact of the cbenkf over the enkf diminishes rather quickly due to the short basin memory and relatively small cb in the base simulation for houston see also fig 7 for larger basins the positive impact extends to longer lead times for lyons mckinney and madisonville the increased skill in the cbenkf ensemble mean forecast remains significantly high well beyond the first 24 hrs of lead time for a number of observational uncertainty parameter combinations for the largest basin justin on the other hand the skill dissipates rather quickly due to the short time to peak associated with rain falling in the lower part of this very elongated basin which dominates the generation of large flows at the outlet see fig b1 of seo et al 2009 fig 8 also shows that the cbenkf improves over the enkf in the ensemble mean sense under widely varying combinations of σ p 2 σ e 2 and σ r 2 the above observations indicate that the cbenkf is robust and may be expected to perform well even if the uncertainty parameters are not prescribed with accuracy an important consideration for real world applications 4 3 ensemble streamflow evaluation here we present the ensemble verification results to assess the performance of ensemble predictions fig 9 shows the mean crpss of the cbenkf ensemble forecast for a subset of the basins the reference is the enkf ensemble forecast all results in fig 9 are conditional on the verifying observation exceeding the 95th percentile flow of the associated basin within the significant events see table 1 as such the figure assesses comparative skill specifically for prediction of large flows for which there exists only limited hydrologic memory for da to rely on for each basin there are 9 mean crpss curves corresponding to the 9 combinations of σ p 2 σ e 2 and σ r 2 given the basin specific σ q 2 see table 3 fig 9 shows that the cbenkf considerably improves over the enkf for all basins shown for short lead times as with the mse ss the increased skill quickly dissipates for houston and brays bayou for the larger basins lyons mckinney and madisonville the increase skill persists into significantly longer lead times for the rest of the basins justin greenville midfield quinlan and schroeder the increased skill stays significant for the first several hours or more but dissipates within the first 24 h or so it is observed in fig 9 that for some mean crpss curves for midfield the skill is lower at lead time of zero i e analysis than at lead time of 1 hr examination of the comprehensive verification results from the evs indicates that for large basins such as midfield the analysis ensembles are not always as reliable as the 1 hr forecast ensembles the above observations point out the need for improving uncertainty modeling particularly for large basins a topic left as a future endeavor for attribution of the increased skill in cbenkf ensembles we carried out mean crps decomposition for 1 6 hr ahead streamflow ensemble forecasts fig 10 shows the mean crpss crps rel res and crpspot for all basins for each basin there are 9 data points representing the 9 combinations of σ p 2 σ e 2 and σ r 2 given the basin specific σ q 2 in the figure the results are connected across all basins only to aid visualization of the differences between the cbenkf and enkf results the figure shows that the cbenkf generally improves both reliability and resolution of ensemble forecasts over the enkf for all basins the mean crpss varies from 0 06 to 0 19 with a mean of 0 12 the mean improvement for all basins in the rel res crpspot and crps by the cbenkf over the enkf are 17 7 10 and 11 respectively because the magnitude of the res is generally much larger than that of the rel at short lead time the above reduction in the rel and increase in the res are comparable in magnitude in terms of reducing the mean crps of the cbenkf ensembles fig 11 shows the mean crpss of 1 hr ahead cbenkf ensemble forecast in reference to the 1 hr ahead enkf forecast for all basins as a function of the conditioning threshold for each threshold on the x axis a total of 90 data points are represented in the vertical which include 9 cases for each of the 10 basins the figure shows that the larger the verifying flow is the larger the margin of improvement by the cbenkf is the mean crpss of the cbenkf ensembles in reference to the enkf is about 0 2 for all ranges of verifying flow and increases to about 0 3 or larger for observed flows at or above the 95th percentile flow within the significant events see table 1 that the gain in skill increases as the threshold increases is an extremely appealing attribute of the cbenkf and is consistent with the cbpkf results seo et al 2018a b shen et al 2019 the above indicates that sac uh simulations of floods generally contain significant cb for the study area and that the cbenkf is able to reduce its ill effects and significantly improve prediction the results presented above pertain only to prediction of significant events when the assimilation cycles include both the storm and inter storm periods the skill of the cbenkf predictions in reference to the enkf is expectedly smaller for example for c5 and c9 at madisonville the mean crpss for flood periods only and for all periods are about 0 35 and 0 20 respectively when the assimilation cycles include only the inter storm periods the cbenkf shows little improvement over the enkf when only the periods of extremely low flows are included however the cbenkf improves over the enkf the above results are fully expected in that the enkf already provides the optimal solution when the true state of the system is at or near median which corresponds generally to low flow conditions and that the cbenkf provides improvement over the tails of the distribution seo et al 2018a b shen et al 2019 the above observations suggests that in real time operation one may normally run the enkf and supersede it with the cbenkf only in non normal conditions 5 conclusions and future research recommendations the conditional bias penalized ensemble kalman filter cbenkf is developed and evaluated for real time assimilation of streamflow data to improve flood forecasting the ensemble mean results show that for the ten basins in tx the cbenkf improves the mean square error skill score see eq 15 over the enkf on average by about 0 15 over lead times of up to the time to peak of the basin the ensemble results show that on average the cbenkf improves the mean continuous ranked probability skill score see eq 16 over the enkf by about 0 2 for all observed flows in significant events and by about 0 3 or larger for observed flows exceeding the 95th percentile in those events that the margin of improvement is larger for larger flows is a particularly appealing aspect of the cbenkf both the ensemble mean and ensemble results show that the considerable improvement by the cbenkf over the enkf is realized over a wide range of combinations of observational uncertainties as such one may expect the cbenkf to improve over the enkf even if the uncertainty modeling may not be very accurate an important consideration in operational forecasting visual comparison of forecast hydrographs with verifying observations indicates that the cbenkf ensemble forecasts are generally of higher quality in the mean and spread than the enkf ensembles but that for a few basins the quality of both the cbenkf and enkf ensembles is compromised by phase errors in the uh and lack of parametric uncertainty modeling in the maximum soil water storages of the sac the crps decomposition indicates that the improved skill in cbenkf ensembles is due to improvement in both reliability and resolution and that their contributions are comparable in magnitude at short lead times the examination of the updated and open loop states indicates that the cbenkf is able to improve the quality of streamflow analysis over the enkf by adjusting the model states beyond what the enkf is able to and that when the cbenkf and enkf produce streamflow analyses of comparable quality the cbenkf generally makes smaller adjustments to the open loop state variables than the enkf while still outperforming the enkf in streamflow prediction the last observation is supported by the examination of the joint relationships of the sac states with and without da in that the cbenkf updated states tend to follow the patterns of the open loop states more closely than the enkf updated it is hence surmised that the improved skill is due in part to the cbenkf updated states being more in line with the open loop model dynamics than the enkf updated the cbenkf in its current form is computationally expensive shen et al 2019 compared to the enkf the cbenkf additionally requires inverting an n n and two m m matrices in each assimilation cycle where m and n denote the number of state variables and observations respectively toward remedying the situation at least two approaches seem possible the first is to build a hybrid filter which runs the enkf in normal conditions but switches to the cbenkf in non normal conditions the second is to reduce the dimensionality of the linear systems via the singular value decomposition or its variant the latter will also allow assessment of dynamically varying information content in the observation and forecast error covariance matrices the state augmentation approach used in this work renders the dimensionality of the state vector very large alternative approaches are possible which greatly reduces dimensionality but at some expense of reduced accuracy the weight for the cb penalty α is specified in this work by prescribing the initial value α 0 and reducing successively until a valid solution is obtained if α could be specified adaptively without iterations based on the state of the dynamical system the computational burden associated with the cbenkf would be significantly reduced shen et al 2019 we are currently evaluating lower dimensional reformulation of the da problem the use of the randomized decomposition approaches for rank reduction halko et al 2011 and machine learning based state classification approaches for adaptive filtering and the results will be reported in the near future declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this

6369,damming is one of the major methods that human being secure reliable freshwater it can change flow magnitude and regime along a river particularly for transboundary rivers shared by multiple jurisdictions this study develops a coupled framework to assess both the current and future cumulative impacts of damming on downstream water availability for data sparse regions like the tibetan plateau the framework is applied to the brahmaputra river basin brb where dam developments on the tibetan plateau are highly concerned the results show that despite being part of the asian water tower the yarlung tsangpo river ytr contributes just 15 16 to brahmaputra streamflow for 48 of its contributing area we found that the maximum impact due to five recently constructed dams in ytr suggests about 8 11 reduction of mean annual streamflow at outlet of brahmaputra river the impacts of damming would be largely offset by runoff increases under the climate scenarios projected by 28 cmip5 model outputs from rcp4 5 median level emission scenarios and 29 cmip5 model outputs from rcp8 5 high level emission scenarios for the period of 2049 to 2075 compared to the historical period of 1979 to 2005 our results suggest that it is necessary to use our framework or a similar one to comprehensively evaluate the maximum possible damming impact across the transboundary rivers keywords cumulative impact damming rainfall runoff modelling water availability climate change rivers 1 introduction the construction of dams to secure water for consumptive uses hydro electricity and flood mitigation is undertaken worldwide donchyts et al 2016 pekel et al 2016 timpe and kaplan 2017 the effect of changing flow regimes and water availability along a river could have adverse consequences for downstream users including the environment palmer et al 2015 poff et al 2016 powers et al 2016 wang et al 2016 yeophantong 2017 where a water source is shared by multiple jurisdictions engineering of streamflow by an upstream state that affects the access to water of downstream states is often a major source of transboundary conflict nilsson et al 2005 the nile river jordan river colorado river and mekong river are some well known examples of transboundary contested water resources the brahmaputra river br is one of the six major rivers that rise on the tibetan plateau tp dubbed the water tower of asia immerzeel and bierkens 2012 immerzeel et al 2010 it flows from china into india then bangladesh where it meets the ganges river before entering the bay of bengal the river is the major water source for hundreds of millions of people in india and bangladesh since 2000 china has undertaken construction of five multi purpose dams in the upper part of the catchment i e yarlung tsangpo river ytr catchment which is the social and economic center on the tibetan plateau the main purpose of the dams are designed for hydropower and irrigation particularly for industrial and domestic uses in china supplementary information text s3 some public media concerned that these dams could impact water supply to northeast india and bangladesh bbc com 2016 dailymail co uk 2016 thehindu com 2016 while it is also reported that there would be little impacts upon downstream flows chinadaily com cn 2010 one of the underlying reasons of the conflicts in addressing the impacts of damming is that there is no sufficient water information available across the brb for comprehensive interpretation for proper and effective water information sharing and coordination underpinning regional sustainable water management poff et al 2016 more solid scientific evidences are required to support the urgent and constructive dialogues among the stakeholders along the river yeophantong 2017 however how the tibetan damming impacts runoff locally and the downstream brb remains unknown this study tries to fill the knowledge gap for this transboundary river another unique motivation of this study is to have solid hydrological simulations in the tp a data sparse region with complex topographic and unique hydrogeological features korup and montgomery 2008 mishra 2015 therefore it is challenging to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics and distribution of streamflow which is required to evaluate the impacts of damming the assessment becomes more challenging when taking into account that the tp has experienced three time higher air temperature increase than the global average over the last 30 years duan and xiao 2015 zhong et al 2011 with the rapidly changed climate large change in future streamflow is expected in the tp and surrounding areas gain et al 2011 immerzeel et al 2010 2013 li et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 this will have noticeable impact on regional water availability across the brb to understand the compounded forces from damming and climate change require new framework that have a solid parameterisation scheme that simulates well spatiotemporal dynamics and distribution of streamflow in the brb to understand damming impact on catchment runoff under future climate it needs to downscale key climate variables such as precipitation that is projected from global climate models such as the cmip5 the fifth phase of the coupled model inter comparison project models moss et al 2010 taylor et al 2012 methods for downscaling climate variables include empirical statistical and dynamical approaches chiew et al 2010 collados lara et al 2018 fowler et al 2007 räty et al 2014 frost et al 2011 recommend the empirical approach for regional water resource planning applications primarily because of the method s robustness this study uses the empirical downscaling method to generate the future climate scenarios for the brb using an empirical scaling factor defined as the change in future climate condition relative to current or historical climatology where cmip5 simulations for the 1976 2005 period define the historical climatology and for 2046 2075 the future climatology the main objective of this study is to develop a new framework to assess damming impacts accumulating along the river under current and projected future climate scenarios for data sparse region the framework is underpinned by coupling reservoir model with a parsimonious grid based gr4j snow hydrological model developed from the lumped version li et al 2013 and tailored to account for snowmelt and glacier melt the ensemble simulation schemes are applied to represent the uncertainty due to regionalization of model parameterization i e how to transfer parameters from catchments to each grid cell and future climate projections immerzeel and bierkens 2012 2 materials and methods 2 1 framework of damming impact assessment sensible assessment of cumulative impacts of damming requires credible prediction of runoff across the basin moreover for runoff prediction at the data sparse regions like tp a robust prediction strategy needs to account for the uncertainty in hydrologic model parameters their regionalization and future climate projections with the consideration of all these issues a new framework of damming impact assessment is presented in fig 1 as can be seen in the framework the corner stone is the coupling hydrological model with reservoir water balance model where the uncertainty of hydrological prediction is accounted for on the basis of monte carlo simulations details of the framework are introduced in the following sections from 2 2 to 2 4 2 2 hydrological model 2 2 1 model description and inputs the hydrological model used in the study is gr4j snow li et al 2014 which couples the original gr4j model perrin et al 2003 with a simple degree day snow module the original gr4j is a 4 parameter rainfall runoff model that has been widely used in europe asia and australia lacombe et al 2008 oudin et al 2008 vaze et al 2011 fig 2 it has two model parameters that define the capacities of the runoff production and routing stores one that specifies the groundwater exchange coefficient and a fourth that defines the time base of the unit hydrograph the snow module of the gr4j snow is adopted from the soil water and assessment tool swat in the snow module precipitation falls as snow and accumulates in the catchment when daily mean air temperature is below 0 c snowmelt occurs when the air temperature is above 0 5 c and is a linear function of the difference between the average snow pack maximum air temperature and the threshold temperature i e 0 5 c sublimation of snow is part of the estimated daily potential evaporation and when it occurs according to neitsch et al 2011 the amount of sublimation is removed from snow pack to meet evaporation demand daily snowmelt contributes to interception soil moisture groundwater and catchment streamflow stores and pathways fig 2 the snow module has three model parameters which define the snow temperature lag a snow coverage factor and a melt factor the melting factor allows seasonal variation represented by a sinusoidal function and the extent of snow coverage represented by an areal depletion curve a more detailed description of swat snowmelt equations can be found in neitsch et al 2011 the gr4j snow is a spatially explicit model for which model inputs and parameters for each grid cells are unique model parameters are obtained using a parameterization approach described in section 2 2 3 runoff is calculated on every grid cell and results are aggregated to obtain predictions of catchment streamflow for comparison against streamflow observations the gr4j snow model differentiates initial states at each grid cell based on glacier location and coverage area at each grid cell an initial water equivalent depth of snow is set up as follows 200 mm for the non glacier part and 10 m for the glacier part furthermore the first three years were used to warm up gr4j snow this makes sure that the initial snow depth has negligible influence on regions without snow cover and more importantly glaciers can consistently contribute to streamflow which is important in the northeastern and central parts of the brahmaputra river basin brb fig 3 we assume that the glacier area ratio at each grid cell is fixed within the simulation period since the change in the glacier area is uncertain and lack of observation support schaner et al 2012 inputs to the gr4j snow model are 0 1 resolution of daily precipitation potential evaporation minimum and maximum air temperature and existing monthly leaf area index and glacier coverage area the orientation of the terrain is not considered in this study all of these datasets were obtained from meteorological and vegetation data products except daily potential evaporation daily potential evaporation was calculated using the mass transfer method that relates potential evaporation to vapor pressure deficit and wind speed hanasaki et al 2008 and requires air temperature specific humidity air pressure wind speed shortwave radiation and longwave radiation inputs which came from regional and global forcing datasets see section 3 2 2 2 model calibration and parameterization the gr4j snow model was run on a daily time step over a modeling domain of 527 840 km2 at a grid resolution of 0 1 the model was calibrated against mean monthly streamflow data at each of 11 catchments for the period 1979 to 1999 10 located in the ytr catchment and one in the lower brb fig 4 the model was warmed up with an initial repeat of the first three years 1979 1981 streamflow data after 1999 were not used for model calibration because construction of the first of the five dams was completed in 2000 with others completed or still to be completed since then table 1 a genetic algorithm an automated global optimisation method was used to calibrate the gr4j snow model the objective of the calibration is to best reproduce the observed mean monthly streamflow which was done by minimising the objective function li et al 2014 viney et al 2009 1 f 1 1 n s e 5 ln 1 b i a s 2 5 where nse is the model efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 estimated by 2 nse 1 i 1 m q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 m q obs i q obs 2

indicating perfect agreement between the modelled and observed monthly streamflow the bias measures the water balance error between modelled and observed mean monthly streamflow with bias 0 indicating overprediction of streamflow by the model and bias 0 indicating model underprediction 2 2 3 parameterisation and ensemble simulation we developed a new approach for parameterising the gr4j snow at the grid scale based on the widely used similarity approach for parameterising hydrological models at both catchment blöschl et al 2013 parajka et al 2005 zhang and chiew 2009a b and grid cell li and zhang 2017 scales the similarity paramerisation was undertaken for each grid cell in the modelling domain to characterize the uncertainty inherent in model parameterization over large areas with limited observation data 10 000 simulations were undertaken from which the 1 best reproducing observed streamflow were used to model the impacts on local and regional flows of five new dams in the ytr catchment under a range of climate scenarios for the periods 1979 2005 and 2049 2075 in the similarity approach the set of parameter values from a calibrated donor catchment are transferred to a target ungauged catchment or grid cell based on their physical similarity including climate the approach used here is summarised as five steps 1 select similarity attributes distance mean annual precipitation potential evaporation temperature combination of elevation and latitude impacts and leaf area index were selected to represent the characteristics at both catchment and grid cell scales 2 quantify attributes for calibration catchments for each of the 11 calibration catchments the similarity attributes were aggregated from its internal grid cells 3 build similarity indices for determining the most similar catchment for predicting streamflow from each grid we calculate a similarity index for each attribute as 4 si j i 1 n w i i i j i i t 2 i i t where sij is the similarity index for the donor catchment j i is the ith attribute from a total n attributes in this case n 5 w i is an attribute weighting 0 1 an unknown parameter obtained in step 4 and the sum of w i equals to 1 with higher w i meaning the ith attribute more important ii t is the value for the ith attribute for the target grid cell t and ii j is the aggregated value for the ith attribute for the jth donor catchment since ii t is not available for geographic distance i i j i i t 2 i i t is replaced by d the euclidean distance between grid and catchment latitude longitude centroids 4 estimate attribute weighting w i monte carlo simulations were conducted to generate 10 000 sets of weightings for the five similarity attributes which were then applied to eq 4 to generate 10 000 sets of optimised parameters for each grid cell 5 select the best 1 of weighting sets the 10 000 simulations were evaluated against the mean monthly streamflow data at the 11 gauging stations and the best 1 i e 100 model runs were selected for ensemble simulation at each 0 1 resolution grid cell fig 1 2 3 reservoir water balances we used the concept of extended deficit analysis eda mcmahon et al 2007 thomas and adebayo 2005 to estimate the reliability level given a designed reservoir capacity of which the dynamic water balance is expressed as 5 s t 1 m i n s t r t d t p t et t c where st 1 and st is the reservoir storages at month t and t 1 respectively c is the reservoir capacity rt is inflow at month t obtained from the hydrological model dt is dam catchment water demand including agricultural and industrial and domestic water demand and pt and ett are precipitation and evaporation from reservoir water body at month t respectively the water body evaporation is taken as potential evaporation estimated from the energy balance based method hanasaki et al 2008 agricultural water demand is estimated as the difference between potential evaporation minus precipitation for maximum future arable crop land area in crop growing season may to october table 1 the arable crop land is selected from the area with slope less than 20 calculated from 3 sec digital elevation data see second 3 assuming the maximum irrigation conduction or the largest of possible impacts future industrial and general water demand is estimated as 15 agricultural water demand obtained from the tibetan autonomous region scale indication changjiang press 2015 and is evenly distributed to each month we assume that both water demands are consumed within dam catchment and without return flow back to its downstream when st 1 is negative it means that the storage together with the inflow cannot meet the monthly water demand indicating failure of the reservoir and it is set to zero for the following step 2 4 dam impact scenarios the dam impact on a downstream sector is defined as the ratio of the deducted streamflow i e the streamflow retained by upstream reservoirs to the natural streamflow from no damming the ratio of 0 means no impact no reduction of streamflow the ratio of 1 means 100 impact streamflow is all retained by upstream reservoir to investigate the cumulative impacts of damming we have calculated the impact ratio consecutively for river sections downstream the reservoirs the cumulative impacts of damming are assessed for two operating scenarios of the reservoirs no spilling and spilling on the basis of reservoir capacity 1 no spilling all streamflow generated from each dam catchment is retained within the catchment and there is no water spilled downstream naturally this represents the maximum dam impact scenario bottom left and bottom right panels in fig 1 and 2 spilling agriculture and industry water uses dt reach limit as explained in section 2 2 and water spilled downstream is the residue from reservoir water balances eq 5 this scenario represents the maximum possible impact with dam operation two bottom central panels in fig 1 it is important to note that this study attempts to represent the maximum possible agriculture and industry water uses instead of the actual usage 3 data we used the state of the art meteorological forcing precipitation minimum air temperature and maximum air temperature downward long wave radiation downward short wave radiation wind speed and vapor pressure data and vegetation data for the ytr catchment daily aggregated from 3 h west forcing data at 0 1 0 1 grid resolution were used the west precipitation data for china were produced by merging 1000 china meteorological administration station data and trmm satellite precipitation analysis data 3b42 he and yang 2011 yang et al 2006 the west forcing data do not cover the lower brb where we used 0 25 0 25 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017 together with 0 5 0 5 wfdei climate forcing other than precipitation data weedon et al 2014 the west precipitation data performs noticeably better than mswep plus wfdei data for streamflow simulation in the ytr catchment supplementary information text s1 the 0 0833 resolution half monthly leaf area index data was obtained from the boston university zhu et al 2013 for consistency the 0 05 0 0833 and 0 5 resolution data were resampled to 0 1 for ensemble simulation future climate scenarios were generated using the combined climate forcing data together with scaling factors obtained from empirical downscaling fowler et al 2007 of 30 available cmip5 models taylor et al 2012 28 gcms for rcp4 5 and 29 gcms for rcp8 5 the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 represent middle level and high level emissions projections which represent radiative forcings of 4 5 and 8 5 w m2 in the year 2100 relative to pre industrial values emissions in rcp4 5 peak around 2040 and then decline while emissions in rcp8 5 continue to rise throughout the 21st century the future precipitation temperature and potential evaporation forcings were generated by scaling up the historical observations using scaling factors derived from the cmip5 models this empirical approach is simple but robust and widely used for regional water resource planning applications chiew et al 2010 fowler et al 2007 zheng et al 2018 details for the cmip5 models and downscaling are summarized in supplementary information text s2 frost et al 2011 moss et al 2010 the monthly streamflow data used for model calibration and simulation were from two sources for the 10 gauges located within the ytr catchment streamflow data were originally observed by the tibetan hydrological bureau but obtained from the hydrological annuals compiled by the ministry of water resources china for the gauge of bahadurabad located in bangladesh streamflow data were obtained from dai et al 2009 it is noted that streamflow data from indian gauges are not publically available the glacier dataset was obtained from the glacier database of global land ice measurements from space project http www glims org raup et al 2007 this dataset includes glacier coverage provided in vector data format i e the esri shapefiles it was then converted into percentage data at 0 1 resolution areas of the dam catchments the reservoir water bodies and the entire brb were delineated from the shuttle radar topography mission 3 arc second digital elevation data provided by the united states geological survey usgs 2000 half monthly leaf area index measurements between 1981 and 2012 derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr ndvi data were obtained from boston university zhu et al 2013 these data have a spatial resolution of 0 0833 8 km the 1981 values were used for 1979 and 1980 since 1995 five major dams have been constructed or are under construction on tributaries of the ytr table 1 the main purposes of these dam are for generating hydropower irrigation and water supply their combined contributing area is about 27 8 103 km2 about 11 of the total yrb area the manla woka zhikong and pangduo dams were completed in 2001 2000 2007 and 2015 respectively laluo is expected to be finished in 2020 the total designed capacity for the five dams is 1956 gl of which pangduo dam accounts for 63 4 results 4 1 model calibration and ensemble predictions table 2 summarises performance of gr4j snow model for the model calibration and 100 ensemble simulations under historical climate inputs from 1979 to 1999 as measured by the nse and model bias the gr4j snow model is well calibrated with nse varying from 0 75 to 0 99 and the model bias is less than 6 for all 11 catchments compared to the model calibration results the 100 ensemble predictions selected from 10 000 parameterisations see section 2 2 3 are slightly degraded but with overall good performance in terms of predicting mean monthly streamflow with the nse values varying from the minimum of 0 59 at lazi to the maximum of 0 98 at bahadurabad fig 4 further shows the mean monthly streamflow variation of the measured and predicted at the11 gauging stations the model bias ranges from a 24 underprediction low boundary at gongbujiangda to a 42 overprediction upper boundary at rikaze the median model runs perform very well with the nse ranging from 0 83 to 0 98 and the bias varying from 21 to 21 the narrow range of results in each ensemble indicates consistent estimate of monthly streamflow with high confidence for the following results analysis the gr4j snow estimates show clear seasonality of snowmelt and glacier melt contributions fig 5 the streamflow contribution from modelled snow and glacier melt varies between 20 and 40 in the ytr catchment in april to june and is less than 15 in other months this result is largely consistent with the simulations in this region or nearby regions chen et al 2017 jeelani et al 2012 lutz et al 2014 schaner et al 2012 it is noted that there exists high uncertainty to partition streamflow components because of complex hydrological nature in this region chen et al 2017 wang et al 2017 and there is no available data to validate the partitioning at the ytr catchment especially that from glacier melt 4 2 streamflow in the baseline period and projected change in the baseline period between 1979 and 2005 the median estimate of mean annual streamflow from these 100 simulations ranged from less than 25 mm year 1 in the northwest to more than 3000 mm year 1 in southeast of the brb fig 6 a streamflow generation in the ytr catchment including the catchments where the five dams are located is substantially lower than in the lower brb i e regions other than the ytr catchment the range of future climate scenarios represented in the analysis includes 28 cmip5 model outputs from rcp4 5 median level emission scenarios and 29 model outputs from rcp8 5 high level emission scenarios taylor et al 2012 supplementary information text s2 which with the 100 parameterizations of the hydrological model results in 2800 and 2900 unique parameterisations for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively under the rcp8 5 fig 6b and to a similar extent rcp4 5 fig s1 futures annual streamflow is projected to increase across most of the brb mainly because of the projected increase in precipitation across most of the region under a warmer climate supplementary information text s2 3 s2 4 4 3 damming impact under the baseline climate the maximum possible interception is that all streamflow are retained by reservoirs section 2 4 and can be quantified using the ratio of streamflow generated within the dam catchments to that from the ytr catchment or brb the contributing areas to the five dams represent 10 9 of the ytr and 5 2 of the brb while their combined streamflow contribution median of 8921 gl year 1 is estimated at 8 11 of ytr streamflow fig 7 a or 1 3 1 5 of brb streamflow fig 7a thus these catchments are relatively poor contributors to flow in the brahmaputra river and yield at or below the average for the ytr catchment fig 7b in practical operation streamflow from the dammed catchments will spill downstream when the reservoir is at full capacity section 2 4 a commonly used reservoir model eq 5 was used to estimate the maximum possible volume of water retained by each reservoir and spillage to determine the potential seasonal and annual cumulative impacts downstream see sections 2 2 and 2 3 the annual cumulative impacts along the tributaries and main river channel are further quantified by including and not including dam operation scenarios respectively fig 8 a and b under the baseline the cumulative impact without including dam spillage i e representing most possible impact along the ytr is about double of that including dam spillage the large impact is observed near downstream of laluo and manla dams the annual impact on xiabuqu river varies in 30 80 from laluo dam to its confluence with main ytr course the degree of impact could be higher than 80 for reaches from manla dam to the nyang qu river confluence but diminish rapidly when flow is diluted from upper reach of nyang qu river the pangduo and zhikong dams have up to 50 impacts on lhasa river which further extend to the main ytr channel with the inflow from downstream tributaries the cumulative impacts are less than 10 after the confluence of nyang river and ytr less than 5 at the ytr outlet and less than 1 along the far downstream brahmaputra river the dams show to have seasonality effects on the downstream flows depending on the catchment the wet season commences between april and june and ends around november with peak streamflow in august between april and july depending on the catchment the dams are predicted to intercept all their inflows with spilling occurring once the dams are full in june and july figs 9 a c and s5 s8 downstream of pangduo zhikong and woka dams this could mean periods of no flow in the dry season there is no spillage predicted from the laluo and manla dams at pangduo zhikong and woka dams there are noticeable median volume of spillage predicted in the dry season supplementary information text s3 1 the implications of these reductions in the reaches downstream of the reservoirs depend on downstream demand and environmental water requirements and the extent to which these requirements are specific objectives of dam operations 4 4 damming impact under future climate under the modelled climate futures the median mean annual streamflow from the dam catchments increases by 1660 gl year 1 or 18 6 for rcp4 5 and 1772 gl year 1 or 19 3 for rcp8 5 the combined relative contribution to the ytr and lower brb is also expected to noticeably increase compared to the baseline contribution fig 7a and b the predicted increases in streamflow in the ytr catchment and lower brb are noticeably higher than the combined baseline streamflow generated from the catchments at five dams fig 7c under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the median increases in the ytr flow are 13 478 gl year 1 and 11 347 gl year 1 respectively which are 1 5 and 1 3 times of the combined streamflow from the five dam catchment under median estimates under the two future climate conditions much more median streamflow increases are projected in the low brb which are 4 1 and 5 6 times of the combined dam catchment streamflow this result indicates that even if all the streamflow generated in the dam catchments is intercepted by the dams and this streamflow loss is likely to be lower than the increase in streamflow in the rest of the ytr catchment and lower brb in the future the median combined spillage from the five reservoirs under the baseline is 4662 gl year 1 which represents a 52 water release downstream with the predicted streamflow increases under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the median volume of spillage increases to 5648 gl year 1 63 and 5921 gl year 1 66 respectively the projected impacts in the wetter futures under rcp8 5 are noticeably smaller than the baseline simulations since more downstream reaches are with less than 1 impact in the futures fig 10 a and b and similar results are under rcp4 5 supplementary information text s3 2 to further investigate monthly cumulative impact along the ytr and brahmaputra river we choose two severely impacted months may and june when small amount of streamflow is generated and the majority or all of streamflow is used within the dam catchment fig 11 summarises the cumulative impacts in these two months under rcp8 5 without including dam spillages fig 11a the impact in these two months is higher than the annual average for the reaches where tributary contribution is small but is slightly smaller than the annual average along the downstream brahmaputra river reaches where there are strong tributary contribution though including dam spillages fig 11b shows less impact than that without dam spillages fig 11a it has an impacting rate higher than 70 in may to june for lhasa river where pangduo and zhikong dams locate on and it propagates to the downstream ytr and brahmaputra river furthermore similar but slightly eased cumulative impacts are also found under rcp4 5 supplementary information text s3 2 5 discussion 5 1 advantage and strength of this study most studies of large scale dam impacts on streamflow are carried out using regional or global hydrological models which normally use default parameters doll and zhang 2010 masaki et al 2017 2018 this will obviously result in large bias in some regions particularly in the data sparse regions a typical example is the tp that is featured by a complex topography where there are few precipitation and streamflow gauges installed which makes understanding the hydrological processes and changes in the tp catchments even harder li et al 2013 2014 mishra 2015 therefore it is challenging to have credible streamflow simulations and predictions across data sparse regions merz and bloschl 2004 more importantly the most available studies only tackle the issue of dam impacts on the whole catchment or river system ahn et al 2018 arrigoni et al 2010 timpe and kaplan 2017 in lots of cases it requires cumulative impact analysis along the river system this is particularly important for the transboundary river such as brb where multiple jurisdictions share river water source the cumulative impact analysis will provide transparent water information for the countries who have interests for the first time we developed a framework that combined model calibration gridded parameterization and simulation uncertainty analysis and cumulative dam impact on downstream streamflow under different climate change scenarios the hydrological model calibrations and simulations were carried out by using 1 regional model calibrations parajka et al 2007 2 parameterisation building on monte carlo simulations demaria et al 2007 seibert 1999 and hydroclimatic similarity parajka et al 2013 razavi and coulibaly 2013 zhang and chiew 2009a b and 3 ensembles from possible climate change scenario inputs chiew et al 2010 mcintyre et al 2005 singh et al 2011 zheng et al 2018 methods section they have following advantages correspondingly including 1 consistent model performance across a large modelling domain 2 maximised regionalisation information obtained from daily streamflow time series climate and vegetation data and 3 fully considered uncertainty from climate change inputs therefore our modelling results in terms of nse are reliable as demonstrated in fig 3 and table 2 the results in term of nse are also comparable to those obtained for data dense regions such as europe parajka et al 2007 and australia li and zhang 2017 zhang and chiew 2009a b furthermore our modelling framework has great potential for global streamflow predictions across ungauged catchments beck et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 5 2 study limitations this study has following limitations first there are limited available streamflow data for calibrating hydrological model gr4j snow there are only 11 catchments where streamflow data are available in the brb 10 located in the ytr catchment and 1 located in the downstream brb this would potentially influence runoff simulation accuracy in the downstream brb more streamflow data should allow for robust validation of gr4j snow in different parts of the brb furthermore there are 18 years of streamflow data 1982 1999 used for model calibrations with the first three years 1979 1981 for model warm up it is possible that the streamflow series employed to calibrate thehydrologicalmodel are not long enough for representing a stationary hydrological condition second this study employed a scaling factor to perform the climate forcing downscaling which only produces a correction of the mean in accordance with future projections we do not consider potential changes in the standard deviation or other statistics that may be important to assess the impacts of the damming pulido velazquez et al 2011 third this study uses the temperature to estimate snowmelt contributed runoff temperature is taken into account in the simple degree day snow module to estimate snowmelt there are other climatic variables that can also influence the snowmelt process such as relative humidity insolation and wind speed including these variables could result in more accurate estimates of snowmelt contributed runoff however compared to the temperature including other variables into the snowmelt module could also large uncertainty for predicting trends in snowmelt under the future climate scenarios such as wind speed mcinnes et al 2011 and insolation lee et al 2016 further investigation is required to quantifying the uncertainty related to the various climate forcing data fourth this study only considers two dam operation scenarios no spilling and spilling under no spilling scenario there is no water spilled downstream naturally and all streamflow generated from each dam catchment is retained which represents the maximum possible impact under spilling scenario maximum agriculture and industry water uses are reached and the residue from reservoir water balances is considered as water spilled downstream this represents the damming impact under the maximum possible agriculture and industry water uses the actual impact will be much smaller especially when considering optimized dam operation to minimize the deficit of the economic and environmental impacts pulido velazquez et al 2008 therefore considering more scenarios in our framework would result in a more comprehensive evaluation of possible damming impacts locally and downstream 5 3 comparing with similar studies the overall increased runoff prediction in the ytr catchment under the future climate is supported by other studies li et al 2013 found that majority of 20 cmip3 models show the increased trend in precipitation resulting in noticeable increase in runoff in the middle reaches of the ytr catchment with the major increase occurring in wet season from may to september it is noted that the future period li et al 2013 used is 2046 2065 which is slightly different from the period of 2049 2075 used in this study similar results were indicated by wijngaard et al 2017 they found that for easternmost upstream headwaters of the brahmaputra i e ytr catchment large increases in runoff are projected under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 this is mainly caused by increases in precipitation and partly also to increases in snowmelt their future climate scenarios are based on the periods of 2011 2100 5 4 implications of this study under warmer climate potential evaporation in the brahmaputra river basin would dramatically increase under the projected climate scenarios by cmip5 models figs s2 s3 this would have negative or reducing impact on streamflow however this impact on streamflow is much smaller than the positive increasing impact by the increased precipitation as shown in fig 6b this is understandable since precipitation is the dominant factor in controlling streamflow annual variability chiew 2006 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2001 zheng et al 2009 in the spillage scenario shown in section 2 4 it is highly possible that damming results in small or negligible spillage in dry years and or dry months which could damage ecological services of river reaches and threaten local sustainability mcmahon et al 2007 richter and thomas 2007 in drought years the proportion of water retained by the dams is higher with less spillage to reaches below the dam which could exacerbate the negative impact on the aquatic ecosystem near downstream to maintain healthy river environment and achieve sustainable economic development therefore it is not sustainable to have high intensity irrigation cropland development on all dam catchments high intensity industrial and domestic water use could seriously deteriorate ecological service for laluo and manla dam catchments it is noted that dams investigated herein were only selected from the tributaries where dam functions include not only hydropower but also irrigation industrial and domestic uses furthermore there are four hydropower purpose only dams jie xu leng da zang mu and zong da located on the main ytr stream which were not included in our study since their modification of natural flow regime is limited at sub daily to daily scales richter and thomas 2007 therefore it is expected that their impact on monthly to annual streamflow analysed in our study is very minimal botter et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 under the climate scenarios projected by cmip5 models the tributary dams on the tibetan plateau would have marginal impact on freshwater reliability under warmer climate which could have small impact on socio economic systems and ecosystems on downstream brahmaputra palmer et al 2015 poff et al 2016 powers et al 2016 wang et al 2016 but the dams could have substantial negative local consequences under high local water demands our results provide the first cumulative dam impact analysis along this large transboundary river system where water information is highly sensitive and not well shared yeophantong 2017 without such an ensemble modelling framework it is impossible to improve downstream and upstream coordination for sustainable water management within brb and other similar large river systems mei et al 2015 poff et al 2016 6 conclusions damming changes flow magnitude and regime along a river which can attract a lot of attention for transboundary rivers since they are shared by multiple jurisdictions to support the urgent and constructive dialogues among the stakeholders along the transboundary rivers it is critical to provide proper and effective water information underpinning regional sustainable water management this is however hampered in a data sparse region with complex topographic and unique hydrogeological features such as the tibetan plateau to this end we develop a coupled framework to assess cumulative impacts of damming on downstream water availability for data sparse regions under historical and future climate scenarios the framework has been successfully applied to in the brahmaputra river basin the modelling results show that five recently constructed dams on the southeastern tibetan plateau can result in 8 11 maximum reduction of mean annual streamflow at outlet of brahmaputra river and the decreased impacts of damming would be largely offset by runoff increases under the future climate scenarios this work should be further extended and explored our framework can be easily applied to other transboundary rivers for the cumulative evaluation of the maximum possible damming impact furthermore more scenarios relating to dam operations such as optimization trying to minimize the deficit of the economic and environmental impacts can be applied for different streams of the transboundary rivers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of

6369,damming is one of the major methods that human being secure reliable freshwater it can change flow magnitude and regime along a river particularly for transboundary rivers shared by multiple jurisdictions this study develops a coupled framework to assess both the current and future cumulative impacts of damming on downstream water availability for data sparse regions like the tibetan plateau the framework is applied to the brahmaputra river basin brb where dam developments on the tibetan plateau are highly concerned the results show that despite being part of the asian water tower the yarlung tsangpo river ytr contributes just 15 16 to brahmaputra streamflow for 48 of its contributing area we found that the maximum impact due to five recently constructed dams in ytr suggests about 8 11 reduction of mean annual streamflow at outlet of brahmaputra river the impacts of damming would be largely offset by runoff increases under the climate scenarios projected by 28 cmip5 model outputs from rcp4 5 median level emission scenarios and 29 cmip5 model outputs from rcp8 5 high level emission scenarios for the period of 2049 to 2075 compared to the historical period of 1979 to 2005 our results suggest that it is necessary to use our framework or a similar one to comprehensively evaluate the maximum possible damming impact across the transboundary rivers keywords cumulative impact damming rainfall runoff modelling water availability climate change rivers 1 introduction the construction of dams to secure water for consumptive uses hydro electricity and flood mitigation is undertaken worldwide donchyts et al 2016 pekel et al 2016 timpe and kaplan 2017 the effect of changing flow regimes and water availability along a river could have adverse consequences for downstream users including the environment palmer et al 2015 poff et al 2016 powers et al 2016 wang et al 2016 yeophantong 2017 where a water source is shared by multiple jurisdictions engineering of streamflow by an upstream state that affects the access to water of downstream states is often a major source of transboundary conflict nilsson et al 2005 the nile river jordan river colorado river and mekong river are some well known examples of transboundary contested water resources the brahmaputra river br is one of the six major rivers that rise on the tibetan plateau tp dubbed the water tower of asia immerzeel and bierkens 2012 immerzeel et al 2010 it flows from china into india then bangladesh where it meets the ganges river before entering the bay of bengal the river is the major water source for hundreds of millions of people in india and bangladesh since 2000 china has undertaken construction of five multi purpose dams in the upper part of the catchment i e yarlung tsangpo river ytr catchment which is the social and economic center on the tibetan plateau the main purpose of the dams are designed for hydropower and irrigation particularly for industrial and domestic uses in china supplementary information text s3 some public media concerned that these dams could impact water supply to northeast india and bangladesh bbc com 2016 dailymail co uk 2016 thehindu com 2016 while it is also reported that there would be little impacts upon downstream flows chinadaily com cn 2010 one of the underlying reasons of the conflicts in addressing the impacts of damming is that there is no sufficient water information available across the brb for comprehensive interpretation for proper and effective water information sharing and coordination underpinning regional sustainable water management poff et al 2016 more solid scientific evidences are required to support the urgent and constructive dialogues among the stakeholders along the river yeophantong 2017 however how the tibetan damming impacts runoff locally and the downstream brb remains unknown this study tries to fill the knowledge gap for this transboundary river another unique motivation of this study is to have solid hydrological simulations in the tp a data sparse region with complex topographic and unique hydrogeological features korup and montgomery 2008 mishra 2015 therefore it is challenging to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics and distribution of streamflow which is required to evaluate the impacts of damming the assessment becomes more challenging when taking into account that the tp has experienced three time higher air temperature increase than the global average over the last 30 years duan and xiao 2015 zhong et al 2011 with the rapidly changed climate large change in future streamflow is expected in the tp and surrounding areas gain et al 2011 immerzeel et al 2010 2013 li et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 this will have noticeable impact on regional water availability across the brb to understand the compounded forces from damming and climate change require new framework that have a solid parameterisation scheme that simulates well spatiotemporal dynamics and distribution of streamflow in the brb to understand damming impact on catchment runoff under future climate it needs to downscale key climate variables such as precipitation that is projected from global climate models such as the cmip5 the fifth phase of the coupled model inter comparison project models moss et al 2010 taylor et al 2012 methods for downscaling climate variables include empirical statistical and dynamical approaches chiew et al 2010 collados lara et al 2018 fowler et al 2007 räty et al 2014 frost et al 2011 recommend the empirical approach for regional water resource planning applications primarily because of the method s robustness this study uses the empirical downscaling method to generate the future climate scenarios for the brb using an empirical scaling factor defined as the change in future climate condition relative to current or historical climatology where cmip5 simulations for the 1976 2005 period define the historical climatology and for 2046 2075 the future climatology the main objective of this study is to develop a new framework to assess damming impacts accumulating along the river under current and projected future climate scenarios for data sparse region the framework is underpinned by coupling reservoir model with a parsimonious grid based gr4j snow hydrological model developed from the lumped version li et al 2013 and tailored to account for snowmelt and glacier melt the ensemble simulation schemes are applied to represent the uncertainty due to regionalization of model parameterization i e how to transfer parameters from catchments to each grid cell and future climate projections immerzeel and bierkens 2012 2 materials and methods 2 1 framework of damming impact assessment sensible assessment of cumulative impacts of damming requires credible prediction of runoff across the basin moreover for runoff prediction at the data sparse regions like tp a robust prediction strategy needs to account for the uncertainty in hydrologic model parameters their regionalization and future climate projections with the consideration of all these issues a new framework of damming impact assessment is presented in fig 1 as can be seen in the framework the corner stone is the coupling hydrological model with reservoir water balance model where the uncertainty of hydrological prediction is accounted for on the basis of monte carlo simulations details of the framework are introduced in the following sections from 2 2 to 2 4 2 2 hydrological model 2 2 1 model description and inputs the hydrological model used in the study is gr4j snow li et al 2014 which couples the original gr4j model perrin et al 2003 with a simple degree day snow module the original gr4j is a 4 parameter rainfall runoff model that has been widely used in europe asia and australia lacombe et al 2008 oudin et al 2008 vaze et al 2011 fig 2 it has two model parameters that define the capacities of the runoff production and routing stores one that specifies the groundwater exchange coefficient and a fourth that defines the time base of the unit hydrograph the snow module of the gr4j snow is adopted from the soil water and assessment tool swat in the snow module precipitation falls as snow and accumulates in the catchment when daily mean air temperature is below 0 c snowmelt occurs when the air temperature is above 0 5 c and is a linear function of the difference between the average snow pack maximum air temperature and the threshold temperature i e 0 5 c sublimation of snow is part of the estimated daily potential evaporation and when it occurs according to neitsch et al 2011 the amount of sublimation is removed from snow pack to meet evaporation demand daily snowmelt contributes to interception soil moisture groundwater and catchment streamflow stores and pathways fig 2 the snow module has three model parameters which define the snow temperature lag a snow coverage factor and a melt factor the melting factor allows seasonal variation represented by a sinusoidal function and the extent of snow coverage represented by an areal depletion curve a more detailed description of swat snowmelt equations can be found in neitsch et al 2011 the gr4j snow is a spatially explicit model for which model inputs and parameters for each grid cells are unique model parameters are obtained using a parameterization approach described in section 2 2 3 runoff is calculated on every grid cell and results are aggregated to obtain predictions of catchment streamflow for comparison against streamflow observations the gr4j snow model differentiates initial states at each grid cell based on glacier location and coverage area at each grid cell an initial water equivalent depth of snow is set up as follows 200 mm for the non glacier part and 10 m for the glacier part furthermore the first three years were used to warm up gr4j snow this makes sure that the initial snow depth has negligible influence on regions without snow cover and more importantly glaciers can consistently contribute to streamflow which is important in the northeastern and central parts of the brahmaputra river basin brb fig 3 we assume that the glacier area ratio at each grid cell is fixed within the simulation period since the change in the glacier area is uncertain and lack of observation support schaner et al 2012 inputs to the gr4j snow model are 0 1 resolution of daily precipitation potential evaporation minimum and maximum air temperature and existing monthly leaf area index and glacier coverage area the orientation of the terrain is not considered in this study all of these datasets were obtained from meteorological and vegetation data products except daily potential evaporation daily potential evaporation was calculated using the mass transfer method that relates potential evaporation to vapor pressure deficit and wind speed hanasaki et al 2008 and requires air temperature specific humidity air pressure wind speed shortwave radiation and longwave radiation inputs which came from regional and global forcing datasets see section 3 2 2 2 model calibration and parameterization the gr4j snow model was run on a daily time step over a modeling domain of 527 840 km2 at a grid resolution of 0 1 the model was calibrated against mean monthly streamflow data at each of 11 catchments for the period 1979 to 1999 10 located in the ytr catchment and one in the lower brb fig 4 the model was warmed up with an initial repeat of the first three years 1979 1981 streamflow data after 1999 were not used for model calibration because construction of the first of the five dams was completed in 2000 with others completed or still to be completed since then table 1 a genetic algorithm an automated global optimisation method was used to calibrate the gr4j snow model the objective of the calibration is to best reproduce the observed mean monthly streamflow which was done by minimising the objective function li et al 2014 viney et al 2009 1 f 1 1 n s e 5 ln 1 b i a s 2 5 where nse is the model efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 estimated by 2 nse 1 i 1 m q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 m q obs i q obs 2

of the observed monthly streamflow i is the ith month with m the total number of months equal to 12 the nse measures the agreement between the modelled and observed monthly values with nse 1 0 indicating perfect agreement between the modelled and observed monthly streamflow the bias measures the water balance error between modelled and observed mean monthly streamflow with bias 0 indicating overprediction of streamflow by the model and bias 0 indicating model underprediction 2 2 3 parameterisation and ensemble simulation we developed a new approach for parameterising the gr4j snow at the grid scale based on the widely used similarity approach for parameterising hydrological models at both catchment blöschl et al 2013 parajka et al 2005 zhang and chiew 2009a b and grid cell li and zhang 2017 scales the similarity paramerisation was undertaken for each grid cell in the modelling domain to characterize the uncertainty inherent in model parameterization over large areas with limited observation data 10 000 simulations were undertaken from which the 1 best reproducing observed streamflow were used to model the impacts on local and regional flows of five new dams in the ytr catchment under a range of climate scenarios for the periods 1979 2005 and 2049 2075 in the similarity approach the set of parameter values from a calibrated donor catchment are transferred to a target ungauged catchment or grid cell based on their physical similarity including climate the approach used here is summarised as five steps 1 select similarity attributes distance mean annual precipitation potential evaporation temperature combination of elevation and latitude impacts and leaf area index were selected to represent the characteristics at both catchment and grid cell scales 2 quantify attributes for calibration catchments for each of the 11 calibration catchments the similarity attributes were aggregated from its internal grid cells 3 build similarity indices for determining the most similar catchment for predicting streamflow from each grid we calculate a similarity index for each attribute as 4 si j i 1 n w i i i j i i t 2 i i t where sij is the similarity index for the donor catchment j i is the ith attribute from a total n attributes in this case n 5 w i is an attribute weighting 0 1 an unknown parameter obtained in step 4 and the sum of w i equals to 1 with higher w i meaning the ith attribute more important ii t is the value for the ith attribute for the target grid cell t and ii j is the aggregated value for the ith attribute for the jth donor catchment since ii t is not available for geographic distance i i j i i t 2 i i t is replaced by d the euclidean distance between grid and catchment latitude longitude centroids 4 estimate attribute weighting w i monte carlo simulations were conducted to generate 10 000 sets of weightings for the five similarity attributes which were then applied to eq 4 to generate 10 000 sets of optimised parameters for each grid cell 5 select the best 1 of weighting sets the 10 000 simulations were evaluated against the mean monthly streamflow data at the 11 gauging stations and the best 1 i e 100 model runs were selected for ensemble simulation at each 0 1 resolution grid cell fig 1 2 3 reservoir water balances we used the concept of extended deficit analysis eda mcmahon et al 2007 thomas and adebayo 2005 to estimate the reliability level given a designed reservoir capacity of which the dynamic water balance is expressed as 5 s t 1 m i n s t r t d t p t et t c where st 1 and st is the reservoir storages at month t and t 1 respectively c is the reservoir capacity rt is inflow at month t obtained from the hydrological model dt is dam catchment water demand including agricultural and industrial and domestic water demand and pt and ett are precipitation and evaporation from reservoir water body at month t respectively the water body evaporation is taken as potential evaporation estimated from the energy balance based method hanasaki et al 2008 agricultural water demand is estimated as the difference between potential evaporation minus precipitation for maximum future arable crop land area in crop growing season may to october table 1 the arable crop land is selected from the area with slope less than 20 calculated from 3 sec digital elevation data see second 3 assuming the maximum irrigation conduction or the largest of possible impacts future industrial and general water demand is estimated as 15 agricultural water demand obtained from the tibetan autonomous region scale indication changjiang press 2015 and is evenly distributed to each month we assume that both water demands are consumed within dam catchment and without return flow back to its downstream when st 1 is negative it means that the storage together with the inflow cannot meet the monthly water demand indicating failure of the reservoir and it is set to zero for the following step 2 4 dam impact scenarios the dam impact on a downstream sector is defined as the ratio of the deducted streamflow i e the streamflow retained by upstream reservoirs to the natural streamflow from no damming the ratio of 0 means no impact no reduction of streamflow the ratio of 1 means 100 impact streamflow is all retained by upstream reservoir to investigate the cumulative impacts of damming we have calculated the impact ratio consecutively for river sections downstream the reservoirs the cumulative impacts of damming are assessed for two operating scenarios of the reservoirs no spilling and spilling on the basis of reservoir capacity 1 no spilling all streamflow generated from each dam catchment is retained within the catchment and there is no water spilled downstream naturally this represents the maximum dam impact scenario bottom left and bottom right panels in fig 1 and 2 spilling agriculture and industry water uses dt reach limit as explained in section 2 2 and water spilled downstream is the residue from reservoir water balances eq 5 this scenario represents the maximum possible impact with dam operation two bottom central panels in fig 1 it is important to note that this study attempts to represent the maximum possible agriculture and industry water uses instead of the actual usage 3 data we used the state of the art meteorological forcing precipitation minimum air temperature and maximum air temperature downward long wave radiation downward short wave radiation wind speed and vapor pressure data and vegetation data for the ytr catchment daily aggregated from 3 h west forcing data at 0 1 0 1 grid resolution were used the west precipitation data for china were produced by merging 1000 china meteorological administration station data and trmm satellite precipitation analysis data 3b42 he and yang 2011 yang et al 2006 the west forcing data do not cover the lower brb where we used 0 25 0 25 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017 together with 0 5 0 5 wfdei climate forcing other than precipitation data weedon et al 2014 the west precipitation data performs noticeably better than mswep plus wfdei data for streamflow simulation in the ytr catchment supplementary information text s1 the 0 0833 resolution half monthly leaf area index data was obtained from the boston university zhu et al 2013 for consistency the 0 05 0 0833 and 0 5 resolution data were resampled to 0 1 for ensemble simulation future climate scenarios were generated using the combined climate forcing data together with scaling factors obtained from empirical downscaling fowler et al 2007 of 30 available cmip5 models taylor et al 2012 28 gcms for rcp4 5 and 29 gcms for rcp8 5 the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 represent middle level and high level emissions projections which represent radiative forcings of 4 5 and 8 5 w m2 in the year 2100 relative to pre industrial values emissions in rcp4 5 peak around 2040 and then decline while emissions in rcp8 5 continue to rise throughout the 21st century the future precipitation temperature and potential evaporation forcings were generated by scaling up the historical observations using scaling factors derived from the cmip5 models this empirical approach is simple but robust and widely used for regional water resource planning applications chiew et al 2010 fowler et al 2007 zheng et al 2018 details for the cmip5 models and downscaling are summarized in supplementary information text s2 frost et al 2011 moss et al 2010 the monthly streamflow data used for model calibration and simulation were from two sources for the 10 gauges located within the ytr catchment streamflow data were originally observed by the tibetan hydrological bureau but obtained from the hydrological annuals compiled by the ministry of water resources china for the gauge of bahadurabad located in bangladesh streamflow data were obtained from dai et al 2009 it is noted that streamflow data from indian gauges are not publically available the glacier dataset was obtained from the glacier database of global land ice measurements from space project http www glims org raup et al 2007 this dataset includes glacier coverage provided in vector data format i e the esri shapefiles it was then converted into percentage data at 0 1 resolution areas of the dam catchments the reservoir water bodies and the entire brb were delineated from the shuttle radar topography mission 3 arc second digital elevation data provided by the united states geological survey usgs 2000 half monthly leaf area index measurements between 1981 and 2012 derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr ndvi data were obtained from boston university zhu et al 2013 these data have a spatial resolution of 0 0833 8 km the 1981 values were used for 1979 and 1980 since 1995 five major dams have been constructed or are under construction on tributaries of the ytr table 1 the main purposes of these dam are for generating hydropower irrigation and water supply their combined contributing area is about 27 8 103 km2 about 11 of the total yrb area the manla woka zhikong and pangduo dams were completed in 2001 2000 2007 and 2015 respectively laluo is expected to be finished in 2020 the total designed capacity for the five dams is 1956 gl of which pangduo dam accounts for 63 4 results 4 1 model calibration and ensemble predictions table 2 summarises performance of gr4j snow model for the model calibration and 100 ensemble simulations under historical climate inputs from 1979 to 1999 as measured by the nse and model bias the gr4j snow model is well calibrated with nse varying from 0 75 to 0 99 and the model bias is less than 6 for all 11 catchments compared to the model calibration results the 100 ensemble predictions selected from 10 000 parameterisations see section 2 2 3 are slightly degraded but with overall good performance in terms of predicting mean monthly streamflow with the nse values varying from the minimum of 0 59 at lazi to the maximum of 0 98 at bahadurabad fig 4 further shows the mean monthly streamflow variation of the measured and predicted at the11 gauging stations the model bias ranges from a 24 underprediction low boundary at gongbujiangda to a 42 overprediction upper boundary at rikaze the median model runs perform very well with the nse ranging from 0 83 to 0 98 and the bias varying from 21 to 21 the narrow range of results in each ensemble indicates consistent estimate of monthly streamflow with high confidence for the following results analysis the gr4j snow estimates show clear seasonality of snowmelt and glacier melt contributions fig 5 the streamflow contribution from modelled snow and glacier melt varies between 20 and 40 in the ytr catchment in april to june and is less than 15 in other months this result is largely consistent with the simulations in this region or nearby regions chen et al 2017 jeelani et al 2012 lutz et al 2014 schaner et al 2012 it is noted that there exists high uncertainty to partition streamflow components because of complex hydrological nature in this region chen et al 2017 wang et al 2017 and there is no available data to validate the partitioning at the ytr catchment especially that from glacier melt 4 2 streamflow in the baseline period and projected change in the baseline period between 1979 and 2005 the median estimate of mean annual streamflow from these 100 simulations ranged from less than 25 mm year 1 in the northwest to more than 3000 mm year 1 in southeast of the brb fig 6 a streamflow generation in the ytr catchment including the catchments where the five dams are located is substantially lower than in the lower brb i e regions other than the ytr catchment the range of future climate scenarios represented in the analysis includes 28 cmip5 model outputs from rcp4 5 median level emission scenarios and 29 model outputs from rcp8 5 high level emission scenarios taylor et al 2012 supplementary information text s2 which with the 100 parameterizations of the hydrological model results in 2800 and 2900 unique parameterisations for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively under the rcp8 5 fig 6b and to a similar extent rcp4 5 fig s1 futures annual streamflow is projected to increase across most of the brb mainly because of the projected increase in precipitation across most of the region under a warmer climate supplementary information text s2 3 s2 4 4 3 damming impact under the baseline climate the maximum possible interception is that all streamflow are retained by reservoirs section 2 4 and can be quantified using the ratio of streamflow generated within the dam catchments to that from the ytr catchment or brb the contributing areas to the five dams represent 10 9 of the ytr and 5 2 of the brb while their combined streamflow contribution median of 8921 gl year 1 is estimated at 8 11 of ytr streamflow fig 7 a or 1 3 1 5 of brb streamflow fig 7a thus these catchments are relatively poor contributors to flow in the brahmaputra river and yield at or below the average for the ytr catchment fig 7b in practical operation streamflow from the dammed catchments will spill downstream when the reservoir is at full capacity section 2 4 a commonly used reservoir model eq 5 was used to estimate the maximum possible volume of water retained by each reservoir and spillage to determine the potential seasonal and annual cumulative impacts downstream see sections 2 2 and 2 3 the annual cumulative impacts along the tributaries and main river channel are further quantified by including and not including dam operation scenarios respectively fig 8 a and b under the baseline the cumulative impact without including dam spillage i e representing most possible impact along the ytr is about double of that including dam spillage the large impact is observed near downstream of laluo and manla dams the annual impact on xiabuqu river varies in 30 80 from laluo dam to its confluence with main ytr course the degree of impact could be higher than 80 for reaches from manla dam to the nyang qu river confluence but diminish rapidly when flow is diluted from upper reach of nyang qu river the pangduo and zhikong dams have up to 50 impacts on lhasa river which further extend to the main ytr channel with the inflow from downstream tributaries the cumulative impacts are less than 10 after the confluence of nyang river and ytr less than 5 at the ytr outlet and less than 1 along the far downstream brahmaputra river the dams show to have seasonality effects on the downstream flows depending on the catchment the wet season commences between april and june and ends around november with peak streamflow in august between april and july depending on the catchment the dams are predicted to intercept all their inflows with spilling occurring once the dams are full in june and july figs 9 a c and s5 s8 downstream of pangduo zhikong and woka dams this could mean periods of no flow in the dry season there is no spillage predicted from the laluo and manla dams at pangduo zhikong and woka dams there are noticeable median volume of spillage predicted in the dry season supplementary information text s3 1 the implications of these reductions in the reaches downstream of the reservoirs depend on downstream demand and environmental water requirements and the extent to which these requirements are specific objectives of dam operations 4 4 damming impact under future climate under the modelled climate futures the median mean annual streamflow from the dam catchments increases by 1660 gl year 1 or 18 6 for rcp4 5 and 1772 gl year 1 or 19 3 for rcp8 5 the combined relative contribution to the ytr and lower brb is also expected to noticeably increase compared to the baseline contribution fig 7a and b the predicted increases in streamflow in the ytr catchment and lower brb are noticeably higher than the combined baseline streamflow generated from the catchments at five dams fig 7c under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the median increases in the ytr flow are 13 478 gl year 1 and 11 347 gl year 1 respectively which are 1 5 and 1 3 times of the combined streamflow from the five dam catchment under median estimates under the two future climate conditions much more median streamflow increases are projected in the low brb which are 4 1 and 5 6 times of the combined dam catchment streamflow this result indicates that even if all the streamflow generated in the dam catchments is intercepted by the dams and this streamflow loss is likely to be lower than the increase in streamflow in the rest of the ytr catchment and lower brb in the future the median combined spillage from the five reservoirs under the baseline is 4662 gl year 1 which represents a 52 water release downstream with the predicted streamflow increases under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the median volume of spillage increases to 5648 gl year 1 63 and 5921 gl year 1 66 respectively the projected impacts in the wetter futures under rcp8 5 are noticeably smaller than the baseline simulations since more downstream reaches are with less than 1 impact in the futures fig 10 a and b and similar results are under rcp4 5 supplementary information text s3 2 to further investigate monthly cumulative impact along the ytr and brahmaputra river we choose two severely impacted months may and june when small amount of streamflow is generated and the majority or all of streamflow is used within the dam catchment fig 11 summarises the cumulative impacts in these two months under rcp8 5 without including dam spillages fig 11a the impact in these two months is higher than the annual average for the reaches where tributary contribution is small but is slightly smaller than the annual average along the downstream brahmaputra river reaches where there are strong tributary contribution though including dam spillages fig 11b shows less impact than that without dam spillages fig 11a it has an impacting rate higher than 70 in may to june for lhasa river where pangduo and zhikong dams locate on and it propagates to the downstream ytr and brahmaputra river furthermore similar but slightly eased cumulative impacts are also found under rcp4 5 supplementary information text s3 2 5 discussion 5 1 advantage and strength of this study most studies of large scale dam impacts on streamflow are carried out using regional or global hydrological models which normally use default parameters doll and zhang 2010 masaki et al 2017 2018 this will obviously result in large bias in some regions particularly in the data sparse regions a typical example is the tp that is featured by a complex topography where there are few precipitation and streamflow gauges installed which makes understanding the hydrological processes and changes in the tp catchments even harder li et al 2013 2014 mishra 2015 therefore it is challenging to have credible streamflow simulations and predictions across data sparse regions merz and bloschl 2004 more importantly the most available studies only tackle the issue of dam impacts on the whole catchment or river system ahn et al 2018 arrigoni et al 2010 timpe and kaplan 2017 in lots of cases it requires cumulative impact analysis along the river system this is particularly important for the transboundary river such as brb where multiple jurisdictions share river water source the cumulative impact analysis will provide transparent water information for the countries who have interests for the first time we developed a framework that combined model calibration gridded parameterization and simulation uncertainty analysis and cumulative dam impact on downstream streamflow under different climate change scenarios the hydrological model calibrations and simulations were carried out by using 1 regional model calibrations parajka et al 2007 2 parameterisation building on monte carlo simulations demaria et al 2007 seibert 1999 and hydroclimatic similarity parajka et al 2013 razavi and coulibaly 2013 zhang and chiew 2009a b and 3 ensembles from possible climate change scenario inputs chiew et al 2010 mcintyre et al 2005 singh et al 2011 zheng et al 2018 methods section they have following advantages correspondingly including 1 consistent model performance across a large modelling domain 2 maximised regionalisation information obtained from daily streamflow time series climate and vegetation data and 3 fully considered uncertainty from climate change inputs therefore our modelling results in terms of nse are reliable as demonstrated in fig 3 and table 2 the results in term of nse are also comparable to those obtained for data dense regions such as europe parajka et al 2007 and australia li and zhang 2017 zhang and chiew 2009a b furthermore our modelling framework has great potential for global streamflow predictions across ungauged catchments beck et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 5 2 study limitations this study has following limitations first there are limited available streamflow data for calibrating hydrological model gr4j snow there are only 11 catchments where streamflow data are available in the brb 10 located in the ytr catchment and 1 located in the downstream brb this would potentially influence runoff simulation accuracy in the downstream brb more streamflow data should allow for robust validation of gr4j snow in different parts of the brb furthermore there are 18 years of streamflow data 1982 1999 used for model calibrations with the first three years 1979 1981 for model warm up it is possible that the streamflow series employed to calibrate thehydrologicalmodel are not long enough for representing a stationary hydrological condition second this study employed a scaling factor to perform the climate forcing downscaling which only produces a correction of the mean in accordance with future projections we do not consider potential changes in the standard deviation or other statistics that may be important to assess the impacts of the damming pulido velazquez et al 2011 third this study uses the temperature to estimate snowmelt contributed runoff temperature is taken into account in the simple degree day snow module to estimate snowmelt there are other climatic variables that can also influence the snowmelt process such as relative humidity insolation and wind speed including these variables could result in more accurate estimates of snowmelt contributed runoff however compared to the temperature including other variables into the snowmelt module could also large uncertainty for predicting trends in snowmelt under the future climate scenarios such as wind speed mcinnes et al 2011 and insolation lee et al 2016 further investigation is required to quantifying the uncertainty related to the various climate forcing data fourth this study only considers two dam operation scenarios no spilling and spilling under no spilling scenario there is no water spilled downstream naturally and all streamflow generated from each dam catchment is retained which represents the maximum possible impact under spilling scenario maximum agriculture and industry water uses are reached and the residue from reservoir water balances is considered as water spilled downstream this represents the damming impact under the maximum possible agriculture and industry water uses the actual impact will be much smaller especially when considering optimized dam operation to minimize the deficit of the economic and environmental impacts pulido velazquez et al 2008 therefore considering more scenarios in our framework would result in a more comprehensive evaluation of possible damming impacts locally and downstream 5 3 comparing with similar studies the overall increased runoff prediction in the ytr catchment under the future climate is supported by other studies li et al 2013 found that majority of 20 cmip3 models show the increased trend in precipitation resulting in noticeable increase in runoff in the middle reaches of the ytr catchment with the major increase occurring in wet season from may to september it is noted that the future period li et al 2013 used is 2046 2065 which is slightly different from the period of 2049 2075 used in this study similar results were indicated by wijngaard et al 2017 they found that for easternmost upstream headwaters of the brahmaputra i e ytr catchment large increases in runoff are projected under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 this is mainly caused by increases in precipitation and partly also to increases in snowmelt their future climate scenarios are based on the periods of 2011 2100 5 4 implications of this study under warmer climate potential evaporation in the brahmaputra river basin would dramatically increase under the projected climate scenarios by cmip5 models figs s2 s3 this would have negative or reducing impact on streamflow however this impact on streamflow is much smaller than the positive increasing impact by the increased precipitation as shown in fig 6b this is understandable since precipitation is the dominant factor in controlling streamflow annual variability chiew 2006 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2001 zheng et al 2009 in the spillage scenario shown in section 2 4 it is highly possible that damming results in small or negligible spillage in dry years and or dry months which could damage ecological services of river reaches and threaten local sustainability mcmahon et al 2007 richter and thomas 2007 in drought years the proportion of water retained by the dams is higher with less spillage to reaches below the dam which could exacerbate the negative impact on the aquatic ecosystem near downstream to maintain healthy river environment and achieve sustainable economic development therefore it is not sustainable to have high intensity irrigation cropland development on all dam catchments high intensity industrial and domestic water use could seriously deteriorate ecological service for laluo and manla dam catchments it is noted that dams investigated herein were only selected from the tributaries where dam functions include not only hydropower but also irrigation industrial and domestic uses furthermore there are four hydropower purpose only dams jie xu leng da zang mu and zong da located on the main ytr stream which were not included in our study since their modification of natural flow regime is limited at sub daily to daily scales richter and thomas 2007 therefore it is expected that their impact on monthly to annual streamflow analysed in our study is very minimal botter et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 under the climate scenarios projected by cmip5 models the tributary dams on the tibetan plateau would have marginal impact on freshwater reliability under warmer climate which could have small impact on socio economic systems and ecosystems on downstream brahmaputra palmer et al 2015 poff et al 2016 powers et al 2016 wang et al 2016 but the dams could have substantial negative local consequences under high local water demands our results provide the first cumulative dam impact analysis along this large transboundary river system where water information is highly sensitive and not well shared yeophantong 2017 without such an ensemble modelling framework it is impossible to improve downstream and upstream coordination for sustainable water management within brb and other similar large river systems mei et al 2015 poff et al 2016 6 conclusions damming changes flow magnitude and regime along a river which can attract a lot of attention for transboundary rivers since they are shared by multiple jurisdictions to support the urgent and constructive dialogues among the stakeholders along the transboundary rivers it is critical to provide proper and effective water information underpinning regional sustainable water management this is however hampered in a data sparse region with complex topographic and unique hydrogeological features such as the tibetan plateau to this end we develop a coupled framework to assess cumulative impacts of damming on downstream water availability for data sparse regions under historical and future climate scenarios the framework has been successfully applied to in the brahmaputra river basin the modelling results show that five recently constructed dams on the southeastern tibetan plateau can result in 8 11 maximum reduction of mean annual streamflow at outlet of brahmaputra river and the decreased impacts of damming would be largely offset by runoff increases under the future climate scenarios this work should be further extended and explored our framework can be easily applied to other transboundary rivers for the cumulative evaluation of the maximum possible damming impact furthermore more scenarios relating to dam operations such as optimization trying to minimize the deficit of the economic and environmental impacts can be applied for different streams of the transboundary rivers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of
