18100,river restoration with the use of in stream structures has been widely implemented to maintain improve physical habitats however the response of aquatic biota has often been too weak to justify the high costs of restoration projects the ecological effectiveness of river restoration has thus been much debated over claims that large scale environmental drivers often overshadow the potential positive ecological effects of locally placed in stream structures in this study we used a two dimensional hydrodynamic habitat model to evaluate the ecological effectiveness of habitat restoration with the use of in stream structures in various water discharges ranging from near dry to environmental flows the habitat suitability of benthic macroinvertebrates and of three cyprinid fish species was simulated for six restoration schemes and at four discharge scenarios and was compared with a reference model without in stream structures we found that the ecological response to habitat restoration varied by species and life stages it strongly depended on the reach scale flow conditions it was often negative at near environmental flows and when positive mostly at near dry flows it was too low to justify the high costs of river restoration flow variation was the major environmental driver that our local habitat restoration schemes attempted but mostly failed to fine tune we conclude that traditional river restoration based on trial and error will likely fail and should be ecologically pre optimized before field implementation widespread use of in stream structures for ecological restoration is not recommended however at near dry flows the response of all biotic elements except for macroinvertebrates was positive in combination with the small habitat suitability differences observed among structure types and densities we suggest that sparse moderate in stream structure placement can be used for cost effective river restoration but it will only be ecologically effective thus justifying the high implementation costs when linked to very specific purposes i to conserve endangered species and ii to increase improve habitat availability suitability during dry periods thus proactively preventing reducing the current and future ecological impacts of climate change graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquatic restoration habitat use habitat suitability droughts temporary rivers climate change 1 introduction the notion that healthy habitats support healthy biota which in turn support healthy human societies emerged after decades of uncontrolled human development that caused severe degradation in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems vörösmarty et al 2010 grizzeti et al 2017 degraded natural systems have hence been engineered to restore their hydrologic geomorphic and ecological processes wohl et al 2015 a practice that has been commonly termed ecological restoration in rivers restoration techniques vary from in stream interventions such as removal of man made structures that inhibit natural flow removal of barriers to fish passage installation of natural or artificial structures to enhance aquatic habitats to riparian or basin wide modifications land restoration flow diversions dam removal and erosion control rrc 2002 yochum 2018 among these methods the placement of engineered in stream structures that create pools modify channel morphology and increase habitat complexity has long been applied in habitat enhancement stewart et al 2009 weirs deflectors and cover structures made from root wads logs boulders and gravel are used to increase biota population density and improve ecosystem functioning roni et al 2005 although physical habitat is enhanced by the placement of in stream structures the relevant response of aquatic biota has been much debated it is not always positive it varies by species and life stages and when positive it is often weak roni et al 2005 thompson et al 2005 stewart et al 2009 palmer et al 2010 roni 2019 according to previous research on salmonids 70 of studies show increased abundance around engineered in stream structures while approx 7 28 of studies suggest no response and 7 18 show lower abundance in restored habitats stewart et al 2009 roni et al 2015 compared to pre restored conditions the positive salmonid responses around in stream structures increased population density abundance often range from 10 to 50 nevertheless increased abundances of up to 167 have also been reported whiteway et al 2010 roni et al 2015 for non salmonid species results range from no significant responses lonzarich and quinn 1995 to 90 increase in fish abundance density in restored habitats shields et al 1993 varying responses have also been observed for benthic macroinvertebrates miller et al 2010 according to roni et al 2015 approx 67 of studies suggest increased macroinvertebrate density around engineered in stream structures while 33 show similar or lower densities in restored habitats typically the positive macroinvertebrate responses are not higher than 28 of the pre restored conditions miller et al 2010 considering the high costs of river restoration ranging from 2 200 000 to 31 000 000 per km2 for european rivers ayres et al 2014 szałkiewicz et al 2018 weak positive ecological responses may not be enough to characterize a restoration project as successful thus ineffectiveness or failure in ecological restoration is a common outcome palmer et al 2014 swan and brown 2017 the reasons for failure have been well documented a multitude of environmental ecological and anthropogenic factors interact across temporal and spatial scales acting as filters to the effectiveness success of ecological restoration mika et al 2010 feld et al 2018 liao et al 2018 local habitat restoration in a degraded river basin may trigger no observable ecological response reach scale flow modification may also undermine the effectiveness of local habitat restoration dam induced flow regulation upstream of a restored river reach may reduce the positive ecological effect of locally placed in stream structures in addition catchment scale land use or the proximity to upstream and downstream populated areas are often not accounted prior to habitat restoration bernhardt et al 2005 it has been argued that local habitat conditions may not be the major driver of ecological processes for fish and benthic macroinvertebrates brown et al 2011 heino et al 2015 karaouzas et al 2019 within the concept of environmental filtering local habitat is accounted as a low level filter for the regional pool of aquatic species friberg et al 2016 it is thus considered that an optimized restored low level habitat filter will result in optimized local ecological processes given that higher level filters e g reach scale are also optimal stoll et al 2016 all the above suggest that ecological restoration should be carefully designed and pre optimized yet many restoration projects have often been implemented within a process of trial and error friberg et al 2016 without any mechanistic pre optimization that would connect decisions to objectives bandrowski et al 2015 to this end hydrodynamic habitat models hhms have been recently introduced in habitat restoration rrc 2017 in hhms a hydraulic hydrodynamic model simulates the water depths d and depth averaged flow velocities v at multiple discharges in a computational mesh papadaki et al 2016 papaioannou et al 2020 the values of v and d are compared with habitat criteria of aquatic biota to estimate the habitat suitability for each simulated discharge gopal 2013 species density abundance is thus related to habitat suitability which is ultimately related to restoration effectiveness habitat restoration with the use of in stream structures can be cost effectively optimized prior to actual implementation by simulating different structures and patterns densities of structure placement in various discharge scenarios aiming to find the most effective restoration scenario i e the one that yields maximum overall habitat suitability and thus maximum species densities for the reach under investigation adeva bustos et al 2019 in this paper we are not pioneering the use of hydrodynamic habitat models for designing effective ecological restoration projects this practice has been already incorporated into habitat restoration during the last decades brown and pasternack 2009 schwartz et al 2015 rrc 2017 rather this study highlights that the physical hydro morphological and ecological processes that ecological restoration attempts to control and optimize i are often too complex to be addressed within the traditional trial and error based river restoration schemes and ii they should be carefully designed and pre optimized within a mechanistic ecological framework before implementation to reach this conclusion we used a two dimensional hydrodynamic habitat model and simulated the hydrological hydraulic and habitat properties in a river reach for various habitat restoration schemes with the use of in stream structures at various discharge scenarios although case specific the results of the study are analyzed within a wider framework to emphasize that ecological restoration requires extensive yet cost effective pre optimization before being applied to real life to reach levels of effectiveness that will justify the high costs of restoration projects 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and topographic data the study area was a 443 m long reach approx 10 226 m2 in an intermittent mediterranean watercourse the evrotas river southern greece fig 1 a c the current study built upon a previous model based environmental flow assessment that was carried out in the same river reach theodoropoulos et al 2019 riverbed topography was mapped with 719 points recording longitude x latitude y and bottom elevation h using a real time kinematic rtk gps consisting of the spectra precision sp60 gnss receiver and the mobile mapper 10 gis gps receiver trimble inc usa the topographic data x y h points were afterwards imported into the blue kenue software chc 2011 and an unstructured triangular computational mesh was generated by linearly interpolating channel topography across the reach here we used the riverbed topography that was acquired during that previous research and the relevant generated mesh as a base model reference for designing simulating multiple in stream habitat restoration schemes in total we designed six habitat restoration schemes and modelled the habitat suitability for five biotic elements at four discharge q scenarios in total 24 hydrodynamic simulations 4 q scenarios x 6 habitat restoration schemes and 120 habitat simulations were applied 24 hydrodynamic simulations x 5 biotic elements to ultimately predict the habitat suitability at each node of the computational mesh of the study area for each habitat restoration scheme and at each discharge scenario fig 2 2 2 habitat restoration schemes two types of in stream structures were designed fig 1d and e i simple structures s representing wood logs single pieces 0 5 m in diameter and 10 m long placed on opposite sides of the channel in a downstream direction at an angle of 135 to the bank fig 1d ii complex structures c representing log jams two single pieces 0 5 m in diameter and 5 m long and six single pieces 0 5 m in diameter and 2 5 m long tied together in two quadruplets each quadruplet included a 5 m long piece combined with three 2 5 m long pieces placed on opposite sides of the channel two quadruplets per side in a downstream direction at an angle of 135 to the bank fig 1e the structure diameter and lengths were selected based on natural in stream wood structures that have been previously recorded in the study reach kalogianni et al 2020 the densest scheme included in stream structures that were placed immediately after the end of the recirculation zone created by the previous structure six habitat restoration schemes were developed based on the type of structure either simple or complex and the density pattern of the placed structures fig 2 1 s1 sparse simple structures evenly spaced at approx every 85 m 2 s2 moderate simple structures evenly spaced at approx every 42 5 m 3 s3 dense simple structures evenly placed at approx every 21 m 4 c1 sparse complex structures evenly spaced at every 85 m 5 c2 moderate complex structures evenly spaced at approx every 42 5 m 6 c3 dense complex structures evenly spaced at approx every 21 m for each habitat restoration scheme a different computational mesh was developed in blue kenue with the following properties s1 12 147 nodes 23 249 elements s2 12 601 nodes 24 159 elements s3 13 513 nodes 25 985 elements c1 14 982 nodes 29 035 elements c2 17 798 nodes 34 667 elements c3 23 105 nodes 45 281 elements all meshes were refined around the structures to obtain locally detailed hydrodynamic results 2 3 model calibration validation and hydrodynamic simulation the base model with no added in stream structures has been previously calibrated at q 0 008 m3 s 1 and validated at q 0 02 m3 s 1 and q 0 5 m3 s 1 theodoropoulos et al 2019 q was prescribed at the upstream boundary and water surface elevation z was prescribed at the downstream boundary based on a stage discharge curve developed using hydrological information from a nearby gauging station calibration and validation of the model were applied by adjusting the riverbed s roughness manning s n values until an acceptable correlation r2 0 85 between observed and simulated d and depth averaged v values was achieved it is considered that mesh changes occurring from the placement of in stream structures in already calibrated validated base models will produce equally accurate hydrodynamic simulations wheaton et al 2004 hafs et al 2014 as long as the computational mesh properties are based on the same topographic dataset and the same boundary conditions used in the base model for each habitat restoration scheme we used the telemac 2d v6 2 galland et al 1991 to simulate d and v in four q scenarios i environmental flow previously determined at q 1 m3 s 1 theodoropoulos et al 2019 ii 0 8 m3 s 1 iii 0 6 m3 s 1 and iv near dry conditions 0 02 m3 s 1 2 4 habitat preferences and habitat suitability curves the habitat preferences of benthic macroinvertebrates and of three endangered endemic fish species the evrotas chub squalius keadicus stephanidis 1971 the spartian minnowroach tropidophoxinellus spartiaticus schmidt ries 1943 and the evrotas minnow pelasgus laconicus kottelat and barbieri 2004 were used in this study to investigate differences among potential habitat restoration schemes and discharge scenarios for the larger bodied evrotas chub two size classes were recorded small total length tl 10 cm corresponding to juveniles and large tl 10 cm corresponding to adults thus four fish groups were studied adult chubs juvenile chubs minnowroaches and minnows fish habitat preferences were assessed using habitat preference curves hscs for flow velocity water depth and substrate type s theodoropoulos et al 2019 that were developed following the approach of bovee 1986 based on microhabitat data relating v d and s values to the abundance of each fish group habitat suitability in microhabitats with highest abundance was considered optimal and scored a value of 1 in the relevant suitability curve whereas the habitat suitability in lowest abundance microhabitats was considered lowest and scored a value of 0 with intermediate abundance values respectively scoring between 0 and 1 macroinvertebrate habitat preferences were assessed using the benthos gr dataset theodoropoulos et al 2018 consisting of 380 microhabitat observations that relate v d and s to a community metrics based habitat suitability index integrating number of families number of ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera families the shannon wiener diversity and the total macroinvertebrate abundance 2 5 habitat suitability modelling for each of the 24 hydrodynamic simulations and for each of the five biotic elements four fish groups benthic macroinvertebrates the habitat suitability preference was estimated at each node of the computational mesh of the study reach for three hydraulic parameters v d and s respectively the fish habitat suitability was calculated by converting the numerical values of v d and s of the hydrodynamic model to habitat suitability preference using the relevant habitat suitability curves then a combined habitat suitability was estimated as k k v k d k s 3 where k v velocity habitat suitability preference k d depth habitat suitability preference k s substrate habitat suitability preference for benthic macroinvertebrates a fuzzy rule based bayesian algorithm frb was implemented in the habfuzz software theodoropoulos et al 2016 the numerical values of v and d were converted to overlapping five class trapezoidal shaped membership functions fuzzy sets the k values were classified into five classes 0 bad 0 2 0 2 poor 0 4 0 4 moderate 0 6 0 6 good 0 8 0 8 high 1 each numerical value of v and d was assigned to one or more fuzzy sets with a membership degree ranging from 0 to 1 the type of substrate was treated as a crisp input and classified based on schneider et al 2010 the training dataset with a priori calculated k values was used to develop sets of data driven if then rules relating the input fuzzy sets with a specific k class the fuzzy membership degree md of each input variable v d and s was then considered as the probability of occurrence of the particular fuzzy set such as if v is low with a membership degree of 1 and d is moderate with a md of 1 and s is gravel with a md of 1 then k is high with a md of 0 3 and good with a md of 0 7 the if then rules were then combined using the bayesian joint probability so that referring to the previous example the probability of the specific microhabitat s k being high is the joint probability that v is low and d is moderate and s is gravel and k is high 1 x 1 x 1 x 0 3 0 3 while the probability of k being good is the joint probability that v is low and d is moderate and s is gravel and k is good 1 x 1 x 1 x 0 7 0 7 based on a utility function brookes et al 2010 a score was assigned to each k class bad 0 1 good 0 3 moderate 0 5 good 0 7 high 0 9 and the habitat suitability k at each node of the computational mesh was ultimately predicted as k m ij s ij where m ij denotes the joint probability of occurrence of each k class and s ij denotes the score of each k class for the previous example k equals to 0 7 x 0 9 0 3 x 0 7 0 84 high 2 6 effectiveness of habitat restoration to assess the effectiveness of each habitat restoration scheme for each biotic element at each q scenario we calculated the weighted usable area wua wua is an indicator of the available area m2 of the study reach that can be exploited by each biotic element by multiplying the k value of each node of the computational mesh with its relevant cell area and aggregating all values restoration effectiveness was then calculated based on the difference and the percent deviation between the wua of the base model without in stream structures and the wua of the habitat restoration schemes models increased wua positive change indicates positive ecological response and decreased wua negative change indicates negative ecological response the model based process described above ultimately resulted in the assessment of the effectiveness of the six habitat restoration schemes in four flow scenarios and for five biotic elements of the evrotas aquatic ecosystem this point forward habitat restoration schemes and flow scenarios are often combined as habitat restoration discharge scheme for example the c1 0 02 scheme indicates sparse complex in stream structures modelled in the q 0 02 m3 s 1 scenario while the base 0 6 scheme suggests q 0 6 m3 s 1 modelled without in stream structures 3 results 3 1 hydrological hydraulic variation the results indicate that water discharge was the primary factor that influenced the hydrodynamic simulations the habitat restoration schemes had a lower overall effect fig 3 supplementary material figs s1 and s2 three generic patterns of water flow hydraulic effects around the in stream structures were observed in the restored reach i the in stream structures deflected the flowing water causing the formation of new water pools either upstream or downstream of the structure depending on the higher level reach scale hydrodynamics ii the in stream structures modified the natural habitats by deepening and or widening already established water pools or by shallowing and or narrowing the pools downstream of the structures in a distance that often surpassed several nearby structures iii the in stream structures had no effect on the water depth the water overtopped the structures without any visible water depth change compared to the base model however the flow velocity field around the structures was often substantially modified the effect of habitat restoration was highest at the lower water discharges as water discharge increased most structures were overtopped by the flowing water ultimately the presence of in stream structures had an overall pool forming pool deepening widening and flow reducing hydraulic effect compared to the base model regardless of the habitat restoration scheme near dry water discharge q 0 02 m3 s 1 had the lowest v and d values vmax 0 79 ms 1 for the c3 0 02 scheme dmax 1 14 m for the s3 0 02 scheme as discharge increased from 0 02 m3 s 1 to 1 m3 s 1 v and d also increased reaching highest values at the base 1 vmax 1 89 ms 1 and the s3 1 schemes dmax 1 74 m respectively within the same water discharge the presence of in stream structures clearly influenced the local hydraulic conditions all habitat restoration schemes maintained increased water volume in the channel compared to the base model fig 3e and f the total additional water volume was highest in the c2 0 6 scheme 226 m3 and lowest in the c1 0 8 scheme 9 56 m3 maximum percent volume change was observed in the c3 0 02 scheme 14 and lowest in the s1 0 8 scheme 0 3 all habitat restoration schemes had higher water depths compared to the base model dmax 0 88 m ranging from 1 02 m 16 s2 0 02 scheme to 1 74 m 97 s3 1 scheme overall flow velocity decreased as in stream structures were added in q 1 m3 s 1 vmax decreased from 1 86 ms 1 base model to 1 55 ms 1 17 c3 scheme in q 0 02 m3 s 1 however the base model had the lowest vmax 0 56 ms 1 while the c3 scheme had vmax 0 79 ms 1 41 increase 3 2 habitat suitability and the effectiveness of habitat restoration the effects of river restoration on the weighted usable area were diverse varying by water discharge and biotic element fig 4 figs s3 s9 overall the response of all biotic elements to habitat restoration was often negative and when positive mostly at near dry flows it ranged from near zero to 28 6 maximum positive ecological response was observed in moderate and sparse habitat restoration schemes but the average wua change between densities was low approx 10 as was also the average change between simple and complex structures 10 the highest positive wua change was observed for the juvenile chub at the s2 0 02 restoration scheme 28 6 as discharge increased from q 0 02 m3 s 1 to q 0 6 m3 s 1 the positive effect of in stream structures on habitat suitability decreased and reached negative values in higher discharges 0 8 m3 s 1 and 1 m3 s 1 the highest negative wua change was observed for macroinvertebrates at the c3 1 restoration scheme 23 except for macroinvertebrates the wua change in near dry conditions q 0 02 m3 s 1 was positive for all biotic elements with higher changes being observed for low and moderate density restoration schemes s1 s2 c1 c2 the wua in q 0 6 m3 s 1 was either low 10 for macroinvertebrates minnowroaches juvenile and adult chubs or negative for minnows wua changes for q 0 8 m3 s 1 and 1 m3 s 1 for all restoration schemes examined were negative with the highest negative values being observed for macroinvertebrates wua differences among structures were not significant the average difference was approx 5 10 reaching a maximum of 15 for macroinvertebrates between the s1 0 02 and s2 0 02 schemes more specifically the placement of in stream structures had a positive effect on the wua of adult chubs at low flows q 0 02 m3 s 1 and q 0 6 m3 s 1 ranging from 4 c3 0 06 scheme to 16 c2 0 02 scheme and a negative effect at higher flows q 0 8 m3 s 1 and q 1 m3 s 1 ranging from 4 c2 0 8 scheme to 13 c3 1 scheme the same trend was observed for minnowroaches the positive low flow effect ranged from 4 s1 0 6 to 26 s2 0 02 and the negative high flow effect ranged from 2 c3 0 8 to 9 c1 0 8 the wua of juvenile chubs was positively influenced in near dry conditions ranging from 14 s3 0 02 to 28 6 s1 0 02 and negatively influenced in higher discharges ranging from 0 6 s1 1 to 9 c3 1 minnows also showed a similar response the positive low flow effect ranged from 8 s2 0 02 to 16 c2 0 02 and the negative high flow effect ranged from 4 c2 0 6 to 15 c2 0 8 the wua of macroinvertebrates was positively influenced only in q 0 6 m3 s 1 ranging from 3 7 s3 0 6 to 7 c1 0 6 and negatively influenced in near dry and higher flows ranging from 4 c1 0 8 to 23 c3 1 3 3 habitat use of fish and macroinvertebrates around in stream structures fish and benthic macroinvertebrates had varying responses to the placement of in stream structures depending on the particular hydraulic effect that was developed more specifically the same structure in the same location caused different hydraulic effects in every water discharge tested complex pool patterns were developed around complex structures compared to simple structures but the overall difference in the local habitat suitability for all biotic elements was low 3 3 1 fish response to in stream structure placement fish responses around in stream structures were typical of their life history strategies in near dry conditions q 0 02 m3 s 1 fish behavior was mostly influenced by water depth adult chubs minnowroaches and minnows preferred deeper slow flowing habitats water pools that were often developed or widened upstream or downstream of the structure and avoided shallow faster flowing habitats fig 5 fig a1 in contrast juvenile chubs avoided lentic conditions developed downstream of the structures the habitat suitability of juvenile chubs was higher in shallower and often faster flowing habitats fig 5 fig a1 as water discharge increased the influence of flow velocity on fish response increased minnowroaches and minnows avoided habitats of high flow velocity when water overtopped the in stream structures fig 6 fig a2 and preferred low flow habitats the habitat suitability of juvenile chubs was further reduced in deep water pools and increased in shallower fast flowing habitats in constrast adult chubs preffered the deeper and faster flowing conditions that were developed in higher discharges 3 3 2 response of macroinvertebrates to in stream structure placement overall the habitat suitability of benthic macroinvertebrates around in stream structures was low both at near dry and higher flow conditions ranging from 0 1 to 0 6 macroinvertebrates avoided the generic pool forming pool deepening fig 5 fig a1 and flow reducing hydraulic effects fig 6 fig a2 that were caused by the structures macroinvertebrate habitat suitability increased only in the rarely occuring cases when the presence of a structure reduced the water depth of an already estabilshed pool causing water to flow downstream or reduced both the water depth and the flow velocity in otherwise fast flowing deep habitats 4 discussion 4 1 river restoration based on trial and error is prone to failure the results of the study agree with previous research on river restoration the simulated ecological response to the placement of in stream structures varied by species and life stages in agreement with friberg et al 2016 it strongly depended on the reach scale flow conditions as previously reported by brown et al 2011 and heino et al 2015 it was often negative at q 0 6 m3 s 1 0 8 m3 s 1 and 1 m3 s 1 stewart et al 2009 and when positive mostly at near dry flows it was not large enough average 10 maximum 28 6 to justify the high costs of river restoration szałkiewicz et al 2018 we further found that flow variation may be a major driver filter of the response of biota to habitat restoration and thus of restoration effectiveness the reach scale flow variation did not only reduce the magnitude of positive ecological effects from locally placed in stream structures the same restoration scheme triggered contrasting ecological responses in different water discharges that typically ranged from approx 15 positive habitat enhancement adult chub s2 scheme near dry flows to 8 negative habitat degradation adult chub s2 scheme environmental flows the results ultimately suggest that river restoration based on trial and error will likely fail the probability of reaching levels of effectiveness that will justify the costs of ecological restoration within a trial and error based process is very low considering the numerous combinations of types sizes diameters angles and patterns of in stream structure placement all restoration schemes applied in this study caused various ecological responses both positive and negative depending on the biotic element and on the reach scale flow conditions partially justifying the long debate among researchers on the ecological effectiveness of river restoration roni et al 2005 thompson et al 2005 stewart et al 2009 the odds of success are not in favor of traditional trial and error based river restoration projects 4 2 unless pre optimized within a mechanistic ecological framework mechanistic frameworks quantify expectations and connect management actions to measurable objectives endpoints bandrowski et al 2015 in mechanistic ecological frameworks the endpoints are often measurable proxies of the response of biota to hydrogeomorphic drivers cabral et al 2017 in this study we applied demonstrated a mechanistic model based ecological framework that considered the various habitat restoration schemes as management actions and used the micro habitat suitability as a measurable proxy for ecological effectiveness in agreement with previous model based studies lange et al 2015 we showed that within this and similar frameworks that actually convert the traditional field based trial and error restoration process to a computer simulated trial and error process the ecological effectiveness of multiple river restoration schemes can be cost effectively evaluated the optimal restoration scheme simulated can be afterwards implemented thus increasing the probability of success of river restoration within this concept however the results further suggest that model based pre optimization of river restoration may require considerable time and effort to evaluate the multitude of possible restoration schemes 4 3 ecological response varied by species and life stages when the reach scale hydrodynamics facilitated the pool forming pool deepening widening and flow reducing hydraulic effect around the in stream structures the response of fish was typical of their life stage this effect was highest at near dry flows and thus all fish groups had a positive ecological response at q 0 02 m3 s 1 that reached up to 28 6 this is in agreement with previous in situ results from the same river kalogianni et al 2020 that highlighted the importance of in stream wood structures for fish at periods of water stress in which the water pools developed around them act as drought refugia facilitating fish survival adult chubs minnowroaches and minnows had similar preferences for deeper slow flowing habitats but we found contrasting responses between juvenile and adult chubs the habitat suitability of juvenile chubs was on average lower around the in stream structures and higher between structures this difference in habitat preference conforms to a previously evidenced ontogenetic shift in the use of pool habitats attributed to dietary partitioning that ultimately results in reduced intra species competition kalogianni et al 2020 as also suggested for other chub species quist and guy 2001 overall the placement of in stream structures at near dry flows favored all fish groups that may had had varying habitat preferences but compared to the base model they found optimized habitats either around adult chubs minnowroaches and minnows or between the structures juvenile chubs at near environmental flows however the already optimized hydraulic conditions were negatively fine tuned by the in stream structures possibly due to increased overtopping which either caused extremely deepened water pools or extremely increased flow velocities thomas et al 2013 have previously shown that local physical habitat diversity may increase by the placement of in stream structures however if not properly designed and maintained it may cause stream habitat fragmentation that ultimately leads to decreased population abundance density and diversity and thus decreased ecological response the same negative response was also observed for macroinvertebrates which further supports this hypothesis of negative fine tuning deoptimizing in contrast to fish however but typical of lotic adapted benthic communities restoration was optimal for macroinvertebrates only at q 0 6 m3 s 1 unlike lentic lowland river reaches in which marginal silt dominated water pools may host rich diverse macroinvertebrate communities principe and corigliano 2006 in lotic mid reaches increased macroinvertebrate abundance richness and diversity have been recorded in riffles areas with shallow water depths and moderate flow velocities compared to pools characterized by high water depths and low flow velocities brown and brussock 1991 nelson and liebermann 2002 wang et al 2012 thus the optimal combination of shallow moderately flowing habitats was obviously found for macroinvertebrates at intermediate flows in contrast to the almost stagnant waters of the near dry flows and the negatively fine tuned waters of near environmental flows 4 4 ecological response strongly depended on reach scale flow conditions our results also indicate that the effectiveness of ecological restoration strongly depends on higher level reach scale drivers acting as filters that critically regulate the local response of biota to the placement of in stream structures overall we found that within suboptimal conditions of high level drivers filters the reach scale water discharge the influence of lower level filters on the distribution of aquatic biota may increase in contrast optimal conditions of high level filters may reduce the positive response of biota to local in stream habitat restoration and can further trigger negative responses in near dry flows suboptimal high level filter the percent habitat suitability change of all biotic elements except for benthic macroinvertebrates for all restoration schemes was positive reaching up to 28 6 juvenile chub s1 scheme when however environmental flow was provided optimal high level filter the relevant habitat suitability change was negative ranging from 0 006 adult chub s1 scheme to 23 macroinvertebrates c3 scheme previous studies have also shown that the distribution of aquatic biota is critically driven by high level filters with local habitat conditions exerting a lower level fine tuning effect karaouzas et al 2019 in our case the reach scale water discharge was the high level filter that the locally placed in stream structures attempted to fine tune as it was shown man made fine tuning ecological restoration with the use of in stream structures may not only reduce the positive response of aquatic biota stoll et al 2016 there is a high probability that negative responses will be triggered 4 5 ecological response did not justify the costs of river restoration climate change implications overall we observed a negative response of biota to the placement of in stream structures the positive ecological response was approx 10 while the maximum positive ecological response was 28 6 observed for juvenile chub only at near dry flows thus our results support the conclusions of stewart et al 2009 also discussed in palmer et al 2010 that widespread use of in stream structures for river restoration is not supported considering though that at near dry flows the response of all biotic elements except for macroinvertebrates was positive in combination with the low habitat suitability differences among structure types and densities we suggest that sparse moderate in stream structures can be used for cost effective habitat restoration but restoration would only be effective thus justifying the high costs required when linked to very specific purposes a to enhance the resistance resilience of endangered species and b to increase improve habitat availability suitability during dry periods thus proactively preventing reducing the current and future ecological impacts of climate change on often endangered local biota palmer et al 2010 this can be implemented either in perennial rivers affected by climate change or human induced flow reduction stabilization or more widely in intermittent rivers which account for more than 50 of the global river length they dominate arid semi arid and mediterranean climates and are expected to increase due to climate change datry et al 2014 we found that for this specific case the placement of in stream structures had an overall positive effect small 4 28 6 but probably significant enough to ensure the survival of the local biota in deepened or newly formed water pools around the in stream structures until flow resumption in the presence of endangered species although the overall effect of habitat restoration on the fish macroinvertebrate communities may be only slightly positive approx 10 or even slightly negative 10 20 river restoration and its high implementation costs would be justified if it ultimately benefits these endangered species and prevents their extinction again within a species specific mechanistic pre optimization 5 conclusions our study showed that success in river restoration with the use of in stream structures critically depends on high level drivers in our case the reach scale water discharge the placement of in stream structures has only a local fine tuning effect the response of biota to the placement of in stream structures varied by species and life stages it was positive at near dry flows and negative at near environmental flows this leads us to species specific restoration but the placement of in stream structures cannot be species specific there is a multitude of types sizes diameters and patterns of potential in stream structure placement that minimize any chance of success for the traditional trial and error based restoration projects even our model based study practically failed to find an optimal one size fits all restoration scheme for all discharges and biotic elements all the above suggest that i the widespread use of in stream structures for river restoration should be avoided ii successful river restoration requires extensive pre optimization within a mechanistic ecological framework prior to field implementation iii restoration can be effective and its high costs would be justified when benefiting endangered species and increasing

18100,river restoration with the use of in stream structures has been widely implemented to maintain improve physical habitats however the response of aquatic biota has often been too weak to justify the high costs of restoration projects the ecological effectiveness of river restoration has thus been much debated over claims that large scale environmental drivers often overshadow the potential positive ecological effects of locally placed in stream structures in this study we used a two dimensional hydrodynamic habitat model to evaluate the ecological effectiveness of habitat restoration with the use of in stream structures in various water discharges ranging from near dry to environmental flows the habitat suitability of benthic macroinvertebrates and of three cyprinid fish species was simulated for six restoration schemes and at four discharge scenarios and was compared with a reference model without in stream structures we found that the ecological response to habitat restoration varied by species and life stages it strongly depended on the reach scale flow conditions it was often negative at near environmental flows and when positive mostly at near dry flows it was too low to justify the high costs of river restoration flow variation was the major environmental driver that our local habitat restoration schemes attempted but mostly failed to fine tune we conclude that traditional river restoration based on trial and error will likely fail and should be ecologically pre optimized before field implementation widespread use of in stream structures for ecological restoration is not recommended however at near dry flows the response of all biotic elements except for macroinvertebrates was positive in combination with the small habitat suitability differences observed among structure types and densities we suggest that sparse moderate in stream structure placement can be used for cost effective river restoration but it will only be ecologically effective thus justifying the high implementation costs when linked to very specific purposes i to conserve endangered species and ii to increase improve habitat availability suitability during dry periods thus proactively preventing reducing the current and future ecological impacts of climate change graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquatic restoration habitat use habitat suitability droughts temporary rivers climate change 1 introduction the notion that healthy habitats support healthy biota which in turn support healthy human societies emerged after decades of uncontrolled human development that caused severe degradation in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems vörösmarty et al 2010 grizzeti et al 2017 degraded natural systems have hence been engineered to restore their hydrologic geomorphic and ecological processes wohl et al 2015 a practice that has been commonly termed ecological restoration in rivers restoration techniques vary from in stream interventions such as removal of man made structures that inhibit natural flow removal of barriers to fish passage installation of natural or artificial structures to enhance aquatic habitats to riparian or basin wide modifications land restoration flow diversions dam removal and erosion control rrc 2002 yochum 2018 among these methods the placement of engineered in stream structures that create pools modify channel morphology and increase habitat complexity has long been applied in habitat enhancement stewart et al 2009 weirs deflectors and cover structures made from root wads logs boulders and gravel are used to increase biota population density and improve ecosystem functioning roni et al 2005 although physical habitat is enhanced by the placement of in stream structures the relevant response of aquatic biota has been much debated it is not always positive it varies by species and life stages and when positive it is often weak roni et al 2005 thompson et al 2005 stewart et al 2009 palmer et al 2010 roni 2019 according to previous research on salmonids 70 of studies show increased abundance around engineered in stream structures while approx 7 28 of studies suggest no response and 7 18 show lower abundance in restored habitats stewart et al 2009 roni et al 2015 compared to pre restored conditions the positive salmonid responses around in stream structures increased population density abundance often range from 10 to 50 nevertheless increased abundances of up to 167 have also been reported whiteway et al 2010 roni et al 2015 for non salmonid species results range from no significant responses lonzarich and quinn 1995 to 90 increase in fish abundance density in restored habitats shields et al 1993 varying responses have also been observed for benthic macroinvertebrates miller et al 2010 according to roni et al 2015 approx 67 of studies suggest increased macroinvertebrate density around engineered in stream structures while 33 show similar or lower densities in restored habitats typically the positive macroinvertebrate responses are not higher than 28 of the pre restored conditions miller et al 2010 considering the high costs of river restoration ranging from 2 200 000 to 31 000 000 per km2 for european rivers ayres et al 2014 szałkiewicz et al 2018 weak positive ecological responses may not be enough to characterize a restoration project as successful thus ineffectiveness or failure in ecological restoration is a common outcome palmer et al 2014 swan and brown 2017 the reasons for failure have been well documented a multitude of environmental ecological and anthropogenic factors interact across temporal and spatial scales acting as filters to the effectiveness success of ecological restoration mika et al 2010 feld et al 2018 liao et al 2018 local habitat restoration in a degraded river basin may trigger no observable ecological response reach scale flow modification may also undermine the effectiveness of local habitat restoration dam induced flow regulation upstream of a restored river reach may reduce the positive ecological effect of locally placed in stream structures in addition catchment scale land use or the proximity to upstream and downstream populated areas are often not accounted prior to habitat restoration bernhardt et al 2005 it has been argued that local habitat conditions may not be the major driver of ecological processes for fish and benthic macroinvertebrates brown et al 2011 heino et al 2015 karaouzas et al 2019 within the concept of environmental filtering local habitat is accounted as a low level filter for the regional pool of aquatic species friberg et al 2016 it is thus considered that an optimized restored low level habitat filter will result in optimized local ecological processes given that higher level filters e g reach scale are also optimal stoll et al 2016 all the above suggest that ecological restoration should be carefully designed and pre optimized yet many restoration projects have often been implemented within a process of trial and error friberg et al 2016 without any mechanistic pre optimization that would connect decisions to objectives bandrowski et al 2015 to this end hydrodynamic habitat models hhms have been recently introduced in habitat restoration rrc 2017 in hhms a hydraulic hydrodynamic model simulates the water depths d and depth averaged flow velocities v at multiple discharges in a computational mesh papadaki et al 2016 papaioannou et al 2020 the values of v and d are compared with habitat criteria of aquatic biota to estimate the habitat suitability for each simulated discharge gopal 2013 species density abundance is thus related to habitat suitability which is ultimately related to restoration effectiveness habitat restoration with the use of in stream structures can be cost effectively optimized prior to actual implementation by simulating different structures and patterns densities of structure placement in various discharge scenarios aiming to find the most effective restoration scenario i e the one that yields maximum overall habitat suitability and thus maximum species densities for the reach under investigation adeva bustos et al 2019 in this paper we are not pioneering the use of hydrodynamic habitat models for designing effective ecological restoration projects this practice has been already incorporated into habitat restoration during the last decades brown and pasternack 2009 schwartz et al 2015 rrc 2017 rather this study highlights that the physical hydro morphological and ecological processes that ecological restoration attempts to control and optimize i are often too complex to be addressed within the traditional trial and error based river restoration schemes and ii they should be carefully designed and pre optimized within a mechanistic ecological framework before implementation to reach this conclusion we used a two dimensional hydrodynamic habitat model and simulated the hydrological hydraulic and habitat properties in a river reach for various habitat restoration schemes with the use of in stream structures at various discharge scenarios although case specific the results of the study are analyzed within a wider framework to emphasize that ecological restoration requires extensive yet cost effective pre optimization before being applied to real life to reach levels of effectiveness that will justify the high costs of restoration projects 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and topographic data the study area was a 443 m long reach approx 10 226 m2 in an intermittent mediterranean watercourse the evrotas river southern greece fig 1 a c the current study built upon a previous model based environmental flow assessment that was carried out in the same river reach theodoropoulos et al 2019 riverbed topography was mapped with 719 points recording longitude x latitude y and bottom elevation h using a real time kinematic rtk gps consisting of the spectra precision sp60 gnss receiver and the mobile mapper 10 gis gps receiver trimble inc usa the topographic data x y h points were afterwards imported into the blue kenue software chc 2011 and an unstructured triangular computational mesh was generated by linearly interpolating channel topography across the reach here we used the riverbed topography that was acquired during that previous research and the relevant generated mesh as a base model reference for designing simulating multiple in stream habitat restoration schemes in total we designed six habitat restoration schemes and modelled the habitat suitability for five biotic elements at four discharge q scenarios in total 24 hydrodynamic simulations 4 q scenarios x 6 habitat restoration schemes and 120 habitat simulations were applied 24 hydrodynamic simulations x 5 biotic elements to ultimately predict the habitat suitability at each node of the computational mesh of the study area for each habitat restoration scheme and at each discharge scenario fig 2 2 2 habitat restoration schemes two types of in stream structures were designed fig 1d and e i simple structures s representing wood logs single pieces 0 5 m in diameter and 10 m long placed on opposite sides of the channel in a downstream direction at an angle of 135 to the bank fig 1d ii complex structures c representing log jams two single pieces 0 5 m in diameter and 5 m long and six single pieces 0 5 m in diameter and 2 5 m long tied together in two quadruplets each quadruplet included a 5 m long piece combined with three 2 5 m long pieces placed on opposite sides of the channel two quadruplets per side in a downstream direction at an angle of 135 to the bank fig 1e the structure diameter and lengths were selected based on natural in stream wood structures that have been previously recorded in the study reach kalogianni et al 2020 the densest scheme included in stream structures that were placed immediately after the end of the recirculation zone created by the previous structure six habitat restoration schemes were developed based on the type of structure either simple or complex and the density pattern of the placed structures fig 2 1 s1 sparse simple structures evenly spaced at approx every 85 m 2 s2 moderate simple structures evenly spaced at approx every 42 5 m 3 s3 dense simple structures evenly placed at approx every 21 m 4 c1 sparse complex structures evenly spaced at every 85 m 5 c2 moderate complex structures evenly spaced at approx every 42 5 m 6 c3 dense complex structures evenly spaced at approx every 21 m for each habitat restoration scheme a different computational mesh was developed in blue kenue with the following properties s1 12 147 nodes 23 249 elements s2 12 601 nodes 24 159 elements s3 13 513 nodes 25 985 elements c1 14 982 nodes 29 035 elements c2 17 798 nodes 34 667 elements c3 23 105 nodes 45 281 elements all meshes were refined around the structures to obtain locally detailed hydrodynamic results 2 3 model calibration validation and hydrodynamic simulation the base model with no added in stream structures has been previously calibrated at q 0 008 m3 s 1 and validated at q 0 02 m3 s 1 and q 0 5 m3 s 1 theodoropoulos et al 2019 q was prescribed at the upstream boundary and water surface elevation z was prescribed at the downstream boundary based on a stage discharge curve developed using hydrological information from a nearby gauging station calibration and validation of the model were applied by adjusting the riverbed s roughness manning s n values until an acceptable correlation r2 0 85 between observed and simulated d and depth averaged v values was achieved it is considered that mesh changes occurring from the placement of in stream structures in already calibrated validated base models will produce equally accurate hydrodynamic simulations wheaton et al 2004 hafs et al 2014 as long as the computational mesh properties are based on the same topographic dataset and the same boundary conditions used in the base model for each habitat restoration scheme we used the telemac 2d v6 2 galland et al 1991 to simulate d and v in four q scenarios i environmental flow previously determined at q 1 m3 s 1 theodoropoulos et al 2019 ii 0 8 m3 s 1 iii 0 6 m3 s 1 and iv near dry conditions 0 02 m3 s 1 2 4 habitat preferences and habitat suitability curves the habitat preferences of benthic macroinvertebrates and of three endangered endemic fish species the evrotas chub squalius keadicus stephanidis 1971 the spartian minnowroach tropidophoxinellus spartiaticus schmidt ries 1943 and the evrotas minnow pelasgus laconicus kottelat and barbieri 2004 were used in this study to investigate differences among potential habitat restoration schemes and discharge scenarios for the larger bodied evrotas chub two size classes were recorded small total length tl 10 cm corresponding to juveniles and large tl 10 cm corresponding to adults thus four fish groups were studied adult chubs juvenile chubs minnowroaches and minnows fish habitat preferences were assessed using habitat preference curves hscs for flow velocity water depth and substrate type s theodoropoulos et al 2019 that were developed following the approach of bovee 1986 based on microhabitat data relating v d and s values to the abundance of each fish group habitat suitability in microhabitats with highest abundance was considered optimal and scored a value of 1 in the relevant suitability curve whereas the habitat suitability in lowest abundance microhabitats was considered lowest and scored a value of 0 with intermediate abundance values respectively scoring between 0 and 1 macroinvertebrate habitat preferences were assessed using the benthos gr dataset theodoropoulos et al 2018 consisting of 380 microhabitat observations that relate v d and s to a community metrics based habitat suitability index integrating number of families number of ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera families the shannon wiener diversity and the total macroinvertebrate abundance 2 5 habitat suitability modelling for each of the 24 hydrodynamic simulations and for each of the five biotic elements four fish groups benthic macroinvertebrates the habitat suitability preference was estimated at each node of the computational mesh of the study reach for three hydraulic parameters v d and s respectively the fish habitat suitability was calculated by converting the numerical values of v d and s of the hydrodynamic model to habitat suitability preference using the relevant habitat suitability curves then a combined habitat suitability was estimated as k k v k d k s 3 where k v velocity habitat suitability preference k d depth habitat suitability preference k s substrate habitat suitability preference for benthic macroinvertebrates a fuzzy rule based bayesian algorithm frb was implemented in the habfuzz software theodoropoulos et al 2016 the numerical values of v and d were converted to overlapping five class trapezoidal shaped membership functions fuzzy sets the k values were classified into five classes 0 bad 0 2 0 2 poor 0 4 0 4 moderate 0 6 0 6 good 0 8 0 8 high 1 each numerical value of v and d was assigned to one or more fuzzy sets with a membership degree ranging from 0 to 1 the type of substrate was treated as a crisp input and classified based on schneider et al 2010 the training dataset with a priori calculated k values was used to develop sets of data driven if then rules relating the input fuzzy sets with a specific k class the fuzzy membership degree md of each input variable v d and s was then considered as the probability of occurrence of the particular fuzzy set such as if v is low with a membership degree of 1 and d is moderate with a md of 1 and s is gravel with a md of 1 then k is high with a md of 0 3 and good with a md of 0 7 the if then rules were then combined using the bayesian joint probability so that referring to the previous example the probability of the specific microhabitat s k being high is the joint probability that v is low and d is moderate and s is gravel and k is high 1 x 1 x 1 x 0 3 0 3 while the probability of k being good is the joint probability that v is low and d is moderate and s is gravel and k is good 1 x 1 x 1 x 0 7 0 7 based on a utility function brookes et al 2010 a score was assigned to each k class bad 0 1 good 0 3 moderate 0 5 good 0 7 high 0 9 and the habitat suitability k at each node of the computational mesh was ultimately predicted as k m ij s ij where m ij denotes the joint probability of occurrence of each k class and s ij denotes the score of each k class for the previous example k equals to 0 7 x 0 9 0 3 x 0 7 0 84 high 2 6 effectiveness of habitat restoration to assess the effectiveness of each habitat restoration scheme for each biotic element at each q scenario we calculated the weighted usable area wua wua is an indicator of the available area m2 of the study reach that can be exploited by each biotic element by multiplying the k value of each node of the computational mesh with its relevant cell area and aggregating all values restoration effectiveness was then calculated based on the difference and the percent deviation between the wua of the base model without in stream structures and the wua of the habitat restoration schemes models increased wua positive change indicates positive ecological response and decreased wua negative change indicates negative ecological response the model based process described above ultimately resulted in the assessment of the effectiveness of the six habitat restoration schemes in four flow scenarios and for five biotic elements of the evrotas aquatic ecosystem this point forward habitat restoration schemes and flow scenarios are often combined as habitat restoration discharge scheme for example the c1 0 02 scheme indicates sparse complex in stream structures modelled in the q 0 02 m3 s 1 scenario while the base 0 6 scheme suggests q 0 6 m3 s 1 modelled without in stream structures 3 results 3 1 hydrological hydraulic variation the results indicate that water discharge was the primary factor that influenced the hydrodynamic simulations the habitat restoration schemes had a lower overall effect fig 3 supplementary material figs s1 and s2 three generic patterns of water flow hydraulic effects around the in stream structures were observed in the restored reach i the in stream structures deflected the flowing water causing the formation of new water pools either upstream or downstream of the structure depending on the higher level reach scale hydrodynamics ii the in stream structures modified the natural habitats by deepening and or widening already established water pools or by shallowing and or narrowing the pools downstream of the structures in a distance that often surpassed several nearby structures iii the in stream structures had no effect on the water depth the water overtopped the structures without any visible water depth change compared to the base model however the flow velocity field around the structures was often substantially modified the effect of habitat restoration was highest at the lower water discharges as water discharge increased most structures were overtopped by the flowing water ultimately the presence of in stream structures had an overall pool forming pool deepening widening and flow reducing hydraulic effect compared to the base model regardless of the habitat restoration scheme near dry water discharge q 0 02 m3 s 1 had the lowest v and d values vmax 0 79 ms 1 for the c3 0 02 scheme dmax 1 14 m for the s3 0 02 scheme as discharge increased from 0 02 m3 s 1 to 1 m3 s 1 v and d also increased reaching highest values at the base 1 vmax 1 89 ms 1 and the s3 1 schemes dmax 1 74 m respectively within the same water discharge the presence of in stream structures clearly influenced the local hydraulic conditions all habitat restoration schemes maintained increased water volume in the channel compared to the base model fig 3e and f the total additional water volume was highest in the c2 0 6 scheme 226 m3 and lowest in the c1 0 8 scheme 9 56 m3 maximum percent volume change was observed in the c3 0 02 scheme 14 and lowest in the s1 0 8 scheme 0 3 all habitat restoration schemes had higher water depths compared to the base model dmax 0 88 m ranging from 1 02 m 16 s2 0 02 scheme to 1 74 m 97 s3 1 scheme overall flow velocity decreased as in stream structures were added in q 1 m3 s 1 vmax decreased from 1 86 ms 1 base model to 1 55 ms 1 17 c3 scheme in q 0 02 m3 s 1 however the base model had the lowest vmax 0 56 ms 1 while the c3 scheme had vmax 0 79 ms 1 41 increase 3 2 habitat suitability and the effectiveness of habitat restoration the effects of river restoration on the weighted usable area were diverse varying by water discharge and biotic element fig 4 figs s3 s9 overall the response of all biotic elements to habitat restoration was often negative and when positive mostly at near dry flows it ranged from near zero to 28 6 maximum positive ecological response was observed in moderate and sparse habitat restoration schemes but the average wua change between densities was low approx 10 as was also the average change between simple and complex structures 10 the highest positive wua change was observed for the juvenile chub at the s2 0 02 restoration scheme 28 6 as discharge increased from q 0 02 m3 s 1 to q 0 6 m3 s 1 the positive effect of in stream structures on habitat suitability decreased and reached negative values in higher discharges 0 8 m3 s 1 and 1 m3 s 1 the highest negative wua change was observed for macroinvertebrates at the c3 1 restoration scheme 23 except for macroinvertebrates the wua change in near dry conditions q 0 02 m3 s 1 was positive for all biotic elements with higher changes being observed for low and moderate density restoration schemes s1 s2 c1 c2 the wua in q 0 6 m3 s 1 was either low 10 for macroinvertebrates minnowroaches juvenile and adult chubs or negative for minnows wua changes for q 0 8 m3 s 1 and 1 m3 s 1 for all restoration schemes examined were negative with the highest negative values being observed for macroinvertebrates wua differences among structures were not significant the average difference was approx 5 10 reaching a maximum of 15 for macroinvertebrates between the s1 0 02 and s2 0 02 schemes more specifically the placement of in stream structures had a positive effect on the wua of adult chubs at low flows q 0 02 m3 s 1 and q 0 6 m3 s 1 ranging from 4 c3 0 06 scheme to 16 c2 0 02 scheme and a negative effect at higher flows q 0 8 m3 s 1 and q 1 m3 s 1 ranging from 4 c2 0 8 scheme to 13 c3 1 scheme the same trend was observed for minnowroaches the positive low flow effect ranged from 4 s1 0 6 to 26 s2 0 02 and the negative high flow effect ranged from 2 c3 0 8 to 9 c1 0 8 the wua of juvenile chubs was positively influenced in near dry conditions ranging from 14 s3 0 02 to 28 6 s1 0 02 and negatively influenced in higher discharges ranging from 0 6 s1 1 to 9 c3 1 minnows also showed a similar response the positive low flow effect ranged from 8 s2 0 02 to 16 c2 0 02 and the negative high flow effect ranged from 4 c2 0 6 to 15 c2 0 8 the wua of macroinvertebrates was positively influenced only in q 0 6 m3 s 1 ranging from 3 7 s3 0 6 to 7 c1 0 6 and negatively influenced in near dry and higher flows ranging from 4 c1 0 8 to 23 c3 1 3 3 habitat use of fish and macroinvertebrates around in stream structures fish and benthic macroinvertebrates had varying responses to the placement of in stream structures depending on the particular hydraulic effect that was developed more specifically the same structure in the same location caused different hydraulic effects in every water discharge tested complex pool patterns were developed around complex structures compared to simple structures but the overall difference in the local habitat suitability for all biotic elements was low 3 3 1 fish response to in stream structure placement fish responses around in stream structures were typical of their life history strategies in near dry conditions q 0 02 m3 s 1 fish behavior was mostly influenced by water depth adult chubs minnowroaches and minnows preferred deeper slow flowing habitats water pools that were often developed or widened upstream or downstream of the structure and avoided shallow faster flowing habitats fig 5 fig a1 in contrast juvenile chubs avoided lentic conditions developed downstream of the structures the habitat suitability of juvenile chubs was higher in shallower and often faster flowing habitats fig 5 fig a1 as water discharge increased the influence of flow velocity on fish response increased minnowroaches and minnows avoided habitats of high flow velocity when water overtopped the in stream structures fig 6 fig a2 and preferred low flow habitats the habitat suitability of juvenile chubs was further reduced in deep water pools and increased in shallower fast flowing habitats in constrast adult chubs preffered the deeper and faster flowing conditions that were developed in higher discharges 3 3 2 response of macroinvertebrates to in stream structure placement overall the habitat suitability of benthic macroinvertebrates around in stream structures was low both at near dry and higher flow conditions ranging from 0 1 to 0 6 macroinvertebrates avoided the generic pool forming pool deepening fig 5 fig a1 and flow reducing hydraulic effects fig 6 fig a2 that were caused by the structures macroinvertebrate habitat suitability increased only in the rarely occuring cases when the presence of a structure reduced the water depth of an already estabilshed pool causing water to flow downstream or reduced both the water depth and the flow velocity in otherwise fast flowing deep habitats 4 discussion 4 1 river restoration based on trial and error is prone to failure the results of the study agree with previous research on river restoration the simulated ecological response to the placement of in stream structures varied by species and life stages in agreement with friberg et al 2016 it strongly depended on the reach scale flow conditions as previously reported by brown et al 2011 and heino et al 2015 it was often negative at q 0 6 m3 s 1 0 8 m3 s 1 and 1 m3 s 1 stewart et al 2009 and when positive mostly at near dry flows it was not large enough average 10 maximum 28 6 to justify the high costs of river restoration szałkiewicz et al 2018 we further found that flow variation may be a major driver filter of the response of biota to habitat restoration and thus of restoration effectiveness the reach scale flow variation did not only reduce the magnitude of positive ecological effects from locally placed in stream structures the same restoration scheme triggered contrasting ecological responses in different water discharges that typically ranged from approx 15 positive habitat enhancement adult chub s2 scheme near dry flows to 8 negative habitat degradation adult chub s2 scheme environmental flows the results ultimately suggest that river restoration based on trial and error will likely fail the probability of reaching levels of effectiveness that will justify the costs of ecological restoration within a trial and error based process is very low considering the numerous combinations of types sizes diameters angles and patterns of in stream structure placement all restoration schemes applied in this study caused various ecological responses both positive and negative depending on the biotic element and on the reach scale flow conditions partially justifying the long debate among researchers on the ecological effectiveness of river restoration roni et al 2005 thompson et al 2005 stewart et al 2009 the odds of success are not in favor of traditional trial and error based river restoration projects 4 2 unless pre optimized within a mechanistic ecological framework mechanistic frameworks quantify expectations and connect management actions to measurable objectives endpoints bandrowski et al 2015 in mechanistic ecological frameworks the endpoints are often measurable proxies of the response of biota to hydrogeomorphic drivers cabral et al 2017 in this study we applied demonstrated a mechanistic model based ecological framework that considered the various habitat restoration schemes as management actions and used the micro habitat suitability as a measurable proxy for ecological effectiveness in agreement with previous model based studies lange et al 2015 we showed that within this and similar frameworks that actually convert the traditional field based trial and error restoration process to a computer simulated trial and error process the ecological effectiveness of multiple river restoration schemes can be cost effectively evaluated the optimal restoration scheme simulated can be afterwards implemented thus increasing the probability of success of river restoration within this concept however the results further suggest that model based pre optimization of river restoration may require considerable time and effort to evaluate the multitude of possible restoration schemes 4 3 ecological response varied by species and life stages when the reach scale hydrodynamics facilitated the pool forming pool deepening widening and flow reducing hydraulic effect around the in stream structures the response of fish was typical of their life stage this effect was highest at near dry flows and thus all fish groups had a positive ecological response at q 0 02 m3 s 1 that reached up to 28 6 this is in agreement with previous in situ results from the same river kalogianni et al 2020 that highlighted the importance of in stream wood structures for fish at periods of water stress in which the water pools developed around them act as drought refugia facilitating fish survival adult chubs minnowroaches and minnows had similar preferences for deeper slow flowing habitats but we found contrasting responses between juvenile and adult chubs the habitat suitability of juvenile chubs was on average lower around the in stream structures and higher between structures this difference in habitat preference conforms to a previously evidenced ontogenetic shift in the use of pool habitats attributed to dietary partitioning that ultimately results in reduced intra species competition kalogianni et al 2020 as also suggested for other chub species quist and guy 2001 overall the placement of in stream structures at near dry flows favored all fish groups that may had had varying habitat preferences but compared to the base model they found optimized habitats either around adult chubs minnowroaches and minnows or between the structures juvenile chubs at near environmental flows however the already optimized hydraulic conditions were negatively fine tuned by the in stream structures possibly due to increased overtopping which either caused extremely deepened water pools or extremely increased flow velocities thomas et al 2013 have previously shown that local physical habitat diversity may increase by the placement of in stream structures however if not properly designed and maintained it may cause stream habitat fragmentation that ultimately leads to decreased population abundance density and diversity and thus decreased ecological response the same negative response was also observed for macroinvertebrates which further supports this hypothesis of negative fine tuning deoptimizing in contrast to fish however but typical of lotic adapted benthic communities restoration was optimal for macroinvertebrates only at q 0 6 m3 s 1 unlike lentic lowland river reaches in which marginal silt dominated water pools may host rich diverse macroinvertebrate communities principe and corigliano 2006 in lotic mid reaches increased macroinvertebrate abundance richness and diversity have been recorded in riffles areas with shallow water depths and moderate flow velocities compared to pools characterized by high water depths and low flow velocities brown and brussock 1991 nelson and liebermann 2002 wang et al 2012 thus the optimal combination of shallow moderately flowing habitats was obviously found for macroinvertebrates at intermediate flows in contrast to the almost stagnant waters of the near dry flows and the negatively fine tuned waters of near environmental flows 4 4 ecological response strongly depended on reach scale flow conditions our results also indicate that the effectiveness of ecological restoration strongly depends on higher level reach scale drivers acting as filters that critically regulate the local response of biota to the placement of in stream structures overall we found that within suboptimal conditions of high level drivers filters the reach scale water discharge the influence of lower level filters on the distribution of aquatic biota may increase in contrast optimal conditions of high level filters may reduce the positive response of biota to local in stream habitat restoration and can further trigger negative responses in near dry flows suboptimal high level filter the percent habitat suitability change of all biotic elements except for benthic macroinvertebrates for all restoration schemes was positive reaching up to 28 6 juvenile chub s1 scheme when however environmental flow was provided optimal high level filter the relevant habitat suitability change was negative ranging from 0 006 adult chub s1 scheme to 23 macroinvertebrates c3 scheme previous studies have also shown that the distribution of aquatic biota is critically driven by high level filters with local habitat conditions exerting a lower level fine tuning effect karaouzas et al 2019 in our case the reach scale water discharge was the high level filter that the locally placed in stream structures attempted to fine tune as it was shown man made fine tuning ecological restoration with the use of in stream structures may not only reduce the positive response of aquatic biota stoll et al 2016 there is a high probability that negative responses will be triggered 4 5 ecological response did not justify the costs of river restoration climate change implications overall we observed a negative response of biota to the placement of in stream structures the positive ecological response was approx 10 while the maximum positive ecological response was 28 6 observed for juvenile chub only at near dry flows thus our results support the conclusions of stewart et al 2009 also discussed in palmer et al 2010 that widespread use of in stream structures for river restoration is not supported considering though that at near dry flows the response of all biotic elements except for macroinvertebrates was positive in combination with the low habitat suitability differences among structure types and densities we suggest that sparse moderate in stream structures can be used for cost effective habitat restoration but restoration would only be effective thus justifying the high costs required when linked to very specific purposes a to enhance the resistance resilience of endangered species and b to increase improve habitat availability suitability during dry periods thus proactively preventing reducing the current and future ecological impacts of climate change on often endangered local biota palmer et al 2010 this can be implemented either in perennial rivers affected by climate change or human induced flow reduction stabilization or more widely in intermittent rivers which account for more than 50 of the global river length they dominate arid semi arid and mediterranean climates and are expected to increase due to climate change datry et al 2014 we found that for this specific case the placement of in stream structures had an overall positive effect small 4 28 6 but probably significant enough to ensure the survival of the local biota in deepened or newly formed water pools around the in stream structures until flow resumption in the presence of endangered species although the overall effect of habitat restoration on the fish macroinvertebrate communities may be only slightly positive approx 10 or even slightly negative 10 20 river restoration and its high implementation costs would be justified if it ultimately benefits these endangered species and prevents their extinction again within a species specific mechanistic pre optimization 5 conclusions our study showed that success in river restoration with the use of in stream structures critically depends on high level drivers in our case the reach scale water discharge the placement of in stream structures has only a local fine tuning effect the response of biota to the placement of in stream structures varied by species and life stages it was positive at near dry flows and negative at near environmental flows this leads us to species specific restoration but the placement of in stream structures cannot be species specific there is a multitude of types sizes diameters and patterns of potential in stream structure placement that minimize any chance of success for the traditional trial and error based restoration projects even our model based study practically failed to find an optimal one size fits all restoration scheme for all discharges and biotic elements all the above suggest that i the widespread use of in stream structures for river restoration should be avoided ii successful river restoration requires extensive pre optimization within a mechanistic ecological framework prior to field implementation iii restoration can be effective and its high costs would be justified when benefiting endangered species and increasing

18101,this study demonstrated the presence of a critical equivalent ratio of the competing anion i e sulfate and bicarbonate to chloride ion in recycled brine to achieve highly selective nitrate removal from nitrate rich groundwater in the standard anion exchange resin aer i e with trimethylamine functional groups column process with increasing bicarbonate or sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine used to circularly activate regenerate the standard aer column considerable bicarbonate sulfate removal and dumping were observed the critical bicarbonate sulfate chloride equivalent ratio of 2 5 8 1 in brine effectively achieved zero net bicarbonate sulfate removal 5 from feedwater during long term exhaustion regeneration cyclic operation the feed rate 6 18 bv h played a key role in determining the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine while the feed sulfate concentration 145 345 mg l slightly changed the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio the use of optimized ternary brine with a sulfate chloride bicarbonate equivalent ratio of 42 5 2 stably achieved long term highly selective nitrate removal from groundwater in the standard aer column process with brine electrochemical treatment the possible mechanism for nitrate selectivity included the modification of the sulfate and bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratios in the standard aer column by the optimized brine in circular activation regeneration mode this changed the column elution and breakthrough curves inhibited the competition of sulfate and bicarbonate for ion exchange sites during exhaustion according to the separation factor and finally achieved selective nitrate removal from feedwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrate selective ion exchange groundwater brine reuse resin activation 1 introduction the contamination of groundwater by nitrate is one of the most serious water pollution problems worldwide biddau et al 2019 as high nitrate levels in drinking water may lead to blue baby syndrome in infants and gastrointestinal cancer in adults su et al 2017 the anion exchange process through polymeric strong base anion exchange resins aers is often considered an efficient method for removal of nitrate from groundwater standard strong base aers such as amberlite ira 400 and amberlite irn 78 hekmatzadeh et al 2012 201 4 sun et al 2015 zheng et al 2011 etc often

hydrophobic nitrate clifford and liu 1993 vanderhoek et al 1988 the preference for sulfate over nitrate on standard aers i e sulfate selective aers leads to low nitrate adsorption capacity nitrate peaking or dumping after nitrate breakthrough hekmatzadeh et al 2012 and higher corrosivity and negative effects on health associated with higher chloride content in product water clifford and liu 1993 since the 1980s a number of nitrate selective aers with longer chain length functional group e g triethyl r n ch2ch3 3 and polystyrene backbones gu et al 2007 hsu and singer 2010 song et al 2012

hekmatzadeh et al 2012 and etc have been developed to overcome those shortcomings mentioned above mcadam and judd 2008 as compared with standard aers however those nitrate selective aers are generally quite expensive which emerges as the primary obstacle against its wide application in water treatment plant in the aer packed column process plug flow passing through the aer column can be divided into many identical segments all anions in water passing through the column can equilibrate in each column segment before being transferred to the next column segment choe et al 2015 during exhaustion or regeneration the general formula of ion exchange reactions between a given anion b n univalent b e g bicarbonate or bivalent b2 e g sulfate ions and the univalent counterion a chloride ion in most cases in the feedwater or brine and aer phase is as follows 1 n r a b n r n b n n a the ion exchange of the given anion over the univalent counterion can be evaluated by the separation factor α calculated as follows gu et al 2004 hu et al 2016 2 α a b n r n b n r a a b n where rn bn and r a are the equilibrium equivalent concentrations of the given anion and the univalent counterion in the aer phase while bn and a are their equilibrium equivalent concentrations in the aqueous phase respectively typically the anionic selectivity sequence on standard aers i e sulfate nitrate chloride bicarbonate hekmatzadeh et al 2012 is mainly related to differences in the physicochemical characteristics of these anions hu et al 2016 and their ionic strengths in solution bergquist et al 2016 the development of nitrate selective aers demonstrates that the anionic selectivity sequence on aers will vary with the change in aer properties i e hydrophobicity when modifying their functional groups and or polymer backbones gu et al 2007 hsu and singer 2010 song et al 2012 as shown in eq 2 however the success or failure of ion exchange of the given anion over the univalent counterion was also determined by the equivalent ratio of the given anion to the univalent counterion i e rn bn r a in aer phase against that i e bn a in feedwater during exhaustion or brine during regeneration furthermore as the aer process is often operated with alternating exhaustion and regeneration cycles the equivalent ratio of a given anion to the univalent counterion in recycled brine might influence their equivalent ratio in the aer during activation regeneration and further influence the ion exchange performance of the given anion during exhaustion according to the separation factor under these conditions besides modifying aer properties i e nitrate selective aers gu et al 2007 hsu and singer 2010 song et al 2012 there may be another strategy to achieve nitrate selectivity in a standard aer column process at a low cost i e by optimizing the equivalent ratio of competing anions to the univalent counterion in recycled brine to inhibit their competition for ion exchange sites during exhaustion following circular activation of a standard aer column by bicarbonate or sulfate chloride binary brine we investigated the potential effect of the bicarbonate or sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in binary brine on anionic removal performance during exhaustion and demonstrated the presence of a critical bicarbonate or sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in binary brine to achieve zero net bicarbonate or sulfate removal from feedwater subsequently following evaluation of the potential effects of feed rate and feed sulfate concentration on the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine we demonstrated the feasibility of selective nitrate removal from groundwater by optimizing ternary brine sulfate chloride bicarbonate over 13 exhaustion regeneration cycles in the standard aer column process with brine electrochemical treatment finally we propose a mechanism for selective nitrate removal in the standard aer column process with optimized brine after investigating the effects of circular activation regeneration by optimized brine on column elution and breakthrough curves and sulfate nitrate binary exchange reactions 2 material and methods 2 1 materials reagent

consecutive exhaustion regeneration cycles i e one brine purification cycle and electrochemical treatment of spent brine in batch mode during the activation and regeneration phases 2 4 l of brine in

feedwater in the feed tank was pumped downwards into the standard aer column at the specified feed rate as shown in table s1 and product water was discharged into the effluent tank following aer regeneration makeup nacl was added to the brine to return its salt concentration to the initial level at that time the aer column was ready for the next exhaustion regeneration cycle the 6 h

analytical instruments gmbh kleve germany the overall precision of the water quality analysis was verified by replicate analysis and calculation of the relative percentage deviation the target of which was 10 3 results and discussion the majority of previous studies on nitrate selective aers used sulfate as a competing anion choe et al 2015 hekmatzadeh et al 2012 hu et al 2016 it is reported that bicarbonate also has an adverse effect on nitrate adsorption choe et al 2015 song et al 2012 although it has lower selectivity than nitrate and chloride hekmatzadeh et al 2012 in this study both sulfate and bicarbonate were selected as competing anions to investigate the potential effects of brine optimization on the selective nitrate removal performance of a standard aer column process fig s2 shows the long term removal of nitrate sulfate and bicarbonate from feedwater during exhaustion when nacl brine is reused during 24 exhaustion regeneration cycles in a standard aer column process without brine purification or replacement along with their accumulation in recycled brine during regeneration consistent with previous studies of standard aer columns with recycling of brine for reuse lehman et al 2008 liu and clifford 1996 sun et al 2015 zheng et al 2011 preferential sulfate removal 96 was observed throughout the long term cyclic operation while nitrate and bicarbonate removal gradually decreased from 100 to 38 and from 28 to 16 respectively cyclic operation led to remarkable accumulation of these three target anions in recycled nacl brine the observations also imply a dynamic increase in the equivalent ratio of all three target anions relative to chloride i e the counter anion in the recycled brine fig s3 shows that the rough estimates of the amounts of nitrate and bicarbonate adsorbed on the standard aer column increased gradually to the peak values during the 16th and 10th exhaustion regeneration cycle respectively and then remained stable in previous study lehman et al 2008 noticed that both sulfate and bicarbonate concentrations in recycled nacl brine reached a steady state after 13 15 cycles of the standard aer column process for groundwater treatment depending on the feedwater ionic concentrations brine concentration and removal effectiveness the presence of a steady state for these anions in the standard aer column or in recycled brine demonstrated that there is an inherent relation of these anions in feedwater in the standard aer column and in recycled brine previously the failure of nitrate removal by standard aers is typically attributed to the stronger competition of sulfate for ion exchange sites li et al 2019 liu and clifford 1996 however it seems in this study that the failure to remove nitrate and bicarbonate may also have been attributable to the considerable increases in their equivalent ratios to chloride in the recycled brine and in the standard aer column which may inhibit their ion exchange capacity during exhaustion 3 1 effects of the bicarbonate or sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine for circular activation of the standard aer column on anionic removal performance during exhaustion bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratio in brine incorporation of bicarbonate into the chloride based brine was reported to exert small effects on standard aer exhaustion and regeneration with regard to sulfate nitrate and chloride because bicarbonate based brine is weaker than chloride based brine li et al 2015 the weak effects of a wide range of bicarbonate concentrations in chloride based brine on anionic removal performance during exhaustion was demonstrated in fig 1 a following circular activation of the standard aer column by brine with various bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratios the sulfate and nitrate removal rates during exhaustion remained constant at 100 during exhaustion however varied bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratios in brine seemed to considerably influence bicarbonate removal during exhaustion the bicarbonate concentration in the product water increased gradually with increases in the bicarbonate equivalent fraction in the recycled brine and finally exceeded the bicarbonate concentration in the feedwater i e negative bicarbonate removal or bicarbonate leakage or dumping into the product water at a bicarbonate equivalent fraction of 0 33 these results demonstrated that the failure to remove bicarbonate observed in fig s2 was attributable to an excessively high bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratio in the recycled brine with the development of continuous operation which finally inhibit the ion exchange capacity of bicarbonate during exhaustion when the bicarbonate equivalent fraction in brine was 0 29 i e the critical bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratio of 2 5 the bicarbonate concentrations in the feedwater and the product water were approximately equivalent i e 5 bicarbonate removal the inhibitory effects of the critical bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratio in recycled brine on long term bicarbonate removal performance were further demonstrated by 15 exhaustion regeneration cycles of the standard aer column process when the brine with the critical bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratio was used to circularly activate or regenerate the standard aer column fig s4 in addition to no significant 5 bicarbonate removal or accumulation remarkable sulfate removal 90 94 and accumulation and remarkable nitrate removal and accumulation were consistently observed with cyclic operation therefore the ratio of 2 5 is referred to as the critical bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratio in brine for activation of the standard aer column to inhibit the competition of bicarbonate for ion exchange sites during exhaustion sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine as shown in fig 1b following circular activation of the standard aer column by brine with various sulfate chloride equivalent ratios nitrate removal remained constant at 100 during exhaustion in most cases the remarkable amounts of sulfate in both feedwater and brine had a negligible influence on nitrate removal performance during exhaustion however with the increase in the sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine bicarbonate removal by the activated standard aer column decreased markedly from 75 to 17 the increase in the sulfate chloride equivalent ratios in brine also considerably influenced sulfate removal performance during exhaustion while the sulfate concentration in the product water increased gradually and finally exceeded its concentration in the feedwater i e negative sulfate removal or sulfate leakage or dumping into the product water these results demonstrated that the failure to remove could be achieved at an excessively high sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in the recycled brine which finally inhibit the ion exchange capacity of sulfate during exhaustion with a sulfate equivalent fraction in brine of 0 89 i e the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio of 8 1 the sulfate concentrations in the feedwater and product water were approximately equivalent i e 5 sulfate removal the inhibitory effect of the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in recycled brine on long term sulfate removal performance was further demonstrated by 12 exhaustion regeneration cycles of the standard aer column process when the brine with the critical equivalent ratio was used to activate or regenerate the standard aer column fig s5 no significant 5 sulfate removal and accumulation as well as low bicarbonate removal 14 21 and accumulation and marked nitrate removal and accumulation were consistently observed with cyclic operation therefore the ratio of 8 1 was referred to as the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine for activation of the standard aer column to inhibit the competitive capacity of sulfate for ion exchange sites during exhaustion in contrast to previous conclusions boumediene and achour 2004 hekmatzadeh et al 2012 li et al 2019 liu and clifford 1996 the results presented here confirmed that the presence of abundant sulfate in brine and feedwater had no significant effect on the nitrate removal performance of the standard aer column 3 2 effects of feed parameters on the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine feed rate a higher feed rate generally increases the turbulence of flow in the fixed bed process resulting in a shorter breakthrough time and faster saturation hekmatzadeh et al 2012 li and yang 2015 xu et al 2013 in this study following circular activation of the standard aer column by brine with various sulfate chloride equivalent ratios the effects of feed rate i e 6 fig 1b 12 and 18 fig 2 bv h on the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine were investigated the feed rate seemed to play a key role in determining the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine with increasing feed rate the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratios in brine changed from 8 1 at 6 bv h to 6 1 at 12 and 18 bv h as reported previously hekmatzadeh et al 2012 li and yang 2015 xu et al 2013 the increase in feed rate markedly influenced nitrate and bicarbonate removal in all cases in this study the world health organization who recommends drinking water nitrate concentrations 50 mg l who 2011 drinking water satisfying this threshold at a feed rate of 18 bv apparently cannot be produced in most cases although efficient nitrate removal i e 55 84 was still achieved therefore a low feed rate e g 10 bv h during exhaustion is recommended for the standard aer column process feed sulfate concentration in this study following circular activation of the standard aer column by brine with various sulfate chloride equivalent ratios the effects of feed sulfate concentration i e 145 fig 1b 245 and 345 fig 3 mg l on the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine were investigated with increasing feed sulfate concentration the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine increased slightly from 8 1 for 145 mg l sulfate to 17 2 for 245 mg l sulfate and then to 9 1 for 345 mg l sulfate these observations suggested that the severalfold change in feed sulfate concentration is accompanied by a slight change in the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine the variation in feed sulfate concentration hardly influenced the nitrate removal performance by the circularly activated standard aer column in all cases and nitrate levels in the product water remained constant at extremely low levels figs 1b and 3 in comparison with the results at 145 mg l sulfate feed sulfate concentrations of 245 345 mg l significantly reduced bicarbonate removal at low sulfate chloride equivalent ratios in the brine 3 3 long term anionic removal and accumulation characteristics of the standard aer column process with optimized brine and brine electrochemical treatment in this study we combined the critical sulfate chloride and bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratios to produce optimized ternary brine with a sulfate chloride bicarbonate equivalent ratio of 42 5 2 this was tentatively used to activate or regenerate the standard aer column during 13 exhaustion regeneration cycles and the long term anionic removal and accumulation performance was further investigated after every four exhaustion regeneration cycles the spent brine was purified by electrochemical treatment to remove nitrate and then recovered to activate the standard aer column prior to the next exhaustion regeneration cycle the results are illustrated in fig 4 in previous studies unitary brines such as naoh hcl nacl and nh4cl brine solutions sun et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 and binary brines such as nacl naoh zheng et al 2017 and nacl nahco3 li et al 2015 were used to regenerate the exhausted aers this is the first report of the simultaneous addition of sulfate and bicarbonate to brine and use of a ternary brine for aer regeneration different from the standard aer column process shown in fig s2 following standard aer activation regeneration by the optimized brine no significant bicarbonate removal 5 and low sulfate removal 2 22 were consistently observed throughout the long term cyclic operation periods as illustrated in fig 4 when their concentrations in the recycled brine remained stable furthermore the sulfate removal maximum 22 of the optimized ternary brine shown in fig 4 was higher than that 5 of the binary brine sulfate chloride shown in fig s5 possibly due to a less precise brine composition as it was produced by a combination of two critical binary equivalent ratios additionally vanderhoek et al 1988 noted 0 45 sulfate removal and no significant bicarbonate removal from feedwater by a nitrate selective aer column in this study following activation regeneration by the optimized brine the standard aer column may also show no or low sulfate and bicarbonate removals from feedwater during long term cyclic operation in contrast although increased carbon chain length of functional groups produced those nitrate selective aers boumediene and achour 2004 hekmatzadeh et al 2012 sowmya and meenakshi 2014 it also reduced their exchange capacity for selective nitrate removal samatya et al 2006 it is often reported that sulfate buildup in the resin phase affects the standard aer column to a much greater extent than the nitrate selective aer column in terms of nitrate removal from feedwater liu and clifford 1996 however as illustrated in fig 4 figs s4 and s5 the sulfate and bicarbonate buildup in the standard aer column induced by circular activation using the optimized brine did not present a major obstacle to nitrate removal and accumulation performance in fact it aided selective nitrate removal and accumulation by inhibiting ion exchange of sulfate and bicarbonate so that quality drinking water with low chloride content could be produced during long term cyclic operation the results presented here also demonstrated that although many aer sites are occupied by competing anions there are still sufficient ion exchange sites available for nitrate removal from feedwater the process of electrolytic decomposition of nitrate to harmless nitrogen gas has attracted a great deal of attention due to its minimal generation of secondary waste ease of operation yu and kupferle 2008 high treatment efficiency and small equipment footprint li et al 2009a 2009b in the presence of abundant chloride in solution electrolytic decomposition was achieved by a combination of reduction of nitrate on the cathode and oxidization of ammonia on the anode by free chlorine clo generated during chloride oxidization su et al 2017 yu and kupferle 2008 in this study prior to spent brine purification treatment the nitrate concentration in the product water increased gradually from 1 to 13 to 39 43 mg l after 4 5 exhaustion regeneration cycles while nitrate in brine increased gradually from 114 to 202 to 612 1064 mg l following electrochemical treatment the nitrate level in spent brine was efficiently decreased to 90 125 mg l i e 84 85 removal and no detectable byproducts e g ammonia and nitrite were detected in the treated brine data not shown no significant effects of electrochemical treatment on bicarbonate and sulfate concentrations in the recycled brine were observed furthermore the electrochemically treated brine eluted nitrate residue on aers resulting in a nitrate level to 167 202 mg l in the recycled brine prior to the next exhaustion regeneration cycle subsequent observations confirmed that electrochemically treated brine effectively restored the capacity of the standard aer column for nitrate removal from feedwater during subsequent long term cyclic operation therefore the electrochemical process can be used in a closed loop to selectively and completely remove nitrate from spent brine from both an economic and environmental standpoint this provides a good solution to the problem of disposal of the spent brine that is frequently generated during the previous aer process electrochemical treatment can reduce the nitrate concentration in spent brine to close to zero paidar et al 2004 however taking mass transfer limitations and low current efficiency at low nitrate concentrations into account paidar et al 2004 it would be advantageous to terminate the electrochemical process of spent brine at a relatively high nitrate concentration e g around 100 mg l in this study 3 4 nitrate selective removal mechanism in the standard aer column process with optimized brine effects of circular activation regeneration mode on column elution curves fig 5 shows the effects of circular activation regeneration mode with nacl brine on the anionic elution profiles of exhausted standard aer column without circular activation regeneration i e direct brine discharge after passage of 9 bv nacl solution through the exhausted standard aer column as the control consistent with a previous study lehman et al 2008 li et al 2015 in the control typical elution peaks for these model anions were seen as shown in fig 5a finally three model anions were completely eluted from the exhausted column to produce an effluent concentration of 0 mg l in contrast under circular activation regeneration mode the standard aer column exhibited markedly different anionic elution curves as shown in fig 5b all anionic concentrations in the brine tank increased gradually to the highest level and then remained constant their maximum concentrations were far lower than those achieved in the control the circular activation regeneration mode finally achieved equilibria of three anions between aers and brine similar to batch adsorption test under these conditions adsorptive equilibrium between aer and brine may result in a remarkable influence of brine composition on the anionic equivalent ratio in a standard aer column that is a low high equivalent ratio of sulfate bicarbonate chloride in recycled brine will result in a low high anionic equivalent ratio on the standard aer column during circular activation regeneration furthermore for the feedwater with a fixed equivalent ratio of sulfate bicarbonate chloride a low high equivalent ratio of sulfate bicarbonate chloride in recycled brine will finally result in a low high separator value during exhaustion according to eq 2 this indicated favorable unfavorable selectivity of the standard aer column for sulfate bicarbonate over chloride i e positive or negative sulfate bicarbonate removal during exhaustion the mechanism explained why as observed in figs 1 3 with the increase in equivalent ratio of sulfate bicarbonate chloride in recycled brine net sulfate bicarbonate removal and subsequent sulfate bicarbonate dumping by the standard aer column was observed in a stepwise manner following the activation by designed brine thus selective nitrate removal by the standard aer column was finally achieved at the critical equivalent ratio of sulfate bicarbonate chloride in recycled brine by circular activation regeneration of the optimized brine effects of circular activation by optimized brine on column breakthrough curves the column breakthrough test was often used in previous studies to demonstrate the selective capacity of nitrate selective aers for nitrate choe et al 2015 gu et al 2004 liu and clifford 1996 in which sulfate will be always driven off these aers by nitrate in the feedwater during exhaustion i e earlier sulfate breakthrough than nitrate breakthrough choe et al 2015 liu and clifford 1996 in this study the potential effects of circular activation by optimized brine on the anionic breakthrough curves of the standard aer column were evaluated using a nonactivated standard aer column as a control and the results are shown in fig 6 as reported previously hekmatzadeh et al 2012 lehman et al 2008 sun et al 2015 effluent anionic concentrations of the nonactivated standard aer column showed a normal anionic breakthrough profile fig 6a bicarbonate broke through first and the nitrate concentration in the product water rose sharply from 0 mg l before 196 bv to above that in the feedwater after 270 bv while no sulfate was detected in the product water throughout the experimental period in contrast following activation by the optimized brine the standard aer column exhibited different column breakthrough curves fig 6b there was a far higher bicarbonate concentration in product water at the beginning than that shown in fig 6a in comparison with sulfate and bicarbonate nitrate bound preferentially to the standard aer column circularly activated by optimized brine the column breakthrough curve presented here was similar to those reported for nitrate selective aers gu et al 2004 hekmatzadeh et al 2012 liu and clifford 1996 sowmya and meenakshi 2014 it indicated that circular activation of the standard aer column by the optimized brine made it feasible to achieve nitrate selectivity in the steady state of the nitrate selective aer system the sulfate mass balance showed that more than 90 of the sulfate loaded on aer sites during the first 80 bvs of exhaustion was subsequently replaced by nitrate in the feedwater during the remaining exhaustion period liu and clifford 1996 as shown in column breakthrough curves which explained why no net sulfate removal was observed during the steady state periods of nitrate selective aer previously liu and clifford 1996 or in this study fig 4 and fig s5 effects of circular activation by optimized brine on sulfate nitrate binary exchange reactions in previous studies qualitative binary ion exchange plots and quantitative separation factor calculations were used to demonstrate the nitrate selective capacities of many nitrate selective aers ebrahimi and roberts 2016 gu et al 2004 hu et al 2016 in this study the activated standard aers were prepared in fixed bed columns using the optimized brine with a sulfate chloride bicarbonate equivalent ratio of 30 5 2 subsequently the selectivity of activated and nonactivated standard aers for sulfate and nitrate were evaluated by sulfate nitrate binary ion exchange reactions as described by gu et al 2004 with minor modifications the separation factor α for sulfate i e the given anion in this test and nitrate i e the mobile counterion in this test was calculated according to eq 2 based on the data nearest the point at which the equivalent ionic fraction in solution was 0 5 a separation value 1 indicates favorable selectivity of aer for sulfate over nitrate while a higher value indicates greater sulfate selectivity hu et al 2016 a plot of the sulfate equivalent concentration fractions on aer y axis versus solution x axis is shown in fig s6 the majority of the data points remained above the 1 1 line indicating greater selectivity for sulfate over nitrate via either nonactivated or activated standard aer furthermore the separation values of activated and nonactivated standard aer were 1 14 and 1 01 respectively which approximated those reported in previous studies for standard aers e g 1 71 137 for 32 standard aers clifford and weber 1983 the results indicated no significant change in the anionic preference of standard aer where activation by optimized brine did not modify its functional groups 3 5 significance of this investigation the results present here indicated that the circular activation regeneration mode modified the anionic equivalent ratio in the standard aer column according to the brine composition fig 5 which in turn influenced the column breakthrough curves of the standard aer column fig 6 and played a key role in determining the removal performance of a given anion during exhaustion according to the separation factor under these conditions no removal from feedwater and accumulation in recycled brine of sulfate and bicarbonate were frequently observed during long term cyclic operation of the standard aer column when the optimized brine with the critical equivalent ratio was used as shown in figs s4 and s5 and fig 4 in this study the exhaustion and regeneration cycles had a common equivalent ratio of the competing anion to chloride ion in the standard aer column as the standard aer column process was operated with alternating exhaustion and regeneration cycles therefore the inhibitory effect of the competing anions in optimized brine on their own ion exchange performance during exhaustion and regeneration can be explained by the approximate equivalent ratios in the feedwater and the optimized brine for example the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratios in recycled brine were 8 0 8 5 and 9 0 for equivalent ratios of sulfate chloride ion in feedwater of 5 3 9 5 and 13 3 respectively at feed sulfate concentrations of 135 243 and 342 mg l respectively selective nitrate removal by the standard aer column was finally achieved through the inhibitory effect of competing anion e g sulfate or bicarbonate in optimized brine on its own ion exchange during exhaustion rather than by the anionic selectivity sequence the difference in the operational costs of the nitrate selective aers reported previously and the standard aer column activated regenerated by optimized brine introduced in this study was determined by their treatment capacity and resin costs due to their similar process design as illustrated in fig 6 the treatment capacity of the activated standard aer column process about 120 bvs of product water approximated to that of some nitrate selective aers for groundwater treatment e g 120 bvs for purolite a 520e gu et al 2004 under the conditions the operational costs of the activated regenerated standard aer column process was significantly lower than that of the nitrate selective aer process since those nitrate selective aers are generally more expensive e g 5 5 times or even higher than standard aers in this study insignificant bicarbonate and sulfate removal were consistently observed from the first cycle of the long term cyclic operation of the standard aer column with optimized brine figs s4 and s5 and fig 4 however for a nitrate selective aer system long term cyclic operation e g 33 exhaustion regeneration cycles is often required to reach a steady state characterized by no net sulfate removal from feedwater clifford and liu 1993 liu and clifford 1996 it seems that the treatment performance of the activated standard aer column in this study was even better than that of nitrate selective aers however there were still many commonalties between the nitrate selective aers reported previously and the standard aer column activated regenerated by optimized brine introduced in this study e g no net sulfate removal from feedwater was achieved after the sulfate concentration in recycled brine reached a plateau clifford and liu 1993 liu and clifford 1996 furthermore the inhibitory effect of non sulfate anions in recycled brine on their own ion exchange performance have also been reported previously for nitrate selective aers when it was also observed in this study including bicarbonate and nitrate for example bergquist et al 2016 concluded that a high concentration of nitrate in brine is principally responsible for the reduced nitrate breakthrough capacity of nitrate selective aers rather than the accumulation of sulfate or bicarbonate in the brine vanderhoek et al 1988 attributed the absence of bicarbonate removal from groundwater when using a nitrate selective aer to abundant bicarbonate on the aer column at the start of each service mode due to the higher alkalinity of the brine therefore it seems possible that the activated standard aer column by the optimized brine in this study and the nitrate selective aers share an identical nitrate selective removal mechanism i e inhibition of the ion exchange capacity of a coexisting anion during exhaustion by its anionic equivalent ratio to the chloride in optimized brine in comparison with nitrate selective aers 2 2 clifford and liu 1993 or even 16 liu and clifford 1996 g l sulfate a far higher sulfate concentration i e 43 44 g l sulfate see figs 1b and 4 in the optimized brine was required for the standard aer column in this study to inhibit its own ion exchange during exhaustion which demonstrated the advantage of nitrate selective aers over the activated standard aer column introduced in this study due to stronger hydrophobicity in recent decades various ion exchangers have been developed to selectively remove different contaminant ions including heavy metals e g cu2 bezzina et al 2019 and as v awual et al 2012 ions and other anions e g phosphate trung huu et al 2018 wu et al 2017 and perchlorate sharbatmaleki and batista 2012 sharbatmaleki et al 2015 the findings presented herein will be helpful for selective ionic removal from various water matrices 4 conclusions 1 as the standard aer column process was operated with alternating exhaustion and regeneration cycles there is an inherent relation of the equivalent ratio of coexisting anion to chloride in the feedwater in the standard aer column and in the recycled brine under these conditions accurate control of the equivalent ratio of sulfate and bicarbonate to chloride in recycled brine of the standard aer column process can achieve selective nitrate removal from feedwater and accumulation in recycled brine by inhibiting the competing capacity of sulfate and bicarbonate for ion exchange sites the circular activation regeneration mode altered the column elution and breakthrough curves and finally achieved selective nitrate removal from feedwater the activated standard aer column in this study and nitrate selective aers share an identical nitrate selective removal mechanism 2 feed rate showed a considerable effect on the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio while severalfold changes in feed sulfate concentrations were accompanied by slight changes in the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine the presence of abundant sulfate and bicarbonate in brine and feedwater had no significant effect on nitrate removal by the standard aer column no significant change in the sulfate preference of standard aers was observed in sulfate nitrate binary exchange reactions as the activation by optimized brine did not modify the functional groups of standard aers 3 the optimized brine composition for circular activation regeneration of the standard aer column and electrochemical treatment to transform nitrate in brine to n2 gas constituted a closed loop to achieve selective nitrate removal from groundwater during long term

determining the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine while the feed sulfate concentration 145 345 mg l slightly changed the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio the use of optimized ternary brine with a sulfate chloride bicarbonate equivalent ratio of 42 5 2 stably achieved long term highly selective nitrate removal from groundwater in the standard aer column process with brine electrochemical treatment the possible mechanism for nitrate selectivity included the modification of the sulfate and bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratios in the standard aer column by the optimized brine in circular activation regeneration mode this changed the column elution and breakthrough curves inhibited the competition of sulfate and bicarbonate for ion exchange sites during exhaustion according to the separation factor and finally achieved selective nitrate removal from feedwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrate selective ion exchange groundwater brine reuse resin activation 1 introduction the contamination of groundwater by nitrate is one of the most serious water pollution problems worldwide biddau et al 2019 as high nitrate levels in drinking water may lead to blue baby syndrome in infants and gastrointestinal cancer in adults su et al 2017 the anion exchange process through polymeric strong base anion exchange resins aers is often considered an

hydrophobic nitrate clifford and liu 1993 vanderhoek et al 1988 the preference for sulfate over nitrate on standard aers i e sulfate selective aers leads to low nitrate adsorption capacity nitrate peaking or dumping after nitrate breakthrough hekmatzadeh et al 2012 and higher corrosivity and negative effects on health associated with higher chloride content in product water clifford and liu

hekmatzadeh et al 2012 and etc have been developed to overcome those shortcomings mentioned above mcadam and judd 2008 as compared with standard aers however those nitrate selective aers are generally quite expensive which emerges as the primary obstacle against its wide application in water treatment plant in the aer packed column process plug flow passing through the aer column can be divided into many identical segments all anions in water passing through the column can equilibrate in each column segment before being transferred to the next column segment choe et al 2015 during exhaustion or regeneration the general formula of ion exchange reactions between a given anion b n univalent b e g bicarbonate or bivalent b2 e g sulfate ions and the univalent counterion a chloride ion in most cases in the feedwater or brine and aer phase is as follows 1 n r a b n r n b n n a the ion exchange of the given anion over the univalent counterion can be evaluated by the separation factor α calculated as follows gu et al 2004 hu et al 2016 2 α a b n r n b n r a a b n where rn bn and r a are the equilibrium equivalent concentrations of the given anion and the univalent counterion in the aer phase while bn and a are their equilibrium equivalent concentrations in the aqueous phase respectively typically the anionic selectivity sequence on standard aers i e sulfate nitrate chloride bicarbonate hekmatzadeh et al 2012 is mainly related to differences in the physicochemical characteristics of these anions hu et al 2016 and their ionic strengths in solution bergquist et al 2016 the development of nitrate selective aers demonstrates that the anionic selectivity sequence on aers will vary with the change in aer properties i e hydrophobicity when modifying their functional groups and or polymer backbones gu et al 2007 hsu and singer 2010 song et al 2012 as shown in eq 2 however the success or failure of ion exchange of the given anion over the univalent counterion was also determined by the equivalent ratio of the given anion to the univalent counterion i e rn bn r a in aer phase against that i e bn a in feedwater during exhaustion or brine during regeneration furthermore as the aer process is often operated with alternating exhaustion and regeneration cycles the equivalent ratio of a given anion to the univalent counterion in recycled brine might influence their equivalent ratio in the aer during activation regeneration and further influence the ion exchange performance of the given anion during exhaustion according to the separation factor under these conditions besides modifying aer properties i e nitrate selective aers gu et al 2007 hsu and singer 2010 song et al 2012 there may be another strategy to achieve nitrate selectivity in a standard aer column process at a low cost i e by optimizing the equivalent ratio of competing anions to the univalent counterion in recycled brine to inhibit their competition for ion exchange sites during exhaustion following circular activation of a standard aer column by bicarbonate or sulfate chloride binary brine we investigated the potential effect of the bicarbonate or sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in binary brine on anionic removal performance during exhaustion and demonstrated the presence of a critical bicarbonate or sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in binary brine to achieve zero net bicarbonate or sulfate removal from feedwater subsequently following evaluation of the potential effects of feed rate and feed sulfate concentration on the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine we demonstrated the feasibility of selective nitrate removal from groundwater by optimizing ternary brine sulfate chloride bicarbonate over 13 exhaustion regeneration cycles in the standard aer column process with brine electrochemical treatment finally we propose a mechanism for selective nitrate removal in the standard aer column process with optimized brine after investigating the effects of circular activation regeneration by optimized brine on column elution and breakthrough curves and sulfate nitrate binary exchange reactions 2 material and methods 2 1 materials reagent

analytical instruments gmbh kleve germany the overall precision of the water quality analysis was verified by replicate analysis and calculation of the relative percentage deviation the target of which was 10 3 results and discussion the majority of previous studies on nitrate selective aers used sulfate as a competing anion choe et al 2015 hekmatzadeh et al 2012 hu et al 2016 it is reported that bicarbonate also has an adverse effect on nitrate adsorption choe et al 2015 song et al 2012 although it has lower selectivity than nitrate and chloride hekmatzadeh et al 2012 in this study both sulfate and bicarbonate were selected as competing anions to investigate the potential effects of brine optimization on the selective nitrate removal performance of a standard aer column process fig s2 shows the long term removal of nitrate sulfate and bicarbonate from feedwater during exhaustion when nacl brine is reused during 24 exhaustion regeneration cycles in a standard aer column process without brine purification or replacement along with their accumulation in recycled brine during regeneration consistent with previous studies of standard aer columns with recycling of brine for reuse lehman et al 2008 liu and clifford 1996 sun et al 2015 zheng et al 2011 preferential sulfate removal 96 was observed throughout the long term cyclic operation while nitrate and bicarbonate removal gradually decreased from 100 to 38 and from 28 to 16 respectively cyclic operation led to remarkable accumulation of these three target anions in recycled nacl brine the observations also imply a dynamic increase in the equivalent ratio of all three target anions relative to chloride i e the counter anion in the recycled brine fig s3 shows that the rough estimates of the amounts of nitrate and bicarbonate adsorbed on the standard aer column increased gradually to the peak values during the 16th and 10th exhaustion regeneration cycle respectively and then remained stable in previous study lehman et al 2008 noticed that both sulfate and bicarbonate concentrations in recycled nacl brine reached a steady state after 13 15 cycles of the standard aer column process for groundwater treatment depending on the feedwater ionic concentrations brine concentration and removal effectiveness the presence of a steady state for these anions in the standard aer column or in recycled brine demonstrated that there is an inherent relation of these anions in feedwater in the standard aer column and in recycled brine previously the failure of nitrate removal by standard aers is typically attributed to the stronger competition of sulfate for ion exchange sites li et al 2019 liu and clifford 1996 however it seems in this study that the failure to remove nitrate and bicarbonate may also have been attributable to the considerable increases in their equivalent ratios to chloride in the recycled brine and in the standard aer column which may inhibit their ion exchange capacity during exhaustion 3 1 effects of the bicarbonate or sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine for circular activation of the standard aer column on anionic removal performance during exhaustion bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratio in brine incorporation of bicarbonate into the chloride based brine was reported to exert small effects on standard aer exhaustion and regeneration with regard to sulfate nitrate and chloride because bicarbonate based brine is weaker than chloride based brine li et al 2015 the weak effects of a wide range of bicarbonate concentrations in chloride based brine on anionic removal performance during exhaustion was demonstrated in fig 1 a following circular activation of the standard aer column by brine with various bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratios the sulfate and nitrate removal rates during exhaustion remained constant at 100 during exhaustion however varied bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratios in brine seemed to considerably influence bicarbonate removal during exhaustion the bicarbonate concentration in the product water increased gradually with increases in the bicarbonate equivalent fraction in the recycled brine and finally exceeded the bicarbonate concentration in the feedwater i e negative bicarbonate removal or bicarbonate leakage or dumping into the product water at a bicarbonate equivalent fraction of 0 33 these results demonstrated that the failure to remove bicarbonate observed in fig s2 was attributable to an excessively high bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratio in the recycled brine with the development of continuous operation which finally inhibit the ion exchange capacity of bicarbonate during exhaustion when the bicarbonate equivalent fraction in brine was 0 29 i e the critical bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratio of 2 5 the bicarbonate concentrations in the feedwater and the product water were approximately equivalent i e 5 bicarbonate removal the inhibitory effects of the critical bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratio in recycled brine on long term bicarbonate removal performance were further demonstrated by 15 exhaustion regeneration cycles of the standard aer column process when the brine with the critical bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratio was used to circularly activate or regenerate the standard aer column fig s4 in addition to no significant 5 bicarbonate removal or accumulation remarkable sulfate removal 90 94 and accumulation and remarkable nitrate removal and accumulation were consistently observed with cyclic operation therefore the ratio of 2 5 is referred to as the critical bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratio in brine for activation of the standard aer column to inhibit the competition of bicarbonate for ion exchange sites during exhaustion sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine as shown in fig 1b following circular activation of the standard aer column by brine with various sulfate chloride equivalent ratios nitrate removal remained constant at 100 during exhaustion in most cases the remarkable amounts of sulfate in both feedwater and brine had a negligible influence on nitrate removal performance during exhaustion however with the increase in the sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine bicarbonate removal by the activated standard aer column decreased markedly from 75 to 17 the increase in the sulfate chloride equivalent ratios in brine also considerably influenced sulfate removal performance during exhaustion while the sulfate concentration in the product water increased gradually and finally exceeded its concentration in the feedwater i e negative sulfate removal or sulfate leakage or dumping into the product water these results demonstrated that the failure to remove could be achieved at an excessively high sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in the recycled brine which finally inhibit the ion exchange capacity of sulfate during exhaustion with a sulfate equivalent fraction in brine of 0 89 i e the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio of 8 1 the sulfate concentrations in the feedwater and product water were approximately equivalent i e 5 sulfate removal the inhibitory effect of the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in recycled brine on long term sulfate removal performance was further demonstrated by 12 exhaustion regeneration cycles of the standard aer column process when the brine with the critical equivalent ratio was used to activate or regenerate the standard aer column fig s5 no significant 5 sulfate removal and accumulation as well as low bicarbonate removal 14 21 and accumulation and marked nitrate removal and accumulation were consistently observed with cyclic operation therefore the ratio of 8 1 was referred to as the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine for activation of the standard aer column to inhibit the competitive capacity of sulfate for ion exchange sites during exhaustion in contrast to previous conclusions boumediene and achour 2004 hekmatzadeh et al 2012 li et al 2019 liu and clifford 1996 the results presented here confirmed that the presence of abundant sulfate in brine and feedwater had no significant effect on the nitrate removal performance of the standard aer column 3 2 effects of feed parameters on the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine feed rate a higher feed rate generally increases the turbulence of flow in the fixed bed process resulting in a shorter breakthrough time and faster saturation hekmatzadeh et al 2012 li and yang 2015 xu et al 2013 in this study following circular activation of the standard aer column by brine with various sulfate chloride equivalent ratios the effects of feed rate i e 6 fig 1b 12 and 18 fig 2 bv h on the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine were investigated the feed rate seemed to play a key role in determining the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine with increasing feed rate the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratios in brine changed from 8 1 at 6 bv h to 6 1 at 12 and 18 bv h as reported previously hekmatzadeh et al 2012 li and yang 2015 xu et al 2013 the increase in feed rate markedly influenced nitrate and bicarbonate removal in all cases in this study the world health organization who recommends drinking water nitrate concentrations 50 mg l who 2011 drinking water satisfying this threshold at a feed rate of 18 bv apparently cannot be produced in most cases although efficient nitrate removal i e 55 84 was still achieved therefore a low feed rate e g 10 bv h during exhaustion is recommended for the standard aer column process feed sulfate concentration in this study following circular activation of the standard aer column by brine with various sulfate chloride equivalent ratios the effects of feed sulfate concentration i e 145 fig 1b 245 and 345 fig 3 mg l on the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine were investigated with increasing feed sulfate concentration the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine increased slightly from 8 1 for 145 mg l sulfate to 17 2 for 245 mg l sulfate and then to 9 1 for 345 mg l sulfate these observations suggested that the severalfold change in feed sulfate concentration is accompanied by a slight change in the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine the variation in feed sulfate concentration hardly influenced the nitrate removal performance by the circularly activated standard aer column in all cases and nitrate levels in the product water remained constant at extremely low levels figs 1b and 3 in comparison with the results at 145 mg l sulfate feed sulfate concentrations of 245 345 mg l significantly reduced bicarbonate removal at low sulfate chloride equivalent ratios in the brine 3 3 long term anionic removal and accumulation characteristics of the standard aer column process with optimized brine and brine electrochemical treatment in this study we combined the critical sulfate chloride and bicarbonate chloride equivalent ratios to produce optimized ternary brine with a sulfate chloride bicarbonate equivalent ratio of 42 5 2 this was tentatively used to activate or regenerate the standard aer column during 13 exhaustion regeneration cycles and the long term anionic removal and accumulation performance was further investigated after every four exhaustion regeneration cycles the spent brine was purified by electrochemical treatment to remove nitrate and then recovered to activate the standard aer column prior to the next exhaustion regeneration cycle the results are illustrated in fig 4 in previous studies unitary brines such as naoh hcl nacl and nh4cl brine solutions sun et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 and binary brines such as nacl naoh zheng et al 2017 and nacl nahco3 li et al 2015 were used to regenerate the exhausted aers this is the first report of the simultaneous addition of sulfate and bicarbonate to brine and use of a ternary brine for aer regeneration different from the standard aer column process shown in fig s2 following standard aer activation regeneration by the optimized brine no significant bicarbonate removal 5 and low sulfate removal 2 22 were consistently observed throughout the long term cyclic operation periods as illustrated in fig 4 when their concentrations in the recycled brine remained stable furthermore the sulfate removal maximum 22 of the optimized ternary brine shown in fig 4 was higher than that 5 of the binary brine sulfate chloride shown in fig s5 possibly due to a less precise brine composition as it was produced by a combination of two critical binary equivalent ratios additionally vanderhoek et al 1988 noted 0 45 sulfate removal and no significant bicarbonate removal from feedwater by a nitrate selective aer column in this study following activation regeneration by the optimized brine the standard aer column may also show no or low sulfate and bicarbonate removals from feedwater during long term cyclic operation in contrast although increased carbon chain length of functional groups produced those nitrate selective aers boumediene and achour 2004 hekmatzadeh et al 2012 sowmya and meenakshi 2014 it also reduced their exchange capacity for selective nitrate removal samatya et al 2006 it is often reported that sulfate buildup in the resin phase affects the standard aer column to a much greater extent than the nitrate selective aer column in terms of nitrate removal from feedwater liu and clifford 1996 however as illustrated in fig 4 figs s4 and s5 the sulfate and bicarbonate buildup in the standard aer column induced by circular activation using the optimized brine did not present a major obstacle to nitrate removal and accumulation performance in fact it aided selective nitrate removal and accumulation by inhibiting ion exchange of sulfate and bicarbonate so that quality drinking water with low chloride content could be produced during long term cyclic operation the results presented here also demonstrated that although many aer sites are occupied by competing anions there are still sufficient ion exchange sites available for nitrate removal from feedwater the process of electrolytic decomposition of nitrate to harmless nitrogen gas has attracted a great deal of attention due to its minimal generation of secondary waste ease of operation yu and kupferle 2008 high treatment efficiency and small equipment footprint li et al 2009a 2009b in the presence of abundant chloride in solution electrolytic decomposition was achieved by a combination of reduction of nitrate on the cathode and oxidization of ammonia on the anode by free chlorine clo generated during chloride oxidization su et al 2017 yu and kupferle 2008 in this study prior to spent brine purification treatment the nitrate concentration in the product water increased gradually from 1 to 13 to 39 43 mg l after 4 5 exhaustion regeneration cycles while nitrate in brine increased gradually from 114 to 202 to 612 1064 mg l following electrochemical treatment the nitrate level in spent brine was efficiently decreased to 90 125 mg l i e 84 85 removal and no detectable byproducts e g ammonia and nitrite were detected in the treated brine data not shown no significant effects of electrochemical treatment on bicarbonate and sulfate concentrations in the recycled brine were observed furthermore the electrochemically treated brine eluted nitrate residue on aers resulting in a nitrate level to 167 202 mg l in the recycled brine prior to the next exhaustion regeneration cycle subsequent observations confirmed that electrochemically treated brine effectively restored the capacity of the standard aer column for nitrate removal from feedwater during subsequent long term cyclic operation therefore the electrochemical process can be used in a closed loop to selectively and completely remove nitrate from spent brine from both an economic and environmental standpoint this provides a good solution to the problem of disposal of the spent brine that is frequently generated during the previous aer process electrochemical treatment can reduce the nitrate concentration in spent brine to close to zero paidar et al 2004 however taking mass transfer limitations and low current efficiency at low nitrate concentrations into account paidar et al 2004 it would be advantageous to terminate the electrochemical process of spent brine at a relatively high nitrate concentration e g around 100 mg l in this study 3 4 nitrate selective removal

the exhausted standard aer column as the control consistent with a previous study lehman et al 2008 li et al 2015 in the control typical elution peaks for these model anions were seen as shown in fig 5a finally three model anions were completely eluted from the exhausted column to produce an effluent concentration of 0 mg l in contrast under circular activation regeneration mode the standard aer column exhibited markedly different anionic elution curves as shown in fig 5b all anionic concentrations in the brine tank increased gradually to the highest level and then remained constant their maximum concentrations were far lower than those achieved in the control the circular activation regeneration mode finally achieved equilibria of three anions between aers and brine similar to batch adsorption test under these conditions adsorptive equilibrium between aer and brine may result in a remarkable influence of brine composition on the anionic equivalent ratio in a standard aer column that is a low high equivalent ratio of sulfate bicarbonate chloride in recycled brine will result in a low high anionic equivalent ratio on the standard aer column during circular activation regeneration furthermore for the feedwater with a fixed equivalent ratio of sulfate bicarbonate chloride a low high equivalent ratio of sulfate bicarbonate chloride in recycled brine will finally result in a low high separator value during exhaustion according to eq 2 this indicated favorable unfavorable selectivity of the standard aer column for sulfate bicarbonate over chloride i e positive or negative sulfate bicarbonate removal during exhaustion the mechanism explained why as observed in figs 1 3 with the increase in equivalent ratio of sulfate bicarbonate chloride in recycled brine net sulfate bicarbonate removal and subsequent sulfate bicarbonate dumping by the standard aer column was observed in a stepwise manner following the activation by designed brine thus selective nitrate removal by the standard aer column was finally achieved at the critical equivalent ratio of sulfate bicarbonate chloride in recycled brine by circular activation regeneration of the optimized brine effects of circular activation by optimized brine on column breakthrough curves the column breakthrough test was often used in previous studies to demonstrate the selective capacity of nitrate selective aers for nitrate choe et al 2015 gu et al 2004 liu and clifford 1996 in which sulfate will be always driven off these aers by nitrate in the feedwater during exhaustion i e earlier sulfate breakthrough than nitrate breakthrough choe et al 2015 liu and clifford 1996 in this study the potential effects of circular activation by optimized brine on the anionic breakthrough curves of the standard aer column were evaluated using a nonactivated standard aer column as a control and the results are shown in fig 6 as reported previously hekmatzadeh et al 2012 lehman et al 2008 sun et al 2015 effluent anionic concentrations of the nonactivated standard aer column showed a normal anionic breakthrough profile fig 6a bicarbonate broke through first and the nitrate concentration in the product water rose sharply from 0 mg l before 196 bv to above that in the feedwater after 270 bv while no sulfate was detected in the product water throughout the experimental period in contrast following activation by the optimized brine the standard aer column exhibited different column breakthrough curves fig 6b there was a far higher bicarbonate concentration in product water at the beginning than that shown in fig 6a in comparison with sulfate and bicarbonate nitrate bound preferentially to the standard aer column circularly activated by optimized brine the column breakthrough curve presented here was similar to those reported for nitrate selective aers gu et al 2004 hekmatzadeh et al 2012 liu and clifford 1996 sowmya and meenakshi 2014 it indicated that circular activation of the standard aer column by the optimized brine made it feasible to achieve nitrate selectivity in the steady state of the nitrate selective aer system the sulfate mass balance showed that more than 90 of the sulfate loaded on aer sites during the first 80 bvs of exhaustion was subsequently replaced by nitrate in the feedwater during the remaining exhaustion period liu and clifford 1996 as shown in column breakthrough curves which explained why no net sulfate removal was observed during the steady state periods of nitrate selective aer previously liu and clifford 1996 or in this study fig 4 and fig s5 effects of circular activation by optimized brine on sulfate nitrate binary exchange reactions in previous studies qualitative binary ion exchange plots and quantitative separation factor calculations were used to demonstrate the nitrate selective capacities of many nitrate selective aers ebrahimi and roberts 2016 gu et al 2004 hu et al 2016 in this study the activated standard aers were prepared in fixed bed columns using the optimized brine with a sulfate chloride bicarbonate equivalent ratio of 30 5 2 subsequently the selectivity of activated and nonactivated standard aers for sulfate and nitrate were evaluated by sulfate nitrate binary ion exchange reactions as described by gu et al 2004 with minor modifications the separation factor α for sulfate i e the given anion in this test and nitrate i e the mobile counterion in this test was calculated according to eq 2 based on the data nearest the point at which the equivalent ionic fraction in solution was 0 5 a separation value 1 indicates favorable selectivity of aer for sulfate over nitrate while a higher value indicates greater sulfate selectivity hu et al 2016 a plot of the sulfate equivalent concentration fractions on aer y axis versus solution x axis is shown in fig s6 the majority of the data points remained above the 1 1 line indicating greater selectivity for sulfate over nitrate via either nonactivated or activated standard aer furthermore the separation values of activated and nonactivated standard aer were 1 14 and 1 01 respectively which approximated those reported in previous studies for standard aers e g 1 71 137 for 32 standard aers clifford and weber 1983 the results indicated no significant change in the anionic preference of standard aer where activation by optimized brine did not modify its functional groups 3 5 significance of this investigation the results present here indicated that the circular activation regeneration mode modified the anionic equivalent ratio in the standard aer column according to the brine composition fig 5 which in turn influenced the column breakthrough curves of the standard aer column fig 6 and played a key role in determining the removal performance of a given anion during exhaustion according to the separation factor under these conditions no removal from feedwater and accumulation in recycled brine of sulfate and bicarbonate were frequently observed during long term cyclic operation of the standard aer column when the optimized brine with the critical equivalent ratio was used as shown in figs s4 and s5 and fig 4 in this study the exhaustion and regeneration cycles had a common equivalent ratio of the competing anion to chloride ion in the standard aer column as the standard aer column process was operated with alternating exhaustion and regeneration cycles therefore the inhibitory effect of the competing anions in optimized brine on their own ion exchange performance during exhaustion and regeneration can be explained by the approximate equivalent ratios in the feedwater and the optimized brine for example the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratios in recycled brine were 8 0 8 5 and 9 0 for equivalent ratios of sulfate chloride ion in feedwater of 5 3 9 5 and 13 3 respectively at feed sulfate concentrations of 135 243 and 342 mg l respectively selective nitrate removal by the standard aer column was finally achieved through the inhibitory effect of competing anion e g sulfate or bicarbonate in optimized brine on its own ion exchange during exhaustion rather than by the anionic selectivity sequence the difference in the operational costs of the nitrate selective aers reported previously and the standard aer column activated regenerated by optimized brine introduced in this study was determined by their treatment capacity and resin costs due to their similar process design as illustrated in fig 6 the treatment capacity of the activated standard aer column process about 120 bvs of product water approximated to that of some nitrate selective aers for groundwater treatment e g 120 bvs for purolite a 520e gu et al 2004 under the conditions the operational costs of the activated regenerated standard aer column process was significantly lower than that of the nitrate selective aer process since those nitrate selective aers are generally more expensive e g 5 5 times or even higher than standard aers in this study insignificant bicarbonate and sulfate removal were consistently observed from the first cycle of the long term cyclic operation of the standard aer column with optimized brine figs s4 and s5 and fig 4 however for a nitrate selective aer system long term cyclic operation e g 33 exhaustion regeneration cycles is often required to reach a steady state characterized by no net sulfate removal from feedwater clifford and liu 1993 liu and clifford 1996 it seems that the treatment performance of the activated standard aer column in this study was even better than that of nitrate selective aers however there were still many commonalties between the nitrate selective aers reported previously and the standard aer column activated regenerated by optimized brine introduced in this study e g no net sulfate removal from feedwater was achieved after the sulfate concentration in recycled brine reached a plateau clifford and liu 1993 liu and clifford 1996 furthermore the inhibitory effect of non sulfate anions in recycled brine on their own ion exchange performance have also been reported previously for nitrate selective aers when it was also observed in this study including bicarbonate and nitrate for example bergquist et al 2016 concluded that a high concentration of nitrate in brine is principally responsible for the reduced nitrate breakthrough capacity of nitrate selective aers rather than the accumulation of sulfate or bicarbonate in the brine vanderhoek et al 1988 attributed the absence of bicarbonate removal from groundwater when using a nitrate selective aer to abundant bicarbonate on the aer column at the start of each service mode due to the higher alkalinity of the brine therefore it seems possible that the activated standard aer column by the optimized brine in this study and the nitrate selective aers share an identical nitrate selective removal mechanism i e inhibition of the ion exchange capacity of a coexisting anion during exhaustion by its anionic equivalent ratio to the chloride in optimized brine in comparison with nitrate selective aers 2 2 clifford and liu 1993 or even 16 liu and clifford 1996 g l sulfate a far higher sulfate concentration i e 43 44 g l sulfate see figs 1b and 4 in the optimized brine was required for the standard aer column in this study to inhibit its own ion exchange during exhaustion which demonstrated the advantage of nitrate selective aers over the activated standard aer column introduced in this study due to stronger hydrophobicity in recent decades various ion exchangers have been developed to selectively remove different contaminant ions including heavy metals e g cu2 bezzina et al 2019 and as v awual et al 2012 ions and other anions e g phosphate trung huu et al 2018 wu et al 2017 and perchlorate sharbatmaleki and batista 2012 sharbatmaleki et al 2015 the findings presented herein will be helpful for selective ionic removal from various water matrices 4 conclusions 1 as the standard aer column process was operated with alternating exhaustion and regeneration cycles there is an inherent relation of the equivalent ratio of coexisting anion to chloride in the feedwater in the standard aer column and in the recycled brine under these conditions accurate control of the equivalent ratio of sulfate and bicarbonate to chloride in recycled brine of the standard aer column process can achieve selective nitrate removal from feedwater and accumulation in recycled brine by inhibiting the competing capacity of sulfate and bicarbonate for ion exchange sites the circular activation regeneration mode altered the column elution and breakthrough curves and finally achieved selective nitrate removal from feedwater the activated standard aer column in this study and nitrate selective aers share an identical nitrate selective removal mechanism 2 feed rate showed a considerable effect on the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio while severalfold changes in feed sulfate concentrations were accompanied by slight changes in the critical sulfate chloride equivalent ratio in brine the presence of abundant sulfate and bicarbonate in brine and feedwater had no significant effect on nitrate removal by the standard aer column no significant change in the sulfate preference of standard aers was observed in sulfate nitrate binary exchange reactions as the activation by optimized brine did not modify the functional groups of standard aers 3 the optimized brine composition for circular activation regeneration of the standard aer column and electrochemical treatment to transform nitrate in brine to n2 gas constituted a closed loop to achieve selective nitrate removal from groundwater during long term exhaustion regeneration cyclic operation these findings could be applied for selective removal of other anions by standard aers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18102,extracellular polymer proteins have been reported to play an important role in enhancing sludge dewaterability during anaerobic digestion in our previous study however how the proteins in sludge determine sludge dewaterability remains to be determined in this work proteins from digested sludge were identified using label free proteomics analysis and its hydrophilicity hydrophobicity properties and functional groups were analysed we determined that the microbial community variation between the three stages during the anaerobic digestion process was responsible for enhancing sludge dewaterability the transformation from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity of digested sludge surface is the result of functional groups distribution variation which caused by the proteins and microbial communities this study provides a new insight into the development of anaerobic digestion based on sludge dewaterability graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion microbial community proteins hydrophilicity hydrophobicity functional groups 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is the main method of sludge stabilisation and reclamation appels et al 2008 khanal 2008 dai et al 2013 mao et al 2015a the degradation of macro molecular proteins present in the extra microcolony polymer emps layer is essential to the enhancement of sludge dewaterability during the ad process the degradation of proteins in the emps layer resulted in the destruction of the bond between organic fractions and moisture accelerating the transformation of mechanically bound moisture into free moisture the reduction of mechanically bound moisture indicates sludge dewaterability better zhang et al 2019 there are three stages in the ad process acidification gasification and stabilisation this study seeks to determine the mechanisms affecting sludge dewaterability occurring during anaerobic digestion based on our previous study zhang et al 2019 many studies have reported on improvement in activated sludge dewaterability due to the destruction of extracellular polymeric substances eps under the action of a chemical adjuvant cai et al 2018 dai et al 2018 wu et al 2018 guo et al 2019 zhen et al 2019 wu et al 2017a reported the effect of calcium peroxide pre treatments on free amino and carbonyl groups of representative extracellular proteins present in activated sludge during sludge dewatering however how the proteins present in sludge affect sludge dewaterability still needs to be explored previous studies have shown that extracellular proteins in sludge are mainly derived from cell decline and cell lysis zhang et al 2015a 2015b wu et al 2017b therefore the protein in digested sludge can be measured by using label free quantitative technique proteomics because eps is produced by microorganisms the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity is surely related to the microbial composition of the sludge evidence suggests that the ad process has a significant impact on microbial structure and community thus affecting the production of eps shin et al 2010 nelson et al 2011 supaphol et al 2011 de vrieze et al 2017 the microorganisms present at each stage of anaerobic digestion may be independent or interact with each other nelson et al 2011 therefore microbial community structure or composition could potentially affect sludge eps components the exploration of microbial community variations in response to the ad process are crucial and necessary to insight into sludge dewatering eps are the macromolecules that consist of polysaccharides and proteins sheng et al 2010 it is the eps that makes up the sludge surface and determines the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of sludge a large amount of research has been conducted regarding the flocculation capacity of sludge and surface hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of sludge liu et al 2007 su et al 2013 however the relationship between sludge proteins and sludge surface hydrophilicity hydrophobicity characteristics is not yet clear it is necessary to investigate the relationship between sludge proteins and sludge hydrophilicity hydrophobicity properties along with sludge dewaterability these results will help improve sludge reduction efficacy the objective of this study was to investigate the bacterial and archaeal microbial community present during the ad process the protein in digested sludge was analysed using label free quantitative technique proteomics the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of protein in sludge was measured using contact angle and surface free energy the different functional groups of sludge responsible for its hydrophilicity hydrophobicity were explored the results are significant to optimise the anaerobic digestion process as well as promote the development of anaerobic

union city ca usa sequencing was carried out on a miseq platform at the majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 2 2 label free quantitative technique for proteomic analysis proteins from the digested sludge samples was identified using label free quantitative technique proteomics two biological replicates were treated for each digested sludge sample the steps included reductive alkylation and protease digestion pre separation of peptides and liquid chromatography lc ms ms analysis the procedure of label free quantitative technique proteomic is as follows the proteins were isolated from rs ds 0 digested sludge from day 0 acidification stage ds 10 gasification stage and ds 30 stabilisation stage using the method described above and subjected to label free proteomics analysis then the content of the digested sludge protein were determined by using bradford or bca measurements afterwards the sample quality was evaluated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page to determine whether the sample quality met the requirements of subsequent experiments the samples that met quality standards were reduced by alkylation equal amount samples were processed with protease digestion by trypsin and then the quality the digested peptides was analysed at last liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms analysis was performed on an equal amount of samples the procedures for lc ms ms analysis are detailed in the supplementary material 2 3 contact angle and surface characteristic evaluation the interfacial tension and surface free energy of digested sludge was estimated using a contact angle approach jc 2000a powereach co shanghai china homogeneous sludge layers were prepared and the sludge layers were placed on the slide as liu et al 2007 describes and then the advancing contact angles were directly measured using the sessile drop technique with a drop of water 1 bromonaphthalene and formamide all contact angle values were based on the arithmetic means of at least five independent measurements the contact angle between sludge and moisture was used to characterise the relative sludge hydrophobicity the larger the contact angle between sludge and water is the better the floc s hydrophobicity the surface tension of digested sludge total interfacial tension and total interfacial free energy between digested sludge and water was calculated per the previous study of liu et al 2007 2 4 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy a mixture of 1 2 mg of freeze dried digested sludge samples and 100 mg of potassium bromide kbr ir grade was pressed into pellets then the pellets were ground to be homogenised and analysed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet 5700 from 400 to 4000 cm 1 the ftir results were normalised by dividing them by the sum of the transmittance values 2 5 analytical methods and statistical analysis different transverse relaxation time can be obtained according to different binding energy between different kinds of moisture and sludge particles the corresponding can be classified as free moisture mechanically bound moisture and bound moisture by using 1h low field nuclear magnetic resonance nyman et al 2008 mao et al 2015b 2017 wu et al 2019 separate tables containing the abundances of the operational taxonomic units otus and the taxonomic assignments were generated for the bacteria and archaea the main element and structure data was established using principal component analysis pca based on the community abundance data obtained by multi group difference test rigorous statistical methods were used to test the hypothesis of differences in species among different groups or samples of microbial communities to evaluate the significance level of differences in species abundance and to determine the species that were significantly different among groups or samples the analysis can be classified at different levels such as phylum class order family genus species and otus one way anova is the rank sum test of two independent samples that is extended to three or more groups it is a method of nonparametric testing for multiple groups three or more of independent samples this analysis can be used to analyse the significance difference in species in multiple groups of samples and calculate the false discovery rate q value for p value 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial community analysis comparison of taxonomic patterns during anaerobic digestion are shown in figs 1 2 the 16s rrna reads of 455 035 and 336 324 bacteria and archaea were obtained from digested sludge samples at different digestion times day 0 3 5 10 15 20 30 and 40 and these sequences were grouped into otus with a similarity of 97 in order to visualise the phylogenetic diversities of the microbial communities 3 1 1 microbial community composition fig 1a shows the distribution of bacterial communities from eight samples at the phylum level the microbial community composition during anaerobic digestion indicated that the relative abundance of dominant species in different digested sludge samples was different among the microbial species found in sludge samples with different digestion times the first 16 dominant most abundant genera accounted for more than 99 of the total sequence among them the dominant ones were firmicutes proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes this corresponded well with the findings reported by nelson et al and vrieze et al nelson et al 2011 de vrieze et al 2017 the population of firmicutes increased in the acidification stage fig s1 firmicutes are known to produce extracellular enzymes including cellulose lipase and protease to hydrolyse cellulose lipids proteins and lignin lim et al 2014 some genus of firmicutes comprised of syntrophic acetogens are capable of butyrate and propionate degradation nelson et al 2011 and butyrate and its analogues were used to produce acetic acid garcia pena et al 2011 the proportion of firmicutes increases indicating that the ad process can better hydrolyse proteins carbohydrates and lipids and other organic fractions during the acidification stage most of the sequences in firmicutes were assigned to the class clostridia 32 93 class bacilli 2 04 class erysipelotrichia 0 42 and the total percentage of other classes such as limnochordia negativicutes and unclassified p firmicutes was 0 71 table s3 during the process of ad the number of proteobacteria increased fig s1 proteobacteria can degrade organic acids including acetate nelson et al 2011 the enhanced sludge dewaterability in anaerobic digestion process is attributed to the degradation of organic matters during the anaerobic digestion process zhang et al 2019 therefore proteobacteria may play a role in improving sludge dewaterability it is well known that some members of proteobacteria smithella are involved in the co culture oxidation of propionate to acetate for the use of acetylated methanogens ariesyady et al 2007 the genus within the bacteroidetes that produces propionate and acetate as its primary fermentation products which is capable of sugar fermentation via the mixed acid pathway is saccharolytic and produces acetate and succinate as its primary fermentation end products nelson et al 2011 actinobacteria associated with propionate production decreased during three stages in anaerobic digestion systems bacterial communities are responsible for the conversion of organic fractions to volatile fatty acids vfas carbon dioxide and hydrogen while archaea communities are responsible for converting acetate or carbon dioxide to methane wan et al 2013 the distribution of archaea sequences at the genus level and the pca analysis basing on all the otus in eight samples is shown in figs 1b and 2b as shown in fig 1b methanobacterium was the predominant archaea genus representing approximately 81 7 of the archaea sequences assigned to a genus the genera methanomassiliicoccus and methanobrevibacter represented roughly 9 42 and 2 34 of genus assigned sequences on day 0 respectively methanobacterium methasarcina methanomassiliicoccus and methanobrevibacter were the predominant archaea genera the other six methanogen genera were only represented by a small number of sequences in the dataset fig 1b these results are in general agreement with findings reported in the literature indicating the predominant methanogens in ad systems chen et al 2017 de vrieze et al 2017 during the process of ad archaea shifted in the acidification stage which showed that the relative abundance of strictly hydrogen producing methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter decreased while the multifunctional acetylated clastic methanosarcina increased fig s2 feng et al 2015 chen et al 2017 during the gasification stage the archaea community varies the relative abundance of methanobacterium increased while that of methanosarcina decreased the archaea community shows the same trend during the stabilisation stage methanobacterium sp is the dominant genus fig s2 most methanobacterium are usually single celled but many studies have reported that methanosarcina is associated with eps degradation and the formation of aggregates of methanosarcina has been observed batstone et al 2006 milkevych and batstone 2014 yang et al 2016 on the one hand eps contains a large amount of moisture due to the natural moisture holding capacity of organic fractions sheng et al 2010 the degradation of organic fractions during ad process leads to diminishing the bond between organic fractions and mechanically bound moisture accelerating the mechanically bound moisture transform into free moisture zhang et al 2019 on the other hand the degradation of methanosarcina destroys aggregates structure and provides a way for the release of mechanically bound moisture the archaea may be the cause of protein content variation and conversion of the protein content in the emps layer is responsible for the transformation of mechanically bound moisture into free moisture therefore the archaea might be crucial to sludge dewatering 3 1 2 pca of microbial community the evolution in community composition over time and with respect to the different digestion stages was analysed via pca fig 2a and b the different plot legend represents the sludge samples of three stages acidification gasification and stabilisation of the anaerobic digestion process the bacteria component was different in the three stages of sludge samples analysed by pca which suggests that the bacteria microbial community was changed as digestion time increased indicating that the bacteria community was sensitive to anaerobic digestion fig 2a the results show that different stages of anaerobic digestion sludge samples of microbial components have obvious differences the pc1 and pc2 shaft axis to the interpretation of the results were 73 97 and 16 18 respectively there were significant differences between archaea sequences at the otu level in the three stages during the ad process fig 2b indicates the archaea community was varied depending on digestion time pc1 and pc2 shaft axis to the interpretation of the results were 87 4 and 11 12 respectively 3 1 3 the significance test and analysis between multi groups a significant difference in community composition was observed on different digestion stage for bacteria and archaea tables 1 and 2 these indicate a strong deviation from the original community both for archaea and bacteria despite similar operational conditions for the inoculum for the bacterial community on the phylum level species from the samples in the three stages of acidification gasification and stabilisation and the results showed that the phylum level species composition of the samples in the three stages had significant differences at the phylum level one way anova p 0 05 table 1 among which such as actinobacteria saccharibacteria and chlorob had significant differences one way anova p 0 05 in contrast in the archaea community the composition of the samples in the three stages were identified as not significantly different at the phylum level one way anova p 0 05 significance test and analysis of the differences among groups of dominant genera in digested sludge samples at different stages of acidification gasification and stabilisation show that methanobacterium have significant differences among the three dominant groups at the genus level one way anova p 0 05 table 2 3 2 identification and function analysis of digested sludge protein 3 2 1 classification of proteins in digested sludge as fig 3 shows according to the gene ontology go all proteins obtained quantitatively were annotated with functional notes to explore the biological functions of these proteins through the classification plot of go the classification of all genetic products of a species is better understood genes can be classified and annotated according to their molecular function mf cellular component cc and biological process bp fig 3a shows the classification of proteins according to their molecular functions molecular functional proteins mainly include binding catalytic and transporter activities the most abundant type is the protein with catalytic activity and binding accounting for 51 12 and 39 74 respectively of these 1397 proteins are relevant to biologically catalysed reactions the catalytic activity proteins in the eps could promote the macromolecule hydrolysis and provide carbon and energy sources for heterotrophic bacteria zhang et al 2015a which accelerates cell lysis and hydrolysis and the destruction of eps structure zhang et al 2015a macro molecular organic fractions was hydrolyzed into micro molecular organic acids in the stage of acidification while during gasification stage organic acids were converted into methane and carbon dioxide destroyed the bond between moisture and organic fractions which was helpful to release mechanically bound moisture and improve sludge dewaterability neyens et al 2004 garcía bernet et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 the proteins related to binding activity were also further classified into many sub groups from digested sludge samples and heterocyclic compound binding ion binding cation binding anion binding carbohydrate derivative binding and atp binding were the most common fig s3 the functions of heterocyclic compound binding were also derived from 673 614 and 577 protein groups from the acidification gasification and stabilisation stages the number of anion cationic binding functional proteins from the three stages of anaerobic digestion was 436 398 399 378 and 370 358 respectively anion groups which interact selectively and non covalently with anions charged atoms or groups of atoms with a net negative charge while cation binding which interact selectively and non covalently with cations charged atoms or groups of atoms with a net positive charge the removal of anion binding protein indicated that the sludge dewaterability was improved during the ad process because the anion binding proteins have more free amino groups which is the main reason for the sludge surface hydrophilicity habeeb 1966 the amino groups and hydrogen bonding more energy is required to remove white and watson 2002 and amino groups are hydrophilic sludge surface presents more hydrophobic because the reduction of amino groups surface hydrophobicity is more influential for functionality than total hydrophobicity surface hydrophobicity influences intermolecular interactions such as binding of small ligands or association with other macromolecules haskard and li chan 1998 the transformation of sludge surface from hydrophilic to hydrophobic enhances sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017b the identified proteins including cell part protein containing complex organelle and membrane were the main groups of cc account for 752 49 79 342 23 49 127 8 72 and 114 7 83 respectively fig 3b cell parts which were any constituent part of a cell basic structural and functional unit of all organisms protein containing complex a stable assembly of two or more macromolecules i e proteins nucleic acids carbohydrates or lipids in which at least one component is a protein and the constituent parts function together organelle any process in which a cell a substance or a cellular entity such as a protein complex or organelle is transported tethered to or otherwise maintained in a specific location in the case of substances localisation may also be achieved via selective degradation membrane a location relative to cellular compartments and structures occupied by a macromolecular machine when it carries out a molecular function eps mainly consists of polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and other cellular components sheng et al 2010 higgins and novak 1997 in general bacterial eps help in the formation of bioflocs in sludge and contribute to its structural surface charge and settling properties and dewaterability houghton and stephenson 2002 the go analysis revealed that these proteins in biological processes consist mainly of two subcategories metabolic processes and cellular processes fig 3c suggesting that they most likely play an enzyme role in these biological processes the metabolic processes subgroup contains the largest number proteins wu et al 2017b a biological process represents a specific objective that the organism is genetically programmed to achieve biological processes are often described by their outcome or ending state e g the biological process of cell division results in the creation of two daughter cells a divided cell from a single parent cell and a biological process is accomplished by a particular set of molecular functions carried out by specific gene products or macromolecular complexes often in a highly regulated manner and in a particular temporal sequence seviour and nielsen 2010 a total of 2678 2483 and 2357 mf proteins in acidification gasification and stabilisation stages were classified respectively the most major molecular functions of these proteins were catalytic activity and binding activity the results exhibited that the main roles of proteins in digested sludge were cation anion and ion binding participation in metabolic process as well as catalysis and degradation of organic matters the structure difference among three stages of digested sludge could be associated with their proteins 3 2 2 abundance of protein the protein sequence was compared with the nr database to obtain species annotation and then protein abundance sum of corresponding species was used to calculate the abundance of this species the abundance of species in each sample is calculated at the genera level thus constructing an abundance profile at the corresponding taxonomy level fig 4 a presented the abundance of protein sequence of the sludge samples of rs ds 10 and ds 30 in the acidification gasification and stabilisation stages respectively each sample is in duplicate and measured twice we analysed the abundance of 682 species that were isolated in these three stages during anaerobic digestion the results showed that pseudomonas approximately 50 in the stage of acidification and 17 and 22 in the gasification and stabilisation stage respectively fig 4b furthermore the methanosarcina and norank showed the same trend the larger number of them in the stage of gasification and lower number of them in the stage of acidification and stabilisation the abundance of other species lower than 1 at genus level was increased during the ad process 3 2 3 significance among three stages during ad process pca was conducted to investigate the relationship among proteins in three stages of anaerobic digestion the contribution of each protein to each dimension was recorded in fig 4c the pca results showed that of the three stages of sludge samples characteristics the first component pc1 accounted for about 94 07 and the second component pc2 accounted for about 5 90 of the total variables in the data set these two components together accounted for about 99 97 of the total variables the t test function in r language was used to calculate the p value of significant difference between samples in the three stages in this study the selection criterion for significant difference expression protein was p 0 05 and fc 0 83 or fc 1 20 indeed the amounts of the shared proteins were 2686 2557 and 2718 in acidification gasification and stabilisation respectively table 3 the visual volcano plot of differential proteins is shown in fig 5 the difference of protein in each two stages was obvious we compared acidification stage rs and gasification ds 10 in a volcano plot in addition to proteins detected uniquely in the sample of acidification stage or gasification stage proteins enriched in the gasification stage included methanosarcina and norank whereas those significantly enriched in the acidification stage included pseudomonas the intensity of proteins significantly up regulated was most under the condition of p 0 01 proteins detected in the stabilisation stage ds 30 compared with the gasification stage ds 10 the intensity of proteins significantly up regulated and down regulated was strong under the condition of p 0 01 these indicating the protein significantly varied from gasification to stabilisation 3 3 hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of digested sludge the surface characteristics of sludge such as surface charge and relative hydrophobicity have important influence on the sludge dewaterability jin et al 2004 contact angle measurements for digested sludge were performed table 4 from these contact angle values surface tension of digested sludge total interfacial tension and total interfacial free energy between digested sludge and water were obtained the contact angle between digested sludge and water was increased from 65 53 day 0 to 78 56 day 15 then decreased to 71 95 day 40 a high contact angle of the digested sludge performance resulted in greater hydrophobicity properties the positive values of the surface free energy values indicate hydrophilic surfaces while negative values imply hydrophobic surfaces busscher and weerkamp 1987 öner 2000 gotoh et al 2003 van oss 2003 o connell et al 2009 based on the values given in table 4 the surface free energy of ds 30 171 61 mj m2 was more negative than that 415 63 mj m2 of rs suggesting that the sludge had more hydrophobic surfaces the result in this study confirmed that the sludge with higher hydrophobicity might dewater more easily wu et al 2017a such differences were ascribed to spatial distribution discrepancy of hydrophilicity functional groups and hydrophobicity functional groups properties of proteins 3 4 functional groups characterisation of sludge samples ftir spectra of sludge in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 fig 6 were employed to analyse the primary causes of the different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the digested sludge surface ftir spectra bands were assigned basing on previous literature sheng et al 2006 badireddy et al 2008 liu et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 the broad band around 3431 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching vibrations of o h and n h in proteins whereas the bands at 2931 cm 1 and 2870 cm 1 were attributed to the c h stretching vibrations 1700 1600 cm 1 amide i region associated with proteins 1600 1500 cm 1 amide ii region associated with proteins the c o stretching vibration of amide i exhibited at 1631 cm 1 and originated from the co stretching vibration of amide group coupled with the in phase bending of the n h bond and stretching of the c n bond whereas n h deformation vibrations of amide ii were observed at 1563 cm 1 and 1512 cm 1 1500 1300 cm 1 carboxylic group containing and hydrocarbon like compounds the band near 1384 cm 1 was assigned to c o symmetric stretching vibration of carboxyl group 1300 1200 cm 1 amide iii region associated with proteins 1200 900 cm 1 polysaccharides and nucleic acids and 900 600 cm 1 fingerprint region the band the band located at 1117 1148 cm 1 corresponded to c o and c c stretching vibration of pyranose ring which is common to all polysaccharides corresponding with previous studies various bands appeared almost in all regions of ftir implying the complex protein and polysaccharide associated functional groups and compositions of eps wang et al 2018 the detailed band assignments for ftir spectral features of digested sludges are given in table s2 based on literature screening sheng et al 2006 yuan et al 2011 as shown in fig 6 the bands at 3431 2931 1635 1526 1403 1075 and 770 cm 1 appeared in all sludge samples being consistent with the concept that eps contains proteins polysaccharides lipids dna and aromatic compounds with an abundance of functional groups such as n h nh2 co c n n h co nh coo and c h wang et al 2018 the bands peaking at 1418 cm 1 and 1117 1148 cm 1 were considered as the deformation vibration of c h in polysaccharides and c o and c c stretching vibration of pyranose ring which is common to all polysaccharides guo et al 2016 however there are no peaks in these two bands this demonstrated that proteins were the key components of digested sludge the band at 1541 cm 1 appeared in the ftir of acidification and gasification stages and disappeared in the stabilisation stage directly suggesting the presence of co nh such as amino acids and uronic acids in sludge samples and the shift of peak position confirmed that the protein amide ii region associated with proteins was disappeared wang et al 2018 polar groups such as co nh were responsible for the hydrophilicity of sludge thus the digested sludge hydrophobicity was enhanced and improved sludge dewaterability however the corresponding position in ftir of was covered by wide bands from 1403 to 1455 cm 1 wang et al 2018 while the peak intensities gasification stage was increased compared to acidification stage indicating that the coo containing compounds in digested sludge in gasification stage were more associated with amino acids than in digested sludge in the acidification stage the distinguishable ftir spectral features of digested sludge from the stabilisation stage is a result of their different organic fraction components the higher contents of co nh and amino acids associated coo in acidification and gasification stages are mainly due to the higher content of proteins in them than the sludge in the stabilisation stages wang et al 2018 the different functional group composition were suggested leading to digested sludge hydrophilic hydrophobic properties differences li et al 2016 4 conclusion 1 significance among communities of bacteria and archaea in the three stages during the ad process and conversion between archaea is responsible for protein content continuously varying in stabilisation stage 2 among proteins molecular functions catalytic activity proteins accelerating the cell lysis and hydrolysis and the destruction of eps structure which helps release mechanically bound moisture in addition sludge surface presents more hydrophobic because the reduction of anion binding proteins during the ad process 3 the increase of sludge surface hydrophobicity during the ad process is the result of functional group distribution variation caused by protein distribution and microbial community thus enhancing

18102,extracellular polymer proteins have been reported to play an important role in enhancing sludge dewaterability during anaerobic digestion in our previous study however how the proteins in sludge determine sludge dewaterability remains to be determined in this work proteins from digested sludge were identified using label free proteomics analysis and its hydrophilicity hydrophobicity properties and functional groups were analysed we determined that the microbial community variation between the three stages during the anaerobic digestion process was responsible for enhancing sludge dewaterability the transformation from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity of digested sludge surface is the result of functional groups distribution variation which caused by the proteins and microbial communities this study provides a new insight into the development of anaerobic digestion based on sludge dewaterability graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion microbial community proteins hydrophilicity hydrophobicity functional groups 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is the main method of sludge stabilisation and reclamation appels et al 2008 khanal 2008 dai et al 2013 mao et al 2015a the degradation of macro molecular proteins present in the extra microcolony polymer emps layer is essential to the enhancement of sludge dewaterability during the ad process the degradation of proteins in the emps layer resulted in the destruction of the bond between organic fractions and moisture accelerating the transformation of mechanically bound moisture into free moisture the reduction of mechanically bound moisture indicates sludge dewaterability better zhang et al 2019 there are three stages in the ad process acidification gasification and stabilisation this study seeks to determine the mechanisms affecting sludge dewaterability occurring during anaerobic digestion based on our previous study zhang et al 2019 many studies have reported on improvement in activated sludge dewaterability due to the destruction of extracellular polymeric substances eps under the action of a chemical adjuvant cai et al 2018 dai et al 2018 wu et al 2018 guo et al 2019 zhen et al 2019 wu et al 2017a reported the effect of calcium peroxide pre treatments on free amino and carbonyl groups of representative extracellular proteins present in activated sludge during sludge dewatering however how the proteins present in sludge affect sludge dewaterability still needs to be explored previous studies have shown that extracellular proteins in sludge are mainly derived from cell decline and cell lysis zhang et al 2015a 2015b wu et al 2017b therefore the protein in digested sludge can be measured by using label free quantitative technique proteomics because eps is produced by microorganisms the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity is surely related to the microbial composition of the sludge evidence suggests that the ad process has a significant impact on microbial structure and community thus affecting the production of eps shin et al 2010 nelson et al 2011 supaphol et al 2011 de vrieze et al 2017 the microorganisms present at each stage of anaerobic digestion may be independent or interact with each other nelson et al 2011 therefore microbial community structure or composition could potentially affect sludge eps components the exploration of microbial community variations in response to the ad process are crucial and necessary to insight into sludge dewatering eps are the macromolecules that consist of polysaccharides and proteins sheng et al 2010 it is the eps that makes up the sludge surface and determines the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of sludge a large amount of research has been conducted regarding the flocculation capacity of sludge and surface hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of sludge liu et al 2007 su et al 2013 however the relationship between sludge proteins and sludge surface hydrophilicity hydrophobicity characteristics is not yet clear it is necessary to investigate the relationship between sludge proteins and sludge hydrophilicity hydrophobicity properties along with sludge dewaterability these results will help improve sludge reduction efficacy the objective of this study was to investigate the bacterial and archaeal microbial community present during the ad process the protein in digested sludge was analysed using label free quantitative technique proteomics the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of protein in sludge was measured using contact angle and surface free energy the different functional groups of sludge responsible for its hydrophilicity hydrophobicity were explored the results are significant to optimise the anaerobic digestion process as well as promote the development of anaerobic digestion technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 microbial community analysis dna from digested sludge sample 0 40 days in age were extracted using fast dna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca the

union city ca usa sequencing was carried out on a miseq platform at the majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 2 2 label free quantitative technique for proteomic analysis proteins from the digested sludge samples was identified using label free quantitative technique proteomics two biological replicates were treated for each digested sludge sample the steps included reductive alkylation and protease digestion pre separation of peptides and liquid chromatography lc ms ms analysis the procedure of label free quantitative technique proteomic is as follows the proteins were isolated from rs ds 0 digested sludge from day 0 acidification stage ds 10 gasification stage and ds 30 stabilisation stage using the method described above and subjected to label free proteomics analysis then the content of the digested sludge protein were determined by using bradford or bca measurements afterwards the sample quality was evaluated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page to determine whether the sample quality met the requirements of subsequent experiments the samples that met quality standards were reduced by alkylation equal amount samples were processed with protease digestion by trypsin and then the quality the digested peptides was analysed at last liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms analysis was performed on an equal amount of samples the procedures for lc ms ms analysis are detailed in the supplementary material 2 3 contact angle and surface characteristic evaluation the interfacial tension and surface free energy of digested sludge was estimated using a contact angle approach jc 2000a powereach co shanghai china homogeneous sludge layers were prepared and the sludge layers were placed on the slide as liu et al 2007 describes and then the advancing contact angles were directly measured using the sessile drop technique with a drop of water 1 bromonaphthalene and formamide all contact angle values were based on the arithmetic means of at least five independent measurements the contact angle between sludge and moisture was used to characterise the relative sludge hydrophobicity the larger the contact angle between sludge and water is the better the floc s hydrophobicity the surface tension of digested sludge total interfacial tension and total interfacial free energy between digested sludge and water was calculated per the previous study of liu et al 2007 2 4 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy a mixture of 1 2 mg of freeze dried digested sludge samples and 100 mg of potassium bromide kbr ir grade was pressed into pellets then the pellets were ground to be homogenised and analysed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet 5700 from 400 to 4000 cm 1 the ftir results were normalised by dividing them by the sum of the transmittance values 2 5 analytical methods and statistical analysis different transverse relaxation time can be obtained according to different binding energy between different kinds of moisture and sludge particles the corresponding can be classified as free moisture mechanically bound moisture and bound moisture by using 1h low field nuclear magnetic resonance nyman et al 2008 mao et al 2015b 2017 wu et al 2019 separate tables containing the abundances of the operational taxonomic units otus and the taxonomic assignments were generated for the bacteria and archaea the main element and structure data was established using principal component analysis pca based on the community abundance data obtained by multi group difference test rigorous statistical methods were used to test the hypothesis of differences in species among different groups or samples of microbial communities to evaluate the significance level of differences in species abundance and to determine the species that were significantly different among groups or samples the analysis can be classified at different levels such as phylum class order family genus species and otus one way anova is the rank sum test of two independent samples that is extended to three or more groups it is a method of nonparametric testing for multiple groups three or more of independent samples this analysis can be used to analyse the significance difference in species in multiple groups of samples and calculate the false discovery rate q value for p value 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial community analysis comparison of taxonomic patterns during anaerobic digestion are shown in figs 1 2 the 16s rrna reads of 455 035 and 336 324 bacteria and archaea were obtained from digested sludge samples at different digestion times day 0 3 5 10 15 20 30 and 40 and these sequences were grouped into otus with a similarity of 97 in order to visualise the phylogenetic diversities of the microbial communities 3 1 1 microbial community composition fig 1a shows the distribution of bacterial communities from eight samples at the phylum level the microbial community composition during anaerobic digestion indicated that the relative abundance of dominant species in different digested sludge samples was different among the microbial species found in sludge samples with different digestion times the first 16 dominant most abundant genera accounted for more than 99 of the total sequence among them the dominant ones were firmicutes proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes this corresponded well with the findings reported by nelson et al and vrieze et al nelson et al 2011 de vrieze et al 2017 the population of firmicutes increased in the acidification stage fig s1 firmicutes are known to produce extracellular enzymes including cellulose lipase and protease to hydrolyse cellulose lipids proteins and lignin lim et al 2014 some genus of firmicutes comprised of syntrophic acetogens are capable of butyrate and propionate degradation nelson et al 2011 and butyrate and its analogues were used to produce acetic acid garcia pena et al 2011 the proportion of firmicutes increases indicating that the ad process can better hydrolyse proteins carbohydrates and lipids and other organic fractions during the acidification stage most of the sequences in firmicutes were assigned to the class clostridia 32 93 class bacilli 2 04 class erysipelotrichia 0 42 and the total percentage of other classes such as limnochordia negativicutes and unclassified p firmicutes was 0 71 table s3 during the process of ad the number of proteobacteria increased fig s1 proteobacteria can degrade organic acids including acetate nelson et al 2011 the enhanced sludge dewaterability in anaerobic digestion process is attributed to the degradation of organic matters during the anaerobic digestion process zhang et al 2019 therefore proteobacteria may play a role in improving sludge dewaterability it is well known that some members of proteobacteria smithella are involved in the co culture oxidation of propionate to acetate for the use of acetylated methanogens ariesyady et al 2007 the genus within the bacteroidetes that produces propionate and acetate as its primary fermentation products which is capable of sugar fermentation via the mixed acid pathway is saccharolytic and produces acetate and succinate as its primary fermentation end products nelson et al 2011 actinobacteria associated with propionate production decreased during three stages in anaerobic digestion systems bacterial communities are responsible for the conversion of organic fractions to volatile fatty acids vfas carbon dioxide and hydrogen while archaea communities are responsible for converting acetate or carbon dioxide to methane wan et al 2013 the distribution of archaea sequences at the genus level and the pca analysis basing on all the otus in eight samples is shown in figs 1b and 2b as shown in fig 1b methanobacterium was the predominant archaea genus representing approximately 81 7 of the archaea sequences assigned to a genus the genera methanomassiliicoccus and methanobrevibacter represented roughly 9 42 and 2 34 of genus assigned sequences on day 0 respectively methanobacterium methasarcina methanomassiliicoccus and methanobrevibacter were the predominant archaea genera the other six methanogen genera were only represented by a small number of sequences in the dataset fig 1b these results are in general agreement with findings reported in the literature indicating the predominant methanogens in ad systems chen et al 2017 de vrieze et al 2017 during the process of ad archaea shifted in the acidification stage which showed that the relative abundance of strictly hydrogen producing methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter decreased while the multifunctional acetylated clastic methanosarcina increased fig s2 feng et al 2015 chen et al 2017 during the gasification stage the archaea community varies the relative abundance of methanobacterium increased while that of methanosarcina decreased the archaea community shows the same trend during the stabilisation stage methanobacterium sp is the dominant genus fig s2 most methanobacterium are usually single celled but many studies have reported that methanosarcina is associated with eps degradation and the formation of aggregates of methanosarcina has been observed batstone et al 2006 milkevych and batstone 2014 yang et al 2016 on the one hand eps contains a large amount of moisture due to the natural moisture holding capacity of organic fractions sheng et al 2010 the degradation of organic fractions during ad process leads to diminishing the bond between organic fractions and mechanically bound moisture accelerating the mechanically bound moisture transform into free moisture zhang et al 2019 on the other hand the degradation of methanosarcina destroys aggregates structure and provides a way for the release of mechanically bound moisture the archaea may be the cause of protein content variation and conversion of the protein content in the emps layer is responsible for the transformation of mechanically bound moisture into free moisture therefore the archaea might be crucial to sludge dewatering 3 1 2 pca of microbial community the evolution in community composition over time and with respect to the different digestion stages was analysed via pca fig 2a and b the different plot legend represents the sludge samples of three stages acidification gasification and stabilisation of the anaerobic digestion process the bacteria component was different in the three stages of sludge samples analysed by pca which suggests that the bacteria microbial community was changed as digestion time increased indicating that the bacteria community was sensitive to anaerobic digestion fig 2a the results show that different stages of anaerobic digestion sludge samples of microbial components have obvious differences the pc1 and pc2 shaft axis to the interpretation of the results were 73 97 and 16 18 respectively there were significant differences between archaea sequences at the otu level in the three stages during the ad process fig 2b indicates the archaea community was varied depending on digestion time pc1 and pc2 shaft axis to the interpretation of the results were 87 4 and 11 12 respectively 3 1 3 the significance test and analysis between multi groups a significant difference in community composition was observed on different digestion stage for bacteria and archaea tables 1 and 2 these indicate a strong deviation from the original community both for archaea and bacteria despite similar operational conditions for the inoculum for the bacterial community on the phylum level species from the samples in the three stages of acidification gasification and stabilisation and the results showed that the phylum level species composition of the samples in the three stages had significant differences at the phylum level one way anova p 0 05 table 1 among which such as actinobacteria saccharibacteria and chlorob had significant differences one way anova p 0 05 in contrast in the archaea community the composition of the samples in the three stages were identified as not significantly different at the phylum level one way anova p 0 05 significance test and analysis of the differences among groups of dominant genera in digested sludge samples at different stages of acidification gasification and stabilisation show that methanobacterium have significant differences among the three dominant groups at the genus level one way anova p 0 05 table 2 3 2 identification and function analysis of digested sludge protein 3 2 1 classification of proteins in digested sludge as fig 3 shows according to the gene ontology go all proteins obtained quantitatively were annotated with functional notes to explore the biological functions of these proteins through the classification plot of go the classification of all genetic products of a species is better understood genes can be classified and annotated according to their molecular function mf cellular component cc and biological process bp fig 3a shows the classification of proteins according to their molecular functions molecular functional proteins mainly include binding catalytic and transporter activities the most abundant type is the protein with catalytic activity and binding accounting for 51 12 and 39 74 respectively of these 1397 proteins are relevant to biologically catalysed reactions the catalytic activity proteins in the eps could promote the macromolecule hydrolysis and provide carbon and energy sources for heterotrophic bacteria zhang et al 2015a which accelerates cell lysis and hydrolysis and the destruction of eps structure zhang et al 2015a macro molecular organic fractions was hydrolyzed into micro molecular organic acids in the stage of acidification while during gasification stage organic acids were converted into methane and carbon dioxide destroyed the bond between moisture and organic fractions which was helpful to release mechanically bound moisture and improve sludge dewaterability neyens et al 2004 garcía bernet et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 the proteins related to binding activity were also further classified into many sub groups from digested sludge samples and heterocyclic compound binding ion binding cation binding anion binding carbohydrate derivative binding and atp binding were the most common fig s3 the functions of heterocyclic compound binding were also derived from 673 614 and 577 protein groups from the acidification gasification and stabilisation stages the number of anion cationic binding functional proteins from the three stages of anaerobic digestion was 436 398 399 378 and 370 358 respectively anion groups which interact selectively and non covalently with anions charged atoms or groups of atoms with a net negative charge while cation binding which interact selectively and non covalently with cations charged atoms or groups of atoms with a net positive charge the removal of anion binding protein indicated that the sludge dewaterability was improved during the ad process because the anion binding proteins have more free amino groups which is the main reason for the sludge surface hydrophilicity habeeb 1966 the amino groups and hydrogen bonding more energy is required to remove white and watson 2002 and amino groups are hydrophilic sludge surface presents more hydrophobic because the reduction of amino groups surface hydrophobicity is more influential for functionality than total hydrophobicity surface hydrophobicity influences intermolecular interactions such as binding of small ligands or association with other macromolecules haskard and li chan 1998 the transformation of sludge surface from hydrophilic to hydrophobic enhances sludge dewaterability wu et al 2017b the identified proteins including cell part protein containing complex organelle and membrane were the main groups of cc account for 752 49 79 342 23 49 127 8 72 and 114 7 83 respectively fig 3b cell parts which were any constituent part of a cell basic structural and functional unit of all organisms protein containing complex a stable assembly of two or more macromolecules i e proteins nucleic acids carbohydrates or lipids in which at least one component is a protein and the constituent parts function together organelle any process in which a cell a substance or a cellular entity such as a protein complex or organelle is transported tethered to or otherwise maintained in a specific location in the case of substances localisation may also be achieved via selective degradation membrane a location relative to cellular compartments and structures occupied by a macromolecular machine when it carries out a molecular function eps mainly consists of polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and other cellular components sheng et al 2010 higgins and novak 1997 in general bacterial eps help in the formation of bioflocs in sludge and contribute to its structural surface charge and settling properties and dewaterability houghton and stephenson 2002 the go analysis revealed that these proteins in biological processes consist mainly of two subcategories metabolic processes and cellular processes fig 3c suggesting that they most likely play an enzyme role in these biological processes the metabolic processes subgroup contains the largest number proteins wu et al 2017b a biological process represents a specific objective that the organism is genetically programmed to achieve biological processes are often described by their outcome or ending state e g the biological process of cell division results in the creation of two daughter cells a divided cell from a single parent cell and a biological process is accomplished by a particular set of molecular functions carried out by specific gene products or macromolecular complexes often in a highly regulated manner and in a particular temporal sequence seviour and nielsen 2010 a total of 2678 2483 and 2357 mf proteins in acidification gasification and stabilisation stages were classified respectively the most major molecular functions of these proteins were catalytic activity and binding activity the results exhibited that the main roles of proteins in digested sludge were cation anion and ion binding participation in metabolic process as well as catalysis and degradation of organic matters the structure difference among three stages of digested sludge could be associated with their proteins 3 2 2 abundance of protein the protein sequence was compared with the nr database to obtain species annotation and then protein abundance sum of corresponding species was used to calculate the abundance of this species the abundance of species in each sample is calculated at the genera level thus constructing an abundance profile at the corresponding taxonomy level fig 4 a presented the abundance of protein sequence of the sludge samples of rs ds 10 and ds 30 in the acidification gasification and stabilisation stages respectively each sample is in duplicate and measured twice we analysed the abundance of 682 species that were isolated in these three stages during anaerobic digestion the results showed that pseudomonas approximately 50 in the stage of acidification and 17 and 22 in the gasification and stabilisation stage respectively fig 4b furthermore the methanosarcina and norank showed the same trend the larger number of them in the stage of gasification and lower number of them in the stage of acidification and stabilisation the abundance of other species lower than 1 at genus level was increased during the ad process 3 2 3 significance among three stages during ad process pca was conducted to investigate the relationship among proteins in three stages of anaerobic digestion the contribution of each protein to each dimension was recorded in fig 4c the pca results showed that of the three stages of sludge samples characteristics the first component pc1 accounted for about 94 07 and the second component pc2 accounted for about 5 90 of the total variables in the data set these two components together accounted for about 99 97 of the total variables the t test function in r language was used to calculate the p value of significant difference between samples in the three stages in this study the selection criterion for significant difference expression protein was p 0 05 and fc 0 83 or fc 1 20 indeed the amounts of the shared proteins were 2686 2557 and 2718 in acidification gasification and stabilisation respectively table 3 the visual volcano plot of differential proteins is shown in fig 5 the difference of protein in each two stages was obvious we compared acidification stage rs and gasification ds 10 in a volcano plot in addition to proteins detected uniquely in the sample of acidification stage or gasification stage proteins enriched in the gasification stage included methanosarcina and norank whereas those significantly enriched in the acidification stage included pseudomonas the intensity of proteins significantly up regulated was most under the condition of p 0 01 proteins detected in the stabilisation stage ds 30 compared with the gasification stage ds 10 the intensity of proteins significantly up regulated and down regulated was strong under the condition of p 0 01 these indicating the protein significantly varied from gasification to stabilisation 3 3 hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of digested sludge the surface characteristics of sludge such as surface charge and relative hydrophobicity have important influence on the sludge dewaterability jin et al 2004 contact angle measurements for digested sludge were performed table 4 from these contact angle values surface tension of digested sludge total interfacial tension and total interfacial free energy between digested sludge and water were obtained the contact angle between digested sludge and water was increased from 65 53 day 0 to 78 56 day 15 then decreased to 71 95 day 40 a high contact angle of the digested sludge performance resulted in greater hydrophobicity properties the positive values of the surface free energy values indicate hydrophilic surfaces while negative values imply hydrophobic surfaces busscher and weerkamp 1987 öner 2000 gotoh et al 2003 van oss 2003 o connell et al 2009 based on the values given in table 4 the surface free energy of ds 30 171 61 mj m2 was more negative than that 415 63 mj m2 of rs suggesting that the sludge had more hydrophobic surfaces the result in this study confirmed that the sludge with higher hydrophobicity might dewater more easily wu et al 2017a such differences were ascribed to spatial distribution discrepancy of hydrophilicity functional groups and hydrophobicity functional groups properties of proteins 3 4 functional groups characterisation of sludge samples ftir spectra of sludge in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 fig 6 were employed to analyse the primary causes of the different hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the digested sludge surface ftir spectra bands were assigned basing on previous literature sheng et al 2006 badireddy et al 2008 liu et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 the broad band around 3431 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching vibrations of o h and n h in proteins whereas the bands at 2931 cm 1 and 2870 cm 1 were attributed to the c h stretching vibrations 1700 1600 cm 1 amide i region associated with proteins 1600 1500 cm 1 amide ii region associated with proteins the c o stretching vibration of amide i exhibited at 1631 cm 1 and originated from the co stretching vibration of amide group coupled with the in phase bending of the n h bond and stretching of the c n bond whereas n h deformation vibrations of amide ii were observed at 1563 cm 1 and 1512 cm 1 1500 1300 cm 1 carboxylic group containing and hydrocarbon like compounds the band near 1384 cm 1 was assigned to c o symmetric stretching vibration of carboxyl group 1300 1200 cm 1 amide iii region associated with proteins 1200 900 cm 1 polysaccharides and nucleic acids and 900 600 cm 1 fingerprint region the band the band located at 1117 1148 cm 1 corresponded to c o and c c stretching vibration of pyranose ring which is common to all polysaccharides corresponding with previous studies various bands appeared almost in all regions of ftir implying the complex protein and polysaccharide associated functional groups and compositions of eps wang et al 2018 the detailed band assignments for ftir spectral features of digested sludges are given in table s2 based on literature screening sheng et al 2006 yuan et al 2011 as shown in fig 6 the bands at 3431 2931 1635 1526 1403 1075 and 770 cm 1 appeared in all sludge samples being consistent with the concept that eps contains proteins polysaccharides lipids dna and aromatic compounds with an abundance of functional groups such as n h nh2 co c n n h co nh coo and c h wang et al 2018 the bands peaking at 1418 cm 1 and 1117 1148 cm 1 were considered as the deformation vibration of c h in polysaccharides and c o and c c stretching vibration of pyranose ring which is common to all polysaccharides guo et al 2016 however there are no peaks in these two bands this demonstrated that proteins were the key components of digested sludge the band at 1541 cm 1 appeared in the ftir of acidification and gasification stages and disappeared in the stabilisation stage directly suggesting the presence of co nh such as amino acids and uronic acids in sludge samples and the shift of peak position confirmed that the protein amide ii region associated with proteins was disappeared wang et al 2018 polar groups such as co nh were responsible for the hydrophilicity of sludge thus the digested sludge hydrophobicity was enhanced and improved sludge dewaterability however the corresponding position in ftir of was covered by wide bands from 1403 to 1455 cm 1 wang et al 2018 while the peak intensities gasification stage was increased compared to acidification stage indicating that the coo containing compounds in digested sludge in gasification stage were more associated with amino acids than in digested sludge in the acidification stage the distinguishable ftir spectral features of digested sludge from the stabilisation stage is a result of their different organic fraction components the higher contents of co nh and amino acids associated coo in acidification and gasification stages are mainly due to the higher content of proteins in them than the sludge in the stabilisation stages wang et al 2018 the different functional group composition were suggested leading to digested sludge hydrophilic hydrophobic properties differences li et al 2016 4 conclusion 1 significance among communities of bacteria and archaea in the three stages during the ad process and conversion between archaea is responsible for protein content continuously varying in stabilisation stage 2 among proteins molecular functions catalytic activity proteins accelerating the cell lysis and hydrolysis and the destruction of eps structure which helps release mechanically bound moisture in addition sludge surface presents more hydrophobic because the reduction of anion binding proteins during the ad process 3 the increase of sludge surface hydrophobicity during the ad process is the result of functional group distribution variation caused by protein distribution and microbial community thus enhancing

18103,antibiotic resistome is a raising concern around the world especially considering treated wastewater for reclamation a wastewater reclamation system wwrs composed by a treatment system ts and a reclaimed system rs with supplementation from the treated effluent and considered as an integrated system of treatment and reclamation was selected in this study high throughput qpcr ht qpcr was applied to profile 283 antibiotic resistance genes args and 12 mobile genetic elements mges in the wwrs a total of 251 arg and 12 mge subtypes were detected in the wwrs the ts exhibited good performance for the removal of args with the number relative and absolute abundances of args largely decreased 99 07 removal efficiency in the final effluent which might be ascribed to biosolid sedimentation enhancement of biosolids removal contributed the lessening of args in the rs high quality effluent significantly reduced the number and abundance of args along the flow to downstream mges were less reduced in the treated effluent than that of the influent r2 0 16 p 0 05 and exhibited close connections with args arcobacter cloacibacterium cyanobacteria acinetobacter flavobacterium and dechloromonas were the relatively abundant genera in the wwrs and exhibited significantly correlations with args microbial communities and mges contributed 65 64 to the changes of args these two factors may be the main drivers of arg proliferation in the wwrs thus attention should be paid to mges and those abundant genera when considering treated wastewater for reclamation graphical abstract

wastewater reclamation system wwrs should be considered as a close knit integrated system including both treatment system ts and reclaimed system rs the treatment systems have been widely accepted as hotspots of args su et al 2017 which are mainly coming from domestic or hospital wastewater sources caucci et al 2016 quintela baluja et al 2019 and horizontal gene transfer hgt among bacteria induced by mobile genetic elements mges including integrons transposases and plasmids di cesare et al 2016 nolivos et al 2019 tong et al 2019 traditional wwtps can effectively remove conventional contaminants suspended solids organic pollutants nitrate and phosphorous however no special processes were designed to remove args pruden et al 2013 even tertiary treatment methods or advanced treatment technologies the relative abundances of args were even increased after wastewater passing through biological treatment facilities according to previous studies bengtsson palme et al 2016 di cesare et al 2016 mao et al 2015 the quality of discharged wastewater for reuse especially overlooked args directly determines the quality and safety of rs in previous study daily loadings of args in the effluent of wwtps were reaching as high as 4 2 1018 copies d lee et al 2017 increases of the relative abundances of aminoglycoside resistance genes and tetracycline resistance genes were observed in receiving river water after wastewater discharge jia et al 2017 continuous discharge of abundant args could pose potential risk to the receiving environment jia et al 2017 lekunberri et al 2018 however the risk of args from long termed reclaimed wastewater treated by ts which may result in proliferation of args in rs is still limited proliferation mechanisms of args in wwtps were totally different from that of antibiotics even a mount arg copies could propagate through hgt among bacteria in activated sludge systems which are plentiful with microorganisms microbial communities have been considered as an important driver of arg disseminations in environmental compartments baym et al 2016 chen et al 2019b jia et al 2017 antibiotic resistance can be transferred among bacteria via direct and indirect pathways forsberg and dantas 2012 treatment systems provide suitable conditions for microorganisms to remove organic and inorganic pollutants abdel raouf et al 2012 leading to ubiquitous bacteria in the final effluent though wastewater from biological reactors is clarified before discharge thus bacteria potentially encoded with diverse args can spread from ts to receiving environments it is very important to assess the shift of bacteria and their correlations with args in the wwrs however little is known about the role of bacteria introduced by treated wastewater in the proliferation of args when considering wastewater recycles this paper focused on the propagation of args associated with microbial communities in the wwrs the aim of this research is to 1

15 vancomycin 8 37 integron 1 59 and transposase 3 19 fig s3a were detected in the wwrs three major resistance mechanisms can be explained for most of the args antibiotic deactivation 41 43 efflux pump 23 11 and cellular protection 28 29 fig s3b in the ts the number of args were significantly decreased in both wet from 174 in w1 to 100 in w4 and dry season from 159 in w1 to 96 in w4 one way anova p 0 05 fig 1 a and b in addition arg subtypes in the w4 were also decreased compared to w2 suggesting that sedimentation or uv might cut down the number of args while there were 10 more args in the w4 than that in the w1 in the normal season when the aeration system of eco biological reactor line a was under maintenance which probably influenced the treatment efficiency the numbers of mges were basically unchanged through the treatment processes whether in the wet or dry seasons one way anova p 0 05 in the rs the detected numbers in the stream water samples were significantly decreased after the input of reclaimed effluent in the normal season and dry season fig 1a and b in the normal season the number of args 120 in the sediment of downstream was also less than that 137 in the upstream the arg numbers of the reclaimed effluent were significantly less than that of upstream g2 one way anova p 0 05 after the effluent discharged for reclamation the number of args in the downstream g4 were decreased compared to the upstream compared to the reclaimed effluent stream water from upstream contributed to the most of the diversity of args in the rs fig 1a and b indicating that the effluent did not significantly contribute to diversify the args of the rs in the wwrs a total of 194 args and mges were shared among the ts final effluent and the rs only 16 and 7 subtypes were unique in the ts and rs fig 1d respectively all of the mges were shared between the ts and rs the detailed information about shared and unique args and mges was showed in fig s4 3 2 abundance of args and mges in the wwrs in the ts the relative abundances of args in the w4 were significantly decreased compared to w1 fig 2 while the relative abundances were almost the same in w2 and w3 one way anova p 0 05 relative abundance of arg and mge subtypes were visualized by heatmap in fig s5 among which aminoglycoside resistance genes beta lactamase resistance genes tetracycline resistance genes integrons and transposases exerted high relative abundances after the tebrs the relative abundances of args in w2 were minified both in the wet and dry season compared to w1 while that were not significantly decreased by uv disinfection one way anova p 0 05 the absolute abundances of args were the highest in the w2 and lower in the w3 and w4 indicating that biosolids sedimentation contributed to the removal of args fig s6 while the accumulation of args with 3 92 1 24 1012 copies g on average in the ds was observed fig s6d in the rs the relative abundances of args were decreased after the supplementation of the reclaimed effluent both in the water and sediment samples of the rs fig 2a and b similarly the absolute abundances of args were attenuated in g3 4 94 1 62 107 copies ml and g4 2 45 1 45 107 copies ml of the downstream compared to g2 1 26 0 40 108 copies ml of the upstream figs s6a and b suggesting that the reclaimed effluent contributed the shift dynamics of args in the rs args were also reduced in the downstream sediments gs2 1 49 1 20 1011 copies g compared to that of upstream gs1 1 40 0 71 1012 copies g fig s6d while mges were slightly decreased along the stream with 4 03 1 48 107 copies ml in g2 and 2 04 0 84 107 copies ml in g4 3 3 removal efficiency and daily loads of args in the treatment system log magnitude variations of arg subtypes in the ts were presented in table s9 removal of total args through the entire process were ranged from 0 92 to 3 08 log and mges from 0 80 to 3 00 log sedimentation could remove 2 46 to 2 86 log args since arg abundances and volatile suspended solids vss were obtained arg removal efficiencies of the teb wwtp could be calculated yang et al 2014 the teb wwtp exhibited high removal efficiency with 99 07 of total args table s10 as shown in table 1 daily load of total args in the effluent reached at 1 49 1016 copies d in details aminoglycoside multidrug beta lactamase and tetracycline resistance genes were over 1 54 1016 copies d the load of vancomycin resistance genes was the lowest with 1 40 1014 copies d in addition the discharge load of mges was up to 8 57 1016 copies d although the removal efficiencies were relatively high the args and mges were still ubiquitous in the final effluent which may pose potential risks to the rs 3 4 characterization of microbial communities a total of 477561 sequence reads were acquired from 13 samples with sequences per sample ranging from 31285 to 40943 table s8 diversity of microbial community along the treatment processes and the stream flow can be clearly identified figs s7 and s8 proteobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes and firmicutes were the most abundant phyla in the wwrs fig s9 at genus level dechloromonas arcobacter and cyanobacteria were abundant in the treated effluent of the ts table s11 fig s7 while cloacibacterium acinetobacter and flavobacterium were plentiful in the water samples of the rs acinetobacter and dechloromonas were discovered to be ubiquitous in the sediment of upstream dechloromonas and flavobacterium were also found abundant in the downstream sediment cyanobacteria were enriched in the downstream g4 which were probably attributed to the reclaimed effluent and the pre tank with suitable conditions as revealed by pcoa the distribution pattern of microbial community in the ts was significantly separated from that in the rs adonis test r 0 45 p 0 0109 9999 permutations fig 3 a two pcs contributed 64 15 variation the different microbial community composition might significantly influence the dynamics of args from ts to rs 3 5 co occurrence patterns of args and mges network analysis was applied to visualize the co occurrence patterns of arg subtypes and mges with pearson s correlation 0 80 p 0 01 in the wwrs fig 4 hub genes were defined according to the most connected nodes sizes of the nodes were graded by the number of connection degree barberan et al 2012 the co occurrence patterns of args and mges in the ts fig s10 were different from that in the rs fig s11 which could be affected by the reclaimed effluent what s more the patterns among mges and args were significantly different when taking the ts and rs in integrated fig 4 or in separately figs s10 and s11 consideration as one of the hub genes figs 4 and s11 inti2 was strongly connected to aminoglycoside aada 1 01 aada 1 02 aadd aade and str tetracycline tet 36 02 tetm 01 tetc 01 tetc 02 tetl 02 and teth mlsb ermt 01 ermt 02 erma ermc lnua 01 lnub 01 lnub 02 flor and sulfonamide dfra12 resistance genes transposases such as is613 tnpa 02 tnpa 03 tnpa 05 tnpa 07 and tp614 might serve as links to different arg types most of args have significant correlations with total abundance of mges p 0 05 table s12 integrons r2 0 91 and transposases r2 0 84 were significantly p 0 01 positive corelated with total antibiotic resistance fig s12 indicating that prevalence of args was significantly in accordance with mges in the wwrs 3 6 relationship between args and microbial communities the redundancy analysis bray curtis distance based illustrated the significantly correlation between arg subtypes and 6 relatively abundant genera in the treated effluent and the rs pseudo f 2 7 p 0 0191 fig 5 a acinetobacter and arcobacter were significantly related to args from influent of the ts w1 and upstream of the rs g2 while flavobacterium and cyanobacteria were more corelated with args in the downstream water g4 and sediment gs2 of the rs in addition dechloromonas exhibited close connection with args of the treated effluent in the end of the ts w3 and w4 the changes of args in the wwrs were more attributed to microbial community 28 78 shift than that of mges 20 00 and their joint effect 16 86 revealed by vpa fig 5a mantel test based on bray curtis distance also indicated that arg dynamics were correlated to microbial community r 0 38 p 0 014 these results suggested that microbial community may be an important driver of arg disseminations in the wwrs 4 discussion 4 1 fate of args in the wastewater reclamation system the ts exerted good performance in removal of args compared to other wwtps table s13 with diversity and relative abundance increases of args and mges in downstream in previous studies lekunberri et al 2018 proia et al 2018 this phenomenon might be ascribed to the core tebrs regarding the fact that the number and relative abundances of major arg subtypes were decreased while increase was observed in other traditional biological reactors table s13 lee et al 2017 mao et al 2015 the macrophytes planted in the tebrs probably contributed to lessen the args reduced effects of args were also noted in rhizosphere of lettuce when manure was applied blau et al 2019 rhizospheres not only provide good habitat for microorganisms protozoa and metazoans but also modulate gene transfer which might be related to root exudation coskun et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 those advantages in rhizospheres would probably be in favor of relative abundance minimization of args to some extent in the bioreactor the vast majorities of args and mges removal were largely attributed to the sedimentation ability of biosolids coated with abundant microorganisms which was in accordance with previous studies lee et al 2017 narciso da rocha et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 in addition the chemical dosing of poly aluminium chloride pac table s2 could enhance the settling ability of suspended particles particles removal directly serves the reduction of args and mges lee et al 2017 resulting in their accumulations in the excess sludge fig s6d which should pay attention to its further treatment or farmland application lau et al 2017 except beta lactamase mlsb and vancomycin resistance genes other args were positively affected by tss total phosphorus tp was positively correlated with all targeted args and mges in the rs including the wastewater effluent fig s13 the seasonal variations of args and mges were probably related to different temperatures planted macrophytes were more active to produce root exudation in wet season than that in dry season zhang et al 2016 more exudation might enhance the settling ability of biosolids in addition coagulation by dosing pac was also affected by temperature xiao et al 2009 ultraviolet uv disinfection might contribute little to the reduction of args and mges with only 0 02 0 87 magnitude order decrease observed table s9 the uv dose does really matter args could be reduced 3 to 4 magnitude under the uv dose condition of 10 times larger than 20 mj cm2 in the teb wwtp which was impractical in real wastewater treatment mckinney and pruden 2012 in addition cleaning of the lamps in time to prevent the uv light from being blocked by films or algae might affect the removal efficiencies of args fig s14 even lamps were no broken and always kept clean uv light could also be inhibited by particular matters or dissolved organic matter lee et al 2017 in the wastewater what s more hydraulic retention time hrt of the uv disinfection tank is extremely short less than 1 min which would probably influence the removal of args noteworthily args might be still abundant in the effluent of ts 6 0 3 9 106 copies ml on average which was probably attributed to the small sized particles ma et al 2019 and cell free args zhang et al 2018 escaping easily out from treatment facilities more attention should be paid to those arg sources when considering wastewater reclamation treated wastewater effluent from the ts would significantly impact the antibiotic resistome shift in the rs owning to the high quality effluent discharge from the ts the args and mges distribution pattern in the rs were significantly separated based on pcoa bray curtis distance fig 3b two pcs exhibited 69 11 explanation effects of args from treated wastewater to the downstream of the rs mainly depended on the relative contribution of treatment plant proia et al 2016 as relative abundances of args in the effluent of the ts were much lower than that of upstream fig 2 as well as absolute abundances fig s6 the reclaimed effluent contributed less to the arg abundance in the rs on the contrary increases were observed in previous studies as to the fact that the abundances of args in the final effluent were much higher than that of receiving upstream lekunberri et al 2018 proia et al 2018 the flow rate of receiving stream and discharged effluent also significantly impact the args dynamic in the rs lapara et al 2015 since the flow rate of the effluent about 0 29 m3 s was comparable to the rs 0 80 m3 s on average the effects of args from treated wastewater would be significant whether in high or low prevalence we could also use distance away from the effluent discharge site to evaluate the dissemination of args and mges in the reclaimed stream czekalski et al 2014 pruden et al 2012 logistic transferred log10 relative abundances of args and mges was linear fitted in fig 6 for relative abundances of mlsb tetracycline others and chloramphenicol versus distance from the teb wwtp discharge point the r2 were within the range of 0 67 0 87 p 0 05 suggesting that variation of those args in the stream could probably be interpreted by distance czekalski et al 2014 lapara et al 2015 as to the lower abundance of args and lower concentrations of nutrients in the effluent fig s6 and table s5 arg disseminations among bacteria in the rs could be weakened in some way although dilution may be contributory the decrease of args especially in the downstream g4 was mainly ascribed to the wastewater effluent supplementation figs 2 and s6 pre tank and ecological purification facilities in the downstream could probably also decay the propagation of args in rs besides rainfall is an important pollution source in the reclaimed stream table s4 especially in southern china stormwater runoff from nearby functional areas farmlands residential zones could bring diverse and abundant args and mges into reclaimed system baral et al 2018 garner et al 2017 which should be of concern 4 2 potential horizontal gene transfer through mges in the wastewater reclamation system horizontal gene transfer is widely accepted as one of the mechanisms for the propagation of args especially via mges including both integrons and transposases han et al 2018 wang et al 2014 zhu et al 2013 it s specified that mges from domestic wastewater could be established in the ts quintela baluja et al 2019 thereby inducing more antibiotic resistance in wastewater through hgt especially in the eco biological reactor with abundant and ubiquitous microorganisms furthermore mges were not significantly reduced in the rs r2 0 16 p 0 05 fig 6 and contributed over 20 00 to the changes of args in the wwrs fig 5b indicating that mges may play a role in the disseminations of args co occurrence patterns revealed by network analysis and the tight correlations among arg and mge subtypes also provided evidence for the role of mges in the dissemination of args in different environmental matrices mges could be the arg cassettes zhu et al 2013 due to their ability in arg proliferations integron integrase genes raised high concern of their important role as assembly platform mazel 2006 of which inti1 as a marker of anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 was frequently detected in wastewater treatment system and played an important role in the disseminations of args for inti2 it was confirmed with capacity to carry some resistance gene cassettes and lead to horizontal transfer bado et al 2010 transposases were also reported to be encoded with diverse args such as tetracycline resistance genes rizzotti et al 2009 and mlsb resistance gene ermb okitsu et al 2005 is26 could facilitate mobilization of resistance genes miriagou et al 2005 tnpa 02 gene was detected with 100 frequency in reclaimed wastewater irrigation samples wang et al 2014 previous study found that tnpa 02 and tnpa 05 exhibited strong connections with ubiquitous resistance genes in different matrices guo et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 numerous studies have demonstrated that mges contributed to the transfer of args in different environmental compartments chen et al 2019a forsberg and dantas 2012 zhu et al 2017 in addition plasmids have also been confirmed as a crucial pathway of hgt for arg disseminations bottery et al 2019 garner et al 2018 which needs further profile in the wwrs 4 3 antibiotic resistome associated with microbial communities the significant different microbial community structures between the ts and rs were probably attributed to various factors the treatment system provides suitable conditions with anaerobic aerobic zones mixture activated sludge and hydraulic retention time hrt table s2 for microorganisms abdel raouf et al 2012 which is totally different from that of rs in addition rs is an open system which can potentially be influenced by nonpoint pollution stormwater runoff garner et al 2017 anthropological activities zhu et al 2017 and other activities these factors may also contribute to the different microbial community structure of rs compared to the ts dynamic of microbial community was an important driver of args dissemination in the wwrs the microbial communities of the ts and rs were connected to each other in the end of ts uv disinfection was purposely conducted to disinfect escherichia coli although certain bacteria may unintentionally be killed several genera can survive from uv irradiation and be introduced into the rs these genera may be encoded with diverse args and influence the microbial community in the rs arcobacter stains have been frequently detected in wastewater and confirmed of resistance to several antibiotics collado and figueras 2011 it was fortunate to discover that arcobacter was less abundant in the downstream than that in the upstream of the rs which was probably attributed to the reclaimed effluent acinetobacter stains are tightly corelated to human infections and possess the ability of carrying certain args yang et al 2014 in addition cyanobacteria introduced by treated effluent can be thrived in the pre tank of rs due to enough nutrients slow water flow and relative long hrt antibiotic resistance in the rs exhibited significantly correlation with cyanobacteria fig 5a cyanobacterial blooms were reported to potentially affect dynamics of size fractionated args in reservoir guo et al 2018 therefore cyanobacteria warrants particular attention when treated wastewater is considered for reclamation multiple resistance types can potentially be carried by dechloromonas which have been commonly observed in wastewater and river water chen et al 2019b nolvak et al 2018 this genus should be concerned for its relative high abundance in the treated effluent flavobacterium was also reported to exhibit significantly correlations with numerous args han et al 2018 yang et al 2014 cloacibacterium can survive from high concentration level of tetracycline in sequencing batch reactors liu et al 2019 the possible host relationships between bacteria and args need further profile and more direct evidence is required rather than correlations which may be biased in compositional results obtained by high throughput sequencing gloor et al 2017 although the ts can remove diverse bacteria encoded with args certain genera still escape the ts and are introduced into the rs which warrants particular attention when considering treated wastewater for possible reclamation 5 conclusion we systematically investigated the occurrence of major args and mges in the wastewater reclamation system which were considered as a close knit integrated system for the first time the tridimensional eco biological reactors planted with various macrophytes in the treatment system were discovered to be efficient in shifting the propagation of args enhancing settling abilities of biosolids could probably promote removal of args the args were decreased in the reclaimed system after supplementation of the treated wastewater from the treatment system indicating that reclaimed system would benefit from the high discharge standards of treated wastewater horizontal gene transfer of args through mges was potential in the wastewater reclamation system since mges in the downstream were less reduced than that in the upstream of the reclaimed system while gene exchange by plasmid or phage in the reclaimed water deserve further elucidate microbial community is one of the important drivers of arg proliferations in the wastewater reclamation system those abundant genera potentially encoded with diverse args in the treated effluent should be of concern when considering possible reclamation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18103,antibiotic resistome is a raising concern around the world especially considering treated wastewater for reclamation a wastewater reclamation system wwrs composed by a treatment system ts and a reclaimed system rs with supplementation from the treated effluent and considered as an integrated system of treatment and reclamation was selected in this study high throughput qpcr ht qpcr was applied to profile 283 antibiotic resistance genes args and 12 mobile genetic elements mges in the wwrs a total of 251 arg and 12 mge subtypes were detected in the wwrs the ts exhibited good performance for the removal of args with the number relative and absolute abundances of args largely decreased 99 07 removal efficiency in the final effluent which might be ascribed to biosolid sedimentation enhancement of biosolids removal contributed the lessening of args in the rs high quality effluent significantly reduced the number and abundance of args along the flow to downstream mges were less reduced in the treated effluent than that of the influent r2 0 16 p 0 05 and exhibited close connections with args arcobacter cloacibacterium cyanobacteria acinetobacter flavobacterium and dechloromonas were the relatively abundant genera in the wwrs and exhibited significantly correlations with args microbial communities and mges contributed 65 64 to the changes of args these two factors may be the main drivers of arg proliferation in the wwrs thus attention should be paid to mges and those abundant genera when considering treated wastewater for reclamation graphical abstract

introduced by reclaimed wastewater are seldom studied antibiotic resistance genes considered as emerging contaminants pruden et al 2006 have been broadly detected in environmental matrices chen et al 2019b xu et al 2016 posing potential risk to human health antibiotic resistome martinez et al 2015 is raised as an alarming issue around the globe who 2014 previous studies focused on the propagation

wastewater reclamation system wwrs should be considered as a close knit integrated system including both treatment system ts and reclaimed system rs the treatment systems have been widely accepted as hotspots of args su et al 2017 which are mainly coming from domestic or hospital wastewater sources caucci et al 2016 quintela baluja et al 2019 and horizontal gene transfer hgt among bacteria induced by mobile genetic elements mges including integrons transposases and plasmids di cesare et al 2016 nolivos et al 2019 tong et al 2019 traditional wwtps can effectively remove conventional contaminants suspended solids organic pollutants nitrate and phosphorous however no special processes were designed to remove args pruden et al 2013 even tertiary treatment methods or advanced treatment technologies the relative abundances of args were even increased after wastewater passing through biological treatment facilities according to previous studies bengtsson palme et al 2016 di cesare et al 2016 mao et al 2015 the quality of discharged wastewater for reuse especially overlooked args directly determines the quality and safety of rs in previous study daily loadings of args in the effluent of wwtps were reaching as high as 4 2 1018 copies d lee et al 2017 increases of the relative abundances of aminoglycoside resistance genes and tetracycline resistance genes were observed in receiving river water after wastewater discharge jia et al 2017 continuous discharge of abundant args could pose potential risk to the receiving environment jia et al 2017 lekunberri et al 2018 however the risk of args from long termed reclaimed wastewater treated by ts which may result in proliferation of args in rs is still limited proliferation mechanisms of args in wwtps were totally different from that of antibiotics even a mount arg copies could propagate through hgt among bacteria in activated sludge systems which are plentiful with microorganisms microbial communities have been considered as an important driver of arg disseminations in environmental compartments baym et al 2016 chen et al 2019b jia et al 2017 antibiotic resistance can be transferred among bacteria via direct and indirect pathways forsberg and dantas 2012 treatment systems provide suitable conditions for microorganisms to remove organic and inorganic pollutants abdel raouf et al 2012 leading to ubiquitous bacteria in the final effluent though wastewater from biological reactors is clarified before discharge thus bacteria potentially encoded with diverse args can spread from ts to receiving environments it is very important to assess the shift of bacteria and their correlations with args in the wwrs however little is known about the role of bacteria introduced by treated wastewater in the proliferation of args when considering wastewater recycles this paper focused on the propagation of args associated with microbial communities in the wwrs the aim of this research is to 1

pump 23 11 and cellular protection 28 29 fig s3b in the ts the number of args were significantly decreased in both wet from 174 in w1 to 100 in w4 and dry season from 159 in w1 to 96 in w4 one way anova p 0 05 fig 1 a and b in addition arg subtypes in the w4 were also decreased compared to w2 suggesting that sedimentation or uv might cut down the number of args while there were 10 more args in the w4 than that in the w1 in the normal season when the aeration system of eco biological reactor line a was under maintenance which probably influenced the treatment efficiency the numbers of mges were basically unchanged through the treatment processes whether in the wet or dry seasons one way anova p 0 05 in the rs the detected numbers in the stream water samples were significantly decreased after the input of reclaimed effluent in the normal season and dry season fig 1a and b in the normal season the number of args 120 in the sediment of downstream was also less than that 137 in the upstream the arg numbers of the reclaimed effluent were significantly less than that of upstream g2 one way anova p 0 05 after the effluent discharged for reclamation the number of args in the downstream g4 were decreased compared to the upstream compared to the reclaimed effluent stream water from upstream contributed to the most of the diversity of args in the rs fig 1a and b indicating that the effluent did not significantly contribute to diversify the args of the rs in the wwrs a total of 194 args and mges were shared among the ts final effluent and the rs only 16 and 7 subtypes were unique in the ts and rs fig 1d respectively all of the mges were shared between the ts and rs the detailed information about shared and unique args and mges was showed in fig s4 3 2 abundance of args and mges in the wwrs in the ts the relative abundances of args in the w4 were significantly decreased compared to w1 fig 2 while the relative abundances were almost the same in w2 and w3 one way anova p 0 05 relative abundance of arg and mge subtypes were visualized by heatmap in fig s5 among which aminoglycoside resistance genes beta lactamase resistance genes tetracycline resistance genes integrons and transposases exerted high relative abundances after the tebrs the relative abundances of args in w2 were minified both in the wet and dry season compared to w1 while that were not significantly decreased by uv disinfection one way anova p 0 05 the absolute abundances of args were the highest in the w2 and lower in the w3 and w4 indicating that biosolids sedimentation contributed to the removal of args fig s6 while the accumulation of args with 3 92 1 24 1012 copies g on average in the ds was observed fig s6d in the rs the relative abundances of args were decreased after the supplementation of the reclaimed effluent both in the water and sediment samples of the rs fig 2a and b similarly the absolute abundances of args were attenuated in g3 4 94 1 62 107 copies ml and g4 2 45 1 45 107 copies ml of the downstream compared to g2 1 26 0 40 108 copies ml of the upstream figs s6a and b suggesting that the reclaimed effluent contributed the shift dynamics of args in the rs args were also reduced in the downstream sediments gs2 1 49 1 20 1011 copies g compared to that of upstream gs1 1 40 0 71 1012 copies g fig s6d while mges were slightly decreased along the stream with 4 03 1 48 107 copies ml in g2 and 2 04 0 84 107 copies ml in g4 3 3 removal efficiency and daily loads of args in the treatment system log magnitude variations of arg subtypes in the ts were presented in table s9 removal of total args through the entire process were ranged from 0 92 to 3 08 log and mges from 0 80 to 3 00 log sedimentation could remove 2 46 to 2 86 log args since arg abundances and volatile suspended solids vss were obtained arg removal efficiencies of the teb wwtp could be calculated yang et al 2014 the teb wwtp exhibited high removal efficiency with 99 07 of total args table s10 as shown in table 1 daily load of total args in the effluent reached at 1 49 1016 copies d in details aminoglycoside multidrug beta lactamase and tetracycline resistance genes were over 1 54 1016 copies d the load of vancomycin resistance genes was the lowest with 1 40 1014 copies d in addition the discharge load of mges was up to 8 57 1016 copies d although the removal efficiencies were relatively high the args and mges were still ubiquitous in the final effluent which may pose potential risks to the rs 3 4 characterization of microbial communities a total of 477561 sequence reads were acquired from 13 samples with sequences per sample ranging from 31285 to 40943 table s8 diversity of microbial community along the treatment processes and the stream flow can be clearly identified figs s7 and s8 proteobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes and firmicutes were the most abundant phyla in the wwrs fig s9 at genus level dechloromonas arcobacter and cyanobacteria were abundant in the treated effluent of the ts table s11 fig s7 while cloacibacterium acinetobacter and flavobacterium were plentiful in the water samples of the rs acinetobacter and dechloromonas were discovered to be ubiquitous in the sediment of upstream dechloromonas and flavobacterium were also found abundant in the downstream sediment cyanobacteria were enriched in the downstream g4 which were probably attributed to the reclaimed effluent and the pre tank with suitable conditions as revealed by pcoa the distribution pattern of microbial community in the ts was significantly separated from that in the rs adonis test r 0 45 p 0 0109 9999 permutations fig 3 a two pcs contributed 64 15 variation the different microbial community composition might significantly influence the dynamics of args from ts to rs 3 5 co occurrence patterns of args and mges network analysis was applied to visualize the co occurrence patterns of arg subtypes and mges with pearson s correlation 0 80 p 0 01 in the wwrs fig 4 hub genes were defined according to the most connected nodes sizes of the nodes were graded by the number of connection degree barberan et al 2012 the co occurrence patterns of args and mges in the ts fig s10 were different from that in the rs fig s11 which could be affected by the reclaimed effluent what s more the patterns among mges and args were significantly different when taking the ts and rs in integrated fig 4 or in separately figs s10 and s11 consideration as one of the hub genes figs 4 and s11 inti2 was strongly connected to aminoglycoside aada 1 01 aada 1 02 aadd aade and str tetracycline tet 36 02 tetm 01 tetc 01 tetc 02 tetl 02 and teth mlsb ermt 01 ermt 02 erma ermc lnua 01 lnub 01 lnub 02 flor and sulfonamide dfra12 resistance genes transposases such as is613 tnpa 02 tnpa 03 tnpa 05 tnpa 07 and tp614 might serve as links to different arg types most of args have significant correlations with total abundance of mges p 0 05 table s12 integrons r2 0 91 and transposases r2 0 84 were significantly p 0 01 positive corelated with total antibiotic resistance fig s12 indicating that prevalence of args was significantly in accordance with mges in the wwrs 3 6 relationship between args and microbial communities the redundancy analysis bray curtis distance based illustrated the significantly correlation between arg subtypes and 6 relatively abundant genera in the treated effluent and the rs pseudo f 2 7 p 0 0191 fig 5 a acinetobacter and arcobacter were significantly related to args from influent of the ts w1 and upstream of the rs g2 while flavobacterium and cyanobacteria were more corelated with args in the downstream water g4 and sediment gs2 of the rs in addition dechloromonas exhibited close connection with args of the treated effluent in the end of the ts w3 and w4 the changes of args in the wwrs were more attributed to microbial community 28 78 shift than that of mges 20 00 and their joint effect 16 86 revealed by vpa fig 5a mantel test based on bray curtis distance also indicated that arg dynamics were correlated to microbial community r 0 38 p 0 014 these results suggested that microbial community may be an important driver of arg disseminations in the wwrs 4 discussion 4 1 fate of args in the wastewater reclamation system the ts exerted good performance in removal of args compared to other wwtps table s13 with diversity and relative abundance increases of args and mges in downstream in previous studies lekunberri et al 2018 proia et al 2018 this phenomenon might be ascribed to the core tebrs regarding the fact that the number and relative abundances of major arg subtypes were decreased while increase was observed in other traditional biological reactors table s13 lee et al 2017 mao et al 2015 the macrophytes planted in the tebrs probably contributed to lessen the args reduced effects of args were also noted in rhizosphere of lettuce when manure was applied blau et al 2019 rhizospheres not only provide good habitat for microorganisms protozoa and metazoans but also modulate gene transfer which might be related to root exudation coskun et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 those advantages in rhizospheres would probably be in favor of relative abundance minimization of args to some extent in the bioreactor the vast majorities of args and mges removal were largely attributed to the sedimentation ability of biosolids coated with abundant microorganisms which was in accordance with previous studies lee et al 2017 narciso da rocha et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 in addition the chemical dosing of poly aluminium chloride pac table s2 could enhance the settling ability of suspended particles particles removal directly serves the reduction of args and mges lee et al 2017 resulting in their accumulations in the excess sludge fig s6d which should pay attention to its further treatment or farmland application lau et al 2017 except beta lactamase mlsb and vancomycin resistance genes other args were positively affected by tss total phosphorus tp was positively correlated with all targeted args and mges in the rs including the wastewater effluent fig s13 the seasonal variations of args and mges were probably related to different temperatures planted macrophytes were more active to produce root exudation in wet season than that in dry season zhang et al 2016 more exudation might enhance the settling ability of biosolids in addition coagulation by dosing pac was also affected by temperature xiao et al 2009 ultraviolet uv disinfection might contribute little to the reduction of args and mges with only 0 02 0 87 magnitude order decrease observed table s9 the uv dose does really matter args could be reduced 3 to 4 magnitude under the uv dose condition of 10 times larger than 20 mj cm2 in the teb wwtp which was impractical in real wastewater treatment mckinney and pruden 2012 in addition cleaning of the lamps in time to prevent the uv light from being blocked by films or algae might affect the removal efficiencies of args fig s14 even lamps were no broken and always kept clean uv light could also be inhibited by particular matters or dissolved organic matter lee et al 2017 in the wastewater what s more hydraulic retention time hrt of the uv disinfection tank is extremely short less than 1 min which would probably influence the removal of args noteworthily args might be still abundant in the effluent of ts 6 0 3 9 106 copies ml on average which was probably attributed to the small sized particles ma et al 2019 and cell free args zhang et al 2018 escaping easily out from treatment facilities more attention should be paid to those arg sources when considering wastewater reclamation treated wastewater effluent from the ts would significantly impact the antibiotic resistome shift in the rs owning to the high quality effluent discharge from the ts the args and mges distribution pattern in the rs were significantly separated based on pcoa bray curtis distance fig 3b two pcs exhibited 69 11 explanation effects of args from treated wastewater to the downstream of the rs mainly depended on the relative contribution of treatment plant proia et al 2016 as relative abundances of args in the effluent of the ts were much lower than that of upstream fig 2 as well as absolute abundances fig s6 the reclaimed effluent contributed less to the arg abundance in the rs on the contrary increases were observed in previous studies as to the fact that the abundances of args in the final effluent were much higher than that of receiving upstream lekunberri et al 2018 proia et al 2018 the flow rate of receiving stream and discharged effluent also significantly impact the args dynamic in the rs lapara et al 2015 since the flow rate of the effluent about 0 29 m3 s was comparable to the rs 0 80 m3 s on average the effects of args from treated wastewater would be significant whether in high or low prevalence we could also use distance away from the effluent discharge site to evaluate the dissemination of args and mges in the reclaimed stream czekalski et al 2014 pruden et al 2012 logistic transferred log10 relative abundances of args and mges was linear fitted in fig 6 for relative abundances of mlsb tetracycline others and chloramphenicol versus distance from the teb wwtp discharge point the r2 were within the range of 0 67 0 87 p 0 05 suggesting that variation of those args in the stream could probably be interpreted by distance czekalski et al 2014 lapara et al 2015 as to the lower abundance of args and lower concentrations of nutrients in the effluent fig s6 and table s5 arg disseminations among bacteria in the rs could be weakened in some way although dilution may be contributory the decrease of args especially in the downstream g4 was mainly ascribed to the wastewater effluent supplementation figs 2 and s6 pre tank and ecological purification facilities in the downstream could probably also decay the propagation of args in rs besides rainfall is an important pollution source in the reclaimed stream table s4 especially in southern china stormwater runoff from nearby functional areas farmlands residential zones could bring diverse and abundant args and mges into reclaimed system baral et al 2018 garner et al 2017 which should be of concern 4 2 potential horizontal gene transfer through mges in the wastewater reclamation system horizontal gene transfer is widely accepted as one of the mechanisms for the propagation of args especially via mges including both integrons and transposases han et al 2018 wang et al 2014 zhu et al 2013 it s specified that mges from domestic wastewater could be established in the ts quintela baluja et al 2019 thereby inducing more antibiotic resistance in wastewater through hgt especially in the eco biological reactor with abundant and ubiquitous microorganisms furthermore mges were not significantly reduced in the rs r2 0 16 p 0 05 fig 6 and contributed over 20 00 to the changes of args in the wwrs fig 5b indicating that mges may play a role in the disseminations of args co occurrence patterns revealed by network analysis and the tight correlations among arg and mge subtypes also provided evidence for the role of mges in the dissemination of args in different environmental matrices mges could be the arg cassettes zhu et al 2013 due to their ability in arg proliferations integron integrase genes raised high concern of their important role as assembly platform mazel 2006 of which inti1 as a marker of anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 was frequently detected in wastewater treatment system and played an important role in the disseminations of args for inti2 it was confirmed with capacity to carry some resistance gene cassettes and lead to horizontal transfer bado et al 2010 transposases were also reported to be encoded with diverse args such as tetracycline resistance genes rizzotti et al 2009 and mlsb resistance gene ermb okitsu et al 2005 is26 could facilitate mobilization of resistance genes miriagou et al 2005 tnpa 02 gene was detected with 100 frequency in reclaimed wastewater irrigation samples wang et al 2014 previous study found that tnpa 02 and tnpa 05 exhibited strong connections with ubiquitous resistance genes in different matrices guo et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 numerous studies have demonstrated that mges contributed to the transfer of args in different environmental compartments chen et al 2019a forsberg and dantas 2012 zhu et al 2017 in addition plasmids have also been confirmed as a crucial pathway of hgt for arg disseminations bottery et al 2019 garner et al 2018 which needs further profile in the wwrs 4 3 antibiotic resistome associated with microbial communities the significant different microbial community structures between the ts and rs were probably attributed to various factors the treatment system provides suitable conditions with anaerobic aerobic zones mixture activated sludge and hydraulic retention time hrt table s2 for microorganisms abdel raouf et al 2012 which is totally different from that of rs in addition rs is an open system which can potentially be influenced by nonpoint pollution stormwater runoff garner et al 2017 anthropological activities zhu et al 2017 and other activities these factors may also contribute to the different microbial community structure of rs compared to the ts dynamic of microbial community was an important driver of args dissemination in the wwrs the microbial communities of the ts and rs were connected to each other in the end of ts uv disinfection was purposely conducted to disinfect escherichia coli although certain bacteria may unintentionally be killed several genera can survive from uv irradiation and be introduced into the rs these genera may be encoded with diverse args and influence the microbial community in the rs arcobacter stains have been frequently detected in wastewater and confirmed of resistance to several antibiotics collado and figueras 2011 it was fortunate to discover that arcobacter was less abundant in the downstream than that in the upstream of the rs which was probably attributed to the reclaimed effluent acinetobacter stains are tightly corelated to human infections and possess the ability of carrying certain args yang et al 2014 in addition cyanobacteria introduced by treated effluent can be thrived in the pre tank of rs due to enough nutrients slow water flow and relative long hrt antibiotic resistance in the rs exhibited significantly correlation with cyanobacteria fig 5a cyanobacterial blooms were reported to potentially affect dynamics of size fractionated args in reservoir guo et al 2018 therefore cyanobacteria warrants particular attention when treated wastewater is considered for reclamation multiple resistance types can potentially be carried by dechloromonas which have been commonly observed in wastewater and river water chen et al 2019b nolvak et al 2018 this genus should be concerned for its relative high abundance in the treated effluent flavobacterium was also reported to exhibit significantly correlations with numerous args han et al 2018 yang et al 2014 cloacibacterium can survive from high concentration level of tetracycline in sequencing batch reactors liu et al 2019 the possible host relationships between bacteria and args need further profile and more direct evidence is required rather than correlations which may be biased in compositional results obtained by high throughput sequencing gloor et al 2017 although the ts can remove diverse bacteria encoded with args certain genera still escape the ts and are introduced into the rs which warrants particular attention when considering treated wastewater for possible reclamation 5 conclusion we systematically investigated the occurrence of major args and mges in the wastewater reclamation system which were considered as a close knit integrated system for the first time the tridimensional eco biological reactors planted with various macrophytes in the treatment system were discovered to be efficient in shifting the propagation of args enhancing settling abilities of biosolids could probably promote removal of args the args were decreased in the reclaimed system after supplementation of the treated wastewater from the treatment system indicating that reclaimed system would benefit from the high discharge standards of treated wastewater horizontal gene transfer of args through mges was potential in the wastewater reclamation system since mges in the downstream were less reduced than that in the upstream of the reclaimed system while gene exchange by plasmid or phage in the reclaimed water deserve further elucidate microbial community is one of the important drivers of arg proliferations in the wastewater reclamation system those abundant genera potentially encoded with diverse args in the treated effluent should be of concern when considering possible reclamation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18104,practical applications of disinfection technologies for engineered waters require an in depth understanding of disinfection profiles and mechanisms of pathogenic bacteria in a complex matrix this study investigated the inactivation of e coli and e faecalis by so 4 an emerging advanced disinfectant in ultrapure water upw and wastewater effluent we based on the bacterial inactivation kinetics in upw in a zerovalent iron peroxydisulfate system the second order rate constants k for so 4 reacting with e coli and e faecalis were measured to be 1 39 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 and 6 71 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 respectively the morphological images of both bacteria by the scanning electron microscope indicated that so 4 initiates oxidative reactions on the wall membranes causing their irreversible damage ultimately affecting membrane permeability and physiological functions to profile the inactivation kinetics of two strains of bacteria in we matrix a mechanistic process based model with the obtained k values was developed sensitivity and uncertainty analyses indicated that the key parameters for the model predictions were the concentrations of halide ions i e br and cl in we and their k values reacting with so 4 accounting for 80 of uncertainty or variance expected in predicted bacterial inactivation this model allows precise estimation of required disinfectant dose even in complex water matrices shedding lights on the extension of application of so 4 based technology in wastewater treatments graphical abstract image 1 keywords so 4 based disinfection processes second order rate constant membrane damage mechanistic process based model 1 introduction disinfection is an essential process during drinking water and wastewater treatments to minimize the risks of exposure to pathogenic microorganisms for public health collivignarelli et al 2017 leeuwen 2000 advanced disinfection processes adps receive a great deal of attention due to their higher disinfection efficiency and more controllable formation of disinfection byproducts dbps than conventional chlorine based methods dadjour et al 2005 ferro et al 2015 xiao et al 2019a for example no bromate and dbps were reported to form in uv h2o2 system penru et al 2012 hydroxyl radical oh based adps are promising technology due to the strong oxidative property of oh with redox potential of 2 7 v vs normal hydrogen electrode nhe at 25 c under acidic conditions zhang et al 2015 oh is able to react with cell walls membranes enzymes and genetic materials of microorganisms balasubramanian et al 1998 kobayashi et al 2014 scientific reportsdas et al 1998 although a linear relationship between oh concentration and the extent of microbial inactivation i e escherichia coli e coli was observed in ultrapure water upw cho et al 2004 oh cannot fully exert its bactericidal effect in wastewater effluent we because of scavenging by effluent organic matter efom and various inorganics e g cl hco 3 etc dong et al 2010 sun et al 2016 sulfate radical so 4 in contrast is an attractive alternative to oh due to its low reactivity with background water constituents e g efom and high redox potential 2 5 3 1 v vs nhe neta et al 1988 xiao et al 2015a 2019b so 4 can be generated by activation of ps or pms with various methods such as uv heat and transition metal ions ho et al 2019 wang et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 for example wordofa et al found a better disinfection performance of so 4 based adps for the inactivation of e coli o157 h7 as compared to oh based adps wordofa et al 2017 the differences in deactivation caused by oh and so 4 were compared on the basis of ct radical concentration exposure time value the induction time of e coli observed by oh was found to be almost 5 folds longer than that by so 4 further oh et al reported that the ct values for o3 o3 h2o2 and o3 peroxydisulfate ps were 31 0 29 9 and 15 9 mg l 1 min for the 2 log inactivation of e coli respectively also indicating a better disinfection performance of so 4 based adps than o3 and oh oh et al 2014 in the radical based adps a possible concern associated with the ct value being used as an indicator of disinfection efficiency is that it varies dramatically with aquatic quality parameters and other water constituents e g concentrations of background efom and halide ions for example at the concentration of 3 mg l 1 of disinfectant i e monochloramine kahler et al reported the ct values of 980 and 2100 mg min l 1 for 3 log reduction of echovirus 11 in two types of pretreated surface waters suggesting that water matrix affects disinfection to a great extent kahler et al 2011 in addition a ct value also varies depending on the required amount e g 1 log or 2 log reduction of inactivation of the bacteria roy et al reported 0 072 mg l 1 min of the ct value for 2 log inactivation of coxsackievirus b5 by o3 roy et al 1981 whereas sigmon et al determined a ct value of 0 15 mg l 1 min for 3 5 log inactivation of coxsackievirus b5 by o3 cole et al 2015 as a consequence the case specific ct values cause perplexity and over specification of experimental conditions for other scientists to refer to lacking a standard means of comparison we hence used the second order reaction rate constants k m 1 s 1 an aquatic quality independent parameter between disinfectants and microorganisms to qualitatively reflect bacterial resistance the use of k provides advantages including 1 to allow direct comparison of bactericidal effects among disinfectants regardless of the amount of required inactivation of bacteria 2 to precisely estimate required disinfectant dose with a k value even for different water qualities and 3 to holistically link background water constituents e g efom and inorganics target microorganisms and other macro micro pollutants by the rate law for comprehensive assessment of the efficiency of disinfectants in addition k value is widely acquainted by chemists as compared to the concept of ct in the present study we investigated the so 4 mediated inactivation kinetics of both gram negative e coli and gram positive enterococcus faecalis e faecalis bacteria zero valent iron zvi was used to activate ps for generating so 4 with advantages 1 so 4 yield activated by zvi is reported to be efficient and stable and the radical pathway is dominant as compared to non radical pathway drzewicz et

different conditions in ultrapure water upw then disinfection mechanisms were elucidated by a suite of macro and micro analytical techniques with the k values in upw a process based model was developed allowing us to comprehensively link background water constituents pollutants and target microorganisms for the purpose of estimation of disinfectant doses the uncertainty and sensitivity involved in the models were quantified and assessed accordingly the established mechanistic model provides in depth understanding on disinfection processes the experimental and modeling results shed light on the extension of the application of so 4 in water engineering 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents information such as sources and purity of chemicals was provided in table s1

disinfection study were either autoclaved or filtered by polyether sulfone membrane φ13 0 22 μm in pore size shengze china to exclude exogenous microorganisms 2 2 target bacteria in this study we selected e coli bl21 atcc baa 1025 and e faecalis atcc 19433 as target surrogates for gram negative and gram positive bacteria respectively the two bacterial species are commonly used as fecal contamination indicator microorganisms during water and wastewater treatment processes anderson et al 2005 tallon et al 2005 the freeze dried bacteria were purchased from atcc and revived subsequently the bacterial solutions were prepared by inoculating single colonies from culture plates overnight at 30 c in an incubator the preculture was then inoculated again in 100 ml luria bertani lb nutrient broth for about 4 h to reach logarithmic phase fig s1 in supplementary material to ensure the same physiological status of bacteria for legitimate comparison monod 1949 in order to rinse bacterial suspensions the bacteria were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min and washed twice with 15 mm acetate acetic acid ac hac buffer solution at ph 5 5 the selection of acetate buffer system was due to its effective buffer capacity 2 8 10 2 at ph 5 5 and non reactive nature with the dyes used in this study i e nucleic acid stain syto 9 and propidium iodide pi scientific 2004 the consumption of so 4 by ac hac in the zvi ps system was taken into account in any models due to its reactivity towards so 4 it should be noted that we did not introduce saline to prepare the bacterial suspensions since the presence of cl at high 0 9 w w concentration will transform to cl cl 2 in a zvi ps system possibly resulting in coexisting radical disinfectants chawla and fessenden 1975 hasegawa and neta 1978 mcelroy 1990 2 3 wastewater collection and characterization wastewater effluent was collected in march 2019 from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in changsha china the plant has a sewage treatment capacity of 40 000 m3 d 1 min et al 2018 wei et al 2019 the sewage collected comes from 50 km2 and the population served is around 600 000 the plant employs the modified sequencing batch reactor msbr which consists of anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o and sbr in series featuring low operating cost but high effluent quality that meets the first b level of the chinese pollutant discharge standard of municipal wastewater treatment plants gb 18918 2002 the wastewater samples were collected at the secondary effluent from the facility and then poured into a upw rinsed 5 l polyethylene barrel with minimal headspace the sample was transported to laboratory within 1 h in an ice bath cooler after collection the wastewater was consecutively pre filtered through qualitative filter papers grade 102 whatman uk the filtered wastewater was acidified and stored in the dark at 4 c until use before disinfection experiments the water sample was filtered by 0 22 μm filters to eliminate the interference of endogenous microorganisms with so 4 mediated disinfection processes the wastewater effluent was characterized and tabulated in table s2 inorganic cations such as fetotal na mg2 k and

solutions at ph 5 5 in a water bath shaker thz 82a aohua china at 20 1 c the selection of the relatively acidic working solution is due to the fact that so 4 is reported to be dominant at acidic condition while at neutral basic ph so 4 and oh coexist to differing extent fang et al 2012 hayon et al 1972 liang and su 2009 further syto 9 stain is sensitive to ph with the maximum fluorescence intensity at ph 5 5 to 6 5 boulos et al 1999 scientific 2004 the initial densities of e coli and e faecalis for disinfection experiments were set to about 1 07 107 colony forming unit cfu ml 1 in the zvi ps system the concentration of ps for disinfection of e coli and e faecalis were 3 mm and 1 mm respectively the selection of its concentration was based on the reasonable contact time and also our previous studies gao et al 2019 yang et al 2017 the selection of optimal dosage of zvi is based on a set of exploratory experiments fig s2 at the zvi dosage of 0 6 g l 1 the degradation efficiency of the probe compound para chlorobenzoic acid p cba was measured to be the highest among all doses thus the applied dose of zvi was determined to be 0 6 g l 1 in addition in order to identify the dominant radical species that was responsible for inactivation in the system tert butanol tba a typical oh scavenger was used we also used uv for disinfection for kinetic comparison and mechanism elucidation under the same conditions with the zvi ps system in the uv system a 10 w low pressure uv lamp gph212t5l 4 heraeus germany emitting light at 254 nm was placed in a cold trap which was

bacterial counting methods live dead baclight bacterial viability kits l7012 molecular probes u s was used to determine the viability of bacteria with syto 9 and pi dyes this fluorescence staining method was reported to be a convenient efficient and easy to use kit to determine the viability of bacterial populations for their cellular membrane integrity berney et al 2007 stiefel et al 2015 under the fluorescence microscope dm2500 leica germany excitation light at 480 and 540 nm live and dead bacteria emitted green and red fluorescence see fig s3 respectively within the cell counting chamber xb k 25 qiujing china the baclight staining and fluorescence microscope counting method has been used frequently in previous studies and considered as a reliable alternative to the conventional spread plate count method gong et al 2012 ivanova et al 2010 2 6 sem imaging of bacteria in order to explore inactivation mechanisms scanning electron microscope sem quanta 250 feg fei u s was applied to characterize the morphology of the bacteria after dehydration specifically the bacterial cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer 0 1 m ph 7 4 after being fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 2 4 h at room temperature then the fixed cells were exposed to a set of ethanol solutions 30 50 70 85 95 and 100 v v for 105 min 7 15 min consequently the bacteria were freeze dried in a vacuum alpha 1 2 ldplus christ germany for 15 h the dehydrated bacteria were sputter coated with platinum em scd500 leica germany for 120 s the dehydrated samples were scanned by a 20 kv beam at a work distance around 11 5 mm the aperture size of the sem microscopy was set at 3 μm and the images of the samples were recorded by the magnification of 80 000 or 100 000 2 7 so 4 steady state concentration measurements the steady state concentration of so 4 so 4 ss all abbreviations were tabulated in table s3 was measured using the probe compound p cba in the zvi ps system 30 μm and 10 μm for e coli and e faecalis respectively p cba was chosen as the probe compound to determine so 4 ss as the reactivity of p cba with so 4 is high k so 4 p cba 3 6 108 m 1 s 1 fang and shang 2012 and it has been frequently used as a reference compound in competitive kinetics studies cong et al 2015 neta et al 1977 xiao et al 2016 the p cba concentration was quantified by an ultra performance liquid chromatography acquity uplc m class waters u s equipped with a diode array detector at a wavelength of 254 nm the uplc is equipped with a 1 7 μm 2 1 50 mm column acquity uplc beh c18 waters u s and the column temperature was set at 35 c mobile eluents consisted of 65 phosphoric buffer 20 mm at ph 3 and 35 acetonitrile with a flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 the sample injection volume was 5 μl 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation in upw 3 1 1 disinfection kinetics and mechanisms the radical scavenging experiments with oh scavenger tba showed that there was no discrepancy for the degradation kinetics of p cba with or without tba fig s4 hence we confirmed that the dominant radical species in our system was determined to be so 4 under the disinfection experimental conditions as control we did not observe any bactericidal effect with either ps or zvi alone in the batch inactivation tests fig 1 black and cyan as shown in fig 1 blue in a c inactivation kinetics of the tested bacteria in the presence of zvi ps was significantly enhanced to the controls black and cyan in a c the enhanced kinetics indicated that so 4 plays a major role in the disinfection process additionally we observed that 90 inactivation of e coli was achieved after 80 min treatment with the initial ps concentration of 3 mm fig 1a blue as for e faecalis the initial ps concentration required for 75 inactivation was 1 mm and the disinfection time was only 12 min fig 1c blue on the basis of fig 1 a c the lethality coefficients pseudo first order inactivation rates indicating disinfection rate for the bacteria were measured to be 3 04 10 2 and 9 24 10 2 min 1 for e coli and e faecalis respectively these results illustrated that gram positive bacterium e faecalis was more sensitive to so 4 than gram negative bacterium e coli it should be noted that we observed slight aggregation of e faecalis after 12 min in a microscopic vision e faecalis typically remained evenly dispersed but in some localized areas they gathered to some extent which slightly interfered with bacterial counting this aggregation phenomenon only was observed after 12 min while the duration of the disinfection of e faecalis was 12 min thus aggregation of e faecalis will not affect our counting however we did not observe any aggregation of e coli during the entire experimental process i e 80 min this comparable result indicated that the aggregation is bacterial dependent in addition we did not observe corrosion products by the fluorescence staining method since the syto 9 and pi dyes stain only the nucleic acid and not the iron hydroxides in fact previous studies showed different resistance of gram negative and gram positive bacteria to disinfectants bae et al 2008 kühn et al 2003 seven et al 2004 the proposed inactivation mechanisms were largely based on the different physiological structures and chemical compositions of the cell walls electrostatic charge and surface adhesion properties van grieken et al 2010 gram positive bacteria typically have two layers cytoplasmic membrane and peptidoglycan layer whereas gram negative bacteria have an additional outer lipopolysaccharide membrane contributing to the strength of their structural integrity drakopoulou et al 2009 many studies reported that gram positive bacteria were more resistant than gram negative bacteria as the cytoplasmic membrane of gram positive bacteria is thicker and more tightly adheres to peptidoglycans than in the case of gram negative bacteria chung et al 2009 gomes et al 2009 thus the thinner wall of e coli provided less protection against disinfectants than e faecalis however other studies reported that gram negative bacteria were more resistant to disinfectants due to the complex outer membrane fu et al 2005 lan et al 2007 demidova also demonstrated that the higher resistance by gram negative bacteria than gram positive bacteria can be attributed to their different chemical composition of cell walls demidova and hamblin 2005 our results appear to support the explanation that the lack of outer lipopolysaccharide membrane makes it easier for so 4 to penetrate into the cytoplasmic membrane resulting in the higher disinfection rate for gram positive e faecalis in order to understand the destruction process of e coli and e faecalis at the cellular structure level morphology of both bacteria at different time intervals were examined by sem for e coli before the zvi ps treatment fig 2 a cells with smooth and intact membranes normally exhibited rod shaped morphology after 40 min treatment fig 2b the cell wall wrinkled with small pits and bulges and the bacteria gradually became deformed with visible holes after 80 min treatment fig 2c many e coli cells were losing the integrity of the wall cell structures resulting in leakage of cytoplasm xia et al 2017 as such it was hard to distinguish their original morphology the morphological change for e faecalis fig 3 was similar to that of e coli before the treatment fig 3a the intact surface of the elliptical cells was fairly smooth during the course of so 4 oxidation fig 3b and c the surface then became less smooth and demonstrated an increase of rupture the irreversible damage under oxidative attack of so 4 could ultimately affect membrane permeability intracellular chemical environment and physiological function these events together resulted in death of the bacteria we observed slow generation of iron hydroxides with an increase of reaction time as fig s5 circled shows some small solid substances attached to the smooth cell surface could be iron hydroxides residues in the sem images however the numbers were low since the bacterial samples for sem were washed at least ten times with phosphate buffer and ethanol solutions in addition we also examined and compared their morphological damage with uv irradiation which is reported to primarily dimerize adjacent thymine molecules in dna ultimately leading to failure in reproduction without damaging cell madigan et al 2008 setlow 1967 before uv treatment the cells were generally smooth walled bodies and typically rod shaped e coli elliptical e faecalis figs 2d and 3d for e coli after 20 s uv irradiation the surface slightly appeared uniformly rough due to well defined cellular wrinkling fig 2e and this roughness increased to a small degree after 40 s irradiation fig 2f for e faecalis this kind of roughness was even less pronounced fig 3e and f as compared to e coli meanwhile we measured the disinfection efficiency of e coli with spread plate count method after 20 s uv irradiation and the result showed that 5 log inactivation of e coli was achieved with the uv exposure of 0 23 mj cm 2 which was in a good agreement with previous studies harris et al 1987 zimmer and slawson 2002 the relatively unchanged morphology of the bacteria membranes along with the spread plate counting result during the course of uv treatment appears to support that uv primarily damaged gene materials to ultimately inactivate bacterial cells which is different from the so 4 disinfection process 3 1 2 calculating k values between so 4 and bacteria we first measured the steady state concentration of so 4 with bacteria so 4 ss upw wb and ct profiles of disinfection in upw based on the decay of probe compound p cba so 4 ss upw wb were determined to be 4 31 10 13 m and 2 84 10 13 m in the presence of e coli and e faecalis in upw respectively the goodness of the linear fitting r 2 0 99 for the decay of p cba confirmed the assumption that the exposure of so 4 to bacteria was steady state in upw the ct value for 1 log inactivation of e coli was measured to be 2 07 10 9 m s and the ct value for 0 58 log inactivation of e faecalis was 2 04 10 10 m s in comparison to previous studies binaco et al investigated the e faecalis inactivation using ps induced by solar photolysis of fe iii ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid complex in their fenton like system in distilled water bianco et al 2017 they reported that the ct value for around 4 5 log inactivation was 4 2 10 8 m s under natural solar radiation with 0 1 mm fe iii complex and 0 5 mm ps it should be noted that it is not appropriate to compare the ct values among studies as the reported ct values in different studies cannot be compared directly unless they achieved the same degree of bacterial inactivation which we believe is the most apparent limitation therefore the concept of using k value a fixed parameter regardless of the amount of required inactivation of bacteria for radical inactivation offers more accurate and direct comparison between different studies the inactivation kinetic model on the basis of the differential rate law was constructed to estimate the disinfection rate constant k gyürék and finch 1998 6 d n d t k m n x c n t m 1 where n is the number of surviving bacteria k is experimentally determined disinfection rate constant c is the concentration of the disinfectant and m n and x are empirical constants typically there are four genres of microbial inactivation kinetic curves exponential decrease shoulder exponential decrease shoulder tailing off decrease and tailing off decrease fig s6 gyürék and finch 1998 all these four genres can be depicted in various forms of eqn 6 in tables s4 and s5 we fitted the measured inactivation kinetics of two strains of bacteria to 7 various differential rate law disinfection models the purposes of these two tables are two folded 1 to make it convenient for others to compare with our study and 2 to obtain the most optimal fit for the measured data we selected 4 out of 7 models namely hom rational hom power law and rennecker mariñas rm models for further consideration due to their highest r 2 values 0 95 0 99 however for modelling processes fewer parameters are always preferred as a model with too many parameters causes overparametrization resulting in covariates gyürék and finch 1998 thus the models with the least fitting parameters were considered resulting in only rm model left fig 4 in addition many parameters such as m n x in the models that were removed do not contain explicit physiochemical connotation on the contrary k in the rm model with the unit of m 1 s 1 denotes the second order rate constant between so 4 and the bacteria while b for describing the lag phase indicating the minimal dosage of so 4 that has bactericidal effect this retardation of the bactericidal effect could be due to the electrostatic repulsion between the surfaces of bacteria and so 4 wordofa et al 2017 in addition the inactivation of bacteria cannot be observed until the cumulative effect of attacking so 4 leads to cell membrane damage in comparing the lag coefficient of e coli and e faecalis the b values were 3 96 10 10 and 3 61 10 11 m s respectively the slightly larger b value for e coli corroborates that the additional outer lipopolysaccharide membrane of e coli may contribute to the structural integrity from different so 4 reactivities for the two strains of bacteria it is also likely that the difference in lag phase can be related to different repair mechanisms of the tested bacteria beuchat 1978 lushchak 2001 based on the rm model the k values for so 4 reacting e coli and e faecalis were determined to be 1 39 109 and 6 71 109 m 1 s 1 respectively and the fit coefficients r 2 for e coli and e faecalis were 0 98 and 0 95 respectively it is worth mentioning that this is the first reported k value between so 4 and bacteria wolf et al measured k values of five human enteric viruses and four bacteriophages reacting with o3 and the k values ranged from 4 5 105 to 3 3 106 m 1 s 1 in milli q water which were at least one order of magnitude lower than this study wolf et al 2018 the lower k value of o3 than that of so 4 could be attributed to lower redox potential 2 07 v vs nhe for o3 and the differences in physiological structures between viruses and target bacteria almand et al 2017 kopf et al 2000 3 2 inactivation in we the inactivation efficiency in we fig 1b and d was greatly reduced compared to upw fig 1a and c for example 1 log inactivation of e coli was observed within 80 min in upw whereas only 0 32 log inactivation was achieved in we at the same time span similarly rodríguez chueca et al used uv to activate pms 0 1 mm for inactivating e coli in a simulated deionized water based winery wastewater sww and real winery wastewater rww rodríguez chueca et al 2017 they found that 6 log and 0 5 log reduction of e coli was achieved after 90 min in sww and rww respectively indicating that the water matrix affected the inactivation efficiencies to a great extent in fact the organic and inorganic constituents in the we decreases the steady state concentration of so 4 in the zvi ps system consequently reducing inactivation efficiencies for the matrix organics gao et al reported that the presence of microorganisms derived organic matter quenched so 4 with a high k value of 2 48 108 mc 1 s 1 resulting in less available so 4 reacting with target contaminants bacteria gao et al 2019 for the matrix inorganics inorganics constituents also affect steady state concentration of so 4 via radical scavenging and complexation of fe2 fe3 ratanatamskul et al 2010 siedlecka and stepnowski 2006 so 4 also exhibits high reactivity with halide ions such as cl and br with high k values up to 108 109 m 1 s 1 see eqns 10 11 in table 1 in addition the complex reactions eqns 17 22 in table 1 between ligands e g cl and so 4 2 and fe2 result in less so 4 yield activated by fe2 lu et al 2005 3 3 kinetics models of bacterial inactivation in order to better understand the disinfection mechanisms and predict the kinetics in situation where empirical chick based models are limited e g empirical models exhibit tendency to emphasize measured data and ignore physicochemical insights for the disinfection process we developed a mechanistic process level disinfection kinetic model in we with the obtained k values then we quantified the uncertainty and assessed the sensitivity involved in predicting bacterial inactivation for the model 3 3 1 modelling inactivation kinetics of bacteria since our inactivation model was developed based on the rate law the concentrations of e coli and e faecalis i e cfu ml 1 under investigation need to be converted to molar based concentrations i e m the conversion was based on the so 4 ss with so 4 ss upw wb and without bacteria so 4 ss upw w ob in the zvi ps system obtained by experimental measurements the reactions involved in calculation of so 4 ss in upw and we are tabulated in table 1 here we demonstrated the conversion calculations taking e coli as an example under the steady state condition in the zvi ps system in upw without e coli the formation rate of so 4 was equal to the rate of consumption thus the so 4 steady state concentrations without bacteria so 4 ss upw w ob can be expressed as 7 r 0 so 4 k 3 so 4 ss upw w ob oh k 4 so 4 ss upw w ob h 2 o k 5 so 4 ss upw w ob s 2 o 8 2 k 8 so 4 ss upw w ob ac k 9 so 4 ss upw w ob hac k 10 so 4 ss upw w ob p cba β so 4 ss upw w ob where β was introduced to simplify the equation 8 β k 3 oh k 4 h 2 o k 5 s 2 o 8 2 k 8 ac k 9 hac k 10 p cba similarly in upw system with e coli the formation rate of so 4 can be expressed as 9 r 0 so 4 k 3 so 4 ss upw wb oh k 4 so 4 ss upw wb h 2 o k 5 so 4 ss upw wb s 2 o 8 2 k 8 so 4 ss upw wb ac k 9 so 4 ss upw wb hac k 10 so 4 ss upw wb p cba k e c so 4 ss upw wb c eq so 4 ss upw wb β k e c c eq where c eq is the equivalent concentration of e coli in the unit of m and k e c is the second order rate constant between so 4 and e coli measured in this study 1 39 109 m 1 s 1 at steady state condition eqn 7 is equal to eqn 9 thus 10 c eq β so 4 ss upw w ob so 4 ss upw wb β k e c so 4 ss upw w ob was measured to be 1 44 10 12 and 8 87 10 13 m for e coli and e faecalis so 4 ss upw wb was measured to be 4 31 10 13 and 2 84 10 13 m for e coli and e faecalis respectively with eqn 10 c eq of e coli and e faecalis were calculated to be 7 53 10 5 and 1 15 10 5 m it should be noted that although the initial e coli and e faecalis concentration is 1 07 107 cfu ml 1 these two strains of bacteria have different resistance to so 4 thus different scavenging effect to so 4 therefore based on their quenching capacity which was characterized by measured steady state concentration of so 4 these two strains of bacteria have different equivalent concentrations based on the equivalent concentration of bacteria the steady state concentration of so 4 in the presence of bacteria in we so 4 ss we wb can be expressed as 11 r 0 so 4 k 3 so 4 ss we wb oh k 4 so 4 ss we wb h 2 o k 5 so 4 ss we wb s 2 o 8 2 k 8 so 4 ss we wb ac k 9 so 4 ss we wb hac k 10 so 4 ss we wb p cba k 11 so 4 ss we wb cl k 12 so 4 ss we wb br k 13 so 4 ss we wb

between so 4 mediated inactivation rate constant min 1 of target bacteria in we k we so 4 and upw k upw so 4 can be expressed as 13 k we so 4 k upw so 4 k e c so 4 ss we wb k e c so 4 ss upw wb β k e c c eq γ k e c c eq then 14 q 1 k we so 4 k upw so 4 1 β k e c c eq γ k e c c eq where q is so 4 quenching ratio of the environmental matrix with efom br cl no 3 and hco 3 concentration measurements in we q for e coli disinfection process was 0 514 indicating that 51 4 of so 4 was quenched by the environmental matrix thus the portion of so 4 that used to inactivate the bacteria is 1 q 1 0 514 0 486 with the same method the q for e faecalis was calculated to be 0 581 thus with eqn 14 the disinfection kinetics in we can be modelled see red lines in fig 1b and d it should be noted that the status of the microorganism varies greatly in different occasions which would cause changes of c eq values and the kinetic rate constants between cells and so 4 thus the predictability of our disinfection models will be jeopardized the exploration of the c eq and k values with bacteria in different physiological states is highly needed in future studies for the application of our model in order to assess model performance the parameter of root mean square error rmse and absolute model bias amb were used the rmse is a statistical indicator frequently used to measure the difference between predicted values and the values observed while amb is a measure for model output deviating from the observations but with directionality of the systematic bias armitage et al 2013 mentaschi et al 2013 the rmse values for predicting disinfection of e coli and e faecalis by the model were 0 17 and 0 05 respectively the amb values for two disinfection processes were 0 11 and 0 13 respectively the rmse and amb metrics indicated that the model exhibited a satisfying performance on predicting the disinfection kinetics in we for the two strains of bacteria 3 3 2 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis the sensitivity of the model to variation in relevant input parameters was conducted by running the model for a small 1 change in each input parameter i and determining the effect on predicted output o the relevant input parameters include various k values for the reactions with so 4 and we constituent concentration see table s6 the sensitivity factor s for each input parameter was then determined independently as follows 15 s δ o o δ i i o o i i the results are presented in table s6 show that the key parameters affecting the model predictions include the k values for reaction with so 4 and we concentrations for br and cl followed by efom other we constituents and their k values with so 4 have little effect and the corresponding s is small i e approaching 0 it should be noted that input parameters for the model do not have identical errors or expected variability the range of variability in input parameters is reported as confidence factor cf in table s6 as well assuming a lognormal distribution a cf of 3 implies a 95 probability that the input value would lie between 1 3 and 3 times the median with the assumption that partial derivatives of input and output are constant over the range of uncertainty in input parameters for the model a preliminary uncertainty analysis can be conducted macleod et al 2002 the confidence factor for uncertainty in model output due to uncertainty in any input parameter j can be calculated as 16 c f o j c f i j s j the fractional contribution of variance in input parameter j to overall variance in the model output can then be written as 17 ln c f i j 2 s i j 2 j 1 n ln c f i j 2 s i j 2 the key input parameters contributing to variance in predicting disinfection kinetics of e coli and e faecalis are presented in fig 5 the most significant contribution to uncertainty in model predicted disinfection was provided by the k values for the reaction of so 4 with cl and br accounting for 52 and 29 of output variance other significant parameters include we concentrations of br and cl with contributions of about 10 and 7 respectively to the model output variance it should be noted that the reactions between secondary halogen free radicals e g br cl in eqns 11 and 12 in table 1 and bacteria were not considered during modelling calculation due to serious lack of their reactivity data this simplification may lead to underestimate inactivation processes 4 conclusions in this study we reported the kinetics and mechanisms of e coli and e faecalis inactivation with in different water matrices with experimental and modelling approaches we used k between so 4 and microorganisms to quantitatively reflect bacterial resistance which was a concept that will connect background water constituents with both target microorganisms and other macro micro pollutants within one comprehensive framework for simultaneous evaluation of their removal efficiencies during adps the k values between so 4 and e coli and e faecalis were measured to be 1 39 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 and 6 71 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 respectively the morphological images indicated that so 4 initiates a series of chain reactions on the wall membranes causing their irreversible damage ultimately affecting membrane permeability and physiological functions this work provided bigger picture and detailed perspective on disinfection kinetics and mechanisms which are expected to result in further advancement in scientific and technological research on so 4 based adps declaration of competing interest the authors

18104,practical applications of disinfection technologies for engineered waters require an in depth understanding of disinfection profiles and mechanisms of pathogenic bacteria in a complex matrix this study investigated the inactivation of e coli and e faecalis by so 4 an emerging advanced disinfectant in ultrapure water upw and wastewater effluent we based on the bacterial inactivation kinetics in upw in a zerovalent iron peroxydisulfate system the second order rate constants k for so 4 reacting with e coli and e faecalis were measured to be 1 39 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 and 6 71 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 respectively the morphological images of both bacteria by the scanning electron microscope indicated that so 4 initiates oxidative reactions on the wall membranes causing their irreversible damage ultimately affecting membrane permeability and physiological functions to profile the inactivation kinetics of two strains of bacteria in we matrix a mechanistic process based model with the obtained k values was developed sensitivity and uncertainty analyses indicated that the key parameters for the model predictions were the concentrations of halide ions i e br and cl in we and their k values reacting with so 4 accounting for 80 of uncertainty or variance expected in predicted bacterial inactivation this model allows precise estimation of required disinfectant dose even in complex water matrices shedding lights on the extension of application of so 4 based technology in wastewater treatments graphical abstract image 1 keywords so 4 based disinfection processes second order rate

pathogenic microorganisms for public health collivignarelli et al 2017 leeuwen 2000 advanced disinfection processes adps receive a great deal of attention due to their higher disinfection efficiency and more controllable formation of disinfection byproducts dbps than conventional chlorine based methods dadjour et al 2005 ferro et al 2015 xiao et al 2019a for example no bromate and dbps were reported to form in uv h2o2 system penru et al 2012 hydroxyl radical oh based adps are promising technology due to the strong oxidative property of oh with redox potential of 2 7 v vs normal hydrogen

et al 2016 sulfate radical so 4 in contrast is an attractive alternative to oh due to its low reactivity with background water constituents e g efom and high redox potential 2 5 3 1 v vs nhe neta et al 1988 xiao et al 2015a 2019b so 4 can be generated by activation of ps or pms with various methods such as uv heat and transition metal ions ho et al 2019 wang et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 for example wordofa et al found a better disinfection performance of so 4 based adps for the inactivation of e coli o157 h7 as compared to oh based adps wordofa et al 2017 the differences in deactivation caused by oh and so 4 were compared on the basis of ct radical concentration exposure time value the induction time of e coli observed by oh was found to be almost 5 folds longer than that by so 4 further oh et al reported that the ct values for o3 o3 h2o2 and o3 peroxydisulfate ps were 31 0 29 9 and 15 9 mg l 1 min for the 2 log inactivation of e coli respectively also indicating a better disinfection performance of so 4 based adps than o3 and oh oh et al 2014 in the radical based adps a possible concern associated with the ct value being used as an indicator of disinfection efficiency is that it varies dramatically with aquatic quality parameters and other water constituents e g concentrations of background efom and halide ions for example at the concentration of 3 mg l 1 of disinfectant i e monochloramine kahler et al reported the ct values of 980 and 2100 mg min l 1 for 3 log reduction of echovirus 11 in two types of pretreated surface waters suggesting that water matrix affects disinfection to a great extent kahler et al 2011 in addition a ct value also varies depending on the required amount e g 1 log or 2 log reduction of inactivation of the bacteria roy et al reported 0 072 mg l 1 min of the ct value for 2 log inactivation of coxsackievirus b5 by o3 roy et al 1981 whereas sigmon et al determined a ct value of 0 15 mg l 1 min for 3 5 log inactivation of coxsackievirus b5 by o3 cole et al 2015 as a consequence the case specific ct values cause perplexity and over specification of experimental conditions for other scientists to refer to lacking a standard means of comparison we hence used the second order reaction rate constants k m 1 s 1 an aquatic quality independent parameter between disinfectants and microorganisms to qualitatively reflect bacterial resistance the use of k provides advantages including 1 to allow direct comparison of bactericidal effects among disinfectants regardless of the amount of required inactivation of bacteria 2 to precisely estimate required disinfectant dose with a k value even for different water qualities and 3 to holistically link background water constituents e g efom and inorganics target microorganisms and other macro micro pollutants by the rate law for comprehensive assessment of the efficiency of disinfectants in addition k value is widely acquainted by chemists as compared to the concept of ct in the present study we investigated the so 4 mediated inactivation kinetics of both gram negative e coli and gram positive enterococcus faecalis e faecalis bacteria zero valent iron zvi was used to activate ps for generating so 4 with advantages 1 so 4 yield activated by zvi is reported to be efficient and stable and the radical pathway is dominant as compared to non radical pathway drzewicz et

different conditions in ultrapure water upw then disinfection mechanisms were elucidated by a suite of macro and micro analytical techniques with the k values in upw a process based model was developed allowing us to comprehensively link background water constituents pollutants and target microorganisms for the purpose of estimation of disinfectant doses the uncertainty and sensitivity involved in the models were quantified and assessed accordingly the established mechanistic model provides in depth understanding on disinfection processes the experimental and modeling results shed light on the extension of the application of so 4 in water engineering 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents information such as sources and purity of chemicals was provided in table s1

selected e coli bl21 atcc baa 1025 and e faecalis atcc 19433 as target surrogates for gram negative and gram positive bacteria respectively the two bacterial species are commonly used as fecal contamination indicator microorganisms during water and wastewater treatment processes anderson et al 2005 tallon et al 2005 the freeze dried bacteria were purchased from atcc and revived subsequently

dominant radical species that was responsible for inactivation in the system tert butanol tba a typical oh scavenger was used we also used uv for disinfection for kinetic comparison and mechanism

glutaraldehyde for 2 4 h at room temperature then the fixed cells were exposed to a set of ethanol solutions 30 50 70 85 95 and 100 v v for 105 min 7 15 min consequently the bacteria were freeze dried

concentration measurements the steady state concentration of so 4 so 4 ss all abbreviations were tabulated in table s3 was measured using the probe compound p cba in the zvi ps system 30 μm and 10 μm

results and discussion 3 1 inactivation in upw 3 1 1 disinfection kinetics and mechanisms the radical scavenging experiments with oh scavenger tba showed that there was no discrepancy for the degradation kinetics of p cba with or without tba fig s4 hence we confirmed that the dominant radical species in our system was determined to be so 4 under the disinfection experimental conditions as control we did not observe any bactericidal effect with either ps or zvi alone in the batch inactivation tests fig 1 black and cyan as shown in fig 1 blue in a c inactivation kinetics of the tested bacteria in the presence of zvi ps was significantly enhanced to the controls black and cyan in a c the enhanced kinetics indicated that so 4 plays a major role in the disinfection process additionally we observed that 90 inactivation of e coli was achieved after 80 min treatment with the initial ps concentration of 3 mm fig 1a blue as for e faecalis the initial ps concentration required for 75 inactivation was 1 mm and the disinfection time was only 12 min fig 1c blue on the basis of fig 1 a c the lethality coefficients pseudo first order inactivation rates indicating disinfection rate for the bacteria were measured to be 3 04 10 2 and 9 24 10 2 min 1 for e coli and e faecalis respectively these results illustrated that gram positive bacterium e faecalis was more sensitive to so 4 than gram negative bacterium e coli it should be noted that we observed slight aggregation of e faecalis after 12 min in a microscopic vision e faecalis typically remained evenly dispersed but in some localized areas they gathered to some extent which slightly interfered with bacterial counting this aggregation phenomenon only was observed after 12 min while the duration of the disinfection of e faecalis was 12 min thus aggregation of e faecalis will not affect our counting however we did not observe any aggregation of e coli during the entire experimental process i e 80 min this comparable result indicated that the aggregation is bacterial dependent in addition we did not observe corrosion products by the fluorescence staining method since the syto 9 and pi dyes stain only the nucleic acid and not the iron hydroxides in fact previous studies showed different resistance of gram negative and gram positive bacteria to disinfectants bae et al 2008 kühn et al 2003 seven et al 2004 the proposed inactivation mechanisms were largely based on the different physiological structures and chemical compositions of the cell walls electrostatic charge and surface adhesion properties van grieken et al 2010 gram positive bacteria typically have two layers cytoplasmic membrane and peptidoglycan layer whereas gram negative bacteria have an additional outer lipopolysaccharide membrane contributing to the strength of their structural integrity drakopoulou et al 2009 many studies reported that gram positive bacteria were more resistant than gram negative bacteria as the cytoplasmic membrane of gram positive bacteria is thicker and more tightly adheres to peptidoglycans than in the case of gram negative bacteria chung et al 2009 gomes et al 2009 thus the thinner wall of e coli provided less protection against disinfectants than e faecalis however other studies reported that gram negative bacteria were more resistant to disinfectants due to the complex outer membrane fu et al 2005 lan et al 2007 demidova also demonstrated that the higher resistance by gram negative bacteria than gram positive bacteria can be attributed to their different chemical composition of cell walls demidova and hamblin 2005 our results appear to support the explanation that the lack of outer lipopolysaccharide membrane makes it easier for so 4 to penetrate into the cytoplasmic membrane resulting in the higher disinfection rate for gram positive e faecalis in order to understand the destruction process of e coli and e faecalis at the cellular structure level morphology of both bacteria at different time intervals were examined by sem for e coli before the zvi ps treatment fig 2 a cells with smooth and intact membranes normally exhibited rod shaped morphology after 40 min treatment fig 2b the cell wall wrinkled with small pits and bulges and the bacteria gradually became deformed with visible holes after 80 min treatment fig 2c many e coli cells were losing the integrity of the wall cell structures resulting in leakage of cytoplasm xia et al 2017 as such it was hard to distinguish their original morphology the morphological change for e faecalis fig 3 was similar to that of e coli before the treatment fig 3a the intact surface of the elliptical cells was fairly smooth during the course of so 4 oxidation fig 3b and c the surface then became less smooth and demonstrated an increase of rupture the irreversible damage under oxidative attack of so 4 could ultimately affect membrane permeability intracellular chemical environment and physiological function these events together resulted in death of the bacteria we observed slow generation of iron hydroxides with an increase of reaction time as fig s5 circled shows some small solid substances attached to the smooth cell surface could be iron hydroxides residues in the sem images however the numbers were low since the bacterial samples for sem were washed at least ten times with phosphate buffer and ethanol solutions in addition we also examined and compared their morphological damage with uv irradiation which is reported to primarily dimerize adjacent thymine molecules in dna ultimately leading to failure in reproduction without damaging cell madigan et al 2008 setlow 1967 before uv treatment the cells were generally smooth walled bodies and typically rod shaped e coli elliptical e faecalis figs 2d and 3d for e coli after 20 s uv irradiation the surface slightly appeared uniformly rough due to well defined cellular wrinkling fig 2e and this roughness increased to a small degree after 40 s irradiation fig 2f for e faecalis this kind of roughness was even less pronounced fig 3e and f as compared to e coli meanwhile we measured the disinfection efficiency of e coli with spread plate count method after 20 s uv irradiation and the result showed that 5 log inactivation of e coli was achieved with the uv exposure of 0 23 mj cm 2 which was in a good agreement with previous studies harris et al 1987 zimmer and slawson 2002 the relatively unchanged morphology of the bacteria membranes along with the spread plate counting result during the course of uv treatment appears to support that uv primarily damaged gene materials to ultimately inactivate bacterial cells which is different from the so 4 disinfection process 3 1 2 calculating k values between so 4 and bacteria we first measured the steady state concentration of so 4 with bacteria so 4 ss upw wb and ct profiles of disinfection in upw based on the decay of probe compound p cba so 4 ss upw wb were determined to be 4 31 10 13 m and 2 84 10 13 m in the presence of e coli and e faecalis in upw respectively the goodness of the linear fitting r 2 0 99 for the decay of p cba confirmed the assumption that the exposure of so 4 to bacteria was steady state in upw the ct value for 1 log inactivation of e coli was measured to be 2 07 10 9 m s and the ct value for 0 58 log inactivation of e faecalis was 2 04 10 10 m s in comparison to previous studies binaco et al investigated the e faecalis inactivation using ps induced by solar photolysis of fe iii ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid complex in their fenton like system in distilled water bianco et al 2017 they reported that the ct value for around 4 5 log inactivation was 4 2 10 8 m s under natural solar radiation with 0 1 mm fe iii complex and 0 5 mm ps it should be noted that it is not appropriate to compare the ct values among studies as the reported ct values in different studies cannot be compared directly unless they achieved the same degree of bacterial inactivation which we believe is the most apparent limitation therefore the concept of using k value a fixed parameter regardless of the amount of required inactivation of bacteria for radical inactivation offers more accurate and direct comparison between different studies the inactivation kinetic model on the basis of the differential rate law was constructed to estimate the disinfection rate constant k gyürék and finch 1998 6 d n d t k m n x c n t m 1 where n is the number of surviving bacteria k is experimentally determined disinfection rate constant c is the concentration of the disinfectant and m n and x are empirical constants typically there are four genres of microbial inactivation kinetic curves exponential decrease shoulder exponential decrease shoulder tailing off decrease and tailing off decrease fig s6 gyürék and finch 1998 all these four genres can be depicted in various forms of eqn 6 in tables s4 and s5 we fitted the measured inactivation kinetics of two strains of bacteria to 7 various differential rate law disinfection models the purposes of these two tables are two folded 1 to make it convenient for others to compare with our study and 2 to obtain the most optimal fit for the measured data we selected 4 out of 7 models namely hom rational hom power law and rennecker mariñas rm models for further consideration due to their highest r 2 values 0 95 0 99 however for modelling processes fewer parameters are always preferred as a model with too many parameters causes overparametrization resulting in covariates gyürék and finch 1998 thus the models with the least fitting parameters were considered resulting in only rm model left fig 4 in addition many parameters such as m n x in the models that were removed do not contain explicit physiochemical connotation on the contrary k in the rm model with the unit of m 1 s 1 denotes the second order rate constant between so 4 and the bacteria while b for describing the lag phase indicating the minimal dosage of so 4 that has bactericidal effect this retardation of the bactericidal effect could be due to the electrostatic repulsion between the surfaces of bacteria and so 4 wordofa et al 2017 in addition the inactivation of bacteria cannot be observed until the cumulative effect of attacking so 4 leads to cell membrane damage in comparing the lag coefficient of e coli and e faecalis the b values were 3 96 10 10 and 3 61 10 11 m s respectively the slightly larger b value for e coli corroborates that the additional outer lipopolysaccharide membrane of e coli may contribute to the structural integrity from different so 4 reactivities for the two strains of bacteria it is also likely that the difference in lag phase can be related to different repair mechanisms of the tested bacteria beuchat 1978 lushchak 2001 based on the rm model the k values for so 4 reacting e coli and e faecalis were determined to be 1 39 109 and 6 71 109 m 1 s 1 respectively and the fit coefficients r 2 for e coli and e faecalis were 0 98 and 0 95 respectively it is worth mentioning that this is the first reported k value between so 4 and bacteria wolf et al measured k values of five human enteric viruses and four bacteriophages reacting with o3 and the k values ranged from 4 5 105 to 3 3 106 m 1 s 1 in milli q water which were at least one order of magnitude lower than this study wolf et al 2018 the lower k value of o3 than that of so 4 could be attributed to lower redox potential 2 07 v vs nhe for o3 and the differences in physiological structures between viruses and target bacteria almand et al 2017 kopf et al 2000 3 2 inactivation in we the inactivation efficiency in we fig 1b and d was greatly reduced compared to upw fig 1a and c for example 1 log inactivation of e coli was observed within 80 min in upw whereas only 0 32 log inactivation was achieved in we at the same time span similarly rodríguez chueca et al used uv to activate pms 0 1 mm for inactivating e coli in a simulated deionized water based winery wastewater sww and real winery wastewater rww rodríguez chueca et al 2017 they found that 6 log and 0 5 log reduction of e coli was achieved after 90 min in sww and rww respectively indicating that the water matrix affected the inactivation efficiencies to a great extent in fact the organic and inorganic constituents in the we decreases the steady state concentration of so 4 in the zvi ps system consequently reducing inactivation efficiencies for the matrix organics gao et al reported that the presence of microorganisms derived organic matter quenched so 4 with a high k value of 2 48 108 mc 1 s 1 resulting in less available so 4 reacting with target contaminants bacteria gao et al 2019 for the matrix inorganics inorganics constituents also affect steady state concentration of so 4 via radical scavenging and complexation of fe2 fe3 ratanatamskul et al 2010 siedlecka and stepnowski 2006 so 4 also exhibits high reactivity with halide ions such as cl and br with high k values up to 108 109 m 1 s 1 see eqns 10 11 in table 1 in addition the complex reactions eqns 17 22 in table 1 between ligands e g cl and so 4 2 and fe2 result in less so 4 yield activated by fe2 lu et al 2005 3 3 kinetics models of bacterial inactivation in order to better understand the disinfection mechanisms and predict the kinetics in situation where empirical chick based models are limited e g empirical models exhibit tendency to emphasize measured data and ignore physicochemical insights for the disinfection process we developed a mechanistic process level disinfection kinetic model in we with the obtained k values then we quantified the uncertainty and assessed the sensitivity involved in predicting bacterial inactivation for the model 3 3 1 modelling inactivation kinetics of bacteria since our inactivation model was developed based on the rate law the concentrations of e coli and e faecalis i e cfu ml 1 under investigation need to be converted to molar based concentrations i e m the conversion was based on the so 4 ss with so 4 ss upw wb and without bacteria so 4 ss upw w ob in the zvi ps system obtained by experimental measurements the reactions involved in calculation of so 4 ss in upw and we are tabulated in table 1 here we demonstrated the conversion calculations taking e coli as an example under the steady state condition in the zvi ps system in upw without e coli the formation rate of so 4 was equal to the rate of consumption thus the so 4 steady state concentrations without bacteria so 4 ss upw w ob can be expressed as 7 r 0 so 4 k 3 so 4 ss upw w ob oh k 4 so 4 ss upw w ob h 2 o k 5 so 4 ss upw w ob s 2 o 8 2 k 8 so 4 ss upw w ob ac k 9 so 4 ss upw w ob hac k 10 so 4 ss upw w ob p cba β so 4 ss upw w ob where β was introduced to simplify the equation 8 β k 3 oh k 4 h 2 o k 5 s 2 o 8 2 k 8 ac k 9 hac k 10 p cba similarly in upw system with e coli the formation rate of so 4 can be expressed as 9 r 0 so 4 k 3 so 4 ss upw wb oh k 4 so 4 ss upw wb h 2 o k 5 so 4 ss upw wb s 2 o 8 2 k 8 so 4 ss upw wb ac k 9 so 4 ss upw wb hac k 10 so 4 ss upw wb p cba k e c so 4 ss upw wb c eq so 4 ss upw wb β k e c c eq where c eq is the equivalent concentration of e coli in the unit of m and k e c is the second order rate constant between so 4 and e coli measured in this study 1 39 109 m 1 s 1 at steady state condition eqn 7 is equal to eqn 9 thus 10 c eq β so 4 ss upw w ob so 4 ss upw wb β k e c so 4 ss upw w ob was measured to be 1 44 10 12 and 8 87 10 13 m for e coli and e faecalis so 4 ss upw wb was measured to be 4 31 10 13 and 2 84 10 13 m for e coli and e faecalis respectively with eqn 10 c eq of e coli and e faecalis were calculated to be 7 53 10 5 and 1 15 10 5 m it should be noted that although the initial e coli and e faecalis concentration is 1 07 107 cfu ml 1 these two strains of bacteria have different resistance to so 4 thus different scavenging effect to so 4 therefore based on their quenching capacity which was characterized by measured steady state concentration of so 4 these two strains of bacteria have different equivalent concentrations based on the equivalent concentration of bacteria the steady state concentration of so 4 in the presence of bacteria in we so 4 ss we wb can be expressed as 11 r 0 so 4 k 3 so 4 ss we wb oh k 4 so 4 ss we wb h 2 o k 5 so 4 ss we wb s 2 o 8 2 k 8 so 4 ss we wb ac k 9 so 4 ss we wb hac k 10 so 4 ss we wb p cba k 11 so 4 ss we wb cl k 12 so 4 ss we wb br k 13 so 4 ss we wb no 3 k 14 so 4 ss we wb hco 3 k 15 so 4 ss we wb efom k e c so 4 ss we wb c eq so 4 ss we wb γ k e c c eq where γ was introduced to simplify eqn 11 12 γ k 3 oh k 4 h 2 o k 5 s 2 o 8 2 k 8 ac k 9 hac k 10 p cba k 11 cl k 12 br k 13 no 3 k 14 hco 3 k 15 efom on the basis of eqn 9 and eqn 11 so 4 ss upw wb β k e c c eq is equal to so 4 ss we wb γ k e c c eq under steady state condition thus the ratio between so 4 mediated inactivation rate constant min 1 of target bacteria in we k we so 4 and upw k upw so 4 can be expressed as 13 k we so 4 k upw so 4 k e c so 4 ss we wb k e c so 4 ss upw wb β k e c c eq γ k e c c eq then 14 q 1 k we so 4 k upw so 4 1 β k e c c eq γ k e c c eq where q is so 4 quenching ratio of the environmental matrix with efom br cl no 3 and hco 3 concentration measurements in we q for e coli disinfection process was 0 514 indicating that 51 4 of so 4 was quenched by the environmental matrix thus the portion of so 4 that used to inactivate the bacteria is 1 q 1 0 514 0 486 with the same method the q for e faecalis was calculated to be 0 581 thus with eqn 14 the disinfection kinetics in we can be modelled see red lines in fig 1b and d it should be noted that the status of the microorganism varies greatly in different occasions which would cause changes of c eq values and the kinetic rate constants between cells and so 4 thus the predictability of our disinfection models will be jeopardized the exploration of the c eq and k values with bacteria in different physiological states is highly needed in future studies for the application of our model in order to assess model performance the parameter of root mean square error rmse and absolute model bias amb were used the rmse is a statistical indicator frequently used to measure the difference between predicted values and the values observed while amb is a measure for model output deviating from the observations but with directionality of the systematic bias armitage et al 2013 mentaschi et al 2013 the rmse values for predicting disinfection of e coli and e faecalis by the model were 0 17 and 0 05 respectively the amb values for two disinfection processes were 0 11 and 0 13 respectively the rmse and amb metrics indicated that the model exhibited a satisfying performance on predicting the disinfection kinetics in we for the two strains of bacteria 3 3 2 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis the sensitivity of the model to variation in relevant input parameters was conducted by running the model for a small 1 change in each input parameter i and determining the effect on predicted output o the relevant input parameters include various k values for the reactions with so 4 and we constituent concentration see table s6 the sensitivity factor s for each input parameter was then determined independently as follows 15 s δ o o δ i i o o i i the results are presented in table s6 show that the key parameters affecting the model predictions include the k values for reaction with so 4 and we concentrations for br and cl followed by efom other we constituents and their k values with so 4 have little effect and the corresponding s is small i e approaching 0 it should be noted that input parameters for the model do not have identical errors or expected variability the range of variability in input parameters is reported as confidence factor cf in table s6 as well assuming a lognormal distribution a cf of 3 implies a 95 probability that the input value would lie between 1 3 and 3 times the median with the assumption that partial derivatives of input and output are constant over the range of uncertainty in input parameters for the model a preliminary uncertainty analysis can be conducted macleod et al 2002 the confidence factor for uncertainty in model output due to uncertainty in any input parameter j can be calculated as 16 c f o j c f i j s j the fractional contribution of variance in input parameter j to overall variance in the model output can then be written as 17 ln c f i j 2 s i j 2 j 1 n ln c f i j 2 s i j 2 the key input parameters contributing to variance in predicting disinfection kinetics of e coli and e faecalis are presented in fig 5 the most significant contribution to uncertainty in model predicted disinfection was provided by the k values for the reaction of so 4 with cl and br accounting for 52 and 29 of output variance other significant parameters include we concentrations of br and cl with contributions of about 10 and 7 respectively to the model output variance it should be noted that the reactions between secondary halogen free radicals e g br cl in eqns 11 and 12 in table 1 and bacteria were not considered during modelling calculation due to serious lack of their reactivity data this simplification may lead to underestimate inactivation processes 4 conclusions in this study we reported the kinetics and mechanisms of e coli and e faecalis inactivation with in different water matrices with experimental and modelling approaches we used k between so 4 and microorganisms to quantitatively reflect bacterial resistance which was a concept that will connect background water constituents with both target microorganisms and other macro micro pollutants within one comprehensive framework for simultaneous evaluation of their removal efficiencies during adps the k values between so 4 and e coli and e faecalis were measured to be 1 39 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 and 6 71 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 respectively the morphological images indicated that so 4 initiates a series of chain reactions on the wall membranes causing their irreversible damage ultimately affecting membrane permeability and physiological functions this work provided bigger picture and detailed perspective on disinfection kinetics and mechanisms which are expected to result in further advancement in scientific and technological research on so 4 based adps declaration of competing interest the authors
