20535,this research work focuses on the design of a robust control algorithm for 3d trajectory tracking of a 4dof unmanned underwater vehicle uuv the proposed strategy is based on a combination of the integral sliding mode control technique with the super twisting controller guaranteeing a continuous compensation of bounded disturbances and accomplishing a significant reduction on the chattering phenomenon in order to verify stability of the closed loop system lyapunov theory is used to guarantee the asymptotic stability in the tracking errors to demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed controller even in presence of disturbances a set of simulations and real time experiments were performed for the trajectory tracking the graphs show that the proposed controller guarantees the converges to the desired references and a high reduction in the chattering effect on the inputs control keywords uuv ismc stismc super twisting 1 introduction in recent years an increasing number of uuv s has been deployed in a wide range of applications including seabed exploration coastal structure inspection oceanographic monitoring of water quality geological sampling and deep water archaeology see griffiths 2002 chutia et al 2017 and sahoo et al 2019 then for an uuv to achieve successful performance during the mission it requires a guidance navigation and control gnc system stutters et al 2008 this represents an extensive field of study in many research groups where the control system plays an important role however there are different challenges due to the non linear dynamic behavior of the vehicle uncertainties in hydrodynamic coefficients coupled dynamics and unknown disturbances caused by waves and marine currents fossen 2002 in the literature the control problems for an uuv has received considerable attention due to its theoretical challenges he et al 2020 research groups around the world have proposed the design of controllers from classic approaches for example monroy et al 2017 presents the comparison of controllers pd pid and saturated pd to stabilize the attitude and depth of a miniature underwater vehicle on the other hand in suarez et al 2018 the authors propose the trajectory tracking of a depth profile using a pd controller and a second order filter which adds robustness to the closed loop system additionally non linear and adaptive controllers have been designed such as a self adaptive fuzzy pid controller based on a nonlinear mimo structure for an auv khodayari and balochian 2015 in karkoub et al 2017 a robust nonlinear hierarchical controller based on backstepping techniques and sliding mode is designed for tracking of the trajectory of an auv considering uncertainties and in wei et al 2015 a controller based on backstepping with a disturbance observer is proposed for trajectory tracking in depth currently the design of more complex controls with robust techniques even under external disturbances and uncertainties has been studied of notable interest are the robust controls based on sliding mode rangel et al 2020 yan et al 2019 to cite a case in kim et al 2015 the integral sliding mode control ismc is designed to obtain effective compensation against uncertainties on hydrodynamic parameters and disturbance rejection effects due to ocean waves and currents it is well known that ismc is a robust control technique that consists in partitioning the control variable in two parts where the first part ensures the compensation of the bounded disturbances for all time see utkin and shi 1996 and the second part called the ideal control allows the stabilization of the state variables once the uncertainties have been compensated however to design the compensative term an auxiliary sliding surface is designed as in shtessel et al 2014 page 30 where the first controller is a first order sliding mode control according to levant 1993 2003 implying that all the unknown bounded uncertainties being compensated from the beginning by the discontinuous variable producing an evident chattering effect that can produce mechanical and electrical wear in the underwater vehicle levant 2010 some authors have proposed algorithms based on sliding mode techniques to obtain robustness against bounded disturbances guaranteeing the reduction of the chattering effect because of its continuity as an example in cildoz et al 2015 a comparative study of three different sliding mode control strategies is presented a conventional sliding mode control an adaptive sliding mode control and sliding mode control based on input output stability all the proposed control strategies demonstrated good performance for position control of an auv autonomous underwater vehicle under the influence of disturbances nonetheless the adaptive sliding mode control strategy produces the best action tracking error and the sliding mode control based on input output stability was the most efficient in reducing the chattering effect on other hand in alibani et al 2018 two super twisting sliding mode control schemes for uncertain systems were applied to address a precise position and attitude tracking problem for an intervention autonomous underwater vehicle i auv the robustness of both methods for disturbances was demonstrated by simulations compared to the standard pid approach demonstrating the best performance with both super twisting methods compared to the double loop pid scheme other authors moreno and osorio 2012 chalanga et al 2016 propose the super twisting control to attenuate the chattering effect and ensure that the tracking error converges exponentially to zero while the sliding surface converges to zero in finite time the main contribution of the present paper is to develop a robust continuous control technique based on the integral sliding mode control with super twisting action for compensating bounded uncertainties from almost the first time instance and attenuate the chattering effect on the control variable then the mentioned technique will be named super twisting integral sliding mode control stismc hence to avoid the chattering phenomena the continuity of the super twisting control will be used to compensate the bounded uncertainties of continuous manner see moreno 2009 2010 moreno and osorio 2012 and with the ismc the robustness will be accomplished from almost the first time instance therefore the continuity and robustness of our controller will attenuate the chattering effect improving the stability and manoeuvrability of the underwater vehicle moreover a series of simulations were carried out to compare the response of the closed loop system using the ismc and the stismc likewise our strategy was implemented in an experimental platform to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control strategy in order to show the main advantages of the stismc with others that use the ismc with the super twisting algorithms a comparative study is performed with tria et al 2017 labbadi and cherkaoui 2019 and pan et al 2017 where it can be concluded that our control strategy has advantages such as a low computational cost a compensation of bounded disturbances from the first time instance with high attenuation of the chattering effect in addition our work presents simulations from which a root mean square error is obtained to prove the efficiency of our controller experimental results were also performed in tria et al 2017 and labbadi and cherkaoui 2019 a low attenuation of the chattering on the inputs control is presented and only simulation results are shown furthermore in pan et al 2017 a high attenuation in the chattering effect is presented with low computational cost and simulation results however real time experiments were not implemented the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes mathematical model of the uuv and section 3 presents the main contribution of this paper which is the design of controller as well as the stability analysis based on lyapunov theory next section 4 describes the underwater vehicle and section 5 presents a set of simulation test then section 6 exposes the results of experimental tests in real time based on the results the performance of the closed loop system is demonstrated finally section 7 provides conclusions 2 mathematical model the mathematical model of an uuv is analyzed in two coordinate frames a body fixed frame o b and an earth fixed frame o i see fig 1 in the literature several works proposed different approaches to obtain the mathematical model graver 2005 bailey 1997 fossen 1999 the representation proposed by fossen 1999 is adopted in this work to describe the non linear model of an uuv and using the notation for underwater vehicles described by the sname sname 1950 the matrix representation of the dynamic model is defined by the follow equations 1 m ν c ν ν d ν ν g η τ ω η j η ν where ν u v w p q r t is the state vector of velocity relative to the body fixed frame η x y z ϕ θ ψ t represents the vector of position and orientation relative to the earth fixed frame m r 6 6 is the inertial matrix c ν r 6 6 describes coriolis matrix d ν r 6 6 defines the hydrodynamic damping matrix g η r 6 is the vector of hydrostatic forces τ τ 1 τ 2 t x y z k m n t r 6 represents the vector of forces and moments in the body fixed frame ω r 6 denotes the disturbance vector and j η r 6 6 is the kinematic transformation between the body frame and the inertial frame 2 1 the bluerov2 mathematical model the uuv used for this work is the bluerov2 by blue robotics it is described in section 4 to simplify the mathematical model of the bluerov2 the assumptions listed below are considered assumption 1 bluerov2 operates at low speed that is less than 2 m s assumption 2 center of gravity c g is located at the origin of the body fixed system o b and the axes x b y b z b are parallel to main axes of inertial frame assumption 3 by design the experimental platform is mechanically stable in 2 dof ϕ θ 0 p q p q 0 due to careful selection of the buoyancy center c β assumption 4 bluerov2 is hydrodynamically symmetrical on two axes the underwater robot configuration allows it to move in 4 dof thus from now on they only consider the reduced state vectors ν u v w r t η x y z ψ t the translation and rotation movements of our robot on body fixed frame can be expressed as x m x u u m v y v v r x u x u u u u y m y v v m u x u u r y v y v v v v z m z w w z w z w w w w w β 2 n i z z n r r m v y v v u x u u m u v n r n r r r r where m is the mass of the vehicle i z z denotes the moment of inertia on z axis x u y v z w n r are the parameters of aggregate mass x u y v z w n r are the linear hydrodynamic coefficients and x u u y v v z w w n r r are the quadratic hydrodynamic coefficients w is the weight of the vehicle and β is the buoyancy force the objective is to validate the proposed controller in real time so it is more common to use sensors related to euler s angles and position measurement in the inertial frame accordingly to represent the dynamic model in the inertial frame the transformation matrix proposed in fossen 1999 is used to simplify the dynamic model of the bluerov2 the limitations of the vehicle are considered and the method used in manzanilla et al 2017 is taken into account the simplified dynamic model of the robot in the inertial frame is 3 x 1 i u u x cos ψ δ x 1 i υ u y sin ψ y 1 i υ u y cos ψ δ y 1 i u u x sin ψ z 1 i ω u z δ z f b ψ 1 i r u ψ δ ψ where f b w β is the force due to the gravitational and buoyancy force i u i υ i ω i r m x u m y v m z w i z z n r for easy reading rename x y z n as u x u y u z u ψ and each δ i for i x y z ψ are all parameters unknown by coriolis damping and model uncertainties due to the environment vehicle structure and low speed it will be assumed that they are bounded i e δ i l i then proposing the control inputs as u x i u υ x u y i υ υ y u z i ω υ z f b and u ψ i r υ ψ where υ i are virtual control inputs from eq 3 it is had to 4 x υ x cos ψ υ y sin ψ ξ x y υ y cos ψ υ x sin ψ ξ y z υ z ξ z ψ υ ψ ξ ψ where ξ i δ x i u ξ y δ y i υ ξ z δ z i w ξ ψ δ ψ i r and these variables are bounded i e ξ i l i in order to cancel the dependency of the yaw angle ψ each υ i for i x y z ψ is proposed as 5 υ x u x x d cos ψ u y y d sin ψ υ y u y y d cos ψ u x x d sin ψ υ z u z z d υ ψ u ψ ψ d where u i are control inputs to be defined later considering 5 in 4 follows 6 x u x ξ x x d y u y ξ y y d z u z ξ z z d ψ u ψ ξ ψ ψ d 3 control strategy defining the tracking error as e i i i d with dynamics i x y z ψ and desired references i d x d y d z d ψ d then the system 6 can be rewritten as 7 e i u i ξ i notice that the eqs 7 are uncoupled perturbed linear systems where the singularity problem does not appear in the dynamics e x 2 and e y 2 because of the continuity of cos ψ sin ψ given in 5 hence its controllability is not affected by the yaw angle ψ the control strategy is designed in order to achieve that for each i x y z ψ the four control variables u i compensate bounded uncertainties ξ i from the first time instance if these satisfy ξ i 0 0 and without producing the chattering effect that commonly is presented into the sliding mode control algorithms this fact will be possible if the super twisting control law is combined with the integral sliding mode algorithm with the idea to achieve e i 1 0 and e i 2 0 asymptotically the sliding surfaces s i will be proposed as 8 s i e i 2 c i e i 1 with c i 0 where e i 1 e i 2 t e i e i t and s i will be given by 9 s i u i ξ i c i e i 2 proposing u i as 10 u i c i e i 2 u 1 i u 2 i then s i is given by 11 s i u 1 i u 2 i ξ i i x y z ψ notice that the term c i e i 2 cancels the lineal part from 9 by another hand u 1 i and u 2 i will be explained later now proposing an auxiliary system as 12 σ i s i z i z i u 2 i considering the eqs 11 and 12 σ i is given by 13 σ i u 1 i ξ i where each u 1 i is proposed as 14 u 1 i k 1 i σ i 1 2 sign σ i k 2 i 0 t sign σ i d τ introducing 14 into 13 then 15 σ i k 1 i σ i 1 2 sign σ i k 2 i 0 t sign σ i d τ ξ i defining 16 h 1 i σ i h 2 i k 2 i 0 t sign σ i d τ ξ i thus 17 h 1 i k 1 i h 1 i 1 2 sign h 1 i h 2 i h 2 i k 2 i sign h 1 i ξ i theorem 1 suppose that the derivative of each ξ i is bounded i e ξ i ξ i r and the gains k 1 i and k 2 i are selected according to 18a k 1 i λ 1 i λ 2 i 2 2 ξ i 2 4 λ 1 i λ 2 i 18b k 2 i 1 2 λ 2 i k 1 i where λ 1 i 0 and λ 2 i are any real number different of zero then the super twisting control law 14 provides the continuity of σ i and σ i yields σ i σ i 0 in finite time proof define 1 1 some ideas from ibarra and castillo 2017 moreno and osorio 2012 and shtessel et al 2012 are taken for this stability analysis 19 ν ν 1 i ν 2 i t h 1 i 1 2 sign h 1 i h 2 i t from 19 it is had ν 1 i h 1 i 1 2 and sign h 1 i ν 1 i ν 1 i with 17 the derivative of each component of ν is represented as 20 ν 1 i 1 2 ν 1 i k 1 i ν 1 i ν 2 i ν 2 i 1 2 ν 1 i 2 k 2 i ν 1 i ξ i and proposing 21 ξ i t χ i t sign h 1 i χ i t ν 1 i ν 1 i where χ i t is a bounded function such that 22 0 χ i t ξ i rewriting 20 in matrix form it follows that 23 ν 1 i ν 2 i 1 2 ν 1 i k 1 i 1 2 k 2 i 2 χ i 0 a ν ν 1 i ν 2 i therefore ν a ν ν remark 1 notice in 19 that if ν 1 i ν 2 i 0 in some finite time t r i then h 1 i h 2 i 0 also in finite time t r i and according to 16 it will be had σ i t t r i 0 and the uncertainties ξ i will be compensated for all t t r i propose the following candidate lyapunov function 24 v ν ν t p i ν where p i is proposed as 25 p i λ 1 i λ 2 i 2 λ 2 i λ 2 i 1 and p i is positive definite if λ 1 i 0 and if λ 2 i is any real number therefore the derivative of 24 is 26 v ν ν t p i a ν a t ν p i ν 1 2 ν 1 i ν t β i ν where β i β i t and given by 27 β i χ i 2 λ 1 i k 1 i 2 λ 2 i λ 2 i k 1 i 2 k 2 i 4 λ 2 i χ i 2 k 2 i λ 2 i k 1 i λ 1 i λ 2 i 2 2 χ i 2 λ 2 i with 2 k 2 i λ 2 i k 1 i λ 1 i λ 2 i 2 2 χ i using the bound of χ i t it follows that 28 v ν 1 2 ν 1 i ν t q i ν where q i β i ξ i and selecting the gains 18a and 18b it is had that 29 q i λ 1 i λ 2 i 2 2 ξ i 2 2 λ 2 i 4 λ 2 i ξ i λ 1 i λ 2 i 2 2 ξ i λ 1 i λ 2 i 2 2 ξ i 2 λ 2 i where det q i 8 λ 2 i 2 ξ i with λ 2 i as any real number different of zero then det q i 0 implying that q i is positive definite guaranteeing that 1 2 ν 1 i ν t q i ν 0 as consequence ν 0 asymptotically however if v ν satisfies also the modified condition v ν γ i v 1 2 ν 0 γ i 0 the convergence will occur in finite time t r i see shtessel et al 2014 page 4 to prove the finite time convergence consider the following inequalities 30a λ m i n p i ν 2 v ν λ m a x p i ν 2 30b λ m a x q i ν 2 ν t q i ν λ m i n q i ν 2 and 31 ν 1 i ν v 1 2 ν λ m i n 1 2 p i using 30a and 30b then 28 becomes 32 v ν 1 2 ν 1 i ν t q i ν 1 2 ν 1 i λ m i n q i ν 2 λ m i n q i 2 ν 1 i v ν λ m a x p i from 31 it is deduced 33 v ν γ i v 1 2 ν with γ i λ m i n 1 2 p i λ m i n q i 2 λ m a x p i indeed separating variables and integrating inequality 33 over the interval time 0 τ t yields 34 2 v 1 2 ν t 2 v 1 2 ν 0 γ i t considering in 34 that v ν t reaches the zero in finite time t r i then t r i is bounded by 35 t r i 2 v 1 2 ν 0 γ i where 35 guarantees that ν ν 1 i ν 2 i t 0 0 t in finite time t r i therefore the mentioned in remark 1 is satisfied now developing and simplifying the lyapunov function 24 v ν λ 1 i λ 1 i 2 ν 1 i 2 2 λ 2 i ν 1 i ν 2 i ν 2 i 2 and proposing σ i 0 0 v 1 2 ν 0 ξ i 0 hence t r i in 35 is bounded by 36 t r i 2 ξ i 0 γ i therefore from 12 it follows that s i t z i t for all t t r i consequently system 12 can be rewritten as 37 s i z i z i u 2 i for all t t r i and with z i 0 s i 0 from the above it yields that 38 s i u 2 i for all t t r i note that s i is not perturbed already now proposing 39 u 2 i k 3 i s i k 3 i 0 then s i is given as 40 s i k 3 i s i to solve 40 it is integrated over the time interval t r i τ t obtaining 41 s i t exp k 3 i t t r i s i t r i then s i t 0 asymptotically for all t t r i and the errors will be given by 42 e i 1 t exp c i t t r i e i 1 t r i e i 2 t c i exp c i t t r i e i 1 t r i then e i 1 t 0 and e i 2 t 0 when t starting from t t r i therefore the main results about u i 1 and u i 2 are described as follows 1 the super twisting control law u i 1 provides the continuity of σ i and σ i yields σ i σ i 0 for all t t r i and compensates ξ i for all t t r i 2 once the uncertainties ξ i have been compensated the linear control u i 2 achieves that s i t 0 asymptotically for all t t r i and e i 1 t 0 and e i 2 t 0 when t starting from t t r i remark 2 notice that if the bounded uncertainties ξ i satisfy ξ i 0 0 then 36 guarantees t r i 0 and the super twisting control law 14 accomplishes that σ i converges to zero in finite time at most after t r i 0 units of time in addition each ξ i will be compensated for all t t r i 0 by another hand the linear control 39 will imply that s i t 0 asymptotically for all t 0 in consequence e i 1 t 0 and e i 2 t 0 when t starting from t 0 lemma 2 if ξ i 0 0 and e i 1 0 0 e i 2 0 0 then s i t 0 for all t 0 and also e i 1 t 0 and e i 2 t 0 for all t 0 proof as was mentioned in remark 2 with ξ i 0 0 the convergence time is given by t r i 0 and substituting in 41 it is obtained s i t exp k 3 i t s i 0 and by eq 8 s i 0 e i 2 0 c i e i 1 0 now considering assumption e i 1 0 0 e i 2 0 0 it follows that s i 0 0 implying that s i t 0 for all t 0 which corresponds to the equilibrium solution from 40 then in 8 e i 2 c i e i 1 0 for all t 0 hence e i 2 c i e i 1 for all t 0 whose solution is given by 43 e i 1 t exp c i t e i 1 0 e i 2 t exp c i t e i 2 0 again considering the assumption e i 1 0 0 e i 2 0 0 then e i 1 t 0 and e i 2 t 0 for all t 0 the above means that if the initial conditions of position and velocity of the vehicle match with the initial conditions of the desired trajectory the trajectory tracking will occur from the beginning it is i i d for all time 4 experimental platform the bluerov2 is an underwater vehicle used in this work see fig 2 this is an open structure modular vehicle with a dimension of 45 71 cm 33 81 cm 22 1 cm a weight of 11 5 kg and a maximum operating depth of 100 m this underwater robot has 6 thrusters with clockwise and counterclockwise propellers minimizing torque reactions that allow it to perform decoupled movements in 4 dof its structure is made of high density polyethylene and is complemented by two acrylic tubes that store the electronic components and the lipo battery the known physical parameters of the bluerov2 are defined in table 1 for more details see wu 2018 the bluerov2 incorporates a pixhawk autopilot that acquires data from sensors as well as an integrated raspberry pi computer that acquires information from the camera and functions as a communication interface with the ground station using the fathom x modem at a speed of 80 mb s by tether the ground station is a lenovo thinkpad netbook with linux xenial and robotic operating system ros it s main function is to perform the data processing and all the necessary calculations in the control algorithm to send the value of the pulse width modulation pwm to electronic speed controllers see fig 3 5 numerical validation the controller design proposed in section 3 is validated with a set of tests to trajectory tracking with an uuv notice that the applied controllers υ i are the defined in 5 according to the control methodology each control variable u i is given by 44 u i c i e i 2 k 1 i σ i 1 2 sign σ i k 2 i 0 t sign σ i d τ k 3 i s i with z i k 3 i 0 t s i d τ where i x y z ψ and initial conditions s i 0 z i 0 0 to introduce the bounded disturbances ξ i these are proposed as 45 ξ i a i sign σ i sin b i t i i ξ i a i i i with ξ i 0 0 and its derivative is given as 46 ξ i a i b i sign σ i cos b i t i i ξ i a i b i i i ξ i the first scenario is to compare the efficiency of stismc with an integral sliding mode control ismc proposed by shtessel et al 2014 the reference trajectory in this test introduce 3 actions autonomously diving to a desired depth moving forward and emerging each one will be able to adjust the speed of the dynamics depending on the task to be performed the desired trajectory introduces movement dynamics at three specific time intervals given by 0 t 1 t 1 t 2 and t 2 t f respectively the following equations describe the generation of the desired trajectory ω 1 d x d y d z d ψ d represents each desired dynamic and ω 2 d defines each reference velocity where the velocity and acceleration can be expressed as 47 ω 1 d ω 2 d ω 2 d u ω 1 g 1 t u ω 2 f 1 t g 2 t u ω 3 f 2 t where the functions u ω i and f j t with i 1 2 3 and j 1 2 are defined as 48 u ω i k p ω i ω 1 d ω e q i k d ω i ω 2 d 49 f j t 0 for 0 t t j 1 for t j t t f with g j t 1 f j t 0 t 1 t 2 t f n k p ω i k d ω i 0 and ω e q i are constant references table 2 shows the values of the parameters used during the tests for the numerical validation λ 1 i λ 2 i are chosen to take into account the conditions proposed in theorem 1 and for ensuring s i 0 for all time each k 3 i was proposed equal to 1 the initial conditions of uuv are η 0 0 0 0 5 the parameters to generate the desired position at each point are k p ω x 0 45 k d ω x 1 85 k p ω y 0 5 k d ω y 0 5 k p ω z 0 34 k d ω z 1 75 on the other hand the proposed times are t 1 25 t 2 50 t f 75 and the points are p 1 0 0 2 p 2 5 0 2 p 3 5 0 0 the results of the trajectory tracking can be seen in fig 4 notice that both control strategies reached the reference trajectory nevertheless the tracking error is smaller with stismc even when the dynamics of the vehicle is affected by limited disturbances see table 3 in fig 5 when the stismc approach is applied notice that σ i and s i remain equal to zero for all time and due to that σ i σ i 0 is continuous this implies that k 1 i σ i 1 2 sign σ i k 2 i 0 t sign σ i given in eq 15 compensates continually each bounded disturbance ξ i from t 0 and s i t 0 0 implies that each error e i t 0 0 this is a clear indication of the good tracking of the desired dynamics in addition the chattering effect on the control inputs is not appreciated due to the continuity of the stismc in spite of having proposed ξ i with chattering effect produced when sign σ i t 0 0 on the other hand in fig 6 when the ismc is applied σ i and s i present high oscillations when they converge to a region close to zero moreover with the ismc there is an evident chattering effect on the control inputs due to the discontinuity on the feedback controllers 6 real time validation in this section the control strategy 44 developed in this work is implemented at the ground station using a ros nodes to manipulate bluerov2 movements main ros nodes used in the implementation are bluerov2 node provides information from the embedded sensors in the vehicle waterlinked gps estimates the pose of the vehicle w r t acoustic localization control node implements a stismc controller finally the rqt reconfigure and rqt plot nodes are used respectively for on line parameter tuning and real time visualization the parameters of the controller for this tests are λ 1 z 1 5 λ 2 z 2 λ 1 ψ 2 2 λ 2 ψ 3 and the gains k 3 i was proposed as k 3 z 4 k 3 ψ 2 experimental tests are performed in a circular pool with a diameter of 4 m and 0 8 m depth two test scenarios are proposed the first scenario stabilizes the orientation of the bluerov2 at different yaw angle values the results can be seen in fig 7 notice that the desired angle is reached in short time and the error remains very close to zero in addition the rmse given by table 4 shows the tracking error is very small on the other hand in fig 8 the sliding surface converges to a region very close to zero and the control input presents attenuation in the chattering effect for the second scenario the vehicle will track a sinusoidal trajectory in depth fig 9 and table 4 show that the tracking error is very small the reference is reached and the error converges to a region of 2 cm on the other hand in fig 10 the evolution of the sliding surface and the response of the control input are displayed note that sliding surface from the beginning converges to a value close to zero the control input presents attenuation in the chattering effect and energy supply by the thrusters is very small 7 conclusions this article describes a super twisting integral sliding mode control to solve the problem of trajectory tracking of an uuv in order to know the advantages of the proposed controller several simulations were carried out where our technique was compared to an ismc the results obtained demonstrate the behavior of the closed loop system and the effectiveness of the proposed controller strategy furthermore in the experimental results the stismc reduces the chattering phenomenon in the control signal and the tracking error converges asymptotically to zero declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
20535,this research work focuses on the design of a robust control algorithm for 3d trajectory tracking of a 4dof unmanned underwater vehicle uuv the proposed strategy is based on a combination of the integral sliding mode control technique with the super twisting controller guaranteeing a continuous compensation of bounded disturbances and accomplishing a significant reduction on the chattering phenomenon in order to verify stability of the closed loop system lyapunov theory is used to guarantee the asymptotic stability in the tracking errors to demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed controller even in presence of disturbances a set of simulations and real time experiments were performed for the trajectory tracking the graphs show that the proposed controller guarantees the converges to the desired references and a high reduction in the chattering effect on the inputs control keywords uuv ismc stismc super twisting 1 introduction in recent years an increasing number of uuv s has been deployed in a wide range of applications including seabed exploration coastal structure inspection oceanographic monitoring of water quality geological sampling and deep water archaeology see griffiths 2002 chutia et al 2017 and sahoo et al 2019 then for an uuv to achieve successful performance during the mission it requires a guidance navigation and control gnc system stutters et al 2008 this represents an extensive field of study in many research groups where the control system plays an important role however there are different challenges due to the non linear dynamic behavior of the vehicle uncertainties in hydrodynamic coefficients coupled dynamics and unknown disturbances caused by waves and marine currents fossen 2002 in the literature the control problems for an uuv has received considerable attention due to its theoretical challenges he et al 2020 research groups around the world have proposed the design of controllers from classic approaches for example monroy et al 2017 presents the comparison of controllers pd pid and saturated pd to stabilize the attitude and depth of a miniature underwater vehicle on the other hand in suarez et al 2018 the authors propose the trajectory tracking of a depth profile using a pd controller and a second order filter which adds robustness to the closed loop system additionally non linear and adaptive controllers have been designed such as a self adaptive fuzzy pid controller based on a nonlinear mimo structure for an auv khodayari and balochian 2015 in karkoub et al 2017 a robust nonlinear hierarchical controller based on backstepping techniques and sliding mode is designed for tracking of the trajectory of an auv considering uncertainties and in wei et al 2015 a controller based on backstepping with a disturbance observer is proposed for trajectory tracking in depth currently the design of more complex controls with robust techniques even under external disturbances and uncertainties has been studied of notable interest are the robust controls based on sliding mode rangel et al 2020 yan et al 2019 to cite a case in kim et al 2015 the integral sliding mode control ismc is designed to obtain effective compensation against uncertainties on hydrodynamic parameters and disturbance rejection effects due to ocean waves and currents it is well known that ismc is a robust control technique that consists in partitioning the control variable in two parts where the first part ensures the compensation of the bounded disturbances for all time see utkin and shi 1996 and the second part called the ideal control allows the stabilization of the state variables once the uncertainties have been compensated however to design the compensative term an auxiliary sliding surface is designed as in shtessel et al 2014 page 30 where the first controller is a first order sliding mode control according to levant 1993 2003 implying that all the unknown bounded uncertainties being compensated from the beginning by the discontinuous variable producing an evident chattering effect that can produce mechanical and electrical wear in the underwater vehicle levant 2010 some authors have proposed algorithms based on sliding mode techniques to obtain robustness against bounded disturbances guaranteeing the reduction of the chattering effect because of its continuity as an example in cildoz et al 2015 a comparative study of three different sliding mode control strategies is presented a conventional sliding mode control an adaptive sliding mode control and sliding mode control based on input output stability all the proposed control strategies demonstrated good performance for position control of an auv autonomous underwater vehicle under the influence of disturbances nonetheless the adaptive sliding mode control strategy produces the best action tracking error and the sliding mode control based on input output stability was the most efficient in reducing the chattering effect on other hand in alibani et al 2018 two super twisting sliding mode control schemes for uncertain systems were applied to address a precise position and attitude tracking problem for an intervention autonomous underwater vehicle i auv the robustness of both methods for disturbances was demonstrated by simulations compared to the standard pid approach demonstrating the best performance with both super twisting methods compared to the double loop pid scheme other authors moreno and osorio 2012 chalanga et al 2016 propose the super twisting control to attenuate the chattering effect and ensure that the tracking error converges exponentially to zero while the sliding surface converges to zero in finite time the main contribution of the present paper is to develop a robust continuous control technique based on the integral sliding mode control with super twisting action for compensating bounded uncertainties from almost the first time instance and attenuate the chattering effect on the control variable then the mentioned technique will be named super twisting integral sliding mode control stismc hence to avoid the chattering phenomena the continuity of the super twisting control will be used to compensate the bounded uncertainties of continuous manner see moreno 2009 2010 moreno and osorio 2012 and with the ismc the robustness will be accomplished from almost the first time instance therefore the continuity and robustness of our controller will attenuate the chattering effect improving the stability and manoeuvrability of the underwater vehicle moreover a series of simulations were carried out to compare the response of the closed loop system using the ismc and the stismc likewise our strategy was implemented in an experimental platform to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control strategy in order to show the main advantages of the stismc with others that use the ismc with the super twisting algorithms a comparative study is performed with tria et al 2017 labbadi and cherkaoui 2019 and pan et al 2017 where it can be concluded that our control strategy has advantages such as a low computational cost a compensation of bounded disturbances from the first time instance with high attenuation of the chattering effect in addition our work presents simulations from which a root mean square error is obtained to prove the efficiency of our controller experimental results were also performed in tria et al 2017 and labbadi and cherkaoui 2019 a low attenuation of the chattering on the inputs control is presented and only simulation results are shown furthermore in pan et al 2017 a high attenuation in the chattering effect is presented with low computational cost and simulation results however real time experiments were not implemented the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes mathematical model of the uuv and section 3 presents the main contribution of this paper which is the design of controller as well as the stability analysis based on lyapunov theory next section 4 describes the underwater vehicle and section 5 presents a set of simulation test then section 6 exposes the results of experimental tests in real time based on the results the performance of the closed loop system is demonstrated finally section 7 provides conclusions 2 mathematical model the mathematical model of an uuv is analyzed in two coordinate frames a body fixed frame o b and an earth fixed frame o i see fig 1 in the literature several works proposed different approaches to obtain the mathematical model graver 2005 bailey 1997 fossen 1999 the representation proposed by fossen 1999 is adopted in this work to describe the non linear model of an uuv and using the notation for underwater vehicles described by the sname sname 1950 the matrix representation of the dynamic model is defined by the follow equations 1 m ν c ν ν d ν ν g η τ ω η j η ν where ν u v w p q r t is the state vector of velocity relative to the body fixed frame η x y z ϕ θ ψ t represents the vector of position and orientation relative to the earth fixed frame m r 6 6 is the inertial matrix c ν r 6 6 describes coriolis matrix d ν r 6 6 defines the hydrodynamic damping matrix g η r 6 is the vector of hydrostatic forces τ τ 1 τ 2 t x y z k m n t r 6 represents the vector of forces and moments in the body fixed frame ω r 6 denotes the disturbance vector and j η r 6 6 is the kinematic transformation between the body frame and the inertial frame 2 1 the bluerov2 mathematical model the uuv used for this work is the bluerov2 by blue robotics it is described in section 4 to simplify the mathematical model of the bluerov2 the assumptions listed below are considered assumption 1 bluerov2 operates at low speed that is less than 2 m s assumption 2 center of gravity c g is located at the origin of the body fixed system o b and the axes x b y b z b are parallel to main axes of inertial frame assumption 3 by design the experimental platform is mechanically stable in 2 dof ϕ θ 0 p q p q 0 due to careful selection of the buoyancy center c β assumption 4 bluerov2 is hydrodynamically symmetrical on two axes the underwater robot configuration allows it to move in 4 dof thus from now on they only consider the reduced state vectors ν u v w r t η x y z ψ t the translation and rotation movements of our robot on body fixed frame can be expressed as x m x u u m v y v v r x u x u u u u y m y v v m u x u u r y v y v v v v z m z w w z w z w w w w w β 2 n i z z n r r m v y v v u x u u m u v n r n r r r r where m is the mass of the vehicle i z z denotes the moment of inertia on z axis x u y v z w n r are the parameters of aggregate mass x u y v z w n r are the linear hydrodynamic coefficients and x u u y v v z w w n r r are the quadratic hydrodynamic coefficients w is the weight of the vehicle and β is the buoyancy force the objective is to validate the proposed controller in real time so it is more common to use sensors related to euler s angles and position measurement in the inertial frame accordingly to represent the dynamic model in the inertial frame the transformation matrix proposed in fossen 1999 is used to simplify the dynamic model of the bluerov2 the limitations of the vehicle are considered and the method used in manzanilla et al 2017 is taken into account the simplified dynamic model of the robot in the inertial frame is 3 x 1 i u u x cos ψ δ x 1 i υ u y sin ψ y 1 i υ u y cos ψ δ y 1 i u u x sin ψ z 1 i ω u z δ z f b ψ 1 i r u ψ δ

all parameters unknown by coriolis damping and model uncertainties due to the environment vehicle structure and low speed it will be assumed that they are bounded i e δ i l i then proposing the control inputs as u x i u υ x u y i υ υ y u z i ω υ z f b and u ψ i r υ ψ where υ i are virtual control inputs from eq 3 it is had to 4 x υ x cos ψ υ y sin ψ ξ x y υ y cos ψ υ x sin ψ ξ y z υ z ξ z ψ υ ψ ξ ψ where ξ i δ x i u ξ y δ y i υ ξ z δ z i w ξ ψ δ ψ i r and these variables are bounded i e ξ i l i in order to cancel the dependency of the yaw angle ψ each υ i for i x y z ψ is proposed as 5 υ

z z d ψ u ψ ξ ψ ψ d 3 control strategy defining the tracking error as e i i i d with dynamics i x y z ψ and desired references i d x d y d z d ψ d then the system 6 can be rewritten as 7 e i u i ξ i notice that the eqs 7 are uncoupled perturbed linear systems where the singularity problem does not appear in the dynamics e x 2 and e y 2 because of the continuity of cos ψ sin ψ given in 5 hence its controllability is not affected by the yaw angle ψ the control strategy is designed in order to achieve that for each i x y z ψ the four control variables u i compensate bounded uncertainties ξ i from the first time instance if these satisfy ξ i 0 0 and without producing the chattering effect that commonly is presented into the sliding mode control algorithms this fact will be possible if the super twisting control law is combined with the integral sliding mode algorithm with the idea to achieve e i 1 0 and e i 2 0 asymptotically the sliding surfaces s i will be proposed as 8 s i e i 2 c i e i 1 with c i 0 where e i 1 e i 2 t e i e i t and s i will be given by 9 s i u i ξ i c i e i 2 proposing u i as 10 u i c i e i 2 u 1 i u 2 i then s i is given by 11 s i u 1 i u 2 i ξ i i x y z ψ notice that the term c i e i 2 cancels the lineal part from 9 by another hand u 1 i and u 2 i will be explained later now proposing an auxiliary system as 12 σ i s i z i z i u 2 i considering the eqs 11 and 12 σ i is given by 13 σ i u 1 i ξ i where each u 1 i is proposed as 14 u 1 i k 1 i σ i 1 2 sign σ i k 2 i 0 t sign σ i d τ introducing 14 into 13 then 15 σ i k 1 i σ i 1 2 sign σ i k 2 i 0 t sign σ i

zero then the super twisting control law 14 provides the continuity of σ i and σ i yields σ i σ i 0 in finite time proof define 1 1 some ideas from ibarra and castillo 2017 moreno and osorio 2012 and

that 22 0 χ i t ξ i rewriting 20 in matrix form it follows that 23 ν 1 i ν 2 i 1 2 ν 1 i k 1 i 1 2 k 2 i 2 χ i 0 a ν ν 1 i ν 2 i therefore ν a ν ν remark 1 notice in 19 that if ν 1 i ν 2 i 0 in some finite time t r i then h 1 i h 2 i 0 also in finite time t r i and according to 16 it will be had σ i t t r i 0 and the uncertainties ξ i will be compensated for all t t r i propose the following candidate lyapunov function 24 v ν ν t p i ν where p i is proposed as 25 p i λ 1 i λ 2 i 2 λ 2 i λ 2 i 1 and p i is positive definite if λ 1 i 0 and if λ 2 i is any real number therefore the

χ i 2 λ 2 i with 2 k 2 i λ 2 i k 1 i λ 1 i λ 2 i 2 2 χ i using the bound of χ i t it follows that 28 v ν 1 2 ν 1 i ν t q i ν where q i β i ξ i and selecting the gains 18a and 18b it is had that 29 q i λ 1 i λ 2 i 2 2 ξ i 2 2 λ 2 i 4 λ 2 i ξ i λ 1 i λ 2 i 2 2 ξ i λ 1 i λ 2 i 2 2 ξ i 2 λ 2 i where det q i 8 λ 2 i 2 ξ i with λ 2 i as any real number different of zero then det q i 0 implying that q i is positive definite guaranteeing that 1 2 ν 1 i ν t q i ν 0 as consequence ν 0 asymptotically however if v ν satisfies also the modified condition v ν γ i v 1 2 ν 0 γ i 0 the convergence will occur in finite time t r i see shtessel et al 2014 page 4 to prove the finite time convergence consider the following inequalities 30a λ m i n p i ν 2 v ν λ m a x p i ν 2 30b λ m a x q i ν 2 ν t q i ν λ m i

considering in 34 that v ν t reaches the zero in finite time t r i then t r i is bounded by 35 t r i 2 v 1 2 ν 0 γ i where 35 guarantees that ν ν 1 i ν 2 i t 0 0 t in finite time t r i therefore the mentioned in remark 1 is satisfied now developing and simplifying the lyapunov function 24 v ν λ 1 i λ 1 i 2 ν 1 i 2 2 λ 2 i ν 1 i ν 2 i ν 2 i 2 and proposing σ i 0 0 v 1 2 ν 0 ξ i 0 hence t r i in 35 is bounded by 36 t r i 2 ξ i 0 γ i therefore from 12 it follows that s i t z i t for all t t r i consequently system 12 can be rewritten as 37 s i z i z i u 2 i for all t t r i and with z i 0 s i 0 from the above it yields that 38 s i u 2 i for all t t r i note that s i is not perturbed already now proposing 39 u 2 i k 3 i s i k 3 i 0 then s i is given as 40 s i k 3 i s i to solve 40 it is integrated over the time interval t r i τ t obtaining 41 s i t exp k 3 i t t r i s i t r i then s i t 0 asymptotically for all t t r i and the errors will be given by 42 e i 1 t exp c i t t r i e i 1 t r i e i 2 t c i exp c i t t r i e i 1 t r i then e i 1 t 0 and e i 2 t 0 when t starting from t t r i therefore the main results about u i 1 and u i 2 are described as follows 1 the super twisting control law u i 1 provides the continuity of σ i and σ i yields σ i σ i 0 for all t t r i and compensates ξ i for all t t r i 2 once the uncertainties ξ i have been compensated the linear control u i 2 achieves that s i t 0 asymptotically for all t t r i and e i 1 t 0 and e i 2 t 0 when t starting from t t r i remark 2 notice that if the bounded uncertainties ξ i satisfy ξ i 0 0 then 36 guarantees t r i 0 and the super twisting control law 14 accomplishes that σ i converges to zero in finite time at most after t r i 0 units of time in addition each ξ i will be compensated for all t t r i 0 by another hand the linear control 39 will imply that s i t 0 asymptotically for all t 0 in consequence e i 1 t 0 and e i 2 t 0 when t starting from t 0 lemma 2 if ξ i 0 0 and e i 1 0 0 e i 2 0 0 then s i t 0 for all t 0 and also e i 1 t 0 and e i 2 t 0 for all t 0 proof as was mentioned in remark 2 with ξ i 0 0 the convergence time is given by t r i 0 and substituting in 41 it is obtained s i t exp k 3 i t s i 0 and by eq 8 s i 0 e i 2 0 c i e i 1 0 now considering assumption e i 1 0 0 e i 2 0 0 it follows that s i 0 0 implying that s i t 0 for all t 0 which corresponds to the equilibrium solution from 40 then in 8 e i 2 c i e i 1 0 for all t 0 hence e i 2 c i e i 1 for all t 0 whose solution is given by 43 e i 1 t exp c i t e i 1 0 e i 2 t exp c i t e i 2 0 again considering the assumption e i 1 0 0 e i 2 0 0 then e i 1 t 0 and e i 2 t 0 for all t 0 the above means that if the initial conditions of position and velocity of the vehicle match with the initial conditions of the desired trajectory the trajectory tracking will occur from the beginning it is i i d for all time 4 experimental platform the bluerov2 is an underwater vehicle used in this work see fig 2 this is an open structure modular vehicle with a dimension of 45 71 cm 33 81 cm 22 1 cm a weight of 11 5 kg and a maximum operating depth of 100 m this underwater robot has 6 thrusters with clockwise and counterclockwise propellers minimizing torque reactions that allow it to perform decoupled movements in 4 dof its structure is made of high density polyethylene and is complemented by two acrylic tubes that store the electronic components and the lipo battery the known physical parameters of the bluerov2 are defined in table 1 for more details see wu 2018 the bluerov2 incorporates a pixhawk autopilot that acquires data from sensors as well as an integrated raspberry pi computer that acquires information from the camera and functions as a communication interface with the ground station using the fathom x modem at a speed of 80 mb s by tether the ground station is a lenovo thinkpad netbook with linux xenial and robotic operating system ros it s main function is to perform the data processing and all the necessary calculations in the control algorithm to send the value of the pulse width modulation pwm to electronic speed controllers see fig 3 5 numerical validation the controller design proposed in section 3 is validated with a set of tests to trajectory tracking with an uuv notice that the applied controllers υ i are the defined in 5 according to the control methodology each control variable u i is given by 44 u i c i e i 2 k 1 i σ i 1 2 sign σ i k 2 i 0 t sign σ i d τ k 3 i s i with z i k 3 i 0 t s i d τ where i x y z ψ and initial conditions s i 0 z i 0 0 to introduce the bounded disturbances ξ i these are proposed as 45 ξ i a i sign σ i sin b i t i i ξ i a i i i with ξ i 0 0 and its derivative is given as 46 ξ i a i b i sign σ i cos b i t i i ξ i a i b i i i ξ i the first scenario is to compare the efficiency of stismc with an integral sliding mode control ismc proposed by shtessel et al 2014 the reference trajectory in this test introduce 3 actions autonomously diving to a desired depth moving forward and emerging each one will be able to adjust the speed of the dynamics depending on the task to be performed the desired trajectory introduces movement dynamics at three specific time intervals given by 0 t 1 t 1 t 2 and t 2 t f respectively the following equations describe the generation of the desired trajectory ω 1 d x d y d z d ψ d represents each desired dynamic and ω 2 d defines each reference velocity where the velocity and acceleration can be expressed as 47 ω 1 d ω 2 d ω 2 d u ω 1 g 1 t u ω 2 f 1 t g 2 t u ω 3 f 2 t where the functions u ω i and f j t with i 1 2 3 and j 1 2 are defined as 48 u ω i k p ω i ω 1 d ω e q i k d ω i ω 2 d 49 f j t 0 for 0 t t j 1 for t j t t f with g j t 1 f j t 0 t 1 t 2 t f n k p ω i k d ω i 0 and ω e q i are constant references table 2 shows the values of the parameters used during the tests for the numerical validation λ 1 i λ 2 i are chosen to take into account the conditions proposed in theorem 1 and for ensuring s i 0 for all time each k 3 i was proposed equal to 1 the initial conditions of uuv are η 0 0 0 0 5 the parameters to generate the desired position at each point are k p ω x 0 45 k d ω x 1 85 k p ω y 0 5 k d ω y 0 5 k p ω z 0 34 k d ω z 1 75 on the other hand the proposed times are t 1 25 t 2 50 t f 75 and the points are p 1 0 0 2 p 2 5 0 2 p 3 5 0 0 the results of the trajectory tracking can be seen in fig 4 notice that both control strategies reached the reference trajectory nevertheless the tracking error is smaller with stismc even when the dynamics of the vehicle is affected by limited disturbances see table 3 in fig 5 when the stismc approach is applied notice that σ i and s i remain equal to zero for all time and due to that σ i σ i 0 is continuous this implies that k 1 i σ i 1 2 sign σ i k 2 i 0 t sign σ i given in eq 15 compensates continually each bounded disturbance ξ i from t 0 and s i t 0 0 implies that each error e i t 0 0 this is a clear indication of the good tracking of the desired dynamics in addition the chattering effect on the control inputs is not appreciated due to the continuity of the stismc in spite of having proposed ξ i with chattering effect produced when sign σ i t 0 0 on the other hand in fig 6 when the ismc is applied σ i and s i present high oscillations when they converge to a region close to zero moreover with the ismc there is an evident chattering effect on the control inputs due to the discontinuity on the feedback controllers 6 real time validation in this section the control strategy 44 developed in this work is implemented at the ground station using a ros nodes to manipulate bluerov2 movements main ros nodes used in the implementation are bluerov2 node provides information from the embedded sensors in the vehicle waterlinked gps estimates the pose of the vehicle w r t acoustic localization control node implements a stismc controller finally the rqt reconfigure and rqt plot nodes are used respectively for on line parameter tuning and real time visualization the parameters of the controller for this tests are λ 1 z 1 5 λ 2 z 2 λ 1 ψ 2 2 λ 2 ψ 3 and the gains k 3 i was proposed as k 3 z 4 k 3 ψ 2 experimental tests are performed in a circular pool with a diameter of 4 m and 0 8 m depth two test scenarios are proposed the first scenario stabilizes the orientation of the bluerov2 at different yaw angle values the results can be seen in fig 7 notice that the desired angle is reached in short time and the error remains very close to zero in addition the rmse given by table 4 shows the tracking error is very small on the other hand in fig 8 the sliding surface converges to a region very close to zero and the control input presents attenuation in the chattering effect for the second scenario the vehicle will track a sinusoidal trajectory in depth fig 9 and table 4 show that the tracking error is very small the reference is reached and the error converges to a region of 2 cm on the other hand in fig 10 the evolution of the sliding surface and the response of the control input are displayed note that sliding surface from the beginning converges to a value close to zero the control input presents attenuation in the chattering effect and energy supply by the thrusters is very small 7 conclusions this article describes a super twisting integral sliding mode control to solve the problem of trajectory tracking of an uuv in order to know the advantages of the proposed controller several simulations were carried out where our technique was compared to an ismc the results obtained demonstrate the behavior of the closed loop system and the effectiveness of the proposed controller strategy furthermore in the experimental results the stismc reduces the chattering phenomenon in the control signal and the tracking error converges asymptotically to zero declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
20536,a wake oscillator model to predict vortex induced vibrations viv of a rigid cylinder elastically mounted with two degrees of freedom 2 dof placed near a plane boundary is proposed the model is composed by three equations two for the structural oscillators in the x and y directions and one for the wake oscillator three new empirical coefficients are coupled to the wake oscillator equation to account for the effects of the plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder also a new empirical term is included on the wake oscillator equation the mass ratio of the cylinder is fixed and equal to 5 5 gap ratios defined as the ratio between the distance of the cylinder to the plane boundary e and the diameter of the cylinder d varying from zero to five are simulated and compared with experimental data for the cross flow reduced amplitude and frequency and the mean drag coefficient the empirical coefficients are calibrated to fit experimental data and using polynomial regression the equations to calculate each empirical coefficient are generated as new information the mean drag coefficient for the cases of e d 0 5 is presented keywords vortex induced vibrations 2 dof wake oscillator model fluid structure interaction 1 introduction when a structure is exposed to a fluid flow vortices may start to shed on the near wake of this structure depending on the freestream velocity of the flow in a given range of flow velocities known as the lock in range the values of the natural frequency of the structure and the shedding frequency of the vortices gets closer to each other leading the structure to vibrate due to the time varying cyclical hydrodynamics forces acting on it this phenomenon is knows as vortex induced vibrations viv if the equilibrium position of the structure is considerably near some plane boundary as the seabed the fluid structure interaction is affected in this case the vortices shedding on the downstream region of the near wake of the cylinder are not fully developed due to the resistance that the fluid finds when trying to pass the gap between the structure and the boundary this suppression of vortices affects the motion of the cylinder when compared to the classical case of a rigid cylinder vibrating away from the boundary in the last decades many experimental studies were carried out to understand viv of a rigid cylinder with different mass and damping ratios and also different reynolds number jauvits and williamson 2004 stappenbelt and lalji 2008 blevins and coughran 2009 kang et al 2016 in all of the mentioned experiments the cylinders used are placed in the absence of a plane boundary in this cases the bottom of the testing flume or the wind tunnel such that the boundary does not influence the observed viv phenomena recent studies was also carried out using mathematical models based on wake oscillator typically the van der pol equation to predict viv of a rigid cylinder with 1 dof and 2 dof skop and balasubramanian 1997 facchinetti et al 2004 ogink and metrikine 2010 kurushina et al 2018 all of these works focus on solving a set of ordinary differential equations to evaluate the wake variable commonly represented by q that models the flow wake behind the cylinder these studies do not have as main goal to reproduced the physics of the flow cylinder interaction in detail which could be achieved by solving the full fluid dynamic equations as observed by jin and dong 2016 computational fluid dynamics cfd has been proven to be the best approach to predict the dynamic characters of viv and some studies were carried out recently with this purpose martins and avila 2019a b khan et al 2018 despite its already mentioned proven capability to predict viv cfd brings a important issue their computational cost for simulations at realistic reynolds numbers wu et al 2012 although all the already mentioned studies had brought to us remarkable conclusions of viv with 1 dof and 2 dof none of them considered the effects of a plane boundary on viv phenomena one of the major differences between viv of a rigid cylinder in the absence and in the presence of a plane boundary observed by barbosa et al 2017 is that at high flow velocities the cylinder may vibrate at higher amplitudes and frequencies when compared to the vibration away from the boundary at the same flow velocity on the other hand at low flow velocities they observed the opposite for the amplitude of vibration i e the cylinder away from the boundary tends to vibrate with higher amplitudes when compared to the same vibrating near the boundary also if the gap ratio defined as e d where e is the distance between the plane boundary and the cylinder and d is the diameter of the cylinder is small enough it is possible that the cylinder and the boundary collides these observed differences in viv when the cylinder is initially placed in the presence of a plane boundary cannot be predicted using the wake oscillators that were mentioned earlier moreover the results obtained in the experiments considering a rigid cylinder vibrating in the absence of a plane boundary also cannot be used to validate the wake oscillator in the field of numerical simulations many studies were conducted using cfd to predict viv of a cylinder initially placed near a plane boundary and exposed to steady and oscillatory fluid flows zhao and cheng 2011 tham et al 2015 munir et al 2018 chen et al 2019 li et al 2016 although none of these works compared their results with experimental data of cylinders with 2 dof vibrating near a plane boundary experimental analysis focusing on predict maximum amplitudes and frequency of vibration and flow visualization of a cylinder initially placed near a plane boundary were also conducted over the past decades jacobsen et al 1984 taniguchi and miyakoshi 1990 bing et al 2009 hsieh et al 2016 daneshvar and morton 2020 although providing valuable informations these experiments were conducted with only 1 dof roshko et al 1975 experimentally measured the effect of wall distance on drag and lift coefficients of circular and triangular cylinders for the lift coefficient c l they noticed the presence of an attractive force between the cylinder and the wall with the force increasing as the gap ratio decreases for the drag coefficient c d they observed that as the cylinder gets closer to the wall its values decreases rapidly this occurs because the vortex shedding on the downstream region of the cylinder is suppressed bearman and zdravkovich 1978 conducted an experimental work for a circular cylinder exposed to a fluid flow with r e 2 5 1 0 4 they analysed pressure distributions around the cylinder and visualized the flow on the near wake of the cylinder for gap ratios varying from 0 e d 2 it was observed by them that when increasing the gap ratio the pressure distribution around the cylinder tends to be symmetric also for 0 8 e d 1 2 the vortex shedding was clearly visible behind the cylinder and the flow around the cylinder was little affected by the presence of the boundary barbosa et al 2017 performed stationary and free vibrations experiments for a cylinder with 2 dof the free vibrations experiment was conducted with reynolds number from 6500 r e 20000 and gap ratios from 0 e d 5 it was observed by them that for large gap ratios e d 2 the boundary had no influence on the response of the cylinder for e d 2 it was observed that as long as the cylinder do not touch the boundary the amplitude of oscillations tends to decrease when the gap ratio decrease for the cases in which the cylinder touches the boundary the amplitude and frequency of vibration of the cylinder tends to rapidly increases as in the case of a rigid cylinder in the absence of a plane boundary and exposed to an external fluid flow it is also important to study wake oscillator models to predict viv when the cylinder is placed near a plane boundary because as was already mentioned the fluid cylinder interaction is different in this case with the usual flow pattern observed in viv of a rigid cylinder been altered by the presence of the boundary due to the resistance that the fluid will find to pass through the gap between the cylinder and the boundary and also the possible collision of the cylinder with this boundary that will introduce impact forces and change the natural frequency of the system from the review performed by us a reasonable number of experimental works focussing on predict the main characteristics of viv of a rigid cylinder near a boundary were found on the other hand only two works considering wake oscillators to predict viv of a rigid circular cylinder near a plane boundary were found thus the motivation for this work appeared jin and dong 2016 proposed a wake oscillator model to predict viv of a cylinder near a plane boundary restricted to move only in the cross flow direction gap ratios from 0 e d 5 and mass ratios from 1 m 3 87 were simulated and compared with experimental data although good results were obtained when compared to experimental data they considered that the empirical coefficients were varying linearly with the gap and mass ratios although providing good results this assumption is not entirely true it will be seen latter that the values of the empirical coefficients in function of the gap ratio do not vary linearly thus a linear polynomial despite being a more simplified approach do not give the correct equations to calculate each one of these empirical coefficients the only 2 dof wake oscillator model found by us was the model proposed by barbosa et al 2017 simulations were conducted with 0 e d 5 and mass ratio m 5 4 1 1 m m m a with m defined as the mass of the cylinder per unit length and m a π d 2 ρ 4 the ideal added mass also per unit length with ρ defined as the density of the fluid and d already defined although providing good results the focus of the authors was to predict the cross flow amplitude of vibration of the cylinder near a boundary for this reason the in line motion of the cylinder was restricted i e set to zero essentially they formulated a wake oscillator model with 2 dof but the dynamic of the in line vibration was neglected and had no influence on the cross flow motion of the cylinder thus a model with 1 dof was considered similarly to the one proposed by jin and dong 2016 the absence of wake oscillator models to predict viv of a cylinder with 2 dof placed near a boundary was the main motivation for the present work also we understand that this research is important to the offshore industry for the cases in which submerged structures such as pipelines and power cables are located near the seabed in this work a 2 dof wake oscillator model for cylinders free to move in the in line and cross flow direction placed near a plane boundary is proposed it is important to mention that in the offshore industry the pipelines have low mass ratio in this case the in line vibration have a significant influence on the cross flow vibration and this is another motivation for which this work considers a model with 2 dof also using polynomial regression the equations to calculate the empirical coefficients β e d η e d and ψ e d to account for the effects of the gap ratio on the motion of the cylinder are generated this will guarantee more precise values for the empirical coefficients when compared to the ones obtained using linear regression such as the ones obtained by jin and dong 2016 in section 2 the mathematical model is presented the tuning parameters of the model are calibrated to fit experimental data in section 3 in section 4 the empirical coefficients for each gap ratio are calibrated to fit experimental data the results obtained are discussed in section 5 and in section 6 conclusion remarks and future research proposals are made 2 model description consider a circular cylinder with diameter d and mass per unit length m this cylinder is exposed to a stationary and uniform fluid flow with velocity v and density ρ also the cylinder is initially placed at a distance e from a plane boundary and its motion is described through the coordinated system x y the schematic model is depicted in fig 1 2 1 structure oscillator equations the cylinder from fig 1 is elastically mounted through two springs with stiffness k and two viscous dampers with damping coefficient c arranged in the x and y directions the x axis defines the in line direction while the y axis defines the cross flow direction the equations that governs the motion of the cylinder in the in line and cross flow directions are respectively 1 m x c x k x f x 2 m y c y k y f y where x and y are the displacements of the cylinder in the in line and cross flow directions respectively and overdots represents derivative with respect to time t f x f y are hydrodynamic forces acting on the cylinder in the in line and cross flow directions respectively the hydrodynamic force f x consists of two parts a vortex force f v x and an inviscid inertia force f a x related to the added mass of the fluid as proposed by qu and metrikine 2020 similarly for f y such forces are written as 3 f x f v x f a x 1 2 ρ d l v 2 c v x m a x 4 f y f v y f a y 1 2 ρ d l v 2 c v y m a y where l is the length of the cylinder and c v x and c v y are the in line and cross flow vortex force coefficients respectively substituting eq 3 into eq 1 moving the inertial force m a x to the left hand side of eq 1 and dividing both sides by m m a the equation of the structure oscillator in the in line direction is given by eq 5 similarly substituting eq 4 into eq 2 moving the inertial force m a y to the left hand side of eq 2 and dividing both sides by m m a the equation of the structure oscillator in the cross flow direction can also be written by eq 6 5 x c m m a x k m m a x 1 2 ρ d l v 2 c v x 1 m m a 6 y c m m a y k m m a y 1 2 ρ d l v 2 c v y 1 m m a remembering that f v x 1 2 ρ d l v 2 c v x and f v y 1 2 ρ d l v 2 c v y then eqs 5 and 6 can be rewritten as 7 x c m m a x k m m a x f v x m m a 8 y c m m a y k m m a y f v y m m a eqs 7 and 8 are written in their classic form as 9 x 2 ζ ω n x ω n 2 x f v x m m a 10 y 2 ζ ω n y ω n 2 y f v y m m a where ζ is the structural damping ratio of the cylinder in still water defined as ζ c 2 ω n m m a and ω n is the natural vibration frequency of the cylinder in still water given by ω n k m m a using fig 2 one can decompose forces f v x and f v y from eqs 3 and 4 respectively as the summation of the drag force due to vortex shedding f v d and the lift force due to vortex shedding f v l resulting in 11 f v x f v d cos β f v l sin β 12 f v y f v l cos β f v d sin β where f v l is the instantaneous lift force due to the vortex shedding and f v d is the instantaneous drag force due to the vortex shedding also β is the angle between the directions of the relative flow velocity u and the undisturbed flow velocity v considering that the velocity of the cylinder is much smaller than the velocity of the flow facchinetti et al 2004 assumed that β 1 with this assumption sin β and cos β are rewritten as 13 sin β β 1 v d y d t cos β 1 with this qu and metrikine 2020 defined f v x and f v y as 14 f v x 1 2 c v l ρ d l u 2 sin β 1 2 c d m ρ d l u 2 cos β 1 2 α c v l 2 ρ d u x u x 15 f v y 1 2 c v l ρ d l u 2 cos β 1 2 c v d ρ d l u 2 sin β where c v l is the vortex lift coefficient defined as c v l q c l 0 2 with c l 0 being the lift coefficient measured on a stationary cylinder u is the velocity of the flow relative to the motion of the cylinder β is the angle between the freestream velocity v and the u c d m is the oscillating mean drag coefficient and α is a wake oscillator coefficient of a stationary cylinder used to generate an oscillating drag force coefficient as defined by qin 2004 2 2 modified wake oscillator equation a new wake oscillator equation has been developed to predict viv of a rigid cylinder with 2 dof near a plane boundary from a modification of the wake oscillator model proposed by qu and metrikine 2020 to predict viv of a rigid cylinder with 2 dof in the absence of a plane boundary this wake oscillator was choose for it being a recent model that uses only one wake oscillator equation to trigger the motion with 2 dof the nonlinear wake oscillator proposed by qu and metrikine 2020 is 16 q ε ω s q 2 1 q ω s 2 q κ d x q a d y where q is the wake variable ω s is the vortex shedding frequency defined as ω s 2 π s t v d with s t being the strouhal number ε κ and a are tuning parameters to fit experimental data the development of eq 16 was suppressed here since the main focus of the present work is to modify such equation to account for the effects of a plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder using the expressions of f v x and f v y proposed by qu and metrikine 2020 and defining the dimensionless quantities τ ω s t ω n ω n ω s x x d and y y d eqs 9 10 and 16 that is the governing equations to predict viv of a rigid cylinder in the absence of a plane boundary in dimensionless form can be written as 17 x 2 ζ ω n x ω n 2 x c v x 2 π 3 s t 2 m c a 18 y 2 ζ ω n y ω n 2 y c v y 2 π 3 s t 2 m c a 19 q ε q 2 1 q q κ x q a y in eqs 17 and 18 c a is the potential added mass coefficient overdots are now derivatives with respect to dimensionless time τ and c v x and c v y are defined by qu and metrikine 2020 as 20 c v x c d m 1 2 π s t x c v l 2 π s t y 1 2 π s t x 2 2 π s t y 2 α c v l 2 1 2 π s t x 1 2 π s t x 21 c v y c d m 2 π s t y c v l 1 2 π s t x 1 2 π s t x 2 2 π s t y 2 2 3 coupling the empirical coefficients on the wake oscillator equation modifications on eq 16 needs to be made in order to account for the effects caused by the proximity of a plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder three empirical coefficients β e d η e d and ψ e d and one term linear in q are added on the wake oscillator equation eq 16 in the following manner 22 q ε ω s q 2 1 q ω s 2 q ψ e d ω n ω s q η e d κ d x q β e d a d y this equation is a van der pol modified oscillator this equation is widely used in viv to model the wake behind a rigid cylinder this is accomplished adding the strouhal frequency ω s on the left hand side and the acceleration coupling term a d y proposed by facchinetti et al 2004 that models the cross flow force that the cylinder exerts on the wake on the right hand side also as this is a 2 dof wake oscillator model we have to add the acceleration coupling term related to the in line direction which is the term κ d x q on the left hand side this would be sufficient to model the wake behind the cylinder in the absence of a plane boundary to account for the effects of the plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder three new empirical coefficients were added on the left hand side we added the term ψ e d ω n ω s q to account for the effects of the plane boundary on the cross flow frequency of the cylinder this term was established empirically and a number of attempts was made until we find the one that better fitted to our model we also added the coefficients β e d multiplying the cross flow forcing term a d y and η e d multiplying the in line forcing term κ d x q to account for the effects of the plane boundary on the cross flow and in line motions of the cylinder respectively the empirical coefficients η e d and β e d are responsible to modify the response of the cylinder in the in line and cross flow directions respectively similarly to κ and a for the cases of a cylinder vibrating in the absence of a plane boundary in other words if κ and a are remained fixed increasing the values of η and β will generate higher amplitudes of vibration in the in line and cross flow directions respectively similarly decreasing the values of η and β the opposite will occurs i e lower values will be achieved for the vibration of the cylinder in the in line and cross flow directions as occurs in the case of the cylinder vibrating in the absence of a plane boundary the response of vibration in the in line direction will affect the response of vibration in the cross flow direction depending on the mass ratio of the cylinder also to perform an analysis considering that the cylinder is allowed to move only in the cross flow direction the coefficient η should be setted to zero the linear term ω n ω s q is responsible to account for the variation of the vibration frequency of the cylinder in the cross flow direction due to the presence of the plane boundary and ψ similarly to η and β is responsible to modify the response of this vibration frequency in dimensionless form eq 22 becomes 23 q ε q 2 1 q q ψ e d ω n q η e d κ x q β e d a y 3 calibration of the tuning parameters of the model the first to be done is calibrate the tuning parameters of eq 19 these are ε κ and a without consider the influence of the plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder alternatively one can use eq 23 and set the empirical coefficients to ψ 0 η 1 and β 1 which result in eq 19 these tuning parameters needs to be calibrated using experimental data obtained with the cylinder vibrating in the absence of the plane boundary i e the plane boundary do not affect the motion of the cylinder by simulating the eqs 17 19 the tuning parameters ε κ and a of eq 19 were calibrated to fit experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 table 1 shows the hydrodynamic parameters used during the simulations which were also used by qu and metrikine 2020 such parameters are used in all the simulations of the present work even for the cases where the cylinder is placed near of the plane boundary one important observation for the value of s t is that in the work of barbosa et al 2017 it was null for the cases of e d 0 3 also it was seen that the reynolds number have almost no influence on s t for e d 0 3 assuming a nearly constant value of s t 0 2 with a mean value of 0 195 in the present work we assumed that s t 0 2 even for the cases in which e d 0 3 this assumption was also made by barbosa et al 2017 when studying the viv of a cylinder near a plane boundary the parameters of the structural system used by barbosa et al 2017 are presented in table 2 which were also used during all the simulations performed in the present work one important observation to be made is that barbosa et al 2017 do not provided the value of the damping used in their work as the authors used the experimental data from blevins and coughran 2009 which considers a viscous damping of 2 to compared their results in the present work a viscous damping of 2 were assumed as can be seen in table 1 also barbosa et al 2017 considered the same viscous damping when studying the viv of a cylinder near a plane boundary the simulation results are shown in fig 3 along with the experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 the results presented are the cross flow reduced amplitude a y a y d where a y is the vibration amplitude in the cross flow direction the mean drag coefficient c x m e a n and the cross flow reduced frequency ω y ω n where ω y is the frequency of vibration of the cylinder in the cross flow direction all the results are in function of the reduced velocity v r 2 π v ω n d the results shown in fig 3 were obtained by simulating eqs 17 19 eq 19 was used instead of eq 23 based on the experimental results obtained by barbosa et al 2017 that shows that for e d 5 the motion of the cylinder is not affected by the presence of the plane boundary as can be seen in fig 3 a the peak value of vibration in the cross flow direction a y was underestimated by the simulation while in fig 3 b one can see that the peak value of mean drag coefficient was overestimated fig 3 also shows that the reduced velocity where the lock in region begins was underestimated by the model finally analysing fig 3 c it can be seen that the simulated responses are in good agreement with the experimental data the cross flow reduced frequency is well captured by the model i e the frequency follows both the vortex shedding frequency outside the lock in range and the natural frequency of the cylinder onto the lock in range during the calibration process of the parameters we do not find a set of values for the tuning parameters that correctly fitted both the peak value of the cross flow reduced amplitude and the mean drag coefficient within this scenario the tuning parameters were calibrated to fit both the cross flow reduced amplitude and the mean drag coefficient as close as possible without prioritizing one and compromising the other the tuning parameters used in all the simulations of the present work are ε 0 1 a 16 and κ 3 4 calibration of the empirical coefficients of the model the next step is to calibrate the empirical coefficients of eq 23 ψ η and β to account for the effects of the plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder for this purpose the eqs 17 18 and 23 are simulated using the parameters from tables 1 and 2 and the experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 the gap ratios are divided in three groups according to their influence on the amplitude and frequency of vibration of the cylinder this separation was also made by barbosa et al 2017 which provide the means to easily compare the numerical response with the experimental data it was experimentally observed by barbosa et al 2017 that the influence of the boundary on the motion of the cylinder is very small for large gap ratios i e 2 e d 5 fig 4 shows the results of the cross flow reduced amplitude cross flow reduced frequency and mean drag coefficient obtained in the simulations for different reduced velocities v r and the respective experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 from here on the simulations performed in the present work are represented in the plots by a symbol and a solid line whilst the experimental data is represented by symbols only it can be seen from figs 4 a and 4 b that for 3 e d 5 the response of the cylinder do not change with a maximum reduced amplitude of a y 0 9 for e d 2 the maximum reduced amplitude slightly drops to a y 0 85 the same trend is observed for the mean drag coefficient in figs 4 c and 4 d where for 3 e d 5 the peak value of the mean drag coefficient is c x m e a n 3 4 and for e d 2 this value drops to c x m e a n 3 2 on the other hand from figs 4 e and 4 f it can be seen that the cross flow reduced frequency is nearly the same for all this range of gap ratios regarding for v r 8 where a variation occurs in the cross flow reduced frequency for e d 2 this variation do not occurs for 3 e d 5 the model was able to predict the peak values for a y and c x m e a n but does not predict precisely the correct response inside the lock in range thus the cross flow reduced frequency was also not well predicted with a slightly underestimation after the lock in range v r 8 this problem is related to the damping parameter of the model ε in eq 23 when changing this parameter one can see that the initial velocity where the lock in range begins shifts to the right as shown fig 5 a changing the damping parameter ε slightly affects the initial velocity where the lock in begins but it have a great impact in the maximum amplitude of vibration as can be seen in fig 5 a where when varying the damping parameters from 0 1 to 0 9 the maximum amplitude of vibration a y drops from 0 8 to 0 35 to solve this problem one have to increase the values of the tuning parameters a and κ which will increase the maximum amplitude of vibration in both directions the result of this change is shown in fig 5 b where the amplitude of vibration increases as a changes from 16 to 30 and κ changes from 3 to 10 but we also see that this shifted to the left the initial velocity where the lock in range begins and also increased the lock in range when this occur we have to make a compromise between lock in range and maximum amplitude of vibration as in the work of barbosa et al 2017 we also focus here in simulate the trend observed in their experiments that when the cylinder gets closer to the plane boundary its maximum amplitude of vibration decreases and this was well achieved when we observe fig 4 b also we can see that the maximum amplitude of the in line mean drag force coefficient c x m e a n is overestimated by the model again this was a problem observed when we were tuning a and κ and again we made a compromise as the main focus here is to predict the maximum amplitude of vibration in the cross flow direction which is the highest value of amplitude when compared to the vibration in the in line direction we focused on tuning these two parameters to better fit the experimental results provided by barbosa et al 2017 for the maximum amplitude of vibration in the cross flow direction if we tuned a and κ to better fit c x m e a n than a y would be underestimated in the presence of this scenario we considered that a y should be well predicted in deterioration of the in line mean drag force coefficient the same analysis is now conducted for the range of medium gap ratios i e 0 75 e d 1 5 where the vortex shedding at the downstream side of the cylinder starts to be suppressed causing changes in the response of the cylinder fig 6 shows the results of the cross flow reduced amplitude cross flow reduced frequency and mean drag coefficient obtained during the simulations along with the comparison with experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 the model was able to predict the peak amplitude of vibration of the cross flow reduced amplitude in figs 6 a and 6 b for all cases of medium gap ratios the trend of the lock in range was also in good agreement with experimental data the maximum value of the curve c x m e a n vs v r was also well predicted with exception of e d 1 5 whit an underestimation for the maximum value as can be seen in figs 6 c and 6 d moreover for this case of e d 1 5 the reduced frequency of vibration in the cross flow direction was slightly underestimated by the model for v r 9 5 as shows fig 6 e for the range of small gap ratios i e 0 0 e d 0 5 the model take into account the in line vibration of the cylinder but in the experiments performed by barbosa et al 2017 the authors do not provided the mean drag coefficient for the cases of small gap ratios in the experiments the gap ratio was really small and the cylinder occasionally collided with the plane boundary which compromised the signal obtained during the experiments and it was not considered reliable by the authors the empirical coefficients β and ψ can be identified using experimental data as function of e d for the small gap ratios but η that have influence on the in line force term in eq 23 cannot although we can observe using figs 4 d 6 c and 6 d that as the gap ratio decreases the mean drag coefficient c x m e a n also decreases for example from c x m e a n 3 45 for e d 3 to c x m e a n 3 25 for e d 2 in fig 4 d the same trend can be observed in fig 6 c as the gap ratio decreases using this trend obtained by empirical observation based on experimental data we established that η 0 5 will be used for this set of small gap ratios this value was established because for all large and medium gap ratios simulated η was between 0 65 and 1 since for small gap ratios all maximum values of c x m e a n are lower than the values obtained for large and medium gap ratios than η 0 65 as η have influence on the in line force term in eq 23 with this we still have a 2 dof analysis this is very important because as was observed by jauvits and williamson 2004 the in line vibration of the cylinder affects its cross flow vibration in cases which m 6 fig 7 shows the results obtained for the cross flow reduced amplitude cross flow reduced frequency and mean drag coefficient along with the comparison with experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 except for the mean drag coefficient as the cylinder touches the plane boundary the typical motion of the cylinder inside the lock in range is not present in the experimental result because there is no symmetry in the signal obtained for the amplitude of vibration of the cylinder in the cross flow direction i e the values of maximum and minimum amplitudes of vibration are different for this reason only the maximum value of cross flow reduced amplitude was provided by barbosa et al 2017 and that is why only the peak maximum amplitude of vibration in the cross flow direction are significant here as can be seen in figs 7 a 7 c the maximum amplitude of vibration in the cross flow direction was well captured by the model in all cases of small gap ratios although the reduced velocity where it occurs was underestimated by the model for the cases of e d 0 25 which explains a limitation of the model to predict the correct reduced velocity where the peak maximum amplitude of vibration occurs for the cases in which the cylinder touches the plane boundary for the cross flow reduced frequency figs 7 e 7 g shows that the model slightly underestimated its values for e d 0 where the cylinder is initially placed almost touching the boundary and for e d 0 25 although no experimental data is available for the mean drag coefficient the model showed to predict good results for all the other two ranges of gap ratios simulated demonstrating its efficiency moreover we found that it is relevant to show these results as to the best of our knowledge a new information for the design of offshore structures in which depending on the scour of the seabed the structure could collide with the boundary and this in line data presented would play a important role during the design process the most valuable information presented in figs 7 d is the inverse trend observed for c x m e a n when compare to the cases of large and medium gap ratios as can be seen in figs 4 c 4 d 6 c and 6 d where the maximum value decreases as the gap ratio decreases for e d 0 25 where the cylinder occasionally touches the boundary during the vibration it presents the opposite trend where the maximum value of c x m e a n increases as the gap ratio decreases for e d 0 5 where the cylinder do not touched the boundary during the experiments from barbosa et al 2017 the maximum value of c x m e a n is about 3 which is a slightly higher value when compare to value for e d 0 75 in fig 6 d when e d 0 25 this value presents an abrupt increase reaching a peak value of four in general the model achieved good results when compared to experimental data for the maximum amplitude in the cross flow direction although the lock in range was not well predicted with an underestimated value of its initial velocity this problem was also found by barbosa et al 2017 in their attempt to generate a model to predict viv of a rigid cylinder near a plane boundary as we mentioned before we believe that this problem is related to the tuning parameters of the model i e a ε and κ as was mentioned before the empirical coefficients β η and ψ were set for each gap ratio simulated and calibrated with experimental data after it using the least mean square method the curves that better fitted the spread data for each empirical coefficient were determined also using the least mean square method the equations to calculate each empirical coefficient as function of the gap ratio were found the curves obtained are presented in fig 8 the curves of ψ for large gap ratios 2 e d 5 medium gap ratios 0 75 e d 1 5 and η for small gap ratios 0 0 e d 0 5 are constants and equals to 0 0 5 and 0 5 respectively this is due to the fact that for large gap ratios 2 e d 5 experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 did not shown any significant changes in the cross flow frequency of the cylinder within this range and as ψ is the empirical coefficient that account for the variations in the cross flow frequency in eq 23 it was set to zero also during calibration process the same experimental data showed that for medium gap ratios 0 75 e d 1 5 ψ 0 5 was the best value founded by us to fit experimental data through this range for the cases of 0 0 e d 0 5 no experimental data was available to tune empirical coefficient η in the presence of this scenario we considered the trend of c x m e a n observed in figs 4 d 6 c and 6 d that as the gap ratio decreases the mean drag coefficient c x m e a n also decreases as already mentioned as η is the empirical coefficient that account for the variations in the in line motion of the cylinder in eq 23 we established that η 0 5 will be used for this set of small gap ratios this value was established because for all large and medium gap ratios simulated 0 65 η 1 since for small gap ratios all maximum values of c x m e a n are lower than the values obtained for large and medium gap ratios than η 0 65 as mentioned before this allows that eq 23 remains a 2 dof equation with this we can calibrate β and ψ for this range of gap ratios using experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 the equations used to obtain each curve from fig 8 are listed in table 3 the value of ψ 0 for large gap ratios is used to neglect the effects of the plane boundary on the cross flow reduced frequency of the cylinder which is observed analysing figs 4 e and 4 f and remembering that it was assumed that the plane boundary have no influence on the motion of the cylinder in the in line direction for small gap ratios η 1 for this case 5 discussions in the present work the response of a cylinder placed near a plane boundary was simulated using a new wake oscillator model with 2 dof where empirical coefficients were added to account for the effects of the plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder as contribution the coupled dynamic between the in line and cross flow vibrations is considered along with the behaviour of the mean drag coefficient for small gap ratios although no experimental data is available to validate the simulated results of mean drag coefficient for small gap ratios the model showed to be consistent with the experiment of barbosa et al 2017 for the cases of medium and large gap ratios with a good prediction of the maximum amplitude of vibration in the cross flow direction the authors considered that this new information concerning the behaviour of the mean drag coefficient will have a remarkable impact in the state of art in viv since for the cases of offshore pipelines that are placed on the seabed with low mass ratios where is known that the influence of the in line vibration on the cross flow vibration could not be neglected a 2 dof wake oscillator model is necessary to achieve better results when predicting viv of a rigid cylinder elastically mounted moreover for small gap ratios where collisions with the seabed may occur it is necessary to predict the contact force for the study of fatigue and this is the contribution of the present model as its provide the energy transferred to the seabed during the impact one new information in the present model is the equations to calculate the empirical coefficients as function of the gap ratios as these equations do not depend on the mass and damping ratios of the cylinder it could be use for any cases it is important to clarify that for different values of mass and damping ratios the appropriate procedure is to first calibrate the tuning parameters of the model with experimental data of a cylinder vibrating in the absence of a plane boundary and then calculate each empirical coefficient using the equations from table 3 the main focus of this work was to simulate the trend observed by roshko et al 1975 that an attractive force appears on the cylinder as its gets closer to the plane boundary this force tends to increase as the gap ratio decrease this trend was well observed during simulations on the plane boundary as the cylinder gets closer to it a repulsive force appears in opposite direction compared to the motion of the cylinder when this repulsive force increases the maximum amplitude of vibration of the cylinder decreases as can be observed in figs 4 a 4 b 6 a and 6 b when the cylinder touches the boundary this force changes direction now becoming an attractive force in figs 7 a 7 c this trend is clearly visible with the maximum amplitudes of vibration for e d 0 and e d 0 25 the cases where the cylinder touched the boundary being higher than for the case for e d 0 50 where the cylinder do not touched the boundary the same trend is observed for the case in which two cylinders are arranged side by side where this force appears in each one of the cylinders and also increases as the gap between one cylinder to another decreases as for the case of a cylinder near a plane boundary when these cylinders collides these forces also change its directions and become repulsive forces this is the situation where cylinders are mounted near each other are of great importance in many engineering applications such as tubes inside heat exchangers power cable lines risers etc and a similar analysis could be conducted to generate a wake oscillator model to predict the response of the cylinder in these situations 6 conclusions the present work had as principal goal to propose a new wake oscillator model with 2 dof to predict viv of a cylinder near a plane boundary in general the model was able to capture the main characteristics of viv of cylinders near a plane boundary with m 5 5 and ζ 0 02 the empirical coefficients β η and ψ to account for the effects of the plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder were obtained by polynomial regression this allowed the equations to calculate the empirical coefficients as function of the gap ratio to be of any order and not only of order one which is an advantage when compare to the model of jin and dong 2016 that considered that the empirical coefficients varies linearly with the gap ratio although the empirical coefficients of the present work was considered to vary only with the gap ratio e d for a case in which one would like to simulate the model for a different mass or damping ratios it will be necessary to first set the tuning parameters from eq 23 ε κ and a for e d 5 and then use the empirical coefficients presented in this work moreover the model developed is only capable to predict viv of a circular cylinder with the same mass and damping ratios in both in line and cross flow directions when new experimental data with different gap ratios become available it will be possible to refine the equations for the empirical coefficients this will result in more precise model s responses for m 5 5 and

20536,a wake oscillator model to predict vortex induced vibrations viv of a rigid cylinder elastically mounted with two degrees of freedom 2 dof placed near a plane boundary is proposed the model is composed by three equations two for the structural oscillators in the x and y directions and one for the wake oscillator three new empirical coefficients are coupled to the wake oscillator equation to account for the effects of the plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder also a new empirical term is included on the wake oscillator equation the mass ratio of the cylinder is fixed and equal to 5 5 gap ratios defined as the ratio between the distance of the cylinder to the plane boundary e and the diameter of the cylinder d varying from zero to five are simulated and compared with experimental data for the cross flow reduced amplitude and frequency and the mean drag coefficient the empirical coefficients are calibrated to fit experimental data and using polynomial regression the equations to calculate each empirical coefficient are generated as new information the mean drag coefficient for the cases of e d 0 5 is presented keywords vortex induced vibrations 2 dof wake oscillator model fluid structure interaction 1 introduction when a structure is exposed to a fluid flow vortices may start to shed on the near wake of this structure depending on the freestream velocity of the flow in a given range of flow velocities known as the lock in range the values of the natural frequency of the structure and the shedding frequency of the vortices gets closer to each other leading the structure to vibrate due to the time varying cyclical hydrodynamics forces acting on it this phenomenon is knows as vortex induced vibrations viv if the equilibrium position of the structure is considerably near some plane boundary as the seabed the fluid structure interaction is affected in this case the vortices shedding on the downstream region of the near wake of the cylinder are not fully developed due to the resistance that the fluid finds when trying to pass the gap between the structure and the boundary this suppression of vortices affects the motion of the cylinder when compared to the classical case of a rigid cylinder vibrating away from the boundary in the last decades many experimental studies were carried out to understand viv of a rigid cylinder with different mass and damping ratios and also different reynolds number jauvits and williamson 2004 stappenbelt and lalji 2008 blevins and coughran 2009 kang et al 2016 in all of the mentioned experiments the cylinders used are placed in the absence of a plane boundary in this cases the bottom of the testing flume or the wind tunnel such that the boundary does not influence the observed viv phenomena recent studies was also carried out using mathematical models based on wake oscillator typically the van der pol equation to predict viv of a rigid cylinder with 1 dof and 2 dof skop and balasubramanian 1997 facchinetti et al 2004 ogink and metrikine 2010 kurushina et al 2018 all of these works focus on solving a set of ordinary differential equations to evaluate the wake variable commonly represented by q that models the flow wake behind the cylinder these studies do not have as main goal to reproduced the physics of the flow cylinder interaction in detail which could be achieved by solving the full fluid dynamic equations as observed by jin and dong 2016 computational fluid dynamics cfd has been proven to be the best approach to predict the dynamic characters of viv and some studies were carried out recently with this purpose martins and avila 2019a b khan et al 2018 despite its already mentioned proven capability to predict viv cfd brings a important issue their computational cost for simulations at realistic reynolds numbers wu et al 2012 although all the already mentioned studies had brought to us remarkable conclusions of viv with 1 dof and 2 dof none of them considered the effects of a plane boundary on viv phenomena one of the major differences between viv of a rigid cylinder in the absence and in the presence of a plane boundary observed by barbosa et al 2017 is that at high flow velocities the cylinder may vibrate at higher amplitudes and frequencies when compared to the vibration away from the boundary at the same flow velocity on the other hand at low flow velocities they observed the opposite for the amplitude of vibration i e the cylinder away from the boundary tends to vibrate with higher amplitudes when compared to the same vibrating near the boundary also if the gap ratio defined as e d where e is the distance between the plane boundary and the cylinder and d is the diameter of the cylinder is small enough it is possible that the cylinder and the boundary collides these observed differences in viv when the cylinder is initially placed in the presence of a plane boundary cannot be predicted using the wake oscillators that were mentioned earlier moreover the results obtained in the experiments considering a rigid cylinder vibrating in the absence of a plane boundary also cannot be used to validate the wake oscillator in the field of numerical simulations many studies were conducted using cfd to predict viv of a cylinder initially placed near a plane boundary and exposed to steady and oscillatory fluid flows zhao and cheng 2011 tham et al 2015 munir et al 2018 chen et al 2019 li et al 2016 although none of these works compared their results with experimental data of cylinders with 2 dof vibrating near a plane boundary experimental analysis focusing on predict maximum amplitudes and frequency of vibration and flow visualization of a cylinder initially placed near a plane boundary were also conducted over the past decades jacobsen et al 1984 taniguchi and miyakoshi 1990 bing et al 2009 hsieh et al 2016 daneshvar and morton 2020 although providing valuable informations these experiments were conducted with only 1 dof roshko et al 1975 experimentally measured the effect of wall distance on drag and lift coefficients of circular and triangular cylinders for the lift coefficient c l they noticed the presence of an attractive force between the cylinder and the wall with the force increasing as the gap ratio decreases for the drag coefficient c d they observed that as the cylinder gets closer to the wall its values decreases rapidly this occurs because the vortex shedding on the downstream region of the cylinder is suppressed bearman and zdravkovich 1978 conducted an experimental work for a circular cylinder exposed to a fluid flow with r e 2 5 1 0 4 they analysed pressure distributions around the cylinder and visualized the flow on the near wake of the cylinder for gap ratios varying from 0 e d 2 it was observed by them that when increasing the gap ratio the pressure distribution around the cylinder tends to be symmetric also for 0 8 e d 1 2 the vortex shedding was clearly visible behind the cylinder and the flow around the cylinder was little affected by the presence of the boundary barbosa et al 2017 performed stationary and free vibrations experiments for a cylinder with 2 dof the free vibrations experiment was conducted with reynolds number from 6500 r e 20000 and gap ratios from 0 e d 5 it was observed by them that for large gap ratios e d 2 the boundary had no influence on the response of the cylinder for e d 2 it was observed that as long as the cylinder do not touch the boundary the amplitude of oscillations tends to decrease when the gap ratio decrease for the cases in which the cylinder touches the boundary the amplitude and frequency of vibration of the cylinder tends to rapidly increases as in the case of a rigid cylinder in the absence of a plane boundary and exposed to an external fluid flow it is also important to study wake oscillator models to predict viv when the cylinder is placed near a plane boundary because as was already mentioned the fluid cylinder interaction is different in this case with the usual flow pattern observed in viv of a rigid cylinder been altered by the presence of the boundary due to the resistance that the fluid will find to pass through the gap between the cylinder and the boundary and also the possible collision of the cylinder with this boundary that will introduce impact forces and change the natural frequency of the system from the review performed by us a reasonable number of experimental works focussing on predict the main characteristics of viv of a rigid cylinder near a boundary were found on the other hand only two works considering wake oscillators to predict viv of a rigid circular cylinder near a plane boundary were found thus the motivation for this work appeared jin and dong 2016 proposed a wake oscillator model to predict viv of a cylinder near a plane boundary restricted to move only in the cross flow direction gap ratios from 0 e d 5 and mass ratios from 1 m 3 87 were simulated and compared with experimental data although good results were obtained when compared to experimental data they considered that the empirical coefficients were varying linearly with the gap and mass ratios although providing good results this assumption is not entirely true it will be seen latter that the values of the empirical coefficients in function of the gap ratio do not vary linearly thus a linear polynomial despite being a more simplified approach do not give the correct equations to calculate each one of these empirical coefficients the only 2 dof wake oscillator model found by us was the model proposed by barbosa et al 2017 simulations were conducted with 0 e d 5 and mass ratio m 5 4 1 1 m m m a with m defined as the mass of the cylinder per unit length and m a π d 2 ρ 4 the ideal added mass also per unit length with ρ defined as the density of the fluid and d already defined although providing good results the focus of the authors was to predict the cross flow amplitude of vibration of the cylinder near a boundary for this reason the in line motion of the cylinder was restricted i e set to zero essentially they formulated a wake oscillator model with 2 dof but the dynamic of the in line vibration was neglected and had no influence on the cross flow motion of the cylinder thus a model with 1 dof was considered similarly to the one proposed by jin and dong 2016 the absence of wake oscillator models to predict viv of a cylinder with 2 dof placed near a boundary was the main motivation for the present work also we understand that this research is important to the offshore industry for the cases in which submerged structures such as pipelines and power cables are located near the seabed in this work a 2 dof wake oscillator model for cylinders free to move in the in line and cross flow direction placed near a plane boundary is proposed it is important to mention that in the offshore industry the pipelines have low mass ratio in this case the in line vibration have a significant influence on the cross flow vibration and this is another motivation for which this work considers a model with 2 dof also using polynomial regression the equations to calculate the empirical coefficients β e d η e d and ψ e d to account for the effects of the gap ratio on the motion of the cylinder are generated this will guarantee more precise values for the empirical coefficients when compared to the ones obtained using linear regression such as the ones obtained by jin and dong 2016 in section 2 the mathematical model is presented the tuning parameters of the model are calibrated to fit experimental data in section 3 in section 4 the empirical coefficients for each gap ratio are calibrated to fit experimental data the results obtained are discussed in section 5 and in section 6 conclusion remarks and future research proposals are made 2 model description consider a circular cylinder with diameter d and mass per unit length m this cylinder is exposed to a stationary and uniform fluid flow with velocity v and density ρ also the cylinder is initially placed at a distance e from a plane boundary and its motion is described through the coordinated system x y the schematic model is depicted in fig 1 2 1 structure oscillator equations the cylinder from fig 1 is elastically mounted through two springs with stiffness k and two viscous dampers with damping coefficient c arranged in the x and y directions the x axis defines the in line direction while the y axis defines the cross flow direction the equations that governs the motion of the cylinder in the in line and cross flow directions are respectively 1 m x c x k x f x 2 m y c y k y f y where x and y are the displacements of the cylinder in the in line and cross flow directions respectively and overdots represents derivative with respect to time t f x f y are hydrodynamic forces acting on the cylinder in the in line and cross flow directions respectively the hydrodynamic force f x consists of two parts a vortex force f v x and an inviscid inertia force f a x related to the added mass of the fluid as proposed by qu and metrikine 2020 similarly for f y such forces are written as 3 f x f v x f a x 1 2 ρ d l v 2 c v x m a x 4 f y f v y f a y 1 2 ρ d l v 2 c v y m a y where l is the length of the cylinder and c v x and c v y are the in line and cross flow vortex force coefficients respectively substituting eq 3 into eq 1 moving the inertial force m a x to the left hand side of eq 1 and dividing both sides by m m a the equation of the structure oscillator in the in line direction is given by eq 5 similarly substituting eq 4 into eq 2 moving the inertial force m a y to the left hand side of eq 2 and dividing both sides by m m a the equation of the structure oscillator in the cross flow direction can also be written by eq 6 5 x c m m a x k m m a x 1 2 ρ d l v 2 c v x 1 m m a 6 y c m m a y k m m a y 1 2 ρ d l v 2 c v y 1 m m a remembering that f v x 1 2 ρ d l v 2 c v x and f v y 1 2 ρ d l v 2 c v y then eqs 5 and 6 can be rewritten as 7 x c m m a x k m m a x f v x m m a 8 y c m m a y k m m a y f v y m m a eqs 7 and 8 are written in their classic form as 9 x 2 ζ ω n x ω n 2 x f v x m m a 10 y 2 ζ ω n y ω n 2 y f v y m m a where ζ is the structural damping ratio of the cylinder in still water defined as ζ c 2 ω n m m a and ω n is the natural vibration frequency of the cylinder in still water given by ω n k m m a using fig 2 one can decompose forces f v x and f v y from eqs 3 and 4 respectively as the summation of the drag force due to vortex shedding f v d and the lift force due to vortex shedding f v l resulting in 11 f v x f v d cos β f v l sin β 12 f v y f v l cos β f v d sin β where f v l is the instantaneous lift force due to the vortex shedding and f v d is the instantaneous drag force due to the vortex shedding also β is the angle between the directions of the relative flow velocity u and the undisturbed flow velocity v considering that the velocity of the cylinder is much smaller than the velocity of the flow facchinetti et al 2004 assumed that β 1 with this assumption sin β and cos β are rewritten as 13 sin β β 1 v d y d t cos β 1 with this qu and metrikine 2020 defined f v x and f v y as 14 f v x 1 2 c v l ρ d l u 2 sin β 1 2 c d m ρ d l u 2 cos β 1 2 α c v l 2 ρ d u x u x 15 f v y 1 2 c v l ρ d l u 2 cos β 1 2 c v d ρ d l u 2 sin β where c v l is the vortex lift coefficient defined as c v l q c l 0 2 with c l 0 being the lift coefficient measured on a stationary cylinder u is the velocity of the flow relative to the motion of the cylinder β is the angle between the freestream velocity v and the u c d m is the oscillating mean drag coefficient and α is a wake oscillator coefficient of a stationary cylinder used to generate an oscillating drag force coefficient as defined by qin 2004 2 2 modified wake oscillator equation a new wake oscillator equation has been developed to predict viv of a rigid cylinder with 2 dof near a plane boundary from a modification of the wake oscillator model proposed by qu and metrikine 2020 to predict viv of a rigid cylinder with 2 dof in the absence of a plane boundary this wake oscillator was choose for it being a recent model that uses only one wake oscillator equation to trigger the motion with 2 dof the nonlinear wake oscillator proposed by qu and metrikine 2020 is 16 q ε ω s q 2 1 q ω s 2 q κ d x q a d y where q is the wake variable ω s is the vortex shedding frequency defined as ω s 2 π s t v d with s t being the strouhal number ε κ and a are tuning parameters to fit experimental data the development of eq 16 was suppressed here since the main focus of the present work is to modify such equation to account for the effects of a plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder using the expressions of f v x and f v y proposed by qu and metrikine 2020 and defining the dimensionless quantities τ ω s t ω n ω n ω s x x d and y y d eqs 9 10 and 16 that is the governing equations to predict viv of a rigid cylinder in the absence of a plane boundary in dimensionless form can be written as 17 x 2 ζ ω n x ω n 2 x c v x 2 π 3 s t 2 m c a 18 y 2 ζ ω n y ω n 2 y c v y 2 π 3 s t 2 m c a 19 q ε q 2 1 q q κ x q a y in eqs 17 and 18 c a is the potential added mass coefficient overdots are now derivatives with respect to dimensionless time τ and c v x and c v y are defined by qu and metrikine 2020 as 20 c v x c d m 1 2 π s t x c v l 2 π s t y 1 2 π s t x 2 2 π s t y 2 α c v l 2 1 2 π s t x 1 2 π s t x 21 c v y c d m 2 π s t y c v l 1 2 π s t x 1 2 π s t x 2 2 π s t y 2 2 3 coupling the empirical coefficients on the wake oscillator equation modifications on eq 16 needs to be made in order to account for the effects caused by the proximity of a plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder three empirical coefficients β e d η e d and ψ e d and one term linear in q are added on the wake oscillator equation eq 16 in the following manner 22 q ε ω s q 2 1 q ω s 2 q ψ e d ω n ω s q η e d κ d x q β e d a d y this equation is a van der pol modified oscillator this equation is widely used in viv to model the wake behind a rigid cylinder this is accomplished adding the strouhal frequency ω s on the left hand side and the acceleration coupling term a d y proposed by facchinetti et al 2004 that models the cross flow force that the cylinder exerts on the wake on the right hand side also as this is a 2 dof wake oscillator model we have to add the acceleration coupling term related to the in line direction which is the term κ d x q on the left hand side this would be sufficient to model the wake behind the cylinder in the absence of a plane boundary to account for the effects of the plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder three new empirical coefficients were added on the left hand side we added the term ψ e d ω n ω s q to account for the effects of the plane boundary on the cross flow frequency of the cylinder this term was established empirically and a number of attempts was made until we find the one that better fitted to our model we also added the coefficients β e d multiplying the cross flow forcing term a d y and η e d multiplying the in line forcing term κ d x q to account for the effects of the plane boundary on the cross flow and in line motions of the cylinder respectively the empirical coefficients η e d and β e d are responsible to modify the response of the cylinder in the in line and cross flow directions respectively similarly to κ and a for the cases of a cylinder vibrating in the absence of a plane boundary in other words if κ and a are remained fixed increasing the values of η and β will generate higher amplitudes of vibration in the in line and cross flow directions respectively similarly decreasing the values of η and β the opposite will occurs i e lower values will be achieved for the vibration of the cylinder in the in line and cross flow directions as occurs in the case of the cylinder vibrating in the absence of a plane boundary the response of vibration in the in line direction will affect the response of vibration in the cross flow direction depending on the mass ratio of the cylinder also to perform an analysis considering that the cylinder is allowed to move only in the cross flow direction the coefficient η should be setted to zero the linear term ω n ω s q is responsible to account for the variation of the vibration frequency of the cylinder in the cross flow direction due to the presence of the plane boundary and ψ similarly to η and β is responsible to modify the response of this vibration frequency in dimensionless form eq 22 becomes 23 q ε q 2 1 q q ψ e d ω n q η e d κ x q β e d a y 3 calibration of the tuning parameters of the model the first to be done is calibrate the tuning parameters of eq 19 these are ε κ and a without consider the influence of the plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder alternatively one can use eq 23 and set the empirical coefficients to ψ 0 η 1 and β 1 which result in eq 19 these tuning parameters needs to be calibrated using experimental data obtained with the cylinder vibrating in the absence of the plane boundary i e the plane boundary do not affect the motion of the cylinder by simulating the eqs 17 19 the tuning parameters ε κ and a of eq 19 were calibrated to fit experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 table 1 shows the hydrodynamic parameters used during the simulations which were also used by qu and metrikine 2020 such parameters are used in all the simulations of the present work even for the cases where the cylinder is placed near of the plane boundary one important observation for the value of s t is that in the work of barbosa et al 2017 it was null for the cases of e d 0 3 also it was seen that the reynolds number have almost no influence on s t for e d 0 3 assuming a nearly constant value of s t 0 2 with a mean value of 0 195 in the present work we assumed that s t 0 2 even for the cases in which e d 0 3 this assumption was also made by barbosa et al 2017 when studying the viv of a cylinder near a plane boundary the parameters of the structural system used by barbosa et al 2017 are presented in table 2 which were also used during all the simulations performed in the present work one important observation to be made is that barbosa et al 2017 do not provided the value of the damping used in their work as the authors used the experimental data from blevins and coughran 2009 which considers a viscous damping of 2 to compared their results in the present work a viscous damping of 2 were assumed as can be seen in table 1 also barbosa et al 2017 considered the same viscous damping when studying the viv of a cylinder near a plane boundary the simulation results are shown in fig 3 along with the experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 the results presented are the cross flow reduced amplitude a y a y d where a y is the vibration amplitude in the cross flow direction the mean drag coefficient c x m e a n and the cross flow reduced frequency ω y ω n where ω y is the frequency of vibration of the cylinder in the cross flow direction all the results are in function of the reduced velocity v r 2 π v ω n d the results shown in fig 3 were obtained by simulating eqs 17 19 eq 19 was used instead of eq 23 based on the experimental results obtained by barbosa et al 2017 that shows that for e d 5 the motion of the cylinder is not affected by the presence of the plane boundary as can be seen in fig 3 a the peak value of vibration in the cross flow direction a y was underestimated by the simulation while in fig 3 b one can see that the peak value of mean drag coefficient was overestimated fig 3 also shows that the reduced velocity where the lock in region begins was underestimated by the model finally analysing fig 3 c it can be seen that the simulated responses are in good agreement with the experimental data the cross flow reduced frequency is well captured by the model i e the frequency follows both the vortex shedding frequency outside the lock in range and the natural frequency of the cylinder onto the lock in range during the calibration process of the parameters we do not find a set of values for the tuning parameters that correctly fitted both the peak value of the cross flow reduced amplitude and the mean drag coefficient within this scenario the tuning parameters were calibrated to fit both the cross flow reduced amplitude and the mean drag coefficient as close as possible without prioritizing one and compromising the other the tuning parameters used in all the simulations of the present work are ε 0 1 a 16 and κ 3 4 calibration of the empirical coefficients of the model the next step is to calibrate the empirical coefficients of eq 23 ψ η and β to account for the effects of the plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder for this purpose the eqs 17 18 and 23 are simulated using the parameters from tables 1 and 2 and the experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 the gap ratios are divided in three groups according to their influence on the amplitude and frequency of vibration of the cylinder this separation was also made by barbosa et al 2017 which provide the means to easily compare the numerical response with the experimental data it was experimentally observed by barbosa et al 2017 that the influence of the boundary on the motion of the cylinder is very small for large gap ratios i e 2 e d 5 fig 4 shows the results of the cross flow reduced amplitude cross flow reduced frequency and mean drag coefficient obtained in the simulations for different reduced velocities v r and the respective experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 from here on the simulations performed in the present work are represented in the plots by a symbol and a solid line whilst the experimental data is represented by symbols only it can be seen from figs 4 a and 4 b that for 3 e d 5 the response of the cylinder do not change with a maximum reduced amplitude of a y 0 9 for e d 2 the maximum reduced amplitude slightly drops to a y 0 85 the same trend is observed for the mean drag coefficient in figs 4 c and 4 d where for 3 e d 5 the peak value of the mean drag coefficient is c x m e a n 3 4 and for e d 2 this value drops to c x m e a n 3 2 on the other hand from figs 4 e and 4 f it can be seen that the cross flow reduced frequency is nearly the same for all this range of gap ratios regarding for v r 8 where a variation occurs in the cross flow reduced frequency for e d 2 this variation do not occurs for 3 e d 5 the model was able to predict the peak values for a y and c x m e a n but does not predict precisely the correct response inside the lock in range thus the cross flow reduced frequency was also not well predicted with a slightly underestimation after the lock in range v r 8 this problem is related to the damping parameter of the model ε in eq 23 when changing this parameter one can see that the initial velocity where the lock in range begins shifts to the right as shown fig 5 a changing the damping parameter ε slightly affects the initial velocity where the lock in begins but it have a great impact in the maximum amplitude of vibration as can be seen in fig 5 a where when varying the damping parameters from 0 1 to 0 9 the maximum amplitude of vibration a y drops from 0 8 to 0 35 to solve this problem one have to increase the values of the tuning parameters a and κ which will increase the maximum amplitude of vibration in both directions the result of this change is shown in fig 5 b where the amplitude of vibration increases as a changes from 16 to 30 and κ changes from 3 to 10 but we also see that this shifted to the left the initial velocity where the lock in range begins and also increased the lock in range when this occur we have to make a compromise between lock in range and maximum amplitude of vibration as in the work of barbosa et al 2017 we also focus here in simulate the trend observed in their experiments that when the cylinder gets closer to the plane boundary its maximum amplitude of vibration decreases and this was well achieved when we observe fig 4 b also we can see that the maximum amplitude of the in line mean drag force coefficient c x m e a n is overestimated by the model again this was a problem observed when we were tuning a and κ and again we made a compromise as the main focus here is to predict the maximum amplitude of vibration in the cross flow direction which is the highest value of amplitude when compared to the vibration in the in line direction we focused on tuning these two parameters to better fit the experimental results provided by barbosa et al 2017 for the maximum amplitude of vibration in the cross flow direction if we tuned a and κ to better fit c x m e a n than a y would be underestimated in the presence of this scenario we considered that a y should be well predicted in deterioration of the in line mean drag force coefficient the same analysis is now conducted for the range of medium gap ratios i e 0 75 e d 1 5 where the vortex shedding at the downstream side of the cylinder starts to be suppressed causing changes in the response of the cylinder fig 6 shows the results of the cross flow reduced amplitude cross flow reduced frequency and mean drag coefficient obtained during the simulations along with the comparison with experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 the model was able to predict the peak amplitude of vibration of the cross flow reduced amplitude in figs 6 a and 6 b for all cases of medium gap ratios the trend of the lock in range was also in good agreement with experimental data the maximum value of the curve c x m e a n vs v r was also well predicted with exception of e d 1 5 whit an underestimation for the maximum value as can be seen in figs 6 c and 6 d moreover for this case of e d 1 5 the reduced frequency of vibration in the cross flow direction was slightly underestimated by the model for v r 9 5 as shows fig 6 e for the range of small gap ratios i e 0 0 e d 0 5 the model take into account the in line vibration of the cylinder but in the experiments performed by barbosa et al 2017 the authors do not provided the mean drag coefficient for the cases of small gap ratios in the experiments the gap ratio was really small and the cylinder occasionally collided with the plane boundary which compromised the signal obtained during the experiments and it was not considered reliable by the authors the empirical coefficients β and ψ can be identified using experimental data as function of e d for the small gap ratios but η that have influence on the in line force term in eq 23 cannot although we can observe using figs 4 d 6 c and 6 d that as the gap ratio decreases the mean drag coefficient c x m e a n also decreases for example from c x m e a n 3 45 for e d 3 to c x m e a n 3 25 for e d 2 in fig 4 d the same trend can be observed in fig 6 c as the gap ratio decreases using this trend obtained by empirical observation based on experimental data we established that η 0 5 will be used for this set of small gap ratios this value was established because for all large and medium gap ratios simulated η was between 0 65 and 1 since for small gap ratios all maximum values of c x m e a n are lower than the values obtained for large and medium gap ratios than η 0 65 as η have influence on the in line force term in eq 23 with this we still have a 2 dof analysis this is very important because as was observed by jauvits and williamson 2004 the in line vibration of the cylinder affects its cross flow vibration in cases which m 6 fig 7 shows the results obtained for the cross flow reduced amplitude cross flow reduced frequency and mean drag coefficient along with the comparison with experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 except for the mean drag coefficient as the cylinder touches the plane boundary the typical motion of the cylinder inside the lock in range is not present in the experimental result because there is no symmetry in the signal obtained for the amplitude of vibration of the cylinder in the cross flow direction i e the values of maximum and minimum amplitudes of vibration are different for this reason only the maximum value of cross flow reduced amplitude was provided by barbosa et al 2017 and that is why only the peak maximum amplitude of vibration in the cross flow direction are significant here as can be seen in figs 7 a 7 c the maximum amplitude of vibration in the cross flow direction was well captured by the model in all cases of small gap ratios although the reduced velocity where it occurs was underestimated by the model for the cases of e d 0 25 which explains a limitation of the model to predict the correct reduced velocity where the peak maximum amplitude of vibration occurs for the cases in which the cylinder touches the plane boundary for the cross flow reduced frequency figs 7 e 7 g shows that the model slightly underestimated its values for e d 0 where the cylinder is initially placed almost touching the boundary and for e d 0 25 although no experimental data is available for the mean drag coefficient the model showed to predict good results for all the other two ranges of gap ratios simulated demonstrating its efficiency moreover we found that it is relevant to show these results as to the best of our knowledge a new information for the design of offshore structures in which depending on the scour of the seabed the structure could collide with the boundary and this in line data presented would play a important role during the design process the most valuable information presented in figs 7 d is the inverse trend observed for c x m e a n when compare to the cases of large and medium gap ratios as can be seen in figs 4 c 4 d 6 c and 6 d where the maximum value decreases as the gap ratio decreases for e d 0 25 where the cylinder occasionally touches the boundary during the vibration it presents the opposite trend where the maximum value of c x m e a n increases as the gap ratio decreases for e d 0 5 where the cylinder do not touched the boundary during the experiments from barbosa et al 2017 the maximum value of c x m e a n is about 3 which is a slightly higher value when compare to value for e d 0 75 in fig 6 d when e d 0 25 this value presents an abrupt increase reaching a peak value of four in general the model achieved good results when compared to experimental data for the maximum amplitude in the cross flow direction although the lock in range was not well predicted with an underestimated value of its initial velocity this problem was also found by barbosa et al 2017 in their attempt to generate a model to predict viv of a rigid cylinder near a plane boundary as we mentioned before we believe that this problem is related to the tuning parameters of the model i e a ε and κ as was mentioned before the empirical coefficients β η and ψ were set for each gap ratio simulated and calibrated with experimental data after it using the least mean square method the curves that better fitted the spread data for each empirical coefficient were determined also using the least mean square method the equations to calculate each empirical coefficient as function of the gap ratio were found the curves obtained are presented in fig 8 the curves of ψ for large gap ratios 2 e d 5 medium gap ratios 0 75 e d 1 5 and η for small gap ratios 0 0 e d 0 5 are constants and equals to 0 0 5 and 0 5 respectively this is due to the fact that for large gap ratios 2 e d 5 experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 did not shown any significant changes in the cross flow frequency of the cylinder within this range and as ψ is the empirical coefficient that account for the variations in the cross flow frequency in eq 23 it was set to zero also during calibration process the same experimental data showed that for medium gap ratios 0 75 e d 1 5 ψ 0 5 was the best value founded by us to fit experimental data through this range for the cases of 0 0 e d 0 5 no experimental data was available to tune empirical coefficient η in the presence of this scenario we considered the trend of c x m e a n observed in figs 4 d 6 c and 6 d that as the gap ratio decreases the mean drag coefficient c x m e a n also decreases as already mentioned as η is the empirical coefficient that account for the variations in the in line motion of the cylinder in eq 23 we established that η 0 5 will be used for this set of small gap ratios this value was established because for all large and medium gap ratios simulated 0 65 η 1 since for small gap ratios all maximum values of c x m e a n are lower than the values obtained for large and medium gap ratios than η 0 65 as mentioned before this allows that eq 23 remains a 2 dof equation with this we can calibrate β and ψ for this range of gap ratios using experimental data from barbosa et al 2017 the equations used to obtain each curve from fig 8 are listed in table 3 the value of ψ 0 for large gap ratios is used to neglect the effects of the plane boundary on the cross flow reduced frequency of the cylinder which is observed analysing figs 4 e and 4 f and remembering that it was assumed that the plane boundary have no influence on the motion of the cylinder in the in line direction for small gap ratios η 1 for this case 5 discussions in the present work the response of a cylinder placed near a plane boundary was simulated using a new wake oscillator model with 2 dof where empirical coefficients were added to account for the effects of the plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder as contribution the coupled dynamic between the in line and cross flow vibrations is considered along with the behaviour of the mean drag coefficient for small gap ratios although no experimental data is available to validate the simulated results of mean drag coefficient for small gap ratios the model showed to be consistent with the experiment of barbosa et al 2017 for the cases of medium and large gap ratios with a good prediction of the maximum amplitude of vibration in the cross flow direction the authors considered that this new information concerning the behaviour of the mean drag coefficient will have a remarkable impact in the state of art in viv since for the cases of offshore pipelines that are placed on the seabed with low mass ratios where is known that the influence of the in line vibration on the cross flow vibration could not be neglected a 2 dof wake oscillator model is necessary to achieve better results when predicting viv of a rigid cylinder elastically mounted moreover for small gap ratios where collisions with the seabed may occur it is necessary to predict the contact force for the study of fatigue and this is the contribution of the present model as its provide the energy transferred to the seabed during the impact one new information in the present model is the equations to calculate the empirical coefficients as function of the gap ratios as these equations do not depend on the mass and damping ratios of the cylinder it could be use for any cases it is important to clarify that for different values of mass and damping ratios the appropriate procedure is to first calibrate the tuning parameters of the model with experimental data of a cylinder vibrating in the absence of a plane boundary and then calculate each empirical coefficient using the equations from table 3 the main focus of this work was to simulate the trend observed by roshko et al 1975 that an attractive force appears on the cylinder as its gets closer to the plane boundary this force tends to increase as the gap ratio decrease this trend was well observed during simulations on the plane boundary as the cylinder gets closer to it a repulsive force appears in opposite direction compared to the motion of the cylinder when this repulsive force increases the maximum amplitude of vibration of the cylinder decreases as can be observed in figs 4 a 4 b 6 a and 6 b when the cylinder touches the boundary this force changes direction now becoming an attractive force in figs 7 a 7 c this trend is clearly visible with the maximum amplitudes of vibration for e d 0 and e d 0 25 the cases where the cylinder touched the boundary being higher than for the case for e d 0 50 where the cylinder do not touched the boundary the same trend is observed for the case in which two cylinders are arranged side by side where this force appears in each one of the cylinders and also increases as the gap between one cylinder to another decreases as for the case of a cylinder near a plane boundary when these cylinders collides these forces also change its directions and become repulsive forces this is the situation where cylinders are mounted near each other are of great importance in many engineering applications such as tubes inside heat exchangers power cable lines risers etc and a similar analysis could be conducted to generate a wake oscillator model to predict the response of the cylinder in these situations 6 conclusions the present work had as principal goal to propose a new wake oscillator model with 2 dof to predict viv of a cylinder near a plane boundary in general the model was able to capture the main characteristics of viv of cylinders near a plane boundary with m 5 5 and ζ 0 02 the empirical coefficients β η and ψ to account for the effects of the plane boundary on the motion of the cylinder were obtained by polynomial regression this allowed the equations to calculate the empirical coefficients as function of the gap ratio to be of any order and not only of order one which is an advantage when compare to the model of jin and dong 2016 that considered that the empirical coefficients varies linearly with the gap ratio although the empirical coefficients of the present work was considered to vary only with the gap ratio e d for a case in which one would like to simulate the model for a different mass or damping ratios it will be necessary to first set the tuning parameters from eq 23 ε κ and a for e d 5 and then use the empirical coefficients presented in this work moreover the model developed is only capable to predict viv of a circular cylinder with the same mass and damping ratios in both in line and cross flow directions when new experimental data with different gap ratios become available it will be possible to refine the equations for the empirical coefficients this will result in more precise model s responses for m 5 5 and ζ 0 02 an important knowledge in the design of offshore structures near the seabed credit authorship contribution statement rafael fehér conceptualization methodology software validation formal

20537,the investigation of buckle propagation in subsea pipelines has been the subject of several works in the past few decades it was shown that the external pressure required to develop the initial local buckle on the pipe is considerably more than the pressure required to propagate the initiated buckle along the pipe in this respect a relevant phenomenon may be framed for a pipe that is subject to a substantial lateral interference load where the load induces plastic damage on the pipe and incites the progression of damage along the pipe as such the present work assesses the pipe s load carrying capacity during the progression of plastic damage using a novel test apparatus in addition using the finite element method an application of damage progression effect is examined on a pipe subject to subsequent fishing gear impacts the physical tests and numerical studies show that the load carrying capacity of a pipe may drop significantly i e 33 5 as reported in test 1 due to the damage progression effect in conclusion the findings of the present work show that disregarding the damage progression effect in the assessment of pipelines could lead to a significant underestimation of the load carrying capacity of the pipes keywords subsea pipeline damage progression buckle propagation trawl interference dnv rp f111 1 introduction the propagation of local buckle on a subsea pipeline has been the subject of several studies in the past few decades i e hahn et al 1993 kyriakides 1994 liang et al 2019 where the buckle propagation refers to the longitudinal propagation of the local buckle plastic damage along the subsea pipeline due to the external pressure in this regard it was shown that the pressure required to buckle a pipeline is more than the pressure needed to propagate the buckle i e chater and hutchinson 1984 therefore pipelines have more structural resistance against the development of the initial plastic damage compared to the propagation of the initiated damage along the pipe this provides a framework for a relevant phenomenon where the pipe is subject to a lateral load by a third party i e bottom fishing gear which applies plastic damage to the pipe and translates and induces the imposed damage along the pipe the goal of the present thesis is to address this phenomenon in swp and pip systems according to recent studies on a pipe under a lateral indentation i e davaripour et al 2020b davaripour and quinton 2018 the plastic capacity of a pipe could decrease significantly when the initiated plastic damage on the pipe progresses along the pipe in other words the lateral load required to develop the initial plastic damage on a pipe could be significantly more than the sliding load required to translate and induce the plastic damage with the same size along the pipe the plastic capacity of a pipe refers to the load carrying capacity or structural resistance of the pipe where the load imposes plastic damage to the pipe this capacity is measured in the present work according to the dent size imposed on the pipe in the load controlled condition or the perpendicular load withstood by the pipe in the displacement controlled condition accordingly novel physical apparatus is employed in the present study to validate and further investigate the damage progression along a pipeline which is imposed by a non rupture type interference load trawl board impact in this work the trawl impact is the first phase during trawl gear interference with a subsea pipeline prior to pullover phase and lasts for some hundredth of a second dnv rp f111 2014 the trawl board is used in otter trawl types to keep the net open during the trawling dnv rp f111 2014 1 1 literature review the topic of a pipe subject to a perpendicular impact has been investigated by several studies in the past decades ellinas and walker 1983 developed a semi empirical model by employing the test results of thomas et al 1976 the authors assumed that the pipe response during the indentation could be idealized into the separate phases of purely local deformation and the global deformation with some additional local response however from the very beginning of the indentation the pipe response involves the combination of both local and global deformation where the local deformation increases with a higher growth rate at the beginning of the indentation then due to the change in the cross section of the pipe the bending stiffness decreases which leads to more global rather than local deformation zheng et al 2012 furthermore soreide and amdahl 1982 studied the clamped pipe without axial restraint subject to transverse indentation under quasi static and impact conditions this boundary condition arrangement considers both local and global deformation of the pipe which is a suitable idealization for a subsea pipeline alexander 2007 examined several impact events on a 12 inch pipe and presented a classification of major damages in a pipe however the reported velocity of impact in his work 13 m s is significantly greater than the one in common impact events imposed on the pipeline system from the trawling activity 2 6 m s jones and birch 1996 performed 54 impact tests on a pipe with a fully clamped boundary condition using different ranges of impact energy and internal pressure the authors presented different failure modes of a pipe subject to a wedge shaped indenter ng and shen 2006 incorporated the foundation support in the test setup and concluded that the failure threshold of a pipe could change when considering the circumferential stress developed due to the pipe foundation interaction however the trawl impact occurs along the seabed and the pipe soil interaction is insignificant in addition to perpendicular indentation there are interference events where the imposed damage could progress along the pipe such as a subsea pipeline subject to a non perpendicular trawl impact davaripour et al 2020b or under repeated perpendicular trawl impacts at adjacent locations the latter case is within the scope of the present study in these scenarios the structural response of the pipe is path dependent where path dependency refers to the effects of the plastic deformation imposed on the pipe at the previous time increment on the current response of the pipe in this regard several studies have been conducted on the path dependent behaviour of a structure subject to a moving load parkes 1958 presented a solution for the plastic response of a massless rigid plastic beam under a traveling mass symonds and neal 1960 extended the study of parkes 1958 using the mass included rigid plastic beam toridis and wen 1966 did an analytical investigation on the dynamic response of an elasto plastic beam under a moving load they proposed a solution for a discrete beam with massless rigid panels connected by joints with a point mass frýba 1999 reviewed and presented analytical solutions for multiple examples of simple moving load scenarios the author provided an analytical solution for a rigid plastic beam with a stationary hinge in the middle subject to a concentrated load translating along the beam quinton 2015 2008 investigated the collision of a hull structure with sliding ice loads and showed a reduction in the structural resistance of the plate when the non rupture type load slides along the plate versus when it is only perpendicular to the plate the investigation of this reduction in cylindrical structures is the main focus of the present study and termed as the damage progression dp effect throughout this paper davaripour and quinton 2018 numerically examined the dp effect in pipes they showed that for a pipe subject to a moving indentation the dp effect only occurs if the load applies plastic damage to the pipe they concluded that the lesser resistance of the pipe on the trailing side of the sliding load compared to the leading side is the main source of the dp effect the trailing side is the part of the pipe behind the sliding load and the leading side is the part ahead of the sliding load the authors showed that the dp effect grows when the extent of plastic damage which is translated along the pipe increases davaripour et al 2020b used finite element analyses to examine an application of the dp effect for subsea pipelines where the pipe is subject to a diagonal trawl impact in this scenario the tangential component of the trawl impact pushes the resulting plastic damage along the pipe the authors showed that due to the dp effect the resulting dent depth on a 5 inches pipe under a diagonal trawl impact with 30 angle is up to 20 higher compared to the case where only the normal component of the trawl impact was applied to the pipe the tangential component of diagonal trawl impacts are commonly disregarded in overtrawlability assessments of pipelines davaripour et al 2020b dnv rp f111 2014 states that the subsequent trawl pullover load and the resulting accumulation of plastic strain should be considered in the overtrawlability assessment of pipelines the number of subsequent interactions is dependent on the trawl frequency in the field however if no specific data is available dnv rp f111 2014 recommends considering the effect of four subsequent pullover loads at the same location likewise the subsequent initial trawl impact should be examined where applicable also parametric studies of the scenario where a pipe is subject to repeated trawl impacts should be assessed in this regard if the repeated impacts occur at neighbouring locations on a pipe it can lead to the progression of damage as reported by davaripour and quinton 2018 due to the dp effect the structural resistance of a pipe could drop significantly as the resulting plastic damage travels along the pipe as such in the present study the case of a pipe subject to repeated indentations at adjacent locations is numerically examined which is an application of the dp effect on subsea pipelines shen and jones 1991 proposed an alternative quasi static approach to replicate the dynamic effect of a rigid perfectly plastic clamped beam struck transversely by an indenter the authors stated that where the indenter is heavy and moves at a relatively low speed the predicted energy absorbed by the structure using the quasi static analysis is similar to the one in the real problem furthermore zheng 2014 did a series of experimental and numerical investigations on pipes subject to transverse indentations and concluded that quasi static conditions could be employed for trawling impact problems as such the quasi static experimental and numerical works presented in the present paper are representatives of actual trawl gear interference with subsea pipelines the topic of the dp effect in subsea pipelines is a novel topic in this regard davaripour et al 2020c provided a physical test under the quasi static and load controlled condition the present work extends the physical findings of davaripour et al 2020c by presenting high quality data regarding additional three physical tests furthermore a numerical model is developed and verified against one of the physical tests which is then employed to examine the pipe s response under repeated quasi static indentations at adjacent locations these analyses represent an idealization of a subsea pipeline subject to repeated trawl impacts at adjoining locations notes on the research scope the main objective of the present study is to provide evidence regarding the effect of damage progression on the plastic capacity of a pipeline furthermore the present study introduces and investigates a novel application of the dp effect in the event of trawl gear interference with subsea pipelines in this regard while the recommendations of dnv rp f111 were incorporated in the methodologies of the present work the test setup as well as the numerical model do not fully represent a scenario of a trawl interference event with a subsea pipeline however the following points justify the validity of the approach employed in the present work for both physical test setup and numerical model the dynamic effect of a trawl impact scenario could be replicated by an equivalent quasi static analysis as reported in shen and jones 1991 and then examined by zheng et al 2013 for the case of a trawl interference with a pipeline as such the physical tests as well as numerical studies are conducted under the quasi static condition the direction of the trawl impact is parallel to the seabed therefore the pipe soil interaction is negligible during the trawl interference event zheng et al 2012 as such the pipe soil interaction is not incorporated in the physical test as well as numerical studies the initial phase of the trawl impact which is the focus of the present scope occurs in some hundredths of a second dnv rp f111 2014 and hence the global deformation of the pipe is negligible and could be disregarded therefore in three out of four physical tests as well as the numerical models the lateral deformation of the pipe is restrained furthermore the physical tests in the present study employ a two phase loading condition to investigate the pipe s response where in phase 1 the pipe is subject to a perpendicular indentation and in phase 2 the resulting damage in phase 1 translates and induces along the pipe in this regard the first phase partially represents the fishing gear impact on a subsea pipeline considering the above mentioned points however the second phase employed only to highlight the effect of damage progression on the load carrying capacity of the pipe and may not represent any particular scenario in the pipeline industry 2 experimental investigation as there are no previous experiments at laboratory scale or otherwise on the subject of the dp effect on cylindrical structures a novel experimental apparatus was used to explore this effect 3 methodology 3 1 test apparatus fig 1 shows an overall view of the test apparatus that was employed to perform the laboratory tests the apparatus was originally devised by quinton 2015 to examine the structural behaviour of plates and stiffened plates subject to sliding loads the apparatus was modified for the present study to investigate the behaviour of hollow cylindrical structures subject to sliding rigid indentations the vertical load path in the test apparatus fig 2 involves the mts test frame which provides the maximum vertical force of 500 kn via the hydraulic ram the mts test frame is a self reacting frame that could apply a precise load to conduct a uniaxial material test the vertical ram pushes the cylindrical indenter against the test specimen which is bolted to the carriage the load path will end with the mts test frame s crossheads the horizontal load path refers to the direction along the long edge of the carriage which is shown in fig 3 the load path starts with the horizontally oriented hydraulic ram which provides the maximum load of 225 kn the ram is connected to a base plate from the left side and to the carriage from the right side and pushes the carriage to translate along the rail as the horizontal load starts from the contact between the indenter and the pipe the horizontal load is transferred from the carriage to the pipe and the indenter the load is then transferred to the horizontal load cell via the swing arm 3 2 test setup the modifications to the test apparatus were designed to provide a test setup incorporating the recommendations of dnv rp f11 2014 fig 4 shows an overall view of the test setup bolted to the carriage including isotropic view a x view b and y view c the test setup comprises three main components including the cylindrical specimen the saddle shaped support and the mounts the cylindrical test specimen i e pipe has an outer diameter of 5 inch schedule 40 the mechanical properties of the pipe were obtained from standard tensile tests astme8 e8m 13 2013 fig 5 shows the stress strain curve averaged from the tensile tests and table 1 summarizes the physical and mechanical properties of the pipe the total length of the specimen between the pins is 1200 mm and the deformable part between the end flanges is 965 2 mm long fig 6 the end flanges as well as hinges are considered relatively rigid in comparison to the cylindrical part in the middle the saddle shaped support is shown in fig 7 it is designed to restrain the global deformation of the specimen it comprises an 863 6 mm 34 inch long plate with a width equal to that of the support carriage and 25 4 mm 1 inch thickness the plate is cut in the center to 70 65 mm radius matching the pipe radius the final curved shape in the center of the plate provides 60 circumferential area for the interaction with the specimen as recommended by dnv rp f11 2014 the saddle shaped support is connected to the carriage via bolts along the two long edges of the plate as well as the i beam welded to the plate and rests against the inside top of the carriage fig 8 fig 9 shows the mounts which are devised to connect the ends of the specimen to the carriage via the key stock and bolts the mounts are made of high strength steel astm 514 with a yield strength of 779 mpa and ultimate strength of 827 mpa as reported in the mill material certification 3 3 indenter the indenter is a solid shaft made of medium tensile strength steel c1035 with a radius of 25 mm representing a trawl door according to dnv rp f11 2014 the leading edge of the indenter is used for the tests with the length of 203 mm for the frictionless indenter fig 10 a and the length of 187 mm for the friction included indenter fig 10 b for the frictionless type the sliding friction between the indenter and the specimen is eliminated using a rolling indenter mounted on two pillow block bearings as well as using lubrication at the region of contact 3 4 boundary conditions two boundary conditions bc were examined during the tests fig 11 including bc 1 where the global deformation of the pipe is restricted using the saddle shaped support and bc 2 where the global and local deformation of the pipe is allowed i e the saddle shaped support is removed from the test setup 3 5 instrumentation the mts test frame data acquisition system as well as laser scanning technologies and imaging technologies were employed during the test to record a the vertical and horizontal force applied by the indenter to the specimen b the vertical displacement of the indenter c the horizontal displacement of the indenter relative to the specimen d the side view of the cylindrical specimen during the indentation e the spatial position of the deformed specimen after the test 3 6 test procedure all tests are performed under the quasi static condition and contain two phases 1 phase 1 fig 12 a where the horizontal hydraulic ram is held steady and the vertical hydraulic ram pushes the indenter against the specimen accordingly in the load controlled test the vertical ram applies 150 kn to the specimen through the indenter with a rate equal to 3 kn s also in the displacement controlled test the vertical hydraulic ram moves the indenter by 35 or 75 mm against the specimen with a rate equal to 1 0 mm s 2 phase 2 fig 12 b where the horizontal hydraulic ram starts to push the carriage along the rail for 300 mm in a displacement controlled condition 1 mm s accordingly where phase 1 is in the displacement controlled condition the vertical position of the hydraulic ram remains steady also where phase 1 is in the load controlled condition the 150 kn vertical load applied by the hydraulic ram remains steady fig 13 shows the deformed cylindrical specimen prior to the indentation a at the end of phase 1 b and at the end of phase 2 c 3 7 test matrix as presented in table 2 four laboratory tests are conducted to investigate the dp effect in a pipeline the vertical indentation load values in table 2 refer to the displacement of the indenter and the load applied by the indenter during phase 1 respectively 4 results and discussion in this section the data recorded during the physical tests are provided in this regard it is worth noting that the results of the first phase of test 1 were partially provided in an article by the authors davaripour et al 2020a furthermore the results of test 3 were partially presented in another article by the authors davaripour et al 2020c however the majority of the physical test results are provided herein 4 1 test 1 bc 1 fi dc dc test 1 was performed to investigate the effect of friction on the dp effect fig 14 shows the deformed shape of the specimen after the test also fig 15 shows the vertical displacement of the indenter or resulting dent depth on the specimen versus time as well as the vertical load resisted by the specimen against the imposed indentation versus time as shown in the figure during phase 1 the vertical indentation increases and reaches to 35 mm consequently the vertical load resisted by the specimen against the imposed indentation increases and reaches to 221 kn during phase 2 while the vertical position of the indenter i e the dent depth imposed on the specimen remains constant the vertical resistance in the pipe decreases up to 33 5 the significant drop occurs upon the initiation of phase 2 and promptly reaches the steady state condition at 146 5 kn then close to the end of phase 2 the vertical resistance of the specimen slightly increases as the indenter approaches the end boundary condition fig 16 shows the horizontal load resisted by the specimen as well as the resultant load during the test the horizontal direction refers to the direction along the carriage s motion path 4 2 test 2 bc 1 fl dc dc test 2 was conducted using the frictionless indenter to provide test data to be compared against the results obtained from test 1 this comparison is employed to assess the effect of friction on the dp effect in pipelines fig 17 shows the deformed shape of the cylindrical specimen where a fig 17 a shows the initiation and direction of the moving load during phase 2 b fig 17 b shows the test setup after the experiment is conducted c fig 17 c shows the laser scanned isotropic view of a section cut of the deformed specimen d fig 17 d shows the y z elevation view of the laser scanned pipe the indentation was applied uniformly during phase 2 however the dent depth is not fully consistent along the pipe which is due to the path dependent behaviour of the pipe during phase 2 in other words the plastic deformation in any location of the pipe was affected by the indentation imposed on the pipe at adjacent locations in next time increments e fig 17 e shows the x z view of a section cut of the scanned pipe fig 18 shows the vertical displacement of the indenter or resulting dent depth on the specimen versus time as well as the vertical load resisted by the specimen against the imposed indentation versus time as shown in the figure during phase 1 the vertical indentation increases and reaches 35 mm consequently the vertical load resisted by the specimen against the imposed indentation increases and reaches 215 kn during phase 2 while the vertical position of the indenter remains constant the vertical resistance in the pipe decreases up to 32 this significant drop occurs upon the initiation of phase 2 and promptly reaches the steady state condition at 146 kn then close to the end of phase 2 the vertical resistance of the specimen slightly increases as the indenter approaches the end boundary condition also fig 19 shows the horizontal load as well as the resultant load resisted by the specimen during the test 4 3 comparison test 1 and 2 fig 20 shows that the vertical load resisted by the specimen in test 2 is nearly identical to the one in test 1 demonstrating that at least for experimental conditions of the present study the effect of sliding friction on pipe s vertical structural resistance is insignificant in other words the dp effect is not dependent on the sliding friction considering the present test condition however the horizontal load resisted by the specimen in test 2 is significantly lower than the one in test 1 fig 20 which is due to the effect of sliding friction between the specimen and the fi indenter in test 1 as such as shown in fig 21 the resultant load resisted during test 2 is significantly less than the one in test 1 the test setup in test 1 versus test 2 is the same except in test 1 the friction included indenter was employed while in test 2 the frictionless indenter was used as such the higher horizontal load in test 1 versus test 2 fig 20 is due to the sliding friction between the indenter and the specimen in test 1 in this regard the friction coefficient between the friction included indenter and the specimen could be derived from the difference between the horizontal load in test 1 and 2 over the vertical load in test 1 the imposed indentation in both tests is the same and equal to 35 mm fig 22 shows the load difference the vertical load in test 1 and the variation of the friction coefficient between the indenter and specimen during test 1 the average friction coefficient where the curve reaches steady state condition is equal to 0 26 0 3 4 4 test 3 bc 1 fl lc dc test 3 was performed to investigate the dp effect in cylindrical specimens under the load controlled condition fig 23 shows the vertical load applied by the indenter against the specimen versus time as well as the vertical displacement of the indenter or the resulting dent depth imposed on the specimen versus time as shown in the figure during phase 1 the applied load increases to 150 kn consequently the dent depth imposed on the specimen increases to 20 7 mm during phase 2 while the vertical load almost remains constant the imposed dent depth on the specimen increases up to 52 and reaches 32 mm this demonstrates the need to consider the dp effect for the assessment of impact scenarios on subsea pipelines where denting limit states and its associated design criteria may be governing also fig 23 shows that during phase 2 while the mts control software held the 150 kn force as measured by the vertical ram s load cell the actual vertical load drops slightly 4 due to the generated moment along the swing arm as discussed in appendix this is an unavoidable experimental error as the mts software control is based only on the vertical ram force and there is no way to compensate for the difference resulting from the swingarm moment this implies that if the imposed vertical load was remained perfectly constant at 150 kn instead of slightly decreasing then the increase in the imposed dent depth could be even larger than 52 also fig 24 shows the horizontal load resisted by the specimen during the test 4 5 test 4 bc 2 fl dc dc test 4 was performed to assess the potential mitigating effects of bending response in cylindrical specimens on the dp effect fig 25 shows the deformed shape of the cylindrical specimen as shown in the figure the saddle shaped support is removed and the specimen has both local and global deformation fig 26 shows the scanned views of the deformed cylindrical specimen where a fig 26 a shows an isotropic view of the specimen b fig 26 b shows the x z view of a specimen c fig 26 c shows the y z elevation view of the pipe with the dimensions of two regions highlighted including where the pipe is 1 intact by the indentation after the test 2 the dent size on the specimen reaches the steady state condition fig 27 shows the vertical load resisted by the specimen versus time as well as the vertical displacement of the indenter versus time as shown in the figure during phase 1 the displacement of the indenter increases to 75 mm consequently the load withstood by the pipe increases to 157 kn during phase 2 while the vertical position of the indenter remains constant the structural resistance of the pipe decreases up to 12 the maximum drop occurs upon the initiation of phase 2 and promptly reaches the steady state condition at 138 kn then the pipe response increases as the indenter approaches the end boundary condition also fig 28 shows the horizontal load as well as the resultant load resisted by the specimen during the test fig 29 shows the vertical displacement of the specimen in the middle at the top and bottom points of the cross section during the 75 mm indentation phase 1 of loading fig 29 also shows the difference between these curves which is the resulting dent depth imposed on the pipe at the region of indentation 4 6 comparison test 2 and 4 according to the results obtained in test 2 and 4 the dp effect in test 4 12 is significantly less than the effect observed in test 2 32 the size of the dent imposed on the pipes is relatively similar in test 2 and 4 35 mm in test 2 and 40 6 mm in test 4 as such the bending response of the pipe has mitigating effects on the dp effect in pipelines fig 30 shows the vertical load resisted by the specimen in test 4 versus test 2 5 numerical investigations a numerical investigation is conducted using abaqus explicit to examine a scenario of a subsea pipeline subject to subsequent trawl impacts the finite element method is employed to show the dp effect when a pipe is indented by repeated trawl impacts at neighbouring locations the subsequent indentation of a pipe at adjoining locations leads to the progression of plastic damage along the pipe this novel scenario examines the statement of dnv rp f11 2014 that repeated impacts at same locations need to be considered reflecting the trawling frequency the idealized numerical model is built according to dnv rp f11 2014 and validated against the results of test 3 furthermore in order to computationally enhance the numerical analyses the semi automatic mass scaling in abaqus is implemented in the numerical model using scale factor of 1000 5 1 element type the specimen is modelled with reduced integration shell elements s4r with aspect ratio equal to 1 and edge length equal to 3 mm the cylindrical indenter and the saddle shaped support are modelled with rigidly constrained solid elements 5 2 load path test 3 is performed in two phases including a phase 1 where the indenter imposes 150 kn load via the cylindrical indenter against the specimen in the load controlled condition b phase 2 where the 150 kn imposed load remains nearly constant 4 reduction and the indenter translates along the pipe for 300 mm fig 31 shows the load path during phase 1 and 2 5 3 boundary conditions the boundary conditions implemented in the test setup include the 1 inch saddle shape support which restrains the global deformation of the specimen and the mounts at both ends which restrain the axial deformation of the specimen these boundary conditions are schematically shown in fig 32 furthermore considering the groove welding between the two end edges of the specimen and the flange plates fig 6 the length of the specimen s deformable region in fig 6 is set to 940 mm and the rest of the specimen s length is rigidly constrained quinton 2015 used a similar test apparatus and reported a vertical elastic deformation in the apparatus during the applied indentation the author performed sensitivity studies and concluded that the elastic stiffness is within the range of 1e7 to 2 5e7 n mm in the present study for the interaction between the saddle shaped support and the specimen the elastic pressure overclosure behaviour is employed with the spring stiffness set to 0 5e7 n mm based on sensitivity analyses this value is slightly less than the values reported by quinton 2015 due to the modifications which are applied to the test apparatus in the present work furthermore additional finite element analyses are conducted to obtain the stiffness of the mounts fig 33 where for the boundary conditions a at the location of the key stock the nodes are restrained along the x axis and b at the location of the bolts nodes are restrained in all degrees of freedom furthermore the tied nodes are rigidly constrained and pulled by 20 mm in the opposite direction of the x axis the mount is modelled using the reduced integration solid elements c3d8r with the deformed shape presented in fig 33 b fig 34 shows the load displacement curve from which the stiffness of the mounts could be obtained in this regard axial connectors as presented in abaqus documentation 2019 at both ends of the pipe are used to represent the stiffness provided by the mounts fig 35 5 4 interaction properties the numerical model comprises two interactions including the contact between the indenter and the specimen and the contact between the specimen and the saddle shaped support fig 35 for the first contact definition the sliding friction coefficient is assumed 0 due to using the frictionless indenter for the latter one interaction according to the test setup there is nearly no relative displacement between the specimen and the support in this regard sensitivity studies are performed using finite element analyses section 3 6 1 which shows that the sliding friction coefficient between the specimen and the saddle shaped support does not affect the pipe s response as such a reasonable friction coefficient of 0 3 is employed for analyses in the present study 5 5 mesh convergence analysis mesh convergence analyses are conducted to determine the shell element size in the specimen fig 36 shows the result of the analyses for three mesh sizes including 3 5 and 6 mm as shown in the figure the results of all three cases are very similar particularly for the maximum vertical displacement of the indenter the mesh size equal to 3 mm is used for the analyses 6 results fig 37 shows a good agreement between the numerical outcome and the physical data during phase 1 the numerical result is perfectly aligned with the test data during phase 2 the numerical prediction slightly underestimates the physical data in the second half of the phase this discrepancy could be sourced in the simplification and idealization of the boundary conditions in the numerical model 6 1 sensitivity study a sensitivity study is conducted using finite element analysis to examine the effect of the friction coefficient between the specimen and the saddle shaped support on the pipe s response accordingly fig 38 presents the dent depth of the specimen under varied friction coefficients 0 0 0 3 and 0 5 and shows the dent depth of the specimen is not affected by the value of the friction coefficient 6 2 repeated trawl impacts dnv rp f111 2014 states that repeated impacts at same locations need to be considered reflecting the trawling frequency however if the subsequent impacts are imposed at neighbouring locations on the pipe it could lead to the damage progression along the pipe in other words if a pipe is indented at locations that are sufficiently close to each other the resulting plastic damage on the pipe translates longitudinally as if the load is sliding along the pipe in this regard a novel scenario is introduced and studied where a cylindrical specimen is subject to several identical quasi static perpendicular indentations at adjoining locations in total 11 adjacent indentations 15 mm away from each other are applied to the pipe using the verified numerical model introduced in section 3 fig 39 shows schematic views for 3 out of 11 indentations along the specimen each indentation imposes a 150 kn on the pipe in the load controlled condition fig 40 shows the deformed shape of the specimen after 11 adjacent indentations as shown in the figure after each indentation the imposed damage on the specimen progresses longitudinally the length of the dent reaches 150 mm after the final indentation furthermore by the progression of the imposed damage the dent depth increases until it reaches a steady state value fig 41 shows the maximum vertical displacement of the indenter along the pipe after each indentation each data marker represents one indentation the results of test 3 are also provided for comparison as shown in fig 41 the damage size in the specimen increases from 21 mm to 29 mm 38 2 increase until it reaches a steady state condition furthermore comparing the numerical results against the physical data of test 3 fig 41 shows a good overall agreement however the specimen under the repeated indentations leads to less dp effect in the present numerical investigation repeated trawl impact on a subsea pipeline is examined under the quasi static load controlled condition as accordingly to shen and jones 1991 and zheng 2014 dynamic effect of the trawl interference event could be replicated using quasi static analyses as a result of this numerical study it is shown that the load carrying capacity of a pipe decreases as the plastic damage progresses longitudinally under repeated identical quasi static indentations at adjacent locations these results show that considering the subsequent trawl impact at adjoining locations on a pipe could lead to more dent depth compared to a case where the pipe is subject to repeated trawl impacts at the same location as recommended by dnv rp f111 2014 subsequent identical quasi static indentations at the same location on a pipe does not change the resulting dent depth imposed after the first indentation this is a clear application of the dp effect in the offshore pipeline industry 6 3 equivalent stress contour fig 42 shows the side views of the pipe subject to repeated indentations and demonstrates the plastic stress contour in the range of yield stress to ultimate stress table 1 accordingly for the pipe under the first indentation there is the symmetrical distribution of stress contour however for the pipe under the third indentation 30 mm away from the first one the trailing side of the pipe does not have a significant contribution compared to the leading side where the trailing side is a portion of pipe behind the indenter and the leading side is the potion of the pipe ahead of the indenter the progression of damage along the pipe involves high geometric material and bc nonlinearities in this respect the following assumptions are made to understand the source of this considerable change in the pipe s stress contour under the first versus the third indentation the pipe s stiffness against the lateral indentation involves longitudinal bending and stretching stiffness as well as circumferential bending and membrane stiffness according to findings of the work conducted by hahn et al 1993 which employed the analytical method to investigate local buckle and buckle propagation in the subsea pipeline under external pressure the first stiffness is negligible compared to the latter one in this regard considering the similar cross sectional deformation of a pipe subject to external pressure and lateral indentation it could be assumed that the pipe s response during the lateral indentation is also controlled by the circumferential bending and membrane stiffness as such pipe s plastic capacity under repeated adjacent indentations could be simplified and investigated by the load carrying capacity of a ring subject to a lateral indentation hahn et al 1993 developed an analytical equation to predict the external pressure required to develop radial displacement on a ring for both before and after the buckling the authors showed that for thin walled pipes for example the pipe of the present study with d t 20 if p pe equation 1 the ring experiences elastic buckling and becomes unstable under bending actions in this regard the ring action under the lateral indentation is examined using the modified version of the numerical model presented in fig 43 where the pipe s length decreased to 1 cm fig 43 shows the numerical model as well as the plastic equivalent stress contour on the ring after 35 mm indentation also fig 44 shows the load displacement curve during the indentation which demonstrates that by the formation of plastic hinges on the ring the ring no longer withstands any additional lateral load this finding is in agreement with the results of hahn et al 1993 regarding the post buckling behaviour of a ring under external pressure however according to the findings of hahn et al 1993 after the elastic buckling of the ring even by a reduction of the external pressure the ring could be crushed however the load carrying capacity of the ring after the formation of plastic hinges remains constant equation 1 p e 2 e 1 t d 3 where e 1 is the elastic modulus for the pipe d and t are the outer diameter and nominal thickness of the ring respectively according to the above points after the initial plastic damage on the pipe for the following indentations i e third indentation the trailing side of the pipe has already buckled according to the above findings regarding the post bucking behaviour of a ring under a lateral indentation the distribution of stress along the trailing side of the pipe is not fully possible as the pipe in the buckled regions is unable to pass more than 3 kn per 1 cm length as presented in fig 44 as such the buckled region on the trailing side of the pipe acts as a weak link therefore the structural contribution of the pipe on the leading side is significantly more than the trailing side which could be observed via the change in the plastic stress contour on the pipe under the first versus third indentation fig 42 6 4 sensitivity studies this section investigates the dp effect under subsequent adjacent and quasi static indentations on a pipe with respect to three variables including the magnitude of the lateral loads the distance between neighbouring indentations and the elastic stiffness between the pipe and the steel support 6 5 load magnitude fig 45 shows the growth in the resulting dent depth on the pipe under repeated adjacent indentations with varied lateral load magnitudes 100 125 and 150 kn the vertical displacement of the indenters corresponds to the resulting dent size imposed on the pipe as shown in fig 45 the dp effect under 100 and 125 kn lateral load is comparable also for the case of the 150 kn load the dp effect is slightly greater than the previous two cases this finding shows that the dp effect could increase under higher lateral loads 6 6 subgrade stiffness another sensitivity study is conducted to assess the dp effect on a small diameter pipe under adjacent and quasi static lateral indentations with varied elastic stiffness in the region of interaction between the pipe and the steel support case 1 5e9 n m and case2 10e9 n m fig 46 shows that the case 2 leads to a 42 3 dp effect which is greater than in case 1 with a 38 2 dp effect this result is due to the higher interaction stiffness in case 2 versus case 1 which leads to the more plastic damage on the pipe and leads to more dp effect as reported in davaripour and quinton 2018 the dp effect is dependent on the damage size which is translated along the pipe this finding shows that dp effect could increase under higher elastic stiffness at the interaction between pipe and the support it is worth noting that the higher vertical displacement of indenters in case 1 versus case 2 is due to the higher elastic penetration of the pipe into the support in case 1 with lower interaction stiffness compared to case 2 6 7 distance between subsequent indentations the scenario of the subsequent adjacent indentations is also examined with respect to the distance between neighbouring indentations in this regard one sensitivity case is studied where the distance between indentations increases from 15 mm base case to 45 mm sensitivity case as shown in fig 47 the dp effect significantly decreases for the sensitivity case 11 2 compared to the base case scenario 38 2 this result shows that the dp effect could decrease if the distance between subsequent indentations increases 6 8 overtrawlability assessment dnv rp f111 2014 which is the present guideline for the overtrawlability assessment of subsea pipelines recommends two approaches to analyze the trawl impact load during the interference event with a subsea pipeline including the analytical approach and numerical method these methods are employed to find the range of impact loads which could impose on the pipe of the present study table 1 using the input data provided in appendix b of dnv rp f111 2014 table 3 the main motivation of these analyses is to justify and validate the equivalent quasi static loads that were employed in the physical tests and numerical studies of the present work i e 225 kn in test 1 and 2 150 kn in test 3 and 167 kn in test 4 the following parameters are not incorporated in the analyses including non structural weight metocean forces buoyancy force hydrostatic pressure internal pressure strain rate effect and thermal expansion force the analytical approach is employed to find the upper bound of the trawl load range which could be experienced by the pipeline of the present study the analytical method is conservative as the equation based on the assumption that the kinetic energy applied during the first phase of the trawl impact is locally absorbed by the bare pipe dnv rp f111 2014 in this regard the impact load experienced by the pipe shell f s h is derived from equation 2 and equation 3 dnv rp f111 2014 equation 2 f sh m p α e loc m p d β 1 α β β 1 equation 3 e loc max e s e a equation 4 m p 1 4 f y t 2 equation 5 α 37 ln d t 1 2 equation 6 β 0 125 ln d t 1 where mp is the plastic moment capacity for a pipe equation 4 α and β are factors calculated based on equation 5 and equation 6 e loc is the kinetic energy e s and e a are the impact energies associated with the steel mass of the trawl board and the hydrodynamic added mass respectively using the analytical approach for the pipeline with the properties presented in table 3 the maximum impact force experienced by pipe shell is equal to 295 1 kn 6 9 numerical approach the finite element method is also employed to find the lower bound of the trawl impact range which could be experienced by the present study pipeline the numerical approach recommended in dnv rp f111 2014 is based on the beam and spring mass bsm model which is shown schematically in fig 48 where pipe soil interaction is represented via discrete springs k p s attached to beam elements the global stiffness of the pipe is modelled with beam elements k p b the local shell stiffness of the pipe is modelled with a spring k s with the stiffness derived from the load displacement curve given by equation 7 the in plane stiffness k t and out of plane stiffness k a of the trawl board are modelled with two elastic springs and point masses are used to represent the pipe mass m p the indenter mass m t and the added mass m a equation 7 f m p α h t d β where f is the impact force applied to the pipe shell h t is the total permanent and elastic dent depth m p is the moment capacity of the pipeline equation 4 α and β are a function of the pipeline s geometrical and mechanical properties equation 5 and equation 6 t is the nominal thickness d is the outer diameter of a pipeline and f y is the yield strength dnv rp f111 2014 the load path in the bsm model involves a an initial velocity is applied to m t and m a b then the resulting kinetic energy is transferred via k t and k a and absorbed by the local deformation of the pipe k s pipe s global deformation k p b and pipe soil interaction in order to validate the accuracy of the bsm model the data presented in appendix b of dnv rp f111 2014 is employed fig 49 shows an excellent agreement between the numerical result of the present study and data provided by dnv rp f111 2014 also fig 50 shows the impact load imposed on the present study pipe during a typical trawl interference event accordingly the maximum trawl impact load is 47 kn which is significantly lower than the conservative prediction obtained from the analytical approach which is equal to 295 1 kn therefore the range of the trawl load that the pipe of the present study could be experienced is in the range of 47 295 1 kn hence the load magnitudes applied to the specimen in the present study physical tests i e 225 kn in test 1 and 2 150 kn in test 3 and 167 kn in test 4 are within the reasonable range 7 summary and conclusions a series of experimental investigations were performed on a 5 inch pipe schedule 40 subject to a two phase lateral indentation to investigate the effect of damage progression on the plastic capacity of a pipe where during phase 1 initial plastic damage was developed perpendicularly by a cylindrical indenter and in phase 2 the indenter induced and translated the resulting damage developed in phase 1 along the pipe accordingly four tests were performed under the quasi static condition and the pipe s structural response was assessed with respect to three variables including the friction between the pipe and indenter the boundary condition and the loading condition the results showed that due to the progression of plastic damage along the pipe during phase 2 of loading the pipe s load carrying capacity drops significantly 33 5 in test 1 these results provide evidence regarding the dp effect in pipes the friction between the indenter and the pipe does not change the dp effect at least for the experimental conditions of the present study by translating a nearly constant vertical load along the pipe the resulting dent depth increases by 52 the drop in the pipe s load carrying capacity is significantly larger where the pipe response is within the pure local deformation versus the combination of local and global deformation numerical simulations were performed to replicate the result of test 3 the finite element results showed excellent agreement with the physical test result the verified finite element model was then used to examine a pipe subject to several adjacent perpendicular indentations applied under the quasi static condition this scenario represents an idealization of a subsea pipeline subject to repeated trawl impacts the results showed that by the progression of damage along the pipe under the same imposed perpendicular loads the size of dent depth increases by 38 2 this result is aligned with the findings of the physical tests that the progression of damage along a pipe decreases the load carrying capacity of the pipe these findings also show that the effect of damage progression should be considered in controlling the denting limit state for the pipe design against accidental interference loads furthermore the von mises stress contour obtained from the numerical analyses was presented which showed that the source of the dp effect is due to the less structural contribution of the trailing side of the pipe compared to the leading side it was discussed that this behaviour is associated with the limited load carrying capacity of the buckled region on the trailing side of the pipe accordingly the trailing side of the pipe during the subsequent indentations acts as a weak link which causes the lesser distribution of stresses along the trailing side of the pipe compared to the leading side 7 1 future work among other things this paper examined a particular load path on a pipe where the pipe is subject to repeated indentations at adjacent locations varied random load patterns should also be examined to provide further insight regarding the dp effect on a pipe under repeated indentations in addition the analyses were conducted under the quasi static condition similar studies should also be performed for a pipe under dynamic repeated impacts at adjacent locations furthermore the contribution of the internal pressure thermal expansion pipe length and dent spring back on the dp effect in pipelines should be considered in the future sensitivity studies dnv rp f111 2014 states that both local and global failure probabilities should be considered for assessing the overtrawlability of pipelines against the subsequent pullover loads as such the scope of the present study should be employed for investigating the pipe response under repeated pull over trawl loads at adjacent locations on the pipeline credit authorship contribution statement farhad

the swing arm indenter and hydraulic ram the indenter is connected to the swing arm and then to the supporting frame as the connection point between the swing arm to the test frame resists vertical displacement the measured vertical load by the mts load cell varies with the vertical force resisted at the connection point accordingly a static analysis is performed to calculate the vertical load resisted at the connection point the vertical load measured by the mts load cell is then adjusted accordingly to provide the vertical load on the indenter fig 51 a view of the connection between the swing arm and indenter fig 51 fig 52 shows a schematic view of the indenter swing arm and boundary conditions where a is the height above the swing arm to the point of action of the horizontal force

combination of indenter and the swing arm is considered as a continuous beam furthermore a section cut of the beam is provided at joint b to assess the loads and moments fig 52 static analysis of the

20537,the investigation of buckle propagation in subsea pipelines has been the subject of several works in the past few decades it was shown that the external pressure required to develop the initial local buckle on the pipe is considerably more than the pressure required to propagate the initiated buckle along the pipe in this respect a relevant phenomenon may be framed for a pipe that is subject to a substantial lateral interference load where the load induces plastic damage on the pipe and incites the progression of damage along the pipe as such the present work assesses the pipe s load carrying capacity during the progression of plastic damage using a novel test apparatus in addition using the finite element method an application of damage progression effect is examined on a pipe subject to subsequent fishing gear impacts the physical tests and numerical studies show that the load carrying capacity of a pipe may drop significantly i e 33 5 as reported in test 1 due to the damage progression effect in conclusion the findings of the present work show that disregarding the damage progression effect in the assessment of pipelines could lead to a significant underestimation of the load carrying capacity of the pipes keywords subsea pipeline damage progression buckle propagation trawl interference dnv rp f111 1 introduction the propagation of local buckle on a subsea pipeline has been the subject of several studies in the past few decades i e hahn et al 1993 kyriakides 1994 liang et al 2019 where the buckle propagation refers to the longitudinal propagation of the local buckle plastic damage along the subsea pipeline due to the external pressure in this regard it was shown that the pressure required to buckle a pipeline is more than the pressure needed to propagate the buckle i e chater and hutchinson 1984 therefore pipelines have more structural resistance against the development of the initial plastic damage compared to the propagation of the initiated damage along the pipe this provides a framework for a relevant phenomenon where the pipe is subject to a lateral load by a third party i e bottom fishing gear which applies plastic damage to the pipe and translates and induces the imposed damage along the pipe the goal of the present thesis is to address this phenomenon in swp and pip systems according to recent studies on a pipe under a lateral indentation i e davaripour et al 2020b davaripour and quinton 2018 the plastic capacity of a pipe could decrease significantly when the initiated plastic damage on the pipe progresses along the pipe in other words the lateral load required to develop the initial plastic damage on a pipe could be significantly more than the sliding load required to translate and induce the plastic damage with the same size along the pipe the plastic capacity of a pipe refers to the load carrying capacity or structural resistance of the pipe where the load imposes plastic damage to the pipe this capacity is measured in the present work according to the dent size imposed on the pipe in the load controlled condition or the perpendicular load withstood by the pipe in the displacement controlled condition accordingly novel physical apparatus is employed in the present study to validate and further investigate the damage progression along a pipeline which is imposed by a non rupture type interference load trawl board impact in this work the trawl impact is the first phase during trawl gear interference with a subsea pipeline prior to pullover phase and lasts for some hundredth of a second dnv rp f111 2014 the trawl board is used in otter trawl types to keep the net open during the trawling dnv rp f111 2014 1 1 literature review the topic of a pipe subject to a perpendicular impact has been investigated by several studies in the past decades ellinas and walker 1983 developed a semi empirical model by employing the test results of thomas et al 1976 the authors assumed that the pipe response during the indentation could be idealized into the separate phases of purely local deformation and the global deformation with some additional local response however from the very beginning of the indentation the pipe response involves the combination of both local and global deformation where the local deformation increases with a higher growth rate at the beginning of the indentation then due to the change in the cross section of the pipe the bending stiffness decreases which leads to more global rather than local deformation zheng et al 2012 furthermore soreide and amdahl 1982 studied the clamped pipe without axial restraint subject to transverse indentation under quasi static and impact conditions this boundary condition arrangement considers both local and global deformation of the pipe which is a suitable idealization for a subsea pipeline alexander 2007 examined several impact events on a 12 inch pipe and presented a classification of major damages in a pipe however the reported velocity of impact in his work 13 m s is significantly greater than the one in common impact events imposed on the pipeline system from the trawling activity 2 6 m s jones and birch 1996 performed 54 impact tests on a pipe with a fully clamped boundary condition using different ranges of impact energy and internal pressure the authors presented different failure modes of a pipe subject to a wedge shaped indenter ng and shen 2006 incorporated the foundation support in the test setup and concluded that the failure threshold of a pipe could change when considering the circumferential stress developed due to the pipe foundation interaction however the trawl impact occurs along the seabed and the pipe soil interaction is insignificant in addition to perpendicular indentation there are interference events where the imposed damage could progress along the pipe such as a subsea pipeline subject to a non perpendicular trawl impact davaripour et al 2020b or under repeated perpendicular trawl impacts at adjacent locations the latter case is within the scope of the present study in these scenarios the structural response of the pipe is path dependent where path dependency refers to the effects of the plastic deformation imposed on the pipe at the previous time increment on the current response of the pipe in this regard several studies have been conducted on the path dependent behaviour of a structure subject to a moving load parkes 1958 presented a solution for the plastic response of a massless rigid plastic beam under a traveling mass symonds and neal 1960 extended the study of parkes 1958 using the mass included rigid plastic beam toridis and wen 1966 did an analytical investigation on the dynamic response of an elasto plastic beam under a moving load they proposed a solution for a discrete beam with massless rigid panels connected by joints with a point mass frýba 1999 reviewed and presented analytical solutions for multiple examples of simple moving load scenarios the author provided an analytical solution for a rigid plastic beam with a stationary hinge in the middle subject to a concentrated load translating along the beam quinton 2015 2008 investigated the collision of a hull structure with sliding ice loads and showed a reduction in the structural resistance of the plate when the non rupture type load slides along the plate versus when it is only perpendicular to the plate the investigation of this reduction in cylindrical structures is the main focus of the present study and termed as the damage progression dp effect throughout this paper davaripour and quinton 2018 numerically examined the dp effect in pipes they showed that for a pipe subject to a moving indentation the dp effect only occurs if the load applies plastic damage to the pipe they concluded that the lesser resistance of the pipe on the trailing side of the sliding load compared to the leading side is the main source of the dp effect the trailing side is the part of the pipe behind the sliding load and the leading side is the part ahead of the sliding load the authors showed that the dp effect grows when the extent of plastic damage which is translated along the pipe increases davaripour et al 2020b used finite element analyses to examine an application of the dp effect for subsea pipelines where the pipe is subject to a diagonal trawl impact in this scenario the tangential component of the trawl impact pushes the resulting plastic damage along the pipe the authors showed that due to the dp effect the resulting dent depth on a 5 inches pipe under a diagonal trawl impact with 30 angle is up to 20 higher compared to the case where only the normal component of the trawl impact was applied to the pipe the tangential component of diagonal trawl impacts are commonly disregarded in overtrawlability assessments of pipelines davaripour et al 2020b dnv rp f111 2014 states that the subsequent trawl pullover load and the resulting accumulation of plastic strain should be considered in the overtrawlability assessment of pipelines the number of subsequent interactions is dependent on the trawl frequency in the field however if no specific data is available dnv rp f111 2014 recommends considering the effect of four subsequent pullover loads at the same location likewise the subsequent initial trawl impact should be examined where applicable also parametric studies of the scenario where a pipe is subject to repeated trawl impacts should be assessed in this regard if the repeated impacts occur at neighbouring locations on a pipe it can lead to the progression of damage as reported by davaripour and quinton 2018 due to the dp effect the structural resistance of a pipe could drop significantly as the resulting plastic damage travels along the pipe as such in the present study the case of a pipe subject to repeated indentations at adjacent locations is numerically examined which is an application of the dp effect on subsea pipelines shen and jones 1991 proposed an alternative quasi static approach to replicate the dynamic effect of a rigid perfectly plastic clamped beam struck transversely by an indenter the authors stated that where the indenter is heavy and moves at a relatively low speed the predicted energy absorbed by the structure using the quasi static analysis is similar to the one in the real problem furthermore zheng 2014 did a series of experimental and numerical investigations on pipes subject to transverse indentations and concluded that quasi static conditions could be employed for trawling impact problems as such the quasi static experimental and numerical works presented in the present paper are representatives of actual trawl gear interference with subsea pipelines the topic of the dp effect in subsea pipelines is a novel topic in this regard davaripour et al 2020c provided a physical test under the quasi static and load controlled condition the present work extends the physical findings of davaripour et al 2020c by presenting high quality data regarding additional three physical tests furthermore a numerical model is developed and verified against one of the physical tests which is then employed to examine the pipe s response under repeated quasi static indentations at adjacent locations these analyses represent an idealization of a subsea pipeline subject to repeated trawl impacts at adjoining locations notes on the research scope the main objective of the present study is to provide evidence regarding the effect of damage progression on the plastic capacity of a pipeline furthermore the present study introduces and investigates a novel application of the dp effect in the event of trawl gear interference with subsea pipelines in this regard while the recommendations of dnv rp f111 were incorporated in the methodologies of the present work the test setup as well as the numerical model do not fully represent a scenario of a trawl interference event with a subsea pipeline however the following points justify the validity of the approach employed in the present work for both physical test setup and numerical model the dynamic effect of a trawl impact scenario could be replicated by an equivalent quasi static analysis as reported in shen and jones 1991 and then examined by zheng et al 2013 for the case of a trawl interference with a pipeline as such the physical tests as well as numerical studies are conducted under the quasi static condition the direction of the trawl impact is parallel to the seabed therefore the pipe soil interaction is negligible during the trawl interference event zheng et al 2012 as such the pipe soil interaction is not incorporated in the physical test as well as numerical studies the initial phase of the trawl impact which is the focus of the present scope occurs in some hundredths of a second dnv rp f111 2014 and hence the global deformation of the pipe is negligible and could be disregarded therefore in three out of four physical tests as well as the numerical models the lateral deformation of the pipe is restrained furthermore the physical tests in the present study employ a two phase loading condition to investigate the pipe s response where in phase 1 the pipe is subject to a perpendicular indentation and in phase 2 the resulting damage in phase 1 translates and induces along the pipe in this regard the first phase partially represents the fishing gear impact on a subsea pipeline considering the above mentioned points however the second phase employed only to highlight the effect of damage progression on the load carrying capacity of the pipe and may not represent any particular scenario in the pipeline industry 2 experimental investigation as there are no previous experiments at laboratory scale or otherwise on the subject of the dp effect on cylindrical structures a novel experimental apparatus was used to explore this effect 3 methodology 3 1 test apparatus fig 1 shows an overall view of the test apparatus that was employed to perform the laboratory tests the apparatus was originally devised by quinton 2015 to examine the structural behaviour of plates and stiffened plates subject to sliding loads the apparatus was modified for the present study to investigate the behaviour of hollow cylindrical structures subject to sliding rigid indentations the vertical load path in the test apparatus fig 2 involves the mts test frame which provides the maximum vertical force of 500 kn via the hydraulic ram the mts test frame is a self reacting frame that could apply a precise load to conduct a uniaxial material test the vertical ram pushes the cylindrical indenter against the test specimen which is bolted to the carriage the load path will end with the mts test frame s crossheads the horizontal load path refers to the direction along the long edge of the carriage which is shown in fig 3 the load path starts with the horizontally oriented hydraulic ram which provides the maximum load of 225 kn the ram is connected to a base plate from the left side and to the carriage from the right side and pushes the carriage to translate along the rail as the horizontal load starts from the contact between the indenter and the pipe the horizontal load is transferred from the carriage to the pipe and the indenter the load is then transferred to the horizontal load cell via the swing arm 3 2 test setup the modifications to the test apparatus were designed to provide a test setup incorporating the recommendations of dnv rp f11 2014 fig 4 shows an overall view of the test setup bolted to the carriage including isotropic view a x view b and y view c the test setup comprises three main components including the cylindrical specimen the saddle shaped support and the mounts the cylindrical test specimen i e pipe has an outer diameter of 5 inch schedule 40 the mechanical properties of the pipe were obtained from standard tensile tests astme8 e8m 13 2013 fig 5 shows the stress strain curve averaged from the tensile tests and table 1 summarizes the physical and mechanical properties of the pipe the total length of the specimen between the pins is 1200 mm and the deformable part between the end flanges is 965 2 mm long fig 6 the end flanges as well as hinges are considered relatively rigid in comparison to the cylindrical part in the middle the saddle shaped support is shown in fig 7 it is designed to restrain the global deformation of the specimen it comprises an 863 6 mm 34 inch long plate with a width equal to that of the support carriage and 25 4 mm 1 inch thickness the plate is cut in the center to 70 65 mm radius matching the pipe radius the final curved shape in the center of the plate provides 60 circumferential area for the interaction with the specimen as recommended by dnv rp f11 2014 the saddle shaped support is connected to the carriage via bolts along the two long edges of the plate as well as the i beam welded to the plate and rests against the inside top of the carriage fig 8 fig 9 shows the mounts which are devised to connect the ends of the specimen to the carriage via the key stock and bolts the mounts are made of high strength steel astm 514 with a yield strength of 779 mpa and ultimate strength of 827 mpa as reported in the mill material certification 3 3 indenter the indenter is a solid shaft made of medium tensile strength steel c1035 with a radius of 25 mm representing a trawl door according to dnv rp f11 2014 the leading edge of the indenter is used for the tests with the length of 203 mm for the frictionless indenter fig 10 a and the length of 187 mm for the friction included indenter fig 10 b for the frictionless type the sliding friction between the indenter and the specimen is eliminated using a rolling indenter mounted on two pillow block bearings as well as using lubrication at the region of contact 3 4 boundary conditions two boundary conditions bc were examined during the tests fig 11 including bc 1 where the global deformation of the pipe is restricted using the saddle shaped support and bc 2 where the global and local deformation of the pipe is allowed i e the saddle shaped support is removed from the test setup 3 5 instrumentation the mts test frame data acquisition system as well as laser scanning technologies and imaging technologies were employed during the test to record a the vertical and horizontal force applied by the indenter to the specimen b the vertical displacement of the indenter c the horizontal displacement of the indenter relative to the specimen d the side view of the cylindrical specimen during the indentation e the spatial position of the deformed specimen after the test 3 6 test procedure all tests are performed under the quasi static condition and contain two phases 1 phase 1 fig 12 a where the horizontal hydraulic ram is held steady and the vertical hydraulic ram pushes the indenter against the specimen accordingly in the load controlled test the vertical ram applies 150 kn to the specimen through the indenter with a rate equal to 3 kn s also in the displacement controlled test the vertical hydraulic ram moves the indenter by 35 or 75 mm against the specimen with a rate equal to 1 0 mm s 2 phase 2 fig 12 b where the horizontal hydraulic ram starts to push the carriage along the rail for 300 mm in a displacement controlled condition 1 mm s accordingly where phase 1 is in the displacement controlled condition the vertical position of the hydraulic ram remains steady also where phase 1 is in the load controlled condition the 150 kn vertical load applied by the hydraulic ram remains steady fig 13 shows the deformed cylindrical specimen prior to the indentation a at the end of phase 1 b and at the end of phase 2 c 3 7 test matrix as presented in table 2 four laboratory tests are conducted to investigate the dp effect in a pipeline the vertical indentation load values in table 2 refer to the displacement of the indenter and the load applied by the indenter during phase 1 respectively 4 results and discussion in this section the data recorded during the physical tests are provided in this regard it is worth noting that the results of the first phase of test 1 were partially provided in an article by the authors davaripour et al 2020a furthermore the results of test 3 were partially presented in another article by the authors davaripour et al 2020c however the majority of the physical test results are provided herein 4 1 test 1 bc 1 fi dc dc test 1 was performed to investigate the effect of friction on the dp effect fig 14 shows the deformed shape of the specimen after the test also fig 15 shows the vertical displacement of the indenter or resulting dent depth on the specimen versus time as well as the vertical load resisted by the specimen against the imposed indentation versus time as shown in the figure during phase 1 the vertical indentation increases and reaches to 35 mm consequently the vertical load resisted by the specimen against the imposed indentation increases and reaches to 221 kn during phase 2 while the vertical position of the indenter i e the dent depth imposed on the specimen remains constant the vertical resistance in the pipe decreases up to 33 5 the significant drop occurs upon the initiation of phase 2 and promptly reaches the steady state condition at 146 5 kn then close to the end of phase 2 the vertical resistance of the specimen slightly increases as the indenter approaches the end boundary condition fig 16 shows the horizontal load resisted by the specimen as well as the resultant load during the test the horizontal direction refers to the direction along the carriage s motion path 4 2 test 2 bc 1 fl dc dc test 2 was conducted using the frictionless indenter to provide test data to be compared against the results obtained from test 1 this comparison is employed to assess the effect of friction on the dp effect in pipelines fig 17 shows the deformed shape of the cylindrical specimen where a fig 17 a shows the initiation and direction of the moving load during phase 2 b fig 17 b shows the test setup after the experiment is conducted c fig 17 c shows the laser scanned isotropic view of a section cut of the deformed specimen d fig 17 d shows the y z elevation view of the laser scanned pipe the indentation was applied uniformly during phase 2 however the dent depth is not fully consistent along the pipe which is due to the path dependent behaviour of the pipe during phase 2 in other words the plastic deformation in any location of the pipe was affected by the indentation imposed on the pipe at adjacent locations in next time increments e fig 17 e shows the x z view of a section cut of the scanned pipe fig 18 shows the vertical displacement of the indenter or resulting dent depth on the specimen versus time as well as the vertical load resisted by the specimen against the imposed indentation versus time as shown in the figure during phase 1 the vertical indentation increases and reaches 35 mm consequently the vertical load resisted by the specimen against the imposed indentation increases and reaches 215 kn during phase 2 while the vertical position of the indenter remains constant the vertical resistance in the pipe decreases up to 32 this significant drop occurs upon the initiation of phase 2 and promptly reaches the steady state condition at 146 kn then close to the end of phase 2 the vertical resistance of the specimen slightly increases as the indenter approaches the end boundary condition also fig 19 shows the horizontal load as well as the resultant load resisted by the specimen during the test 4 3 comparison test 1 and 2 fig 20 shows that the vertical load resisted by the specimen in test 2 is nearly identical to the one in test 1 demonstrating that at least for experimental conditions of the present study the effect of sliding friction on pipe s vertical structural resistance is insignificant in other words the dp effect is not dependent on the sliding friction considering the present test condition however the horizontal load resisted by the specimen in test 2 is significantly lower than the one in test 1 fig 20 which is due to the effect of sliding friction between the specimen and the fi indenter in test 1 as such as shown in fig 21 the resultant load resisted during test 2 is significantly less than the one in test 1 the test setup in test 1 versus test 2 is the same except in test 1 the friction included indenter was employed while in test 2 the frictionless indenter was used as such the higher horizontal load in test 1 versus test 2 fig 20 is due to the sliding friction between the indenter and the specimen in test 1 in this regard the friction coefficient between the friction included indenter and the specimen could be derived from the difference between the horizontal load in test 1 and 2 over the vertical load in test 1 the imposed indentation in both tests is the same and equal to 35 mm fig 22 shows the load difference the vertical load in test 1 and the variation of the friction coefficient between the indenter and specimen during test 1 the average friction coefficient where the curve reaches steady state condition is equal to 0 26 0 3 4 4 test 3 bc 1 fl lc dc test 3 was performed to investigate the dp effect in cylindrical specimens under the load controlled condition fig 23 shows the vertical load applied by the indenter against the specimen versus time as well as the vertical displacement of the indenter or the resulting dent depth imposed on the specimen versus time as shown in the figure during phase 1 the applied load increases to 150 kn consequently the dent depth imposed on the specimen increases to 20 7 mm during phase 2 while the vertical load almost remains constant the imposed dent depth on the specimen increases up to 52 and reaches 32 mm this demonstrates the need to consider the dp effect for the assessment of impact scenarios on subsea pipelines where denting limit states and its associated design criteria may be governing also fig 23 shows that during phase 2 while the mts control software held the 150 kn force as measured by the vertical ram s load cell the actual vertical load drops slightly 4 due to the generated moment along the swing arm as discussed in appendix this is an unavoidable experimental error as the mts software control is based only on the vertical ram force and there is no way to compensate for the difference resulting from the swingarm moment this implies that if the imposed vertical load was remained perfectly constant at 150 kn instead of slightly decreasing then the increase in the imposed dent depth could be even larger than 52 also fig 24 shows the horizontal load resisted by the specimen during the test 4 5 test 4 bc 2 fl dc dc test 4 was performed to assess the potential mitigating effects of bending response in cylindrical specimens on the dp effect fig 25 shows the deformed shape of the cylindrical specimen as shown in the figure the saddle shaped support is removed and the specimen has both local and global deformation fig 26 shows the scanned views of the deformed cylindrical specimen where a fig 26 a shows an isotropic view of the specimen b fig 26 b shows the x z view of a specimen c fig 26 c shows the y z elevation view of the pipe with the dimensions of two regions highlighted including where the pipe is 1 intact by the indentation after the test 2 the dent size on the specimen reaches the steady state condition fig 27 shows the vertical load resisted by the specimen versus time as well as the vertical displacement of the indenter versus time as shown in the figure during phase 1 the displacement of the indenter increases to 75 mm consequently the load withstood by the pipe increases to 157 kn during phase 2 while the vertical position of the indenter remains constant the structural resistance of the pipe decreases up to 12 the maximum drop occurs upon the initiation of phase 2 and promptly reaches the steady state condition at 138 kn then the pipe response increases as the indenter approaches the end boundary condition also fig 28 shows the horizontal load as well as the resultant load resisted by the specimen during the test fig 29 shows the vertical displacement of the specimen in the middle at the top and bottom points of the cross section during the 75 mm indentation phase 1 of loading fig 29 also shows the difference between these curves which is the resulting dent depth imposed on the pipe at the region of indentation 4 6 comparison test 2 and 4 according to the results obtained in test 2 and 4 the dp effect in test 4 12 is significantly less than the effect observed in test 2 32 the size of the dent imposed on the pipes is relatively similar in test 2 and 4 35 mm in test 2 and 40 6 mm in test 4 as such the bending response of the pipe has mitigating effects on the dp effect in pipelines fig 30 shows the vertical load resisted by the specimen in test 4 versus test 2 5 numerical investigations a numerical investigation is conducted using abaqus explicit to examine a scenario of a subsea pipeline subject to subsequent trawl impacts the finite element method is employed to show the dp effect when a pipe is indented by repeated trawl impacts at neighbouring locations the subsequent indentation of a pipe at adjoining locations leads to the progression of plastic damage along the pipe this novel scenario examines the statement of dnv rp f11 2014 that repeated impacts at same locations need to be considered reflecting the trawling frequency the idealized numerical model is built according to dnv rp f11 2014 and validated against the results of test 3 furthermore in order to computationally enhance the numerical analyses the semi automatic mass scaling in abaqus is implemented in the numerical model using scale factor of 1000 5 1 element type the specimen is modelled with reduced integration shell elements s4r with aspect ratio equal to 1 and edge length equal to 3 mm the cylindrical indenter and the saddle shaped support are modelled with rigidly constrained solid elements 5 2 load path test 3 is performed in two phases including a phase 1 where the indenter imposes 150 kn load via the cylindrical indenter against the specimen in the load controlled condition b phase 2 where the 150 kn imposed load remains nearly constant 4 reduction and the indenter translates along the pipe for 300 mm fig 31 shows the load path during phase 1 and 2 5 3 boundary conditions the boundary conditions implemented in the test setup include the 1 inch saddle shape support which restrains the global deformation of the specimen and the mounts at both ends which restrain the axial deformation of the specimen these boundary conditions are schematically shown in fig 32 furthermore considering the groove welding between the two end edges of the specimen and the flange plates fig 6 the length of the specimen s deformable region in fig 6 is set to 940 mm and the rest of the specimen s length is rigidly constrained quinton 2015 used a similar test apparatus and reported a vertical elastic deformation in the apparatus during the applied indentation the author performed sensitivity studies and concluded that the elastic stiffness is within the range of 1e7 to 2 5e7 n mm in the present study for the interaction between the saddle shaped support and the specimen the elastic pressure overclosure behaviour is employed with the spring stiffness set to 0 5e7 n mm based on sensitivity analyses this value is slightly less than the values reported by quinton 2015 due to the modifications which are applied to the test apparatus in the present work furthermore additional finite element analyses are conducted to obtain the stiffness of the mounts fig 33 where for the boundary conditions a at the location of the key stock the nodes are restrained along the x axis and b at the location of the bolts nodes are restrained in all degrees of freedom furthermore the tied nodes are rigidly constrained and pulled by 20 mm in the opposite direction of the x axis the mount is modelled using the reduced integration solid elements c3d8r with the deformed shape presented in fig 33 b fig 34 shows the load displacement curve from which the stiffness of the mounts could be obtained in this regard axial connectors as presented in abaqus documentation 2019 at both ends of the pipe are used to represent the stiffness provided by the mounts fig 35 5 4 interaction properties the numerical model comprises two interactions including the contact between the indenter and the specimen and the contact between the specimen and the saddle shaped support fig 35 for the first contact definition the sliding friction coefficient is assumed 0 due to using the frictionless indenter for the latter one interaction according to the test setup there is nearly no relative displacement between the specimen and the support in this regard sensitivity studies are performed using finite element analyses section 3 6 1 which shows that the sliding friction coefficient between the specimen and the saddle shaped support does not affect the pipe s response as such a reasonable friction coefficient of 0 3 is employed for analyses in the present study 5 5 mesh convergence analysis mesh convergence analyses are conducted to determine the shell element size in the specimen fig 36 shows the result of the analyses for three mesh sizes including 3 5 and 6 mm as shown in the figure the results of all three cases are very similar particularly for the maximum vertical displacement of the indenter the mesh size equal to 3 mm is used for the analyses 6 results fig 37 shows a good agreement between the numerical outcome and the physical data during phase 1 the numerical result is perfectly aligned with the test data during phase 2 the numerical prediction slightly underestimates the physical data in the second half of the phase this discrepancy could be sourced in the simplification and idealization of the boundary conditions in the numerical model 6 1 sensitivity study a sensitivity study is conducted using finite element analysis to examine the effect of the friction coefficient between the specimen and the saddle shaped support on the pipe s response accordingly fig 38 presents the dent depth of the specimen under varied friction coefficients 0 0 0 3 and 0 5 and shows the dent depth of the specimen is not affected by the value of the friction coefficient 6 2 repeated trawl impacts dnv rp f111 2014 states that repeated impacts at same locations need to be considered reflecting the trawling frequency however if the subsequent impacts are imposed at neighbouring locations on the pipe it could lead to the damage progression along the pipe in other words if a pipe is indented at locations that are sufficiently close to each other the resulting plastic damage on the pipe translates longitudinally as if the load is sliding along the pipe in this regard a novel scenario is introduced and studied where a cylindrical specimen is subject to several identical quasi static perpendicular indentations at adjoining locations in total 11 adjacent indentations 15 mm away from each other are applied to the pipe using the verified numerical model introduced in section 3 fig 39 shows schematic views for 3 out of 11 indentations along the specimen each indentation imposes a 150 kn on the pipe in the load controlled condition fig 40 shows the deformed shape of the specimen after 11 adjacent indentations as shown in the figure after each indentation the imposed damage on the specimen progresses longitudinally the length of the dent reaches 150 mm after the final indentation furthermore by the progression of the imposed damage the dent depth increases until it reaches a steady state value fig 41 shows the maximum vertical displacement of the indenter along the pipe after each indentation each data marker represents one indentation the results of test 3 are also provided for comparison as shown in fig 41 the damage size in the specimen increases from 21 mm to 29 mm 38 2 increase until it reaches a steady state condition furthermore comparing the numerical results against the physical data of test 3 fig 41 shows a good overall agreement however the specimen under the repeated indentations leads to less dp effect in the present numerical investigation repeated trawl impact on a subsea pipeline is examined under the quasi static load controlled condition as accordingly to shen and jones 1991 and zheng 2014 dynamic effect of the trawl interference event could be replicated using quasi static analyses as a result of this numerical study it is shown that the load carrying capacity of a pipe decreases as the plastic damage progresses longitudinally under repeated identical quasi static indentations at adjacent locations these results show that considering the subsequent trawl impact at adjoining locations on a pipe could lead to more dent depth compared to a case where the pipe is subject to repeated trawl impacts at the same location as recommended by dnv rp f111 2014 subsequent identical quasi static indentations at the same location on a pipe does not change the resulting dent depth imposed after the first indentation this is a clear application of the dp effect in the offshore pipeline industry 6 3 equivalent stress contour fig 42 shows the side views of the pipe subject to repeated indentations and demonstrates the plastic stress contour in the range of yield stress to ultimate stress table 1 accordingly for the pipe under the first indentation there is the symmetrical distribution of stress contour however for the pipe under the third indentation 30 mm away from the first one the trailing side of the pipe does not have a significant contribution compared to the leading side where the trailing side is a portion of pipe behind the indenter and the leading side is the potion of the pipe ahead of the indenter the progression of damage along the pipe involves high geometric material and bc nonlinearities in this respect the following assumptions are made to understand the source of this considerable change in the pipe s stress contour under the first versus the third indentation the pipe s stiffness against the lateral indentation involves longitudinal bending and stretching stiffness as well as circumferential bending and membrane stiffness according to findings of the work conducted by hahn et al 1993 which employed the analytical method to investigate local buckle and buckle propagation in the subsea pipeline under external pressure the first stiffness is negligible compared to the latter one in this regard considering the similar cross sectional deformation of a pipe subject to external pressure and lateral indentation it could be assumed that the pipe s response during the lateral indentation is also controlled by the circumferential bending and membrane stiffness as such pipe s plastic capacity under repeated adjacent indentations could be simplified and investigated by the load carrying capacity of a ring subject to a lateral indentation hahn et al 1993 developed an analytical equation to predict the external pressure required to develop radial displacement on a ring for both before and after the buckling the authors showed that for thin walled pipes for example the pipe of the present study with d t 20 if p pe equation 1 the ring experiences elastic buckling and becomes unstable under bending actions in this regard the ring action under the lateral indentation is examined using the modified version of the numerical model presented in fig 43 where the pipe s length decreased to 1 cm fig 43 shows the numerical model as well as the plastic equivalent stress contour on the ring after 35 mm indentation also fig 44 shows the load displacement curve during the indentation which demonstrates that by the formation of plastic hinges on the ring the ring no longer withstands any additional lateral load this finding is in agreement with the results of hahn et al 1993 regarding the post buckling behaviour of a ring under external pressure however according to the findings of hahn et al 1993 after the elastic buckling of the ring even by a reduction of the external pressure the ring could be crushed however the load carrying capacity of the ring after the formation of plastic hinges remains constant equation 1 p e 2 e 1 t d 3 where e 1 is the elastic modulus for the pipe d and t are the outer diameter and nominal thickness of the ring respectively according to the above points after the initial plastic damage on the pipe for the following indentations i e third indentation the trailing side of the pipe has already buckled according to the above findings regarding the post bucking behaviour of a ring under a lateral indentation the distribution of stress along the trailing side of the pipe is not fully possible as the pipe in the buckled regions is unable to pass more than 3 kn per 1 cm length as presented in fig 44 as such the buckled region on the trailing side of the pipe acts as a weak link therefore the structural contribution of the pipe on the leading side is significantly more than the trailing side which could be observed via the change in the plastic stress contour on the pipe under the first versus third indentation fig 42 6 4 sensitivity studies this section investigates the dp effect under subsequent adjacent and quasi static indentations on a pipe with respect to three variables including the magnitude of the lateral loads the distance between neighbouring indentations and the elastic stiffness between the pipe and the steel support 6 5 load magnitude fig 45 shows the growth in the resulting dent depth on the pipe under repeated adjacent indentations with varied lateral load magnitudes 100 125 and 150 kn the vertical displacement of the indenters corresponds to the resulting dent size imposed on the pipe as shown in fig 45 the dp effect under 100 and 125 kn lateral load is comparable also for the case of the 150 kn load the dp effect is slightly greater than the previous two cases this finding shows that the dp effect could increase under higher lateral loads 6 6 subgrade stiffness another sensitivity study is conducted to assess the dp effect on a small diameter pipe under adjacent and quasi static lateral indentations with varied elastic stiffness in the region of interaction between the pipe and the steel support case 1 5e9 n m and case2 10e9 n m fig 46 shows that the case 2 leads to a 42 3 dp effect which is greater than in case 1 with a 38 2 dp effect this result is due to the higher interaction stiffness in case 2 versus case 1 which leads to the more plastic damage on the pipe and leads to more dp effect as reported in davaripour and quinton 2018 the dp effect is dependent on the damage size which is translated along the pipe this finding shows that dp effect could increase under higher elastic stiffness at the interaction between pipe and the support it is worth noting that the higher vertical displacement of indenters in case 1 versus case 2 is due to the higher elastic penetration of the pipe into the support in case 1 with lower interaction stiffness compared to case 2 6 7 distance between subsequent indentations the scenario of the subsequent adjacent indentations is also examined with respect to the distance between neighbouring indentations in this regard one sensitivity case is studied where the distance between indentations increases from 15 mm base case to 45 mm sensitivity case as shown in fig 47 the dp effect significantly decreases for the sensitivity case 11 2 compared to the base case scenario 38 2 this result shows that the dp effect could decrease if the distance between subsequent indentations increases 6 8 overtrawlability assessment dnv rp f111 2014 which is the present guideline for the overtrawlability assessment of subsea pipelines recommends two approaches to analyze the trawl impact load during the interference event with a subsea pipeline including the analytical approach and numerical method these methods are employed to find the range of impact loads which could impose on the pipe of the present study table 1 using the input data provided in appendix b of dnv rp f111 2014 table 3 the main motivation of these analyses is to justify and validate the equivalent quasi static loads that were employed in the physical tests and numerical studies of the present work i e 225 kn in test 1 and 2 150 kn in test 3 and 167 kn in test 4 the following parameters are not incorporated in the analyses including non structural weight metocean forces buoyancy force hydrostatic pressure internal pressure strain rate effect and thermal expansion force the analytical approach is employed to find the upper bound of the trawl load range which could be experienced by the pipeline of the present study the analytical method is conservative as the equation based on the assumption that the kinetic energy applied during the first phase of the trawl impact is locally absorbed by the bare pipe dnv rp f111 2014 in this regard the impact load experienced by the pipe shell f s h is derived from equation 2 and equation 3 dnv rp f111 2014 equation 2 f sh m p α e loc m p d β 1 α β β 1 equation 3 e loc max e s e a equation 4 m p 1 4 f y t 2 equation 5 α 37 ln d t 1 2 equation 6 β 0 125 ln d t 1 where mp is the plastic moment capacity for a pipe equation 4 α and β are factors calculated based on equation 5 and equation 6 e loc is the kinetic energy e s and e a are the impact energies associated with the steel mass of the trawl board and the hydrodynamic added mass respectively using the analytical approach for the pipeline with the properties presented in table 3 the maximum impact force experienced by pipe shell is equal to 295 1 kn 6 9 numerical approach the finite element method is also employed to find the lower bound of the trawl impact range which could be experienced by the present study pipeline the numerical approach recommended in dnv rp f111 2014 is based on the beam and spring mass bsm model which is shown schematically in fig 48 where pipe soil interaction is represented via discrete springs k p s attached to beam elements the global stiffness of the pipe is modelled with beam elements k p b the local shell stiffness of the pipe is modelled with a spring k s with the stiffness derived from the load displacement curve given by equation 7 the in plane stiffness k t and out of plane stiffness k a of the trawl board are modelled with two elastic springs and point masses are used to represent the pipe mass m p the indenter mass m t and the added mass m a equation 7 f m p α h t d β where f is the impact force applied to the pipe shell h t is the total permanent and elastic dent depth m p is the moment capacity of the pipeline equation 4 α and β are a function of the pipeline s geometrical and mechanical properties equation 5 and equation 6 t is the nominal thickness d is the outer diameter of a pipeline and f y is the yield strength dnv rp f111 2014 the load path in the bsm model involves a an initial velocity is applied to m t and m a b then the resulting kinetic energy is transferred via k t and k a and absorbed by the local deformation of the pipe k s pipe s global deformation k p b and pipe soil interaction in order to validate the accuracy of the bsm model the data presented in appendix b of dnv rp f111 2014 is employed fig 49 shows an excellent agreement between the numerical result of the present study and data provided by dnv rp f111 2014 also fig 50 shows the impact load imposed on the present study pipe during a typical trawl interference event accordingly the maximum trawl impact load is 47 kn which is significantly lower than the conservative prediction obtained from the analytical approach which is equal to 295 1 kn therefore the range of the trawl load that the pipe of the present study could be experienced is in the range of 47 295 1 kn hence the load magnitudes applied to the specimen in the present study physical tests i e 225 kn in test 1 and 2 150 kn in test 3 and 167 kn in test 4 are within the reasonable range 7 summary and conclusions a series of experimental investigations were performed on a 5 inch pipe schedule 40 subject to a two phase lateral indentation to investigate the effect of damage progression on the plastic capacity of a pipe where during phase 1 initial plastic damage was developed perpendicularly by a cylindrical indenter and in phase 2 the indenter induced and translated the resulting damage developed in phase 1 along the pipe accordingly four tests were performed under the quasi static condition and the pipe s structural response was assessed with respect to three variables including the friction between the pipe and indenter the boundary condition and the loading condition the results showed that due to the progression of plastic damage along the pipe during phase 2 of loading the pipe s load carrying capacity drops significantly 33 5 in test 1 these results provide evidence regarding the dp effect in pipes the friction between the indenter and the pipe does not change the dp effect at least for the experimental conditions of the present study by translating a nearly constant vertical load along the pipe the resulting dent depth increases by 52 the drop in the pipe s load carrying capacity is significantly larger where the pipe response is within the pure local deformation versus the combination of local and global deformation numerical simulations were performed to replicate the result of test 3 the finite element results showed excellent agreement with the physical test result the verified finite element model was then used to examine a pipe subject to several adjacent perpendicular indentations applied under the quasi static condition this scenario represents an idealization of a subsea pipeline subject to repeated trawl impacts the results showed that by the progression of damage along the pipe under the same imposed perpendicular loads the size of dent depth increases by 38 2 this result is aligned with the findings of the physical tests that the progression of damage along a pipe decreases the load carrying capacity of the pipe these findings also show that the effect of damage progression should be considered in controlling the denting limit state for the pipe design against accidental interference loads furthermore the von mises stress contour obtained from the numerical analyses was presented which showed that the source of the dp effect is due to the less structural contribution of the trailing side of the pipe compared to the leading side it was discussed that this behaviour is associated with the limited load carrying capacity of the buckled region on the trailing side of the pipe accordingly the trailing side of the pipe during the subsequent indentations acts as a weak link which causes the lesser distribution of stresses along the trailing side of the pipe compared to the leading side 7 1 future work among other things this paper examined a particular load path on a pipe where the pipe is subject to repeated indentations at adjacent locations varied random load patterns should also be examined to provide further insight regarding the dp effect on a pipe under repeated indentations in addition the analyses were conducted under the quasi static condition similar studies should also be performed for a pipe under dynamic repeated impacts at adjacent locations furthermore the contribution of the internal pressure thermal expansion pipe length and dent spring back on the dp effect in pipelines should be considered in the future sensitivity studies dnv rp f111 2014 states that both local and global failure probabilities should be considered for assessing the overtrawlability of pipelines against the subsequent pullover loads as such the scope of the present study should be employed for investigating the pipe response under repeated pull over trawl loads at adjacent locations on the pipeline credit authorship contribution statement farhad

the swing arm indenter and hydraulic ram the indenter is connected to the swing arm and then to the supporting frame as the connection point between the swing arm to the test frame resists vertical displacement the measured vertical load by the mts load cell varies with the vertical force resisted at the connection point accordingly a static analysis is performed to calculate the vertical load resisted at the connection point the vertical load measured by the mts load cell is then adjusted accordingly to provide the vertical load on the indenter fig 51 a view of the connection between the

20538,off design and realistic operative conditions of the propulsion system have been progressively considered a frontier topic for the development of novel and successful design procedures the availability of high accurate data on propeller performance both experimental or numerical is pivotal for the development of reliable tools and the enhancement of traditional ones in this context this paper continues the investigation described in ortolani et al 2020 that was dedicated to analyze the single blade loads obtained by oblique towing tests and assess their consistency with those measured during the steady turning phase reproduced by free running model tests in this paper the same analysis is broadened to two aspects at first the in plane forces and moments that are obtained by a conversion from the rotating frame of the measure to the fixed frame are discussed these loads need quantification because they are the primary cause of damages of the shafting structure vibratory loads and also contribute to dynamic response of the ship then the study is switched to the comparison of single blade loads during transient motions of the turning maneuvers at weak and tight rudder angles performed at the same reference speed as the captive model test the analysis lays the basis for the enhancement of ship system comprehensive mathematical models already used in ship design to real time analysis of vibratory loads and emitted noise keywords propeller performance in off design single blade loads propeller loads oblique towing transient maneuvers 1 introduction the more stringent requirements imposed by international regulations for low environmental emissions noise continuity of operation at sea comfort and safety boosted in the last decades research on the ship performance during realistic and off design conditions ship propulsion was certainly one of the topic which attracted more research given its pivotal role in the success of a design due to its strict connection with propulsive efficiency hull structural strength and noise emission the standard design of the propeller consists on the maximization of its performance hydrodynamic efficiency cavitation noise with respect to straight advance and calm water however real world is different from being ideal and maneuvering motion in waves up to heavy off design conditions completely alter the flow field around the hull and hence the inflow to the propeller as a matter of fact this causes the loads developed by the single blades and the propeller to be markedly different from the optimal condition they where designed for for example recent experimental studies on free running maneuvering model test ortolani et al 2015a showed for the case of twin screw configuration that during maneuvering abrupt overloading of thrust and torq c o 2 ue up to 100 in contrast to the value in rectilinear motion occurs and non negligible forces and moments acting in the plane of the propeller develop a further outcome of these activities confirmed by unsteady c f d computational fluid dynamic simulations dubbioso et al 2017 muscari et al 2017 was the fact that maneuvers at small drift angle could be as critical as tighter ones in these situations the combination of low propeller loading and detachment of coherent structures convected through the propeller disk causes very complicated propeller wake interactions that yielded strong peaks for the in plane loads in turns the onset of these phenomena amplifies side effects such as propeller hull induced vibratory loads pressure pulses and noise emission that during transient motions can be further exacerbated on these basis to move a further step forward to deeply understand and quantify these complex hydrodynamic mechanisms a novel set up ortolani and dubbioso 2020 based on the measure of three forces and moments exerted by the single blade of the propulsor has been installed and successfully tested on a twin screw model for free running maneuvering model tests ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a the availability of cycle resolved blade loads further highlighted that the fluctuation of the thrust and tangential force with respect to the averaged one can be of the order of 100 whereas the magnitude and fluctuation of spindle moment can markedly exceed by 300 the mean value that results in rectilinear motion the correlation of single blade forces and bearing forces confirmed that the onset of peaks for the vertical force can be ascribed to steep gradient of the inflow moreover in plane yaw and pitching moments can achieve values of the same order of torque in straight motion during maneuvering at the maximum rudder angle accounting for these conditions at an analysis level or in the design loop is a very challenging issue because they are associated to very complex flow phenomena massive flow separation ventilation and cavitation that demand the use of advanced numerical or experimental techniques to complement the capability of established approaches in traditional design gaggero et al 2019 although advanced c f d techniques have reached high level of maturity and reliabilty to solve extremely complex phenomena their validation to correctly predict single blade and propeller loads in these conditions has not been yet completed according to the authors knowledge on the other hand free running model testing is yet probably the most reliable approach to investigate these problems in particular those related to transient motions however these kind of tests are usually performed during the latest stages of the design and are not practically included in the design loop and moreover the required facilities are not commonly affordable to researchers and engineers in contrast to indoor towing tanks as a matter of fact these approaches are too expensive and impractical to adopt in earlier design stages where massive evaluation of geometric configurations are considered and at least can be used for analysis of a limited set or the final geometry on the contrary a broad set of off design conditions maneuvering and safety maneuvers can be analyzed by captive model testing in traditional towing tanks additionally these kind of tests are more suited to systematic investigations for developing parametric description of the physical phenomena in this context in order to inspect the feasibility of captive model tests to reproduce the behavior of the propeller in off design the single blade loads measured during the steady turning motion of free running model ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a were compared to oblique towing tests for a twin screw model ortolani et al 2020 specifically the tests consisted in systematic analysis of a broad set of drift angles up to 30 and speed drops comparable to those experienced in the stabilized phase of the turn the analysis showed that the comparison of blade thrust and spindle moment in terms of equivalent drift angle and nearest speed drop was very satisfactory and the discrepancies were mainly ascribed to the distribution of the drift angle along the hull that could have determined differences in the evolution of the flow relying on the same experimental benchmark of captive and free running tests the present work broadens the previous analysis ortolani et al 2020 to two topics the first issue focuses on the comparative study of the in plane loads obtained from the conversion of the rotating to the fixed frame while the second task concerns the loads developed during transient maneuvers in order to corroborate the validity of captive model tests and their consistency with general maneuvers the analysis relied on the phenomenological link between the loads and the nominal wake obtained by preliminary c f d simulations in relation to ship design the use of captive model tests has practical implication for a remarkable enhancement of comprehensive models these are semi empirical tools used to describe in a multidisciplinary fashion the behavior of a marine vehicle in realistic operative conditions and off design since physical phenomena are modeled by physical based laws enhanced by parametric experimental data these solvers allow real time results and therefore they are an attractive solution to complement existing tools in the optimization loop the use of these tools spread to the analysis of the interaction of prime mover with propulsion system during maneuvers coraddu et al 2013 motion in waves saettone et al 2020 up to the design of alternative control laws of the control system in off design altosole and martelli 2017 vrijdag et al 2010 fig 1 sketches an example of a typical flow chart for these tools in this particular case for ship maneuvering in brief once the geometries and the operative conditions are given in input the solver evaluates the dynamic response of the ship integrating the rigid body motion equation the forcing terms are represented by the hydrodynamic loads acting on the main elements of the ship i e hull rudder and propeller described by parametric laws function of ship s speed and acceleration moreover the propeller operative condition revolution pitch depends on the dynamic behavior of the prime mover and the action of the control law in fact observing the sketch depicted in fig 1 the standard modeling of the propeller relies on the use on the open water characteristics of the propeller to yield the thrust and torque for the solution of the motion and engine dynamic equations these information guide the operation of the propulsion control unit to automatically modify the operative input fuel rate propeller pitch or rudder angle or interact in real time with the pilot helmsman and alternatively are crucial for the optimization of its gains coefficients during its design on the other hand an alternative modeling strategy consists of the implementation of cycle resolved single blade loads in terms of kinematic condition of the model drift angle and speed drop and geometric characteristics of the blade i e pitch to diameter ratio not considered in this study as showed in the figure at each time step of the simulation the single blade loads can be obtained from interpolation of the cycles about the operating condition the resolution of the complete set of loads developed by the blade allows to describe accurately the propeller contribution to the dynamic response of the ship and in particular analyze critical design aspects associated to vibration and emitted noise that can be noticeably altered during realistic operative conditions ortolani and dubbioso 2020 dubbioso et al 2020 as well as providing a useful guide for the sizing of the shaft and bearings to avoid failures in critical situations hard over turn ventilation 2 test case and experimental set up the experimental activity was performed on a fast twin screw propeller scaled model and its main dimensions are reported in table 1 it is equipped with two inward rotating five bladed propellers as shown in fig 2 the model is characterized by a v shaped stern and it is equipped with several appendages as two couples of stabilizer fins bilge keels a small skeg a couple of horn rudders and brackets supporting the shaft line the results discussed in this paper derive from two experimental campaigns free running self propelled maneuvering tests that were performed at cnr inm maneuvering basin and captive oblique towing tests that were carried out in the rectilinear towing tank details of the model and device set up for the two different experimental approaches are provided in the mentioned literature and are omitted for the sake of brevity it is worth to stress that both setups include a novel system that provides the measure of the full set of loads i e three forces and three moments acting on a single blade of the starboard propeller this has been achieved by manufacturing a custom propeller which houses a commercial six components transducer attached at the root of one of the blades analog signals are transmitted to the on board acquisition system by a special low noise slip ring and a shielded cable passing through the hollow shaft as depicted in fig 3 the calibration range and uncertainties of the transducer have been provided by the manufacturer and reported in table 2 for the sake of completeness the aim of this paper is the comparison of propeller loads developed during the different phases of a turning circle maneouver performed in free running test with the loads measured in captive model test at fixed drift angle with the purpose of reproducing a similar operative condition for the stabilized phase of the turning and simulate quasi steady conditions for transient phases i e start of the evolution and pull out phase the basic idea is to evaluate the possibility and asses the reliability to mimic hydrodynamic condition of a complex test as is a free running model campaign by an easier more controlled and cheaper in terms of costs and time experimental activity the test conditions of the free running and captive model tests is reported in table 3 and table 4 respectively each condition has been repeated at list five times the transient maneuvers concern the initial transient and the pull out phase for the turning circle performed at maximum rudder angle δ 35 and the transient phase of the turning circle performed at δ 15 the nominal advance speed corresponds to froude number f n 0 26 and reynolds number r e 1 053 e 7 propeller angular speed is set at the model self propulsion point in order to mimic the propeller functioning during free running model tests and all these quantities are kept constant during all tests the nominal advance coefficient of the propeller j j v n d where v is the approach speed of the model n and d are propeller rate of revolution and diameter respectively is 1 05 3 data analysis during a turning circle manoeuvre three different hydrodynamic conditions may be discerned corresponding to the three main sailing situations the approach phase corresponds to the straight ahead navigation when the rudder is at neutral position this can be identified as the design condition with the propeller working in a well defined wake just after the rudder actuation the transient phase starts this phase is characterized by a rapid evolution of hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull and a subsequent complex evolution of the inflow to the propeller when all the forces reach the equilibrium and the wake is fully developed the stabilized phase starts a visual explanation of these phases is depicted in fig 4 in this paper we are interested in the comparison between loads developed during the transient and stabilized phases of free running model test and the simulated quasi steady conditions reproduced in captive tests at cnr inm towing basin transient and stabilized phases are characterized by yaw sway coupled motion which results in a propeller drift angle β p that is different from model drift β see fig 5 to achieve a similar velocity component at the propeller disk captive model tests have to be conducted by setting the towing drift angle β e f f equal to β p in this way although velocity components can be close to the free running ones the hydrodynamics of the inflow cannot be simulated with the same accuracy due to the lack of rotational speed that contributes significantly to the development of hull wake see discussion in section 4 only hydrodynamic forces and moments are discussed as inertial and gravity components have been removed from measured loads collected data are sampled at 5 khz but loads and other correlated data are re sampled according to 360 steps corresponding to a complete revolution of the propeller with one degree of resolution in order to harmonize the outputs and make the data comparable between single blade cycles according to fig 6 the time history of loads has been sliced obtaining a series of single cycles they have been used to obtain a mean cycle of a single run x 1 and its standard deviation σ 1 the mean cycles corresponding to each run have been combined to obtain a representative cycle calculated both by arithmetic and weighted mean x 1 and x 2 respectively which account for deviations due to different and unaccountable error sources like for example the presence of wind or small waves during free running tests a different approach has been adopted for the transient analysis since it is not possible to find a mean because of the nature of the rapid evolution of the inflow that gives rise to fast time varying loads global propeller loads are derived from single blade measurements adopting a procedure that takes into account the relative position of each blade the collected data are not simply time shifted of a fixed value proportional to the angle between the blades but the time history of each blade has been calculated as an interpolation between two subsequent cycles of the reference blade weighted by its relative position on the propeller disk in this way every blade takes into account the time varying nature of the inflow although it has not been possible to capture rapid events that are faster than a complete propeller revolution the analysis of the transient motion concerned a single run test similarly to the steady analysis the cycles of the propeller loads were extracted according to the measure of the phase angle θ and mean value and maximum fluctuation given by the difference among absolute maximum and minimum values were recorded moreover the harmonic analysis was carried out considering different approaches that consisted on the application of fft fast fourier transform on each cycle that is a short time fft with window equal to the cycle without overlap between each segment with reference to fig 7 single blade loads are measured in the so called blade reference frame b superscript this frame rotates with the blade and is centred on the propeller shaft with the x axis pointing forward z pointing radially out of the propeller and the y axis following the right hand rule this frame is primary used to carry out a detailed investigation of single blade loads in relation to wake topology in order to describe global propeller loads the hub frame is introduced this frame is fixed with the model with x axis coincident with blade frame the z axis pointing upwards and y pointing towards portside the angle between b and h frames is indicated with the θ symbol and increasing value are concordant with propeller rotation direction 4 results the comparison of the captive and free running model tests is carried out following a phenomenological perspective aimed to clarify the cause effect relation between the evolution of the inflow and the propeller performance the inflow to the propeller has been calculated by preliminary c f d computations of r a n s reyonolds averaged navier stokes equations fig 8 shows the nominal wake for the rectilinear motion and oblique towing at β 15 and 30 that are representative of weak and tight maneuvers the nominal wake is expressed in terms of colour maps of axial u and vector field of the tangential velocity given the nominal wake the evolution of the loads during a revolution can be inferred synthesizing the blade hydrodynamics with a 2d hydrofoil see fig 9 the figure provides a simple description of blade flow since the self induction velocity system is not represented for clarity n is the propeller rate of revolution per second r is the radial position of a representative section and α is the angle of attack 4 1 wake field discussion the wake fields highlight the asymmetric evolution of the wake that determines the different behavior of the propeller on the leeward side the propeller is affected by the interaction with the wake of the hull whereas on the windward side the inflow progressively evolves to a pure oblique flow in particular the flow around the propeller is characterized by vortical structures that interact with the wake of hull and downstream appendages to yield complex hydrodynamic blade wake interactions albeit the phenomenological details are detailed in the following sections it is propaedeutic to identify these structures namely stabilizer fin vortex fv whose signature is clearly visible on the left right of the windward leeward propeller for the model in straight ahead see fig 8a skeg vortex sv evidenced by the swirling flow for the drift condition at β e f f 15 in fig 8b large mixed vortex mv that is evidence on the right of the leeward propeller at the highest drift angle see fig 8c this structure comes from the interaction of skeg bilge keel not evidenced in these plots and other structures detached from the appendages for example the shaft in general these structures and the features of the wake differently evolve for the three different test conditions considered in this study in this context it has to be pointed out once more that the choice of the equivalent drift angle in correspondence of the propeller plane between pure oblique and free running maneuvers i e β e f f β p satisfies the geometric kinematic condition at the propeller but does not guarantee the equivalence of the inflow to the propellers in fact the pure oblique towing implies a constant drift angle along the hull differently from the free running where the motion is also due to yaw see fig 10 in addition to this it has to be remarked that the effect of motion in the transverse plane roll has been neglected in this analysis as a result during oblique towing the sections ahead of the propeller are impinged at a greater drift angle causing the vortex structures and hydrodynamic interactions to be stronger during downstream convection as well as at a different location with respect to the propeller disk the discrepancies between free running and pure drift propeller in flow conditions can be appreciated in terms of the straightening of the flow the flow straightening is a concept that has been introduced in the context of system based mathematical models of ship maneuvering and physically describes a reduction of the nominal transverse velocity in correspondence of the rudder or the propeller in the present context the concept is addressed for quantifying a mean deflection of the flow at the inlet of the propeller for the pure oblique flow and coupled yaw sway motion that yield a similar β e f f to this purpose the flow straightening is described by the regression model described of ankudinov panel h 10 ship controllability 1993 that according to the authors knowledge is the only one that splits the contributions form the lateral and yaw velocity 1 β h t a n 1 γ v v h γ r ψ x u h where γ v and γ r are the flow straightening coefficients associated to lateral and yaw velocity v h and ψ respectively u h is the axial component of the velocity here assumed to the advance speed of the ship for simplicity and x is the longitudinal distance of the propeller from the centre of rotation β h is the hydrodynamic drift angle in correspondence of the propeller according to panel h 10 ship controllability 1993 the flow straightening coefficients are defined in terms of the macroscopic geometric characteristics of the ship already defined in table 1 2 γ v 1 1 5 b l c b b t 0 5 γ r γ v 0 44 0 22 γ v fig 11 a show the values of the nominal drift angle for couples of sway and yaw velocities the solid marks refer to three conditions β e f f 7 5 15 and 30 where marks along ψ 0 indicate cases in oblique towing while the internal marks identify the free running condition that yields the same β e f f as oblique towing the correspondent values of the effective drift angle for the oblique towing and free running conditions corrected by equation 2 are identified in fig 11b it can be observed that the marks associated to the oblique towing and the correspondent free running maneuver are no more aligned along the same value the results are synthesized in table 5 it can be evidenced that for a similar geometrical drift angle β e f f at the propeller the hydrodynamic one is obviously smaller due to the shadow effect of the hull moreover the two conditions differ by about 20 consistently with the simplified representation in fig 10 it has to be stressed that this estimate is approximate because the effect of speed of the model as well as propeller loading is not accounted for in the formulations of γ v and γ r moreover since the methodology at least for the mean single blade loads can somehow account for these effects by interpolation the discrepancies are in the typical range admitted for a predictive methodology in the preliminary design 4 2 hub propeller loads during oblique towing the origin of the propeller in plane forces and moments is explained in terms of the imbalances of k t x k t y and k t z of the single blade converted in the fixed hub frame of reference between intervals of the period quadrants dubbioso et al 2017 ortolani and dubbioso 2019b see fig 12 specifically k q y and k t y are generated by difference of thrust and side force between the upper 1 s t and 4 t h quadrants u superscript and lower 2 n d and 3 r d quadrants d superscript halves of the disk fig 12 on the other hand k q z and k t z are generated by difference of thrust and side force between the left 1 s t and 2 n d quadrants l superscript and right 3 r d and 4 t h quadrants r superscript halves of the disk dimensionless propeller loads are presented in terms of ratio with respect to the total thrust at v 1 0 which corresponds to fn 0 26 in straight ahead condition and equivalent drift angle β e f f in order to have a consistent comparison with the free running results according to the reference system defined in fig 7 the lateral and vertical components of the radial force are positive when directed to port side and upwards fig 13 shows the in plane loads exerted by the propeller during oblique towing and free running tests for internal and external propeller negative and positive β values respectively while the split contributions from the different halves are showed in fig 14 for a more immediate association with the propeller loading condition the generation of the in plane moments k q y and k q z is described in terms of thrust unbalances namely assuming that the arm of k t x does not change during the cycle a clearer comparison is proposed in fig 15 where only the o t data that correspond to the closer value of speed drop of free running tests are selected the loads are described for the starboard propeller and therefore the inflow field for the windward propeller should be mirrored when referring to the external side in general the outcome of the oblique towing tests highlights that k t y and k q y are more sensitive to propeller loading i e towing speed with respect to vertical force and pitch moment in case of k t y the force reduces in proportion to the decrease of towing speed at all drift angles except for the smallest angles on both internal and external propellers and the trend with drift angle is not similar for all speeds on the contrary the variation of the loads with drift angle is markedly similar for the other components in case of the pitch moment k q y the effect of speed drop increases with the increase of β while in case of vertical force k t z and yaw moment k q z the data collapse about the same value in case of the vertical force the speed drop seems to be important at intermediate drift angle 10 20 on both propellers the trend of the steady turning and in particular the asymmetric behavior is well captured for all the components although discrepancies evidently exist in relation to the speed drop in greater detail the side force k t y experiences an almost linear trend with rudder angle for the windward and leeward propellers see fig 13a in both situations the side force provides a stabilizing effect to the model i e it creates a couple that counteracts the turning motion on the windward side k t y is generated in the lower half of the disk in facts in this sector the load dashed lines increases while it is almost constant in the opposite sector for each velocity see fig 14a this different behavior is consequent to the concurrent effect between the tangential and axial velocity to build up the hydrodynamic load in the lower half the cross flow acts to increase the tangential velocity relative to the foil and consequently the incidence angle this effect is opposite in the upper half the trend revealed by o t highlights that the load in the lower half increases at an higher rate the more the propeller loading is reduced collapsing to a common value at the maximum drift angle probably at higher loading foil efficiency could be reduced due to the onset of stall or other mechanisms associated to the operation of the blades in unsteady regimes in case of s t k t y is always lower than the oblique towing as a consequence of the underload and overload of the lateral force in the lower and upper half of the disk respectively on the leeward side k t y establishes to a lower value with respect to external propeller due to interaction with the wake of the hull in particular the side force is almost constant with β in the upper half of the disk and the effect of speed drop is minimal this is due to the fact that in the upper half of the disk the increase of the speed drop is counterbalanced by the cross flow conversely in the lower half the load diminishes because the cross flow causes the blade section to be impinged with a lower tangential velocity the magnitude of the side force developed during s t orange colored line experiences a local increment on both halves about the β e f f 15 this behavior is driven by the s v with reference to fig 8b it provides a sort of blockage effect on the flow coming from the wind side and interacts locally with the blade in case of the free running the vortex could be weaker and located farther with respect to the leeward propeller in contrast to the one represented in the figure because the skeg is impinged at smaller drift angle as a consequence the cross flow could reach the 2 n d quadrant at higher upwards deflection amplifying the tangential flow relative to the blade sections in this sector with consequent increase of the load these hydrodynamic phenomena also explain the imbalance of k t x that gives rise to the pitch moment on the external propeller k q y is negative i e it acts to bend the propeller shaft on the top pushing downward the propeller since the blades are overloaded in the lower half of the disk see fig 14c in case of o t the thrust resembles the side force namely it grows monotonically in the lower half with drift angle at a rate that is faster the higher the advance velocity this causes the curves trend to collapse at β 30 on the contrary on the upper half k t x is almost constant and the effect of propeller loading is uniform at all β oblique towing overestimates the free running results in particular at the higher drift angles see also fig 15c because the thrust at same speed drop v 0 7 is stronger in the lower half of the disk see fig 14a it can be inferred that in this sector the wake shed from appendages is less deflected to the lee side due the constant drift distribution and the resulting higher local speed which can yield local increase of the load however the trend of k q y is very well captured by o t when considering values at same speed drop on the internal side k q y lifts the propeller given the higher hydrodynamic load exerted in the upper half the trend of o t is very different from the free running in fact k q y at the smallest β is close to the value in straight ahead and it is yet negative then abruptly rises at β 15 and keeps an almost constant value this is associated to the fact that the thrust in the lower half of the disk drops at a considerably higher rate with respect to the upper half on the contrary the pitch moment increases smoothly for the steady turning tests except for the tightest maneuver this behavior can be associated to the fact that the thrust increases only in the upper half while it keeps almost constant in the lower half the vertical force k t z shows a completely different trend between the external and internal propeller see fig 13b in straight ahead motion the vertical force is upwards oriented and correspondent to about 20 of the thrust because in the left half of the disk both the reduction of the axial component of the inflow and the upwards tangential component act to increase the blade loading vice versa on the opposite half the flow is almost clean and being oriented in the same sense of blade motion lessens the tangential component relative to the sections see fig 9 and on its turn the load on the windward propeller k t z drops with an almost linear trend with the increase of β this is consequent to the fact that the magnitude of the force on the right side negative monotonically increases because the blade experiences a relevant cross flow that strengthens the load in the 3 r d quadrant this contribution is only partially canceled in the 4 t h quadrant due to the opposite action of the tangential flow it is interesting to observe that for 7 5 β 15 these contributions are equally balanced the load is almost constant probably because in the 4 t h quadrant the blade encounters the velocity defect associated to the wake of the outer bracket however at larger drift angle the load further increases due to the establishment of the pure oblique flow on the left half of the disk the vertical force is constant due to different mechanisms that depend on the drift angle in facts at smaller β the action of the s v structure induces a tangential flow that being oriented in the same sense of the blade motion weakens the increment of incidence angle of the section caused by the wake of the bracket at the higher drifts i e see fig 8c the unloading due to the cross flow in the 1 s t quadrant balances the load increase in the lower sector the comparison with the separate contributions developed during s t highlights that the source of the discrepancy arises in the 1 s t and 2 n d quadrant with the exception of β 30 this is due to the non consistent evolution of the flow along the model that could give rise to a stronger velocity defect as well as a different contribution from s v and consequently higher loads on the opposite half the vertical force is captured very accurately also in terms of the speed drop these considerations hold to explain the features of the yaw moment k q z see fig 13d in particular the split contribution of k t x and the difference with s t resembles the one discussed for the vertical force see fig 14d briefly the yaw moment in straight ahead is negative and acts to bend the shaft inward then it gradually changes to turn outward the propeller due to load increase in the 3 r d and 4 t h quadrants on the leeward side k t z exhibits a non linear trend see fig 13b specifically it further increases at β 7 5 to a value that is almost 30 and then keeps this value before definitely drop at the maximum drift this behavior resembles the free running model tests although the peak is first achieved than s t as better showed in fig 15b the nature of this non linear behavior can be ascribed to the fact that at the smaller drift angles say 0 θ 7 5 the left right imbalance increases due to the opposite trend of the force developed by the blade specifically on the left half of the disk 1 s t and 2 n d quadrants the vertical force increases because the velocity induced by the onset of s v causes the tangential flow relative to blade section to increase and therefore develop higher load on the opposite half it abruptly drops due to the cross flow in the 3 r d quadrant this event can be inferred from fig 8a and b observing that in the 4 t h the unloading effect of the in plane velocity is similar to the straight ahead upwards oriented to reduce the incidence of the blade sections at higher β the imbalance is gradually mitigated on the left half k t z drops because s v is transported to the lee side and the blade vortex interaction mechanism ends simultaneously its blockage effect dies and the cross flow reduces the incidence angle of the blades in particular in the 2 n d quadrant this mechanism is further strengthened moving to larger drift angles see fig 8c in fact m v deflects the wake shed past the shaft and the low pressure region thus formed deviates downward the cross flow to further reduce the component tangential to blade sections on the right half the vertical force downward oriented gradually increases due to the reduction of axial velocity in the wake past the shaft and the increase of the tangential component induced by m v more specifically it is worth noticing the non linear trend in the range 7 5 β 20 this behavior is associated to the transition and simultaneous evolution of s v for example at β 15 the magnitude of k t z increases because the separation past the shaft causes the outward deflection of the tangential flow and the increase of velocity defect in the 4 t h quadrant then at β 20 it can be inferred that s v increased in size the skeg is impinged at higher incidence and is centred on the propeller disk to induce a tangential flow that is concordant to blade rotation and thus acts to reduce the force of the blades it is worth noticing that this complex behavior on the right half of disk is experienced during s t on the contrary the accordance is poorer on the left half of disk for discrepancies of wake evolution from ahead of the propeller however as a matter of fact the trend of s t is well captured when referring to similar speed drop see fig 15b the trend of the split contribution of k t x resembles that of the vertical force for o t and s t it is interesting to note that the non linear behavior experienced in both tests is experienced at the larger drift angles k q z is always negative i e it acts to bend the propeller shaft outward to the lee side 4 3 transient analysis the analysis of the periodic blade loads during unsteady ship dynamics is considered for the transient phases of a turning circle in this preliminary study the analysis is focused on three different conditions the transient phase t r a at δ 15 and 35 and the pull out p o at δ 35 at the same reference approach speed f n 0 26 of the oblique towing in order to carry out a consistent comparison of the data the analysis is centred on the t r a at δ 35 because it experiences transient states that can be compared to the steady phases for turning circles at all rudder angles tested δ 7 5 35 on the other hand the additional transients are included to study the effects of the different kinematic response and initial condition on the loads the key features of the transient maneuvers are showed in fig 16 in particular fig 16a highlights the segment of the trajectory obtained at δ 35 during which the propeller experiences the same equivalent drift angles identified by square symbols of the steady turning phases obtained at different rudder angles it is interesting to note that this interval covers a longitudinal movement by about two ship lengths about sixty propeller revolution fig 16b shows the dynamic response of the model after the activation of the rudder in terms of yaw rate speed drop and effective drift angle in the pictures time has been replaced by propeller cycles at δ 15 the transient is obviously slower due to the lower control loads and the consequent slower dynamic response of the model in order to relate the nominal propeller functioning regime with the dynamic response of the model the variation of the speed drop with the effective drift angle β e f f is visualized in fig 18 the speed drop is the most meaningful parameter since it can be immediately associated to the nominal propeller advance coefficient j j v a b s nd where n and d are propeller rate of revolution and diameter and hence propeller loading the dynamic response of the model is not reversible during p o in particular the recovery of the speed is markedly slower during the re establishment of the straight ahead motion on the contrary the t r a at δ 15 resembles the same trend of tighter maneuver to provide a brief overview of the underlying features of the effect of transient motion the evolution of the mean values of the single blade thrust and spindle torque developed during the t r a phase of weak and tight maneuvers is reported in fig 17 together with the yaw rate in order to better highlight the effect of the transient motions the maximum fluctuation δ l where l is the generic load of the load developed during each blade revolution is inspected the maximum fluctuation is the peak to peak value of the load during a cycle the loads are reported in terms of ratio with respect to the thrust and torque in the approach phase as the rudder is activated the mean values and the fluctuations evolve asymmetrically on the windward and leeward sides for the internal propeller the trend is smoother with respect to the external propeller with the exception of a very short interval almost 10 cycles after the start of the maneuver on the windward propeller the trend resembles the same two slope feature observed in a previous study for a similar twin screw ortolani et al 2015b with the exception of the spindle torque at δ 35 this behavior is strictly associated to the velocity induced by the motion as it can be deduced by the evolution of the yaw rate and the fact that the maximum values establish almost at the same instant on the contrary the behavior on the internal side is slower due to the interaction with the wake however the evolution of the maximum fluctuation is markedly affected by the rate of turn during the weaker maneuver the blade on the internal side develops the largest fluctuation that is almost 300 immediately after the activation of the rudder and exceeds by 50 and 100 the one on the opposite side for the thrust and spindle torque respectively moreover on the internal side the maximum value is achieved considerably before the stabilization of the yaw rate on the contrary at δ 35 the fluctuation converge to comparable values it increases by almost 40 and 10 with respect to the previous maneuver on the external and internal side respectively note that at the first instances of the transient the growth rate is faster for the internal propeller and the peak exceeds the stabilized value of the external propeller the gradual increase of the maximum fluctuation experienced by the blade on the windward side is consistent to the disturbance induced by an oblique flow as demonstrated by the top bottom difference of the load showed in fig 14 on the contrary on the internal side the phenomenon is driven by the viscous dominated character of the wake the analysis of the transient and the comparison with the equivalent quasi steady data is proposed in terms of equivalent drift angle instead of time for the sake of improving the readability of the comparison with oblique towing and the steady turning phase values before continuing it is important to remark the fundamental implications of the transient motion on the evolution of the wake these aspects need to be highlighted in order to understand the nature of the discrepancy of the transient loads with respect to the quasi steady conditions s t and o t since the use of the wake fields in fig 8 is anyway considered for this purpose in particular given the similarity of a maneuvering hull with a low aspect ratio wing at incidence during a transient motion the wake past the hull is altered with respect to a steady condition by the so called circulatory and non circulatory effects these are associated to the temporal variation of the lateral force that causes the time varying circulation of wake structures detached from it and added mass effects respectively moreover the size and intensity of the vortical structure is different as a consequence of the discrepancy of the absolute velocity associated to speed drop see fig 19 in fact the intensity of the vortex is proportional to the lift that on its turn is proportional to the product of incidence angle i e drift and squared absolute speed therefore vortices detached during transient characterized by lower speed drop are stronger and bigger than the correspondent ones generated during the quasi steady cases in the following analysis only this effect and added mass are considered to infer the discrepancies of the periodic blade loads given the unknown of the time scale of memory effect of circulation 4 3 1 mean loads and maximum fluctuation the averaged mean values of single blade thrust bending and spindle moment for the transients maneuvers are showed in fig 20 figures on the left side refer to the internal propeller in general in case of both propellers k t x and k q y during the t r a phase at both rudder angles well overlap with each other and the steady turning values black circle see fig 20a and b the transient loads are slightly higher than the steady phase during the early stages i e at β e f f 8 4 this fact can be associated to the sway yaw response of the model that can contribute to the different establishment of the wake and moreover on the speed drop in fact fig 18 highlights that after the activation of the rudder the model experiences a sudden deceleration that causes higher propeller loading during the p o the thrust and bending moment are markedly higher with respect to t r a and steady turning phases at the same β e f f this behavior has to be ascribed to the fact that the velocity slowly grows after the activation of the rudder it remains below 0 8 up to β e f f 10 and consequently the propeller operates at a lower equivalent advance coefficient this behavior is consistent with the fact that k t x and k q y are in between the loads of the oblique towing tests at v a b s 0 7 and 0 8 up to β e f f 10 for both internal and external propeller the evolution of the loads is different for the two propellers on the internal side they gradually increase up to β e f f 10 and then drop in particular the loads show a faster increase for 10 β e f f 20 well reproduced by the o t tests that can be associated to the change of morphology of the wake from fully separated to the reformation of smaller and coherent structures that pass through the propeller disk on the other hand on the external side the loads monotonically decrease with a faster rate for β e f f 10 the closer inspection of the trends also reveals the wake propeller interaction phenomenon about β e f f 15 by the slight increment of the load the mean values of the spindle torque during the t r a is in accordance with the steady turning values see fig 20c in this case the values during the p o are lower with respect to the t r a at δ 35 as a consequence of the fact that the hydrodynamic centre of blade load moves towards inner sections and given skewed shape of the blade it moves toward the leading edge i e the spindle axis to yield a smaller value of the moment arm ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a both transient and steady state values are underestimated by o t although the trend with increasing β e f f and speed drop is captured as discussed in ortolani et al 2020 and at the beginning of the section the discrepancies can be associated to localized alteration of the wake due to the constrained attitude of the model during the oblique towing in this sense small variations of loading distribution can have a noticeable effect on the spindle moment as expected the behavior of the maximum fluctuation of the loads developed by the internal and external propeller is markedly asymmetric considering the transient maneuvers δ l is stronger during the t r a phase with respect to the pull out at δ 35 because the propeller operates at lower loading and consequently it is more sensitive to spatial gradients and temporal fluctuations of the inflow see fig 21 in contrast to the mean values δ l experienced during the t r a is affected by the severity of the maneuver i e rudder angle and the most critical conditions are experienced by the internal propeller although the maximum value of δ l is similar for the two propellers it grows at a faster rate than the external propeller at lower β e f f as a consequence of the interaction with the wake by an alternative perspective the internal propeller would experience stronger fluctuation during weaker maneuvers this is corroborated by the t r a at δ 15 the maximum fluctuation on the leeward propeller being 25 higher than the windward one in more details on the internal side the evolution of the signal is qualitatively similar at both rudder angles immediately after the activation of the rudder δ l smoothly grows for smaller drift angles probably because the planar velocities are slow and the modification of the wake are not relevant after the signal abruptly increases for a relatively short interval of the drift angle about 8 and then flattens out prior to achieve the stabilized value it is worth noticing that the slope of the signal at δ 15 weakens before that of the tighter maneuver because the transient is close to its end and accelerations are going to die out during the p o the evolution of the absolute fluctuation is smoother given higher equivalent advance coefficient of the propeller on the external side the evolution of the fluctuation during t r a is smoother with respect for the internal side in particular the grow rate is almost linear and then stabilizes at the smaller rudder angle the fluctuation stabilizes at almost the same drift angle observed for the internal propeller β e f f 10 conversely at δ 35 the fluctuation monotonically grows up to β e f f 24 and the plateau is markedly shorter during the p o δ l initially drops at an higher rate with respect to t r a up to β e f f 15 and then slowly converges to the straight ahead value 4 3 2 periodic loads the evolution of the periodic single blade thrust and spindle torque during the transient maneuvers are reported in figs 23 26 and are compared with steady turning and oblique towing loads to further explain the discrepancies discussed in the previous paragraphs to support the cause and effect link between the loads and the inflow the wake patterns showed in fig 8a c are considered in a dynamic fashion and the generation of the loads are discussed synthesizing the blade hydrodynamics with 2d hydrofoil theory fig 9 on the internal propeller k t x generated during t r a at β e f f 8 4 increases in the upper half of the disk and drops in the lower half of the disk with respect to rectilinear condition orange colored line see fig 23a on the left in more detail in straight ahead the signal features two peaks at θ 45 and 120 caused by the perturbation of the bracket and velocity gradients of the hull wake axial velocity defect and upwards component respectively ortolani et al 2020 from the early stage of the transient only the peak about θ 100 is visible in fact the lateral flow induced by the motion deflects the boundary layer of the hull to the leeward side causing the increase the incidence of the blades during the passage in the 1 s t in the lower half 90 θ 270 the cross flow acts to reduce the load it being oriented in the same sense of blade rotation although the trend agrees with s t and o t the most evident discrepancies are experienced in the upper half of the disk as a consequence of the perturbation from s v already mentioned in section 4 2 see fig 8b and added mass effect in fact with respect to s t dashed line the velocity defect past the inner bracket is stronger because the equivalent sections of the foil are thicker due to added mass on the other hand s v and velocity defect are stronger for the reported condition of o t because it is generated at higher absolute speed and incidence angle constant along the appendages as a result in the upper half of the disk the blade would be affected by a stronger tangential flow that increases the hydrodynamic incidence of the blades these effects are amplified at β e f f 15 5 fig 23b because the acceleration of the model is yet higher and the differences in absolute speed with respect to s t increased in fact the peak of k t x experienced during t r a at θ 45 associated to the interaction of the blade with s v is 10 stronger with respect to the oblique towing and steady turning see fig 8b since the speed drop is markedly smaller than the s t and o t this structure is stronger and hence its disturbance moreover the growth rate of the load is faster also because the lighter loading condition causes the blade to be more sensitive to velocity gradients on the contrary k t x in the lower half of the disk is smaller since the cross flow oriented to reduce the flow incidence of the blade sections is higher in the 4 t h quadrant k t x experiences a faster grow rate with respect to s t probably because the blade encounters a stronger velocity defects past the shaft and outer brackets θ 340 due to both added mass effect and faster cross flow in the sector 180 θ 360 during o t the thrust is higher probably because the inflow is characterized by a more complex wake with strong reduction of axial velocity originated by the constant value of β e f f at β e f f 22 4 fig 23c the evolution of the loads is driven by the complex flow field that results from the interplay between s v and the wake of appendages this interaction gives rise to m v that is the counterclockwise rotating swirling flow that is lee positioned with respect to the propeller at the maximum drift angle see fig 8c at this drift angle m v is in between position reported in the figures plausibly almost centred with the propeller disk and globally induces a velocity field that is concordant with the rotation of the blades a plausible situation of the vortex field affecting the leeward propeller is visualized in fig 22 muscari et al 2017 and it is considered in the following discussion during t r a the cross flow and m v are stronger with respect to s t due to the higher absolute speed lower speed drop as a consequence of the stronger interaction with m v the wake shed from the brackets is disrupted and the velocity defect is amplified moreover it is reduced with respect to β 15 5 because the overloading effect of the cross flow is counteracted by the contribution of m v therefore k t x is greater than s t for a portion of the 1 s t quadrant 0 θ 60 although the propeller loading is nominally lighter in this sector blade thrust grows at a larger rate that culminates to the peak at θ 90 this fact can be associated to the interaction of the blade with the wake shed past the external shaft as it can be clearly evidenced from fig 22 during steady motion panel on the right the vortex system detached from the windward shaft made of intertwined longitudinal and transverse structures features seems larger with respect to the one developed during t r a moreover in this case the longitudinal structures can be engulfed by the stronger m v during the blade passage in the 2 n d and 3 r d quadrants k t x is lower than s t because the tangential flow relative to the blade sections is reduced by the stronger cross flow further enhanced by the induced velocity of m v moreover in the 4 t h quadrant it is interesting to observe that the interaction of the blade with the wake of the shaft and brackets during t r a is strengthened with respect to s t as proved by the abrupt increase of the load in the two sectors 280 θ 320 and 320 θ 360 during o t k t x exhibits the same trend of the peak for the transient maneuver see sequence of left panels in fig 23b and c however it seems smoother because the wake generated by the constant distribution of β e f f along hull and appendages could break further the coherency to give onset to swirling flow characterized by larger spatial scales as discussed for the previous case this can also cause a stronger velocity defect that causes the blade to operate at lower equivalent advance coefficient and hence develop higher thrust in the remaining sector of the cycle at β 28 4 fig 23d during s t the peak of k t x reduces and shifts to lower phase angle θ 50 this reduction is probably ascribed to the effect of m v see fig 8c the induced velocity downward oriented acts to weaken the tangential flow from the wind side and counteracts the leeward convection of the wake of the inner bracket it is interesting to observe that the trend is quantitatively analogous during t r a although in that case the signal is characterized by two peaks at θ 45 and 90 the first peak is more definite probably because the velocity defect past the inner bracket is thinner in fact as a consequence of the lower speed drop both the magnitude and the perturbation of m v and cross flow are stronger than s t on one side the cross flow pushes the wake past the bracket to the leeward side while on the other m v blocks it analogously the second fluctuation about θ 90 can be associated to a stronger velocity defect induced by the wake past the external shaft in this case the shaft structures are not entrapped and disrupted by m v since it is farther from the disk the signature of shaft structures can be grasped in fig 8c in the 4 t h quadrant the velocity induced by m v is oppositely oriented with respect to the blade motion and therefore acts to increase the load moreover m v is stronger during transient given the lower speed drop this is confirmed by the fact that k t x is smaller during t r a with respect to s t and rises abruptly after the interaction with the wake past the shaft in case of the oblique towing m v could be formed by the merging of stronger structures given by the globally higher incidence along the hull in turns its effect perturbs the whole inflow distribution over the disk more critically causing k t x to be higher in the lower half of the period in the remaining interval of the cycle the trend of the loads is similar to the previous case fig 23c given the almost similar perturbation induced by this coherent structure on the external side the interaction is essentially dominated by the cross flow induced by the motion as demonstrated by the sinusoidal trend of the signal with no evidence of phase shifts for the cases considered the blade experiences the maximum value in the lower half of the cycle where the cross flow is opposed to blade rotation and the flow impinges the blades with an higher angle of attack however the interaction between the blade and wake structures can be evidenced in particular at smaller drift angles and differences between the evolution of the loads can be more directly ascribed to mismatch of speed drop and wake formation past the hull and appendages in more details at β e f f 8 4 k t x developed during t r a and s t are very similar to each other see fig 23a on the right panel in the 1 s t quadrant the load gradually increases because the component of the cross flow tangential to the section of the blades that acts to mitigate the incidence angle reduces and at the same time the blade is going to interact with the wake of the inner bracket clearly visible in fig 8b since the blade loading is lighter during t r a the thrust is smaller and when the blade interacts with the wake of the bracket at about θ 45 it experiences a more severe oscillation with respect to s t on the other hand albeit the different speed drop the thrust of t r a is almost coincident with s t in the lower half of the disk 90 θ 270 since the accelerations are dominant in the early stages of the transient it can be inferred that the flow is deflected and more accelerated by the added mass carried by the shaft therefore the blade foils are impinged by a stronger tangential flow that being opposite to blade rotation further increases the load in the 4 t h quadrant k t x decreases because both the axial and tangential components of the wake act to reduce the load the discrepancy between the blade thrust developed during t r a and s t can be motivated in addition to the propeller loading with the different interaction with f v vortex from the wake field showed in fig 8a it can be inferred that this vortex at smaller drift angle is yet coherent and being counterclockwise induces a tangential flow oriented with blade rotation that reduces the blade load this effect is magnified during the transient and oblique towing in the former case f v is stronger with respect to s t as a consequence of the higher absolute velocity of the model on the other hand during o t f v being detached with higher incidence due to the constant drift distribution is convected more inward to trigger stronger interaction with the wall and wake of the brackets finally it can be observed that in the sector 90 θ 130 k t x developed during o t is lower than the steady turning due to localized differences of the wake caused by the constant distribution of drift angle at β e f f 15 5 the t r a and s t differ in the last half of the 4 t h quadrant due to disparity of propeller loading in the remaining interval of the period the two loads almost coincide as in the previous case k t x generated during o t is strongest in the upper half of the disk due to increment of velocity defect associated to the constant distribution of the drift angle at β e f f 22 4 the remarkable discrepancy between t r a and s t is caused by propeller loading the difference of speed being higher than 20 see fig 18 finally at β e f f 28 4 the t r a is lower than s t phase in the whole period due to the higher advance speed and lighter propeller loading except close to the peak because of the added mass effect of the shaft that acts to increase the tangential flow relative to the blade sections on the other hand during o t k t x is always higher with respect to free running because the differences on the evolution of the wake field are further triggered by the different drift distribution the behavior of the spindle torque is reported in fig 24 for the sake of completeness in general the trend of k q z is consistent with propeller loading and its variation according to the simplified model already introduced in ortolani and dubbioso 2019b dubbioso and ortolani 2020 for a skewed blade in fact k q z decreases in contrast to the growth of propeller loading that is the hydrodynamic centre tends to move to the inward sections and to the leading edge see the sign convention in fig 7 in this case the t r a seems in very good agreement with the s t in contrast to the oblique towing tests in general the t r a and s t deviates for the external propeller at β e f f 22 4 fig 24c because the highest difference in speed drop i e propeller loading the poorer quantitative accordance between o t and the free running results stresses that this load can be very sensitive to alterations of the wake field associated to the constant drift distribution the evolution of the single blade thrust and spindle torque evolution during the p o phase of the turning circle at δ 35 are showed in figs 25 and 26 respectively in the plots the cycle experienced during the t r a is also included to better highlight the discrepancies and at the same time to better highlight the differences of the cause and effect analysis the oblique tests are not discussed since these can be deduced by the reader on the basis of the following considerations in general the matching of the p o with steady condition is less satisfactory than the t r a because the relative difference of propeller loading and speed drop is further amplified see fig 18 in facts the loads developed during p o and s t at varying β e f f diverge over the cycle by an amount that is comparable to the discrepancy between the correspondent speed drop showed in fig 18 however on the internal propeller the consequences of speed drop combines with stronger propeller wake interaction this is evident for example at β e f f 22 4 although the propeller is highly loaded during the pull out in the 1 s t quadrant the trend of k t x matches with s t according to the role played by s v specifically s v impinges the disk in the 1 s t quadrant on the basis of the behavior of the in plane loads discussed in section 4 2 and at the same time it is weaker and smaller with respect to s t as a consequence of the lower absolute speed hence it induces a slower tangential velocity and consequently lower increment of angle of attack and load with respect to steady turning moreover the weaker blockage of s v during p o provokes in combination with the added mass of the shaft the upwards deflection of the cross flow about θ 90 to be weaker with consequent reduction of the developed thrust these effects drive also the behavior of the blade loads at β e f f 15 5 see fig 26b on the left panel in the 1 s t quadrant the peaks of k t x during t r a and p o are oppositely phase shifted with respect to the steady turning phase in more details during p o the peak of k t x is phase shifted with respect to s t that is opposite to t r a in case of p o s v is weaker and smaller as well as its blockage effect thus the cross flow evolves in between the vortex and the shaft more upwards inclined causing the blade to be impinged by a faster tangential flow at greater θ with respect to the analogous situation during t r a this phenomenon seems consistent with the phase shift of the fluctuation of k t x in the 4 t h quadrant during t r a and p o see fig 25b that can be ascribed to the interaction of the blade with the wake shed past the shaft in fact as a consequence of the different inclination with which the cross flow impacts the propeller shaft the sector with minimal tangential velocity and velocity defect visible in the 4 t h quadrant in fig 8b would be crossed over by the blade at different azimuth finally at β e f f 8 4 the trend of the loads is markedly similar although the deviation of the mean value is caused by the different loading state of the propeller during s t and t r a the trend is different in the 4 t h quadrant probably because in this sector the blade is less sensitive to unsteady interaction with the wake shed by the shaft and starboard bracket on the external propeller the same qualitative considerations provided for the t r a hold the similarity of the trend of the signal and their phase alignment stress the dominant effect of speed drop while differences ascribed to wake evolution matter locally this is proved by the fact that the deviation of p o is almost constant during all the cycle and it resembles the same trend of the percentage discrepancy of the speed drop reported in fig 18 the results of the spindle torque reported in fig 26 for the sake of completeness essentially confirm the same behavior observed for the t r a phase in particular the sensitivity of this load to the loading state of the blade the correlation between its trend and the propeller loading i e thrust is left to the reader following the mentioned simplified model ortolani and dubbioso 2019a finally the impact of the severity of the maneuver on the evolution of the blade loads is analyzed by the comparison of transient phases correspondent to the turning maneuvers at δ 15 t r a 15 and 35 t r a 35 see figs 27 and 28 the general inspection of the behavior of k t x emphasizes that the most evident discrepancy between the two transients is experienced by the internal propeller due to interactions with the wake see fig 27a on the left in particular during t r a 15 at β e f f 8 4 k t x experiences a peak that is stronger with respect to the tightest maneuver by almost 20 this is probably consequent to the fact that s v is more coherent due to the lower speed drop high speed of the model at same equivalent drift as a consequence the tangential velocity induced in the 1 s t quadrant is stronger and amplifies the hydrodynamic incidence of the blades at the same time in the 4 t h quadrant the blade develops lower thrust probably because the upward distortion of the incoming cross flow due to added mass of the propeller shaft is weaker due to smaller lateral acceleration at the highest drift angle β e f f 15 5 k t x generated during t r a 15 matches with the s t because the motion is establishing the steady phase of the turn similarly in case of the external propeller as a consequence of the weaker phenomena related to blade wake interactions with respect to the internal propeller the signals are in better agreement with each other and converge to the steady state at the highest drift angle the trend of the spindle torque is consistent with the loading state of the blade see fig 28 as stressed for the other manuevering conditions k q z developed during o t captures the trend of the free running maneuvers although it is shifted in mean value due to the higher sensitivity to alteration of the wake as well as the constrained motion in the transverse plane 4 3 3 harmonic analysis the harmonic analysis of k t x developed during s t t r a and o t is reported in fig 29 for the conditions at β e f f 15 the harmonic content of the signal is dominated by tonal components multiples of the blade passing frequency b p f in the low frequency interval of the spectrum consistently with the fact that the cavitation phenomena were absent and the evolution of the time histories discussed in the previous section the harmonics drop abruptly and the signals are dominated by the 1 s t and 2 n d bpf for this reason the detailed evolution of the amplitude of the harmonics of single blade thrust and spindle torque is showed only for the 1 s t and 2 n d bpf in figs 30 and 31 respectively it is evident that the blade loads are dominated by the 1 s t bpf given the similar trends of δ l and the harmonics when comparing figs 21 and 30 this is also corroborated by their relative magnitude from the transient and steady state values the 1 s t bpf is almost four and three times larger than the 2 n d bpf on the external and internal propeller respectively on the external side the harmonics of k t x and k q z increase monotonically with the increase of the β e f f conversely on the internal side the trend is non linear the magnitude establishing 1 s t bpf or decreasing after β e f f 20 these trends are confirmed by the oblique towing tests in general it is interesting to observe that the discrepancy between the harmonics associated to different propeller loading smoothly increases for 1 s t bpf on the external propeller whereas it is markedly stronger for the second component for both external and internal propellers the deviations with the transient and steady state results are consistent with those observed for the absolute fluctuation in general it can be evidenced that for the external propeller and the 2 n d bpf of the internal one the free running data fall inside the band spanned by o t for both blade thrust and spindle torque see panels on the right in figs 30 and 31 conversely the 1 s t bpf of thrust and spindle torque developed by the blade of the internal propeller is under predicted at highest drift angles 5 conclusions and further works the present work complemented the investigation concerning the systematic analysis of single blade loads obtained by oblique towing tests and their comparison with measures obtained by free running maneuvers dubbioso and ortolani 2020 these investigations were conceived to gain a very detailed insight in the propeller performance in maneuvering conditions and collect quantitative data for validation of advanced c f d solvers as well as for the development and enhancement of simplified tools for taking into consideration realistic and off design operative conditions since the earlier stages of ship design the single blade loads measured by captive model tests were first analyzed and compared to the quasi steady phase of free running turning maneuvers in terms of hub components that are related to structural strength of the propulsive shaft and to the dynamic response of the ship providing non negligible maneuvering forces in this case the captive model tests provided a further insight on the generation of the loads due to propeller loading the blade loads obtained with captive model tests are in good agreement with steady turning regime obtained by free running test in terms of absolute values and split contribution of the source loads over halves of the disk in particular the behavior on the external propeller is accurately reproduced on the other hand a more evident discrepancy was revealed on the internal propeller as a consequence of the expected different evolution of the wake for the two kind of tests nevertheless the non linear evolution of the loads associated to complex blade wake interaction and hydrodynamic interference is captured the second issue of the investigation was concerned with transient maneuvers in particular the single blade loads generated during transient phases of the turning circle namely the initial transient at δ 15 and 35 and the pull out for the tightest maneuver were considered and then compared with captive tests the analysis emphasized that the loads developed during transitory phases differ with respect to the quasi steady conditions considered at equivalent drift angle the main reason of the discrepancy is associated to speed drop that determines both the propeller loading condition on one side and on the other the evolution of the vortical structures detached from the hull and their consequent interaction with the wake of the appendages the problem on the internal propeller is the most critical because the blades always rotate in a strongly perturbed flow in contrast to the windward side where the interactions are substantially weaker given the similarity with a pure oblique flow in general the study showed that on the leeward side the maximum fluctuation of the single blade load is stronger for the first transient of the turning circle i e t r a with respect to steady turning i e s t while during the pull out the fluctuation are smaller than s t conversely the averaged values developed during t r a are closer with respect to the steady conditions while they are amplified during pull out this fact stresses that the evolution of the wake of the hull affects more the propeller performance during t r a phases since the discrepancy in terms of speed drop and hence propeller loads with respect to s t is smaller than p o qualitatively the same trend is observed for the external propeller although the p o and t r a depart almost equally from the loads developed in steady turn given the minimal interference with the wake also in this case the captive model tests capture very satisfactorily the behavior of the propeller in terms of mean value maximum fluctuation and periodic load this result confirms that captive model tests typically used in ship hydrodynamics to characterize hull loads maneuvering can be equally useful to achieve systematic quantification of propeller performance in this regard captive model tests demanding simpler set up and structural devices are cheaper than free running tests and can be therefore considered at earlier stages of the design this is a key point for the enhancement of system based models that make possible to consider off design and realistic operative conditions in the optimization design loop obviously the present conclusion needs further validation with a broader set of unsteady maneuvers in this regard the systematic analysis of a broad set of single blade loads developed during a thorough set of free running maneuvers that considers also fully unsteady maneuvers standard and non standard zig

20538,off design and realistic operative conditions of the propulsion system have been progressively considered a frontier topic for the development of novel and successful design procedures the availability of high accurate data on propeller performance both experimental or numerical is pivotal for the development of reliable tools and the enhancement of traditional ones in this context this paper continues the investigation described in ortolani et al 2020 that was dedicated to analyze the single blade loads obtained by oblique towing tests and assess their consistency with those measured during the steady turning phase reproduced by free running model tests in this paper the same analysis is broadened to two aspects at first the in plane forces and moments that are obtained by a conversion from the rotating frame of the measure to the fixed frame are discussed these loads need quantification because they are the primary cause of damages of the shafting structure vibratory loads and also contribute to dynamic response of the ship then the study is switched to the comparison of single blade loads during transient motions of the turning maneuvers at weak and tight rudder angles performed at the same reference speed as the captive model test the analysis lays the basis for the enhancement of ship system comprehensive mathematical models already used in ship design to real time analysis of vibratory loads and emitted noise keywords propeller performance in off design single blade loads propeller loads oblique towing transient maneuvers 1 introduction the more stringent requirements imposed by international regulations for low environmental emissions noise continuity of operation at sea comfort and safety boosted in the last decades research on the ship performance during realistic and off design conditions ship propulsion was certainly one of the topic which attracted more research given its pivotal role in the success of a design due to its strict connection with propulsive efficiency hull structural strength and noise emission the standard design of the propeller consists on the maximization of its performance hydrodynamic efficiency cavitation noise with respect to straight advance and calm water however real world is different from being ideal and maneuvering motion in waves up to heavy off design conditions completely alter the flow field around the hull and hence the inflow to the propeller as a matter of fact this causes the loads developed by the single blades and the propeller to be markedly different from the optimal condition they where designed for for example recent experimental studies on free running maneuvering model test ortolani et al 2015a showed for the case of twin screw configuration that during maneuvering abrupt overloading of thrust and torq c o 2 ue up to 100 in contrast to the value in rectilinear motion occurs and non negligible forces and moments acting in the plane of the propeller develop a further outcome of these activities confirmed by unsteady c f d computational fluid dynamic simulations dubbioso et al 2017 muscari et al 2017 was the fact that maneuvers at small drift angle could be as critical as tighter ones in these situations the combination of low propeller loading and detachment of coherent structures convected through the propeller disk causes very complicated propeller wake interactions that yielded strong peaks for the in plane loads in turns the onset of these phenomena amplifies side effects such as propeller hull induced vibratory loads pressure pulses and noise emission that during transient motions can be further exacerbated on these basis to move a further step forward to deeply understand and quantify these complex hydrodynamic mechanisms a novel set up ortolani and dubbioso 2020 based on the measure of three forces and moments exerted by the single blade of the propulsor has been installed and successfully tested on a twin screw model for free running maneuvering model tests ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a the availability of cycle resolved blade loads further highlighted that the fluctuation of the thrust and tangential force with respect to the averaged one can be of the order of 100 whereas the magnitude and fluctuation of spindle moment can markedly exceed by 300 the mean value that results in rectilinear motion the correlation of single blade forces and bearing forces confirmed that the onset of peaks for the vertical force can be ascribed to steep gradient of the inflow moreover in plane yaw and pitching moments can achieve values of the same order of torque in straight motion during maneuvering at the maximum rudder angle accounting for these conditions at an analysis level or in the design loop is a very challenging issue because they are associated to very complex flow phenomena massive flow separation ventilation and cavitation that demand the use of advanced numerical or experimental techniques to complement the capability of established approaches in traditional design gaggero et al 2019 although advanced c f d techniques have reached high level of maturity and reliabilty to solve extremely complex phenomena their validation to correctly predict single blade and propeller loads in these conditions has not been yet completed according to the authors knowledge on the other hand free running model testing is yet probably the most reliable approach to investigate these problems in particular those related to transient motions however these kind of tests are usually performed during the latest stages of the design and are not practically included in the design loop and moreover the required facilities are not commonly affordable to researchers and engineers in contrast to indoor towing tanks as a matter of fact these approaches are too expensive and impractical to adopt in earlier design stages where massive evaluation of geometric configurations are considered and at least can be used for analysis of a limited set or the final geometry on the contrary a broad set of off design conditions maneuvering and safety maneuvers can be analyzed by captive model testing in traditional towing tanks additionally these kind of tests are more suited to systematic investigations for developing parametric description of the physical phenomena in this context in order to inspect the feasibility of captive model tests to reproduce the behavior of the propeller in off design the single blade loads measured during the steady turning motion of free running model ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a were compared to oblique towing tests for a twin screw model ortolani et al 2020 specifically the tests consisted in systematic analysis of a broad set of drift angles up to 30 and speed drops comparable to those experienced in the stabilized phase of the turn the analysis showed that the comparison of blade thrust and spindle moment in terms of equivalent drift angle and nearest speed drop was very satisfactory and the discrepancies were mainly ascribed to the distribution of the drift angle along the hull that could have determined differences in the evolution of the flow relying on the same experimental benchmark of captive and free running tests the present work broadens the previous analysis ortolani et al 2020 to two topics the first issue focuses on the comparative study of the in plane loads obtained from the conversion of the rotating to the fixed frame while the second task concerns the loads developed during transient maneuvers in order to corroborate the validity of captive model tests and their consistency with general maneuvers the analysis relied on the phenomenological link between the loads and the nominal wake obtained by preliminary c f d simulations in relation to ship design the use of captive model tests has practical implication for a remarkable enhancement of comprehensive models these are semi empirical tools used to describe in a multidisciplinary fashion the behavior of a marine vehicle in realistic operative conditions and off design since physical phenomena are modeled by physical based laws enhanced by parametric experimental data these solvers allow real time results and therefore they are an attractive solution to complement existing tools in the optimization loop the use of these tools spread to the analysis of the interaction of prime mover with propulsion system during maneuvers coraddu et al 2013 motion in waves saettone et al 2020 up to the design of alternative control laws of the control system in off design altosole and martelli 2017 vrijdag et al 2010 fig 1 sketches an example of a typical flow chart for these tools in this particular case for ship maneuvering in brief once the geometries and the operative conditions are given in input the solver evaluates the dynamic response of the ship integrating the rigid body motion equation the forcing terms are represented by the hydrodynamic loads acting on the main elements of the ship i e hull rudder and propeller described by parametric laws function of ship s speed and acceleration moreover the propeller operative condition revolution pitch depends on the dynamic behavior of the prime mover and the action of the control law in fact observing the sketch depicted in fig 1 the standard modeling of the propeller relies on the use on the open water characteristics of the propeller to yield the thrust and torque for the solution of the motion and engine dynamic equations these information guide the operation of the propulsion control unit to automatically modify the operative input fuel rate propeller pitch or rudder angle or interact in real time with the pilot helmsman and alternatively are crucial for the optimization of its gains coefficients during its design on the other hand an alternative modeling strategy consists of the implementation of cycle resolved single blade loads in terms of kinematic condition of the model drift angle and speed drop and geometric characteristics of the blade i e pitch to diameter ratio not considered in this study as showed in the figure at each time step of the simulation the single blade loads can be obtained from interpolation of the cycles about the operating condition the resolution of the complete set of loads developed by the blade allows to describe accurately the propeller contribution to the dynamic response of the ship and in particular analyze critical design aspects associated to vibration and emitted noise that can be noticeably altered during realistic operative conditions ortolani and dubbioso 2020 dubbioso et al 2020 as well as providing a useful guide for the sizing of the shaft and bearings to avoid failures in critical situations hard over turn ventilation 2 test case and experimental set up the experimental activity was performed on a fast twin screw propeller scaled model and its main dimensions are reported in table 1 it is equipped with two inward rotating five bladed propellers as shown in fig 2 the model is characterized by a v shaped stern and it is equipped with several appendages as two couples of stabilizer fins bilge keels a small skeg a couple of horn rudders and brackets supporting the shaft line the results discussed in this paper derive from two experimental campaigns free running self propelled maneuvering tests that were performed at cnr inm maneuvering basin and captive oblique towing tests that were carried out in the rectilinear towing tank details of the model and device set up for the two different experimental approaches are provided in the mentioned literature and are omitted for the sake of brevity it is worth to stress that both setups include a novel system that provides the measure of the full set of loads i e three forces and three moments acting on a single blade of the starboard propeller this has been achieved by manufacturing a custom propeller which houses a commercial six components transducer attached at the root of one of the blades analog signals are transmitted to the on board acquisition system by a special low noise slip ring and a shielded cable passing through the hollow shaft as depicted in fig 3 the calibration range and uncertainties of the transducer have been provided by the manufacturer and reported in table 2 for the sake of completeness the aim of this paper is the comparison of propeller loads developed during the different phases of a turning circle maneouver performed in free running test with the loads measured in captive model test at fixed drift angle with the purpose of reproducing a similar operative condition for the stabilized phase of the turning and simulate quasi steady conditions for transient phases i e start of the evolution and pull out phase the basic idea is to evaluate the possibility and asses the reliability to mimic hydrodynamic condition of a complex test as is a free running model campaign by an easier more controlled and cheaper in terms of costs and time experimental activity the test conditions of the free running and captive model tests is reported in table 3 and table 4 respectively each condition has been repeated at list five times the transient maneuvers concern the initial transient and the pull out phase for the turning circle performed at maximum rudder angle δ 35 and the transient phase of the turning circle performed at δ 15 the nominal advance speed corresponds to froude number f n 0 26 and reynolds number r e 1 053 e 7 propeller angular speed is set at the model self propulsion point in order to mimic the propeller functioning during free running model tests and all these quantities are kept constant during all tests the nominal advance coefficient of the propeller j j v n d where v is the approach speed of the model n and d are propeller rate of revolution and diameter respectively is 1 05 3 data analysis during a turning circle manoeuvre three different hydrodynamic conditions may be discerned corresponding to the three main sailing situations the approach phase corresponds to the straight ahead navigation when the rudder is at neutral position this can be identified as the design condition with the propeller working in a well defined wake just after the rudder actuation the transient phase starts this phase is characterized by a rapid evolution of hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull and a subsequent complex evolution of the inflow to the propeller when all the forces reach the equilibrium and the wake is fully developed the stabilized phase starts a visual explanation of these phases is depicted in fig 4 in this paper we are interested in the comparison between loads developed during the transient and stabilized phases of free running model test and the simulated quasi steady conditions reproduced in captive tests at cnr inm towing basin transient and stabilized phases are characterized by yaw sway coupled motion which results in a propeller drift angle β p that is different from model drift β see fig 5 to achieve a similar velocity component at the propeller disk captive model tests have to be conducted by setting the towing drift angle β e f f equal to β p in this way although velocity components can be close to the free running ones the hydrodynamics of the inflow cannot be simulated with the same accuracy due to the lack of rotational speed that contributes significantly to the development of hull wake see discussion in section 4 only hydrodynamic forces and moments are discussed as inertial and gravity components have been removed from measured loads collected data are sampled at 5 khz but loads and other correlated data are re sampled according to 360 steps corresponding to a complete revolution of the propeller with one degree of resolution in order to harmonize the outputs and make the data comparable between single blade cycles according to fig 6 the time history of loads has been sliced obtaining a series of single cycles they have been used to obtain a mean cycle of a single run x 1 and its standard deviation σ 1 the mean cycles corresponding to each run have been combined to obtain a representative cycle calculated both by arithmetic and weighted mean x 1 and x 2 respectively which account for deviations due to different and unaccountable error sources like for example the presence of wind or small waves during free running tests a different approach has been adopted for the transient analysis since it is not possible to find a mean because of the nature of the rapid evolution of the inflow that gives rise to fast time varying loads global propeller loads are derived from single blade measurements adopting a procedure that takes into account the relative position of each blade the collected data are not simply time shifted of a fixed value proportional to the angle between the blades but the time history of each blade has been calculated as an interpolation between two subsequent cycles of the reference blade weighted by its relative position on the propeller disk in this way every blade takes into account the time varying nature of the inflow although it has not been possible to capture rapid events that are faster than a complete propeller revolution the analysis of the transient motion concerned a single run test similarly to the steady analysis the cycles of the propeller loads were extracted according to the measure of the phase angle θ and mean value and maximum fluctuation given by the difference among absolute maximum and minimum values were recorded moreover the harmonic analysis was carried out considering different approaches that consisted on the application of fft fast fourier transform on each cycle that is a short time fft with window equal to the cycle without overlap between each segment with reference to fig 7 single blade loads are measured in the so called blade reference frame b superscript this frame rotates with the blade and is centred on the propeller shaft with the x axis pointing forward z pointing radially out of the propeller and the y axis following the right hand rule this frame is primary used to carry out a detailed investigation of single blade loads in relation to wake topology in order to describe global propeller loads the hub frame is introduced this frame is fixed with the model with x axis coincident with blade frame the z axis pointing upwards and y pointing towards portside the angle between b and h frames is indicated with the θ symbol and increasing value are concordant with propeller rotation direction 4 results the comparison of the captive and free running model tests is carried out following a phenomenological perspective aimed to clarify the cause effect relation between the evolution of the inflow and the propeller performance the inflow to the propeller has been calculated by preliminary c f d computations of r a n s reyonolds averaged navier stokes equations fig 8 shows the nominal wake for the rectilinear motion and oblique towing at β 15 and 30 that are representative of weak and tight maneuvers the nominal wake is expressed in terms of colour maps of axial u and vector field of the tangential velocity given the nominal wake the evolution of the loads during a revolution can be inferred synthesizing the blade hydrodynamics with a 2d hydrofoil see fig 9 the figure provides a simple description of blade flow since the self induction velocity system is not represented for clarity n is the propeller rate of revolution per second r is the radial position of a representative section and α is the angle of attack 4 1 wake field discussion the wake fields highlight the asymmetric evolution of the wake that determines the different behavior of the propeller on the leeward side the propeller is affected by the interaction with the wake of the hull whereas on the windward side the inflow progressively evolves to a pure oblique flow in particular the flow around the propeller is characterized by vortical structures that interact with the wake of hull and downstream appendages to yield complex hydrodynamic blade wake interactions albeit the phenomenological details are detailed in the following sections it is propaedeutic to identify these structures namely stabilizer fin vortex fv whose signature is clearly visible on the left right of the windward leeward propeller for the model in straight ahead see fig 8a skeg vortex sv evidenced by the swirling flow for the drift condition at β e f f 15 in fig 8b large mixed vortex mv that is evidence on the right of the leeward propeller at the highest drift angle see fig 8c this structure comes from the interaction of skeg bilge keel not evidenced in these plots and other structures detached from the appendages for example the shaft in general these structures and the features of the wake differently evolve for the three different test conditions considered in this study in this context it has to be pointed out once more that the choice of the equivalent drift angle in correspondence of the propeller plane between pure oblique and free running maneuvers i e β e f f β p satisfies the geometric kinematic condition at the propeller but does not guarantee the equivalence of the inflow to the propellers in fact the pure oblique towing implies a constant drift angle along the hull differently from the free running where the motion is also due to yaw see fig 10 in addition to this it has to be remarked that the effect of motion in the transverse plane roll has been neglected in this analysis as a result during oblique towing the sections ahead of the propeller are impinged at a greater drift angle causing the vortex structures and hydrodynamic interactions to be stronger during downstream convection as well as at a different location with respect to the propeller disk the discrepancies between free running and pure drift propeller in flow conditions can be appreciated in terms of the straightening of the flow the flow straightening is a concept that has been introduced in the context of system based mathematical models of ship maneuvering and physically describes a reduction of the nominal transverse velocity in correspondence of the rudder or the propeller in the present context the concept is addressed for quantifying a mean deflection of the flow at the inlet of the propeller for the pure oblique flow and coupled yaw sway motion that yield a similar β e f f to this purpose the flow straightening is described by the regression model described of ankudinov panel h 10 ship controllability 1993 that according to the authors knowledge is the only one that splits the contributions form the lateral and yaw velocity 1 β h t a n 1 γ v v h γ r ψ x u h where γ v and γ r are the flow straightening coefficients associated to lateral and yaw velocity v h and ψ respectively u h is the axial component of the velocity here assumed to the advance speed of the ship for simplicity and x is the longitudinal distance of the propeller from the centre of rotation β h is the hydrodynamic drift angle in correspondence of the propeller according to panel h 10 ship controllability 1993 the flow straightening coefficients are defined in terms of the macroscopic geometric characteristics of the ship already defined in table 1 2 γ v 1 1 5 b l c b b t 0 5 γ r γ v 0 44 0 22 γ v fig 11 a show the values of the nominal drift angle for couples of sway and yaw velocities the solid marks refer to three conditions β e f f 7 5 15 and 30 where marks along ψ 0 indicate cases in oblique towing while the internal marks identify the free running condition that yields the same β e f f as oblique towing the correspondent values of the effective drift angle for the oblique towing and free running conditions corrected by equation 2 are identified in fig 11b it can be observed that the marks associated to the oblique towing and the correspondent free running maneuver are no more aligned along the same value the results are synthesized in table 5 it can be evidenced that for a similar geometrical drift angle β e f f at the propeller the hydrodynamic one is obviously smaller due to the shadow effect of the hull moreover the two conditions differ by about 20 consistently with the simplified representation in fig 10 it has to be stressed that this estimate is approximate because the effect of speed of the model as well as propeller loading is not accounted for in the formulations of γ v and γ r moreover since the methodology at least for the mean single blade loads can somehow account for these effects by interpolation the discrepancies are in the typical range admitted for a predictive methodology in the preliminary design 4 2 hub propeller loads during oblique towing the origin of the propeller in plane forces and moments is explained in terms of the imbalances of k t x k t y and k t z of the single blade converted in the fixed hub frame of reference between intervals of the period quadrants dubbioso et al 2017 ortolani and dubbioso 2019b see fig 12 specifically k q y and k t y are generated by difference of thrust and side force between the upper 1 s t and 4 t h quadrants u superscript and lower 2 n d and 3 r d quadrants d superscript halves of the disk fig 12 on the other hand k q z and k t z are generated by difference of thrust and side force between the left 1 s t and 2 n d quadrants l superscript and right 3 r d and 4 t h quadrants r superscript halves of the disk dimensionless propeller loads are presented in terms of ratio with respect to the total thrust at v 1 0 which corresponds to fn 0 26 in straight ahead condition and equivalent drift angle β e f f in order to have a consistent comparison with the free running results according to the reference system defined in fig 7 the lateral and vertical components of the radial force are positive when directed to port side and upwards fig 13 shows the in plane loads exerted by the propeller during oblique towing and free running tests for internal and external propeller negative and positive β values respectively while the split contributions from the different halves are showed in fig 14 for a more immediate association with the propeller loading condition the generation of the in plane moments k q y and k q z is described in terms of thrust unbalances namely assuming that the arm of k t x does not change during the cycle a clearer comparison is proposed in fig 15 where only the o t data that correspond to the closer value of speed drop of free running tests are selected the loads are described for the starboard propeller and therefore the inflow field for the windward propeller should be mirrored when referring to the external side in general the outcome of the oblique towing tests highlights that k t y and k q y are more sensitive to propeller loading i e towing speed with respect to vertical force and pitch moment in case of k t y the force reduces in proportion to the decrease of towing speed at all drift angles except for the smallest angles on both internal and external propellers and the trend with drift angle is not similar for all speeds on the contrary the variation of the loads with drift angle is markedly similar for the other components in case of the pitch moment k q y the effect of speed drop increases with the increase of β while in case of vertical force k t z and yaw moment k q z the data collapse about the same value in case of the vertical force the speed drop seems to be important at intermediate drift angle 10 20 on both propellers the trend of the steady turning and in particular the asymmetric behavior is well captured for all the components although discrepancies evidently exist in relation to the speed drop in greater detail the side force k t y experiences an almost linear trend with rudder angle for the windward and leeward propellers see fig 13a in both situations the side force provides a stabilizing effect to the model i e it creates a couple that counteracts the turning motion on the windward side k t y is generated in the lower half of the disk in facts in this sector the load dashed lines increases while it is almost constant in the opposite sector for each velocity see fig 14a this different behavior is consequent to the concurrent effect between the tangential and axial velocity to build up the hydrodynamic load in the lower half the cross flow acts to increase the tangential velocity relative to the foil and consequently the incidence angle this effect is opposite in the upper half the trend revealed by o t highlights that the load in the lower half increases at an higher rate the more the propeller loading is reduced collapsing to a common value at the maximum drift angle probably at higher loading foil efficiency could be reduced due to the onset of stall or other mechanisms associated to the operation of the blades in unsteady regimes in case of s t k t y is always lower than the oblique towing as a consequence of the underload and overload of the lateral force in the lower and upper half of the disk respectively on the leeward side k t y establishes to a lower value with respect to external propeller due to interaction with the wake of the hull in particular the side force is almost constant with β in the upper half of the disk and the effect of speed drop is minimal this is due to the fact that in the upper half of the disk the increase of the speed drop is counterbalanced by the cross flow conversely in the lower half the load diminishes because the cross flow causes the blade section to be impinged with a lower tangential velocity the magnitude of the side force developed during s t orange colored line experiences a local increment on both halves about the β e f f 15 this behavior is driven by the s v with reference to fig 8b it provides a sort of blockage effect on the flow coming from the wind side and interacts locally with the blade in case of the free running the vortex could be weaker and located farther with respect to the leeward propeller in contrast to the one represented in the figure because the skeg is impinged at smaller drift angle as a consequence the cross flow could reach the 2 n d quadrant at higher upwards deflection amplifying the tangential flow relative to the blade sections in this sector with consequent increase of the load these hydrodynamic phenomena also explain the imbalance of k t x that gives rise to the pitch moment on the external propeller k q y is negative i e it acts to bend the propeller shaft on the top pushing downward the propeller since the blades are overloaded in the lower half of the disk see fig 14c in case of o t the thrust resembles the side force namely it grows monotonically in the lower half with drift angle at a rate that is faster the higher the advance velocity this causes the curves trend to collapse at β 30 on the contrary on the upper half k t x is almost constant and the effect of propeller loading is uniform at all β oblique towing overestimates the free running results in particular at the higher drift angles see also fig 15c because the thrust at same speed drop v 0 7 is stronger in the lower half of the disk see fig 14a it can be inferred that in this sector the wake shed from appendages is less deflected to the lee side due the constant drift distribution and the resulting higher local speed which can yield local increase of the load however the trend of k q y is very well captured by o t when considering values at same speed drop on the internal side k q y lifts the propeller given the higher hydrodynamic load exerted in the upper half the trend of o t is very different from the free running in fact k q y at the smallest β is close to the value in straight ahead and it is yet negative then abruptly rises at β 15 and keeps an almost constant value this is associated to the fact that the thrust in the lower half of the disk drops at a considerably higher rate with respect to the upper half on the contrary the pitch moment increases smoothly for the steady turning tests except for the tightest maneuver this behavior can be associated to the fact that the thrust increases only in the upper half while it keeps almost constant in the lower half the vertical force k t z shows a completely different trend between the external and internal propeller see fig 13b in straight ahead motion the vertical force is upwards oriented and correspondent to about 20 of the thrust because in the left half of the disk both the reduction of the axial component of the inflow and the upwards tangential component act to increase the blade loading vice versa on the opposite half the flow is almost clean and being oriented in the same sense of blade motion lessens the tangential component relative to the sections see fig 9 and on its turn the load on the windward propeller k t z drops with an almost linear trend with the increase of β this is consequent to the fact that the magnitude of the force on the right side negative monotonically increases because the blade experiences a relevant cross flow that strengthens the load in the 3 r d quadrant this contribution is only partially canceled in the 4 t h quadrant due to the opposite action of the tangential flow it is interesting to observe that for 7 5 β 15 these contributions are equally balanced the load is almost constant probably because in the 4 t h quadrant the blade encounters the velocity defect associated to the wake of the outer bracket however at larger drift angle the load further increases due to the establishment of the pure oblique flow on the left half of the disk the vertical force is constant due to different mechanisms that depend on the drift angle in facts at smaller β the action of the s v structure induces a tangential flow that being oriented in the same sense of the blade motion weakens the increment of incidence angle of the section caused by the wake of the bracket at the higher drifts i e see fig 8c the unloading due to the cross flow in the 1 s t quadrant balances the load increase in the lower sector the comparison with the separate contributions developed during s t highlights that the source of the discrepancy arises in the 1 s t and 2 n d quadrant with the exception of β 30 this is due to the non consistent evolution of the flow along the model that could give rise to a stronger velocity defect as well as a different contribution from s v and consequently higher loads on the opposite half the vertical force is captured very accurately also in terms of the speed drop these considerations hold to explain the features of the yaw moment k q z see fig 13d in particular the split contribution of k t x and the difference with s t resembles the one discussed for the vertical force see fig 14d briefly the yaw moment in straight ahead is negative and acts to bend the shaft inward then it gradually changes to turn outward the propeller due to load increase in the 3 r d and 4 t h quadrants on the leeward side k t z exhibits a non linear trend see fig 13b specifically it further increases at β 7 5 to a value that is almost 30 and then keeps this value before definitely drop at the maximum drift this behavior resembles the free running model tests although the peak is first achieved than s t as better showed in fig 15b the nature of this non linear behavior can be ascribed to the fact that at the smaller drift angles say 0 θ 7 5 the left right imbalance increases due to the opposite trend of the force developed by the blade specifically on the left half of the disk 1 s t and 2 n d quadrants the vertical force increases because the velocity induced by the onset of s v causes the tangential flow relative to blade section to increase and therefore develop higher load on the opposite half it abruptly drops due to the cross flow in the 3 r d quadrant this event can be inferred from fig 8a and b observing that in the 4 t h the unloading effect of the in plane velocity is similar to the straight ahead upwards oriented to reduce the incidence of the blade sections at higher β the imbalance is gradually mitigated on the left half k t z drops because s v is transported to the lee side and the blade vortex interaction mechanism ends simultaneously its blockage effect dies and the cross flow reduces the incidence angle of the blades in particular in the 2 n d quadrant this mechanism is further strengthened moving to larger drift angles see fig 8c in fact m v deflects the wake shed past the shaft and the low pressure region thus formed deviates downward the cross flow to further reduce the component tangential to blade sections on the right half the vertical force downward oriented gradually increases due to the reduction of axial velocity in the wake past the shaft and the increase of the tangential component induced by m v more specifically it is worth noticing the non linear trend in the range 7 5 β 20 this behavior is associated to the transition and simultaneous evolution of s v for example at β 15 the magnitude of k t z increases because the separation past the shaft causes the outward deflection of the tangential flow and the increase of velocity defect in the 4 t h quadrant then at β 20 it can be inferred that s v increased in size the skeg is impinged at higher incidence and is centred on the propeller disk to induce a tangential flow that is concordant to blade rotation and thus acts to reduce the force of the blades it is worth noticing that this complex behavior on the right half of disk is experienced during s t on the contrary the accordance is poorer on the left half of disk for discrepancies of wake evolution from ahead of the propeller however as a matter of fact the trend of s t is well captured when referring to similar speed drop see fig 15b the trend of the split contribution of k t x resembles that of the vertical force for o t and s t it is interesting to note that the non linear behavior experienced in both tests is experienced at the larger drift angles k q z is always negative i e it acts to bend the propeller shaft outward to the lee side 4 3 transient analysis the analysis of the periodic blade loads during unsteady ship dynamics is considered for the transient phases of a turning circle in this preliminary study the analysis is focused on three different conditions the transient phase t r a at δ 15 and 35 and the pull out p o at δ 35 at the same reference approach speed f n 0 26 of the oblique towing in order to carry out a consistent comparison of the data the analysis is centred on the t r a at δ 35 because it experiences transient states that can be compared to the steady phases for turning circles at all rudder angles tested δ 7 5 35 on the other hand the additional transients are included to study the effects of the different kinematic response and initial condition on the loads the key features of the transient maneuvers are showed in fig 16 in particular fig 16a highlights the segment of the trajectory obtained at δ 35 during which the propeller experiences the same equivalent drift angles identified by square symbols of the steady turning phases obtained at different rudder angles it is interesting to note that this interval covers a longitudinal movement by about two ship lengths about sixty propeller revolution fig 16b shows the dynamic response of the model after the activation of the rudder in terms of yaw rate speed drop and effective drift angle in the pictures time has been replaced by propeller cycles at δ 15 the transient is obviously slower due to the lower control loads and the consequent slower dynamic response of the model in order to relate the nominal propeller functioning regime with the dynamic response of the model the variation of the speed drop with the effective drift angle β e f f is visualized in fig 18 the speed drop is the most meaningful parameter since it can be immediately associated to the nominal propeller advance coefficient j j v a b s nd where n and d are propeller rate of revolution and diameter and hence propeller loading the dynamic response of the model is not reversible during p o in particular the recovery of the speed is markedly slower during the re establishment of the straight ahead motion on the contrary the t r a at δ 15 resembles the same trend of tighter maneuver to provide a brief overview of the underlying features of the effect of transient motion the evolution of the mean values of the single blade thrust and spindle torque developed during the t r a phase of weak and tight maneuvers is reported in fig 17 together with the yaw rate in order to better highlight the effect of the transient motions the maximum fluctuation δ l where l is the generic load of the load developed during each blade revolution is inspected the maximum fluctuation is the peak to peak value of the load during a cycle the loads are reported in terms of ratio with respect to the thrust and torque in the approach phase as the rudder is activated the mean values and the fluctuations evolve asymmetrically on the windward and leeward sides for the internal propeller the trend is smoother with respect to the external propeller with the exception of a very short interval almost 10 cycles after the start of the maneuver on the windward propeller the trend resembles the same two slope feature observed in a previous study for a similar twin screw ortolani et al 2015b with the exception of the spindle torque at δ 35 this behavior is strictly associated to the velocity induced by the motion as it can be deduced by the evolution of the yaw rate and the fact that the maximum values establish almost at the same instant on the contrary the behavior on the internal side is slower due to the interaction with the wake however the evolution of the maximum fluctuation is markedly affected by the rate of turn during the weaker maneuver the blade on the internal side develops the largest fluctuation that is almost 300 immediately after the activation of the rudder and exceeds by 50 and 100 the one on the opposite side for the thrust and spindle torque respectively moreover on the internal side the maximum value is achieved considerably before the stabilization of the yaw rate on the contrary at δ 35 the fluctuation converge to comparable values it increases by almost 40 and 10 with respect to the previous maneuver on the external and internal side respectively note that at the first instances of the transient the growth rate is faster for the internal propeller and the peak exceeds the stabilized value of the external propeller the gradual increase of the maximum fluctuation experienced by the blade on the windward side is consistent to the disturbance induced by an oblique flow as demonstrated by the top bottom difference of the load showed in fig 14 on the contrary on the internal side the phenomenon is driven by the viscous dominated character of the wake the analysis of the transient and the comparison with the equivalent quasi steady data is proposed in terms of equivalent drift angle instead of time for the sake of improving the readability of the comparison with oblique towing and the steady turning phase values before continuing it is important to remark the fundamental implications of the transient motion on the evolution of the wake these aspects need to be highlighted in order to understand the nature of the discrepancy of the transient loads with respect to the quasi steady conditions s t and o t since the use of the wake fields in fig 8 is anyway considered for this purpose in particular given the similarity of a maneuvering hull with a low aspect ratio wing at incidence during a transient motion the wake past the hull is altered with respect to a steady condition by the so called circulatory and non circulatory effects these are associated to the temporal variation of the lateral force that causes the time varying circulation of wake structures detached from it and added mass effects respectively moreover the size and intensity of the vortical structure is different as a consequence of the discrepancy of the absolute velocity associated to speed drop see fig 19 in fact the intensity of the vortex is proportional to the lift that on its turn is proportional to the product of incidence angle i e drift and squared absolute speed therefore vortices detached during transient characterized by lower speed drop are stronger and bigger than the correspondent ones generated during the quasi steady cases in the following analysis only this effect and added mass are considered to infer the discrepancies of the periodic blade loads given the unknown of the time scale of memory effect of circulation 4 3 1 mean loads and maximum fluctuation the averaged mean values of single blade thrust bending and spindle moment for the transients maneuvers are showed in fig 20 figures on the left side refer to the internal propeller in general in case of both propellers k t x and k q y during the t r a phase at both rudder angles well overlap with each other and the steady turning values black circle see fig 20a and b the transient loads are slightly higher than the steady phase during the early stages i e at β e f f 8 4 this fact can be associated to the sway yaw response of the model that can contribute to the different establishment of the wake and moreover on the speed drop in fact fig 18 highlights that after the activation of the rudder the model experiences a sudden deceleration that causes higher propeller loading during the p o the thrust and bending moment are markedly higher with respect to t r a and steady turning phases at the same β e f f this behavior has to be ascribed to the fact that the velocity slowly grows after the activation of the rudder it remains below 0 8 up to β e f f 10 and consequently the propeller operates at a lower equivalent advance coefficient this behavior is consistent with the fact that k t x and k q y are in between the loads of the oblique towing tests at v a b s 0 7 and 0 8 up to β e f f 10 for both internal and external propeller the evolution of the loads is different for the two propellers on the internal side they gradually increase up to β e f f 10 and then drop in particular the loads show a faster increase for 10 β e f f 20 well reproduced by the o t tests that can be associated to the change of morphology of the wake from fully separated to the reformation of smaller and coherent structures that pass through the propeller disk on the other hand on the external side the loads monotonically decrease with a faster rate for β e f f 10 the closer inspection of the trends also reveals the wake propeller interaction phenomenon about β e f f 15 by the slight increment of the load the mean values of the spindle torque during the t r a is in accordance with the steady turning values see fig 20c in this case the values during the p o are lower with respect to the t r a at δ 35 as a consequence of the fact that the hydrodynamic centre of blade load moves towards inner sections and given skewed shape of the blade it moves toward the leading edge i e the spindle axis to yield a smaller value of the moment arm ortolani and dubbioso 2019b a both transient and steady state values are underestimated by o t although the trend with increasing β e f f and speed drop is captured as discussed in ortolani et al 2020 and at the beginning of the section the discrepancies can be associated to localized alteration of the wake due to the constrained attitude of the model during the oblique towing in this sense small variations of loading distribution can have a noticeable effect on the spindle moment as expected the behavior of the maximum fluctuation of the loads developed by the internal and external propeller is markedly asymmetric considering the transient maneuvers δ l is stronger during the t r a phase with respect to the pull out at δ 35 because the propeller operates at lower loading and consequently it is more sensitive to spatial gradients and temporal fluctuations of the inflow see fig 21 in contrast to the mean values δ l experienced during the t r a is affected by the severity of the maneuver i e rudder angle and the most critical conditions are experienced by the internal propeller although the maximum value of δ l is similar for the two propellers it grows at a faster rate than the external propeller at lower β e f f as a consequence of the interaction with the wake by an alternative perspective the internal propeller would experience stronger fluctuation during weaker maneuvers this is corroborated by the t r a at δ 15 the maximum fluctuation on the leeward propeller being 25 higher than the windward one in more details on the internal side the evolution of the signal is qualitatively similar at both rudder angles immediately after the activation of the rudder δ l smoothly grows for smaller drift angles probably because the planar velocities are slow and the modification of the wake are not relevant after the signal abruptly increases for a relatively short interval of the drift angle about 8 and then flattens out prior to achieve the stabilized value it is worth noticing that the slope of the signal at δ 15 weakens before that of the tighter maneuver because the transient is close to its end and accelerations are going to die out during the p o the evolution of the absolute fluctuation is smoother given higher equivalent advance coefficient of the propeller on the external side the evolution of the fluctuation during t r a is smoother with respect for the internal side in particular the grow rate is almost linear and then stabilizes at the smaller rudder angle the fluctuation stabilizes at almost the same drift angle observed for the internal propeller β e f f 10 conversely at δ 35 the fluctuation monotonically grows up to β e f f 24 and the plateau is markedly shorter during the p o δ l initially drops at an higher rate with respect to t r a up to β e f f 15 and then slowly converges to the straight ahead value 4 3 2 periodic loads the evolution of the periodic single blade thrust and spindle torque during the transient maneuvers are reported in figs 23 26 and are compared with steady turning and oblique towing loads to further explain the discrepancies discussed in the previous paragraphs to support the cause and effect link between the loads and the inflow the wake patterns showed in fig 8a c are considered in a dynamic fashion and the generation of the loads are discussed synthesizing the blade hydrodynamics with 2d hydrofoil theory fig 9 on the internal propeller k t x generated during t r a at β e f f 8 4 increases in the upper half of the disk and drops in the lower half of the disk with respect to rectilinear condition orange colored line see fig 23a on the left in more detail in straight ahead the signal features two peaks at θ 45 and 120 caused by the perturbation of the bracket and velocity gradients of the hull wake axial velocity defect and upwards component respectively ortolani et al 2020 from the early stage of the transient only the peak about θ 100 is visible in fact the lateral flow induced by the motion deflects the boundary layer of the hull to the leeward side causing the increase the incidence of the blades during the passage in the 1 s t in the lower half 90 θ 270 the cross flow acts to reduce the load it being oriented in the same sense of blade rotation although the trend agrees with s t and o t the most evident discrepancies are experienced in the upper half of the disk as a consequence of the perturbation from s v already mentioned in section 4 2 see fig 8b and added mass effect in fact with respect to s t dashed line the velocity defect past the inner bracket is stronger because the equivalent sections of the foil are thicker due to added mass on the other hand s v and velocity defect are stronger for the reported condition of o t because it is generated at higher absolute speed and incidence angle constant along the appendages as a result in the upper half of the disk the blade would be affected by a stronger tangential flow that increases the hydrodynamic incidence of the blades these effects are amplified at β e f f 15 5 fig 23b because the acceleration of the model is yet higher and the differences in absolute speed with respect to s t increased in fact the peak of k t x experienced during t r a at θ 45 associated to the interaction of the blade with s v is 10 stronger with respect to the oblique towing and steady turning see fig 8b since the speed drop is markedly smaller than the s t and o t this structure is stronger and hence its disturbance moreover the growth rate of the load is faster also because the lighter loading condition causes the blade to be more sensitive to velocity gradients on the contrary k t x in the lower half of the disk is smaller since the cross flow oriented to reduce the flow incidence of the blade sections is higher in the 4 t h quadrant k t x experiences a faster grow rate with respect to s t probably because the blade encounters a stronger velocity defects past the shaft and outer brackets θ 340 due to both added mass effect and faster cross flow in the sector 180 θ 360 during o t the thrust is higher probably because the inflow is characterized by a more complex wake with strong reduction of axial velocity originated by the constant value of β e f f at β e f f 22 4 fig 23c the evolution of the loads is driven by the complex flow field that results from the interplay between s v and the wake of appendages this interaction gives rise to m v that is the counterclockwise rotating swirling flow that is lee positioned with respect to the propeller at the maximum drift angle see fig 8c at this drift angle m v is in between position reported in the figures plausibly almost centred with the propeller disk and globally induces a velocity field that is concordant with the rotation of the blades a plausible situation of the vortex field affecting the leeward propeller is visualized in fig 22 muscari et al 2017 and it is considered in the following discussion during t r a the cross flow and m v are stronger with respect to s t due to the higher absolute speed lower speed drop as a consequence of the stronger interaction with m v the wake shed from the brackets is disrupted and the velocity defect is amplified moreover it is reduced with respect to β 15 5 because the overloading effect of the cross flow is counteracted by the contribution of m v therefore k t x is greater than s t for a portion of the 1 s t quadrant 0 θ 60 although the propeller loading is nominally lighter in this sector blade thrust grows at a larger rate that culminates to the peak at θ 90 this fact can be associated to the interaction of the blade with the wake shed past the external shaft as it can be clearly evidenced from fig 22 during steady motion panel on the right the vortex system detached from the windward shaft made of intertwined longitudinal and transverse structures features seems larger with respect to the one developed during t r a moreover in this case the longitudinal structures can be engulfed by the stronger m v during the blade passage in the 2 n d and 3 r d quadrants k t x is lower than s t because the tangential flow relative to the blade sections is reduced by the stronger cross flow further enhanced by the induced velocity of m v moreover in the 4 t h quadrant it is interesting to observe that the interaction of the blade with the wake of the shaft and brackets during t r a is strengthened with respect to s t as proved by the abrupt increase of the load in the two sectors 280 θ 320 and 320 θ 360 during o t k t x exhibits the same trend of the peak for the transient maneuver see sequence of left panels in fig 23b and c however it seems smoother because the wake generated by the constant distribution of β e f f along hull and appendages could break further the coherency to give onset to swirling flow characterized by larger spatial scales as discussed for the previous case this can also cause a stronger velocity defect that causes the blade to operate at lower equivalent advance coefficient and hence develop higher thrust in the remaining sector of the cycle at β 28 4 fig 23d during s t the peak of k t x reduces and shifts to lower phase angle θ 50 this reduction is probably ascribed to the effect of m v see fig 8c the induced velocity downward oriented acts to weaken the tangential flow from the wind side and counteracts the leeward convection of the wake of the inner bracket it is interesting to observe that the trend is quantitatively analogous during t r a although in that case the signal is characterized by two peaks at θ 45 and 90 the first peak is more definite probably because the velocity defect past the inner bracket is thinner in fact as a consequence of the lower speed drop both the magnitude and the perturbation of m v and cross flow are stronger than s t on one side the cross flow pushes the wake past the bracket to the leeward side while on the other m v blocks it analogously the second fluctuation about θ 90 can be associated to a stronger velocity defect induced by the wake past the external shaft in this case the shaft structures are not entrapped and disrupted by m v since it is farther from the disk the signature of shaft structures can be grasped in fig 8c in the 4 t h quadrant the velocity induced by m v is oppositely oriented with respect to the blade motion and therefore acts to increase the load moreover m v is stronger during transient given the lower speed drop this is confirmed by the fact that k t x is smaller during t r a with respect to s t and rises abruptly after the interaction with the wake past the shaft in case of the oblique towing m v could be formed by the merging of stronger structures given by the globally higher incidence along the hull in turns its effect perturbs the whole inflow distribution over the disk more critically causing k t x to be higher in the lower half of the period in the remaining interval of the cycle the trend of the loads is similar to the previous case fig 23c given the almost similar perturbation induced by this coherent structure on the external side the interaction is essentially dominated by the cross flow induced by the motion as demonstrated by the sinusoidal trend of the signal with no evidence of phase shifts for the cases considered the blade experiences the maximum value in the lower half of the cycle where the cross flow is opposed to blade rotation and the flow impinges the blades with an higher angle of attack however the interaction between the blade and wake structures can be evidenced in particular at smaller drift angles and differences between the evolution of the loads can be more directly ascribed to mismatch of speed drop and wake formation past the hull and appendages in more details at β e f f 8 4 k t x developed during t r a and s t are very similar to each other see fig 23a on the right panel in the 1 s t quadrant the load gradually increases because the component of the cross flow tangential to the section of the blades that acts to mitigate the incidence angle reduces and at the same time the blade is going to interact with the wake of the inner bracket clearly visible in fig 8b since the blade loading is lighter during t r a the thrust is smaller and when the blade interacts with the wake of the bracket at about θ 45 it experiences a more severe oscillation with respect to s t on the other hand albeit the different speed drop the thrust of t r a is almost coincident with s t in the lower half of the disk 90 θ 270 since the accelerations are dominant in the early stages of the transient it can be inferred that the flow is deflected and more accelerated by the added mass carried by the shaft therefore the blade foils are impinged by a stronger tangential flow that being opposite to blade rotation further increases the load in the 4 t h quadrant k t x decreases because both the axial and tangential components of the wake act to reduce the load the discrepancy between the blade thrust developed during t r a and s t can be motivated in addition to the propeller loading with the different interaction with f v vortex from the wake field showed in fig 8a it can be inferred that this vortex at smaller drift angle is yet coherent and being counterclockwise induces a tangential flow oriented with blade rotation that reduces the blade load this effect is magnified during the transient and oblique towing in the former case f v is stronger with respect to s t as a consequence of the higher absolute velocity of the model on the other hand during o t f v being detached with higher incidence due to the constant drift distribution is convected more inward to trigger stronger interaction with the wall and wake of the brackets finally it can be observed that in the sector 90 θ 130 k t x developed during o t is lower than the steady turning due to localized differences of the wake caused by the constant distribution of drift angle at β e f f 15 5 the t r a and s t differ in the last half of the 4 t h quadrant due to disparity of propeller loading in the remaining interval of the period the two loads almost coincide as in the previous case k t x generated during o t is strongest in the upper half of the disk due to increment of velocity defect associated to the constant distribution of the drift angle at β e f f 22 4 the remarkable discrepancy between t r a and s t is caused by propeller loading the difference of speed being higher than 20 see fig 18 finally at β e f f 28 4 the t r a is lower than s t phase in the whole period due to the higher advance speed and lighter propeller loading except close to the peak because of the added mass effect of the shaft that acts to increase the tangential flow relative to the blade sections on the other hand during o t k t x is always higher with respect to free running because the differences on the evolution of the wake field are further triggered by the different drift distribution the behavior of the spindle torque is reported in fig 24 for the sake of completeness in general the trend of k q z is consistent with propeller loading and its variation according to the simplified model already introduced in ortolani and dubbioso 2019b dubbioso and ortolani 2020 for a skewed blade in fact k q z decreases in contrast to the growth of propeller loading that is the hydrodynamic centre tends to move to the inward sections and to the leading edge see the sign convention in fig 7 in this case the t r a seems in very good agreement with the s t in contrast to the oblique towing tests in general the t r a and s t deviates for the external propeller at β e f f 22 4 fig 24c because the highest difference in speed drop i e propeller loading the poorer quantitative accordance between o t and the free running results stresses that this load can be very sensitive to alterations of the wake field associated to the constant drift distribution the evolution of the single blade thrust and spindle torque evolution during the p o phase of the turning circle at δ 35 are showed in figs 25 and 26 respectively in the plots the cycle experienced during the t r a is also included to better highlight the discrepancies and at the same time to better highlight the differences of the cause and effect analysis the oblique tests are not discussed since these can be deduced by the reader on the basis of the following considerations in general the matching of the p o with steady condition is less satisfactory than the t r a because the relative difference of propeller loading and speed drop is further amplified see fig 18 in facts the loads developed during p o and s t at varying β e f f diverge over the cycle by an amount that is comparable to the discrepancy between the correspondent speed drop showed in fig 18 however on the internal propeller the consequences of speed drop combines with stronger propeller wake interaction this is evident for example at β e f f 22 4 although the propeller is highly loaded during the pull out in the 1 s t quadrant the trend of k t x matches with s t according to the role played by s v specifically s v impinges the disk in the 1 s t quadrant on the basis of the behavior of the in plane loads discussed in section 4 2 and at the same time it is weaker and smaller with respect to s t as a consequence of the lower absolute speed hence it induces a slower tangential velocity and consequently lower increment of angle of attack and load with respect to steady turning moreover the weaker blockage of s v during p o provokes in combination with the added mass of the shaft the upwards deflection of the cross flow about θ 90 to be weaker with consequent reduction of the developed thrust these effects drive also the behavior of the blade loads at β e f f 15 5 see fig 26b on the left panel in the 1 s t quadrant the peaks of k t x during t r a and p o are oppositely phase shifted with respect to the steady turning phase in more details during p o the peak of k t x is phase shifted with respect to s t that is opposite to t r a in case of p o s v is weaker and smaller as well as its blockage effect thus the cross flow evolves in between the vortex and the shaft more upwards inclined causing the blade to be impinged by a faster tangential flow at greater θ with respect to the analogous situation during t r a this phenomenon seems consistent with the phase shift of the fluctuation of k t x in the 4 t h quadrant during t r a and p o see fig 25b that can be ascribed to the interaction of the blade with the wake shed past the shaft in fact as a consequence of the different inclination with which the cross flow impacts the propeller shaft the sector with minimal tangential velocity and velocity defect visible in the 4 t h quadrant in fig 8b would be crossed over by the blade at different azimuth finally at β e f f 8 4 the trend of the loads is markedly similar although the deviation of the mean value is caused by the different loading state of the propeller during s t and t r a the trend is different in the 4 t h quadrant probably because in this sector the blade is less sensitive to unsteady interaction with the wake shed by the shaft and starboard bracket on the external propeller the same qualitative considerations provided for the t r a hold the similarity of the trend of the signal and their phase alignment stress the dominant effect of speed drop while differences ascribed to wake evolution matter locally this is proved by the fact that the deviation of p o is almost constant during all the cycle and it resembles the same trend of the percentage discrepancy of the speed drop reported in fig 18 the results of the spindle torque reported in fig 26 for the sake of completeness essentially confirm the same behavior observed for the t r a phase in particular the sensitivity of this load to the loading state of the blade the correlation between its trend and the propeller loading i e thrust is left to the reader following the mentioned simplified model ortolani and dubbioso 2019a finally the impact of the severity of the maneuver on the evolution of the blade loads is analyzed by the comparison of transient phases correspondent to the turning maneuvers at δ 15 t r a 15 and 35 t r a 35 see figs 27 and 28 the general inspection of the behavior of k t x emphasizes that the most evident discrepancy between the two transients is experienced by the internal propeller due to interactions with the wake see fig 27a on the left in particular during t r a 15 at β e f f 8 4 k t x experiences a peak that is stronger with respect to the tightest maneuver by almost 20 this is probably consequent to the fact that s v is more coherent due to the lower speed drop high speed of the model at same equivalent drift as a consequence the tangential velocity induced in the 1 s t quadrant is stronger and amplifies the hydrodynamic incidence of the blades at the same time in the 4 t h quadrant the blade develops lower thrust probably because the upward distortion of the incoming cross flow due to added mass of the propeller shaft is weaker due to smaller lateral acceleration at the highest drift angle β e f f 15 5 k t x generated during t r a 15 matches with the s t because the motion is establishing the steady phase of the turn similarly in case of the external propeller as a consequence of the weaker phenomena related to blade wake interactions with respect to the internal propeller the signals are in better agreement with each other and converge to the steady state at the highest drift angle the trend of the spindle torque is consistent with the loading state of the blade see fig 28 as stressed for the other manuevering conditions k q z developed during o t captures the trend of the free running maneuvers although it is shifted in mean value due to the higher sensitivity to alteration of the wake as well as the constrained motion in the transverse plane 4 3 3 harmonic analysis the harmonic analysis of k t x developed during s t t r a and o t is reported in fig 29 for the conditions at β e f f 15 the harmonic content of the signal is dominated by tonal components multiples of the blade passing frequency b p f in the low frequency interval of the spectrum consistently with the fact that the cavitation phenomena were absent and the evolution of the time histories discussed in the previous section the harmonics drop abruptly and the signals are dominated by the 1 s t and 2 n d bpf for this reason the detailed evolution of the amplitude of the harmonics of single blade thrust and spindle torque is showed only for the 1 s t and 2 n d bpf in figs 30 and 31 respectively it is evident that the blade loads are dominated by the 1 s t bpf given the similar trends of δ l and the harmonics when comparing figs 21 and 30 this is also corroborated by their relative magnitude from the transient and steady state values the 1 s t bpf is almost four and three times larger than the 2 n d bpf on the external and internal propeller respectively on the external side the harmonics of k t x and k q z increase monotonically with the increase of the β e f f conversely on the internal side the trend is non linear the magnitude establishing 1 s t bpf or decreasing after β e f f 20 these trends are confirmed by the oblique towing tests in general it is interesting to observe that the discrepancy between the harmonics associated to different propeller loading smoothly increases for 1 s t bpf on the external propeller whereas it is markedly stronger for the second component for both external and internal propellers the deviations with the transient and steady state results are consistent with those observed for the absolute fluctuation in general it can be evidenced that for the external propeller and the 2 n d bpf of the internal one the free running data fall inside the band spanned by o t for both blade thrust and spindle torque see panels on the right in figs 30 and 31 conversely the 1 s t bpf of thrust and spindle torque developed by the blade of the internal propeller is under predicted at highest drift angles 5 conclusions and further works the present work complemented the investigation concerning the systematic analysis of single blade loads obtained by oblique towing tests and their comparison with measures obtained by free running maneuvers dubbioso and ortolani 2020 these investigations were conceived to gain a very detailed insight in the propeller performance in maneuvering conditions and collect quantitative data for validation of advanced c f d solvers as well as for the development and enhancement of simplified tools for taking into consideration realistic and off design operative conditions since the earlier stages of ship design the single blade loads measured by captive model tests were first analyzed and compared to the quasi steady phase of free running turning maneuvers in terms of hub components that are related to structural strength of the propulsive shaft and to the dynamic response of the ship providing non negligible maneuvering forces in this case the captive model tests provided a further insight on the generation of the loads due to propeller loading the blade loads obtained with captive model tests are in good agreement with steady turning regime obtained by free running test in terms of absolute values and split contribution of the source loads over halves of the disk in particular the behavior on the external propeller is accurately reproduced on the other hand a more evident discrepancy was revealed on the internal propeller as a consequence of the expected different evolution of the wake for the two kind of tests nevertheless the non linear evolution of the loads associated to complex blade wake interaction and hydrodynamic interference is captured the second issue of the investigation was concerned with transient maneuvers in particular the single blade loads generated during transient phases of the turning circle namely the initial transient at δ 15 and 35 and the pull out for the tightest maneuver were considered and then compared with captive tests the analysis emphasized that the loads developed during transitory phases differ with respect to the quasi steady conditions considered at equivalent drift angle the main reason of the discrepancy is associated to speed drop that determines both the propeller loading condition on one side and on the other the evolution of the vortical structures detached from the hull and their consequent interaction with the wake of the appendages the problem on the internal propeller is the most critical because the blades always rotate in a strongly perturbed flow in contrast to the windward side where the interactions are substantially weaker given the similarity with a pure oblique flow in general the study showed that on the leeward side the maximum fluctuation of the single blade load is stronger for the first transient of the turning circle i e t r a with respect to steady turning i e s t while during the pull out the fluctuation are smaller than s t conversely the averaged values developed during t r a are closer with respect to the steady conditions while they are amplified during pull out this fact stresses that the evolution of the wake of the hull affects more the propeller performance during t r a phases since the discrepancy in terms of speed drop and hence propeller loads with respect to s t is smaller than p o qualitatively the same trend is observed for the external propeller although the p o and t r a depart almost equally from the loads developed in steady turn given the minimal interference with the wake also in this case the captive model tests capture very satisfactorily the behavior of the propeller in terms of mean value maximum fluctuation and periodic load this result confirms that captive model tests typically used in ship hydrodynamics to characterize hull loads maneuvering can be equally useful to achieve systematic quantification of propeller performance in this regard captive model tests demanding simpler set up and structural devices are cheaper than free running tests and can be therefore considered at earlier stages of the design this is a key point for the enhancement of system based models that make possible to consider off design and realistic operative conditions in the optimization design loop obviously the present conclusion needs further validation with a broader set of unsteady maneuvers in this regard the systematic analysis of a broad set of single blade loads developed during a thorough set of free running maneuvers that considers also fully unsteady maneuvers standard and non standard zig

increases along the curved span of two cylinder whereas the absolute value of base coefficient decreases keywords convex curved cylinder spacing ratio vorticity structures feature axial flow mean pressure coefficients 1 introduction the complex flow in the wake of multiple cylinders in side by side configuration has attracted considerable attention due to its relevance to offshore and ocean engineering applications such as risers pipelines and cables etc the top ends of the catenary risers and mooring lines are attached on the floating production system and the horizontal parts near the bottom ends are laid on the seabed resulting in curved spans between the touch down points and the vertical pipes the changing local inclination angle along the span of the curved cylinders contributes to a wake flow much more complex than the ones behind straight cylinders numerous numerical studies on flow past a single curved cylinder have been performed to investigate the effects of the reynolds number the curvature radius and flow direction on the flow behaviors strouhal numbers and force coefficients miliou et al 2003 2007 canabes 2010 gallardo et al 2013 2014 assi et al 2014 shang et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 2019 jiang et al 2018a b 2019 zhu et al 2018 2019 it was found that at low reynolds numbers the curvature of cylinder induces the out of phase mode of the vortex tubes along the curved span of the single cylinder miliou et al 2007 gallardo et al 2014a b the vortex tubes are deformed and the phase of vortex shedding is shifted close to the horizontal section however the vortex tubes are almost parallel to the cylindrical axis and vortex shedding is in phase mode along the span at high reynolds numbers the wake flow features of flow past a curved cylinder with convex and concave configurations are very different from each other miliou et al 2003 2007 the vortex tubes are slightly inclined and follow the curved span only a single predominant vortex shedding frequency exists along the span in the convex case while the vortex shedding is significantly suppressed by the axial flow in the concave case gallardo et al 2014a b and canabes 2010 performed a series of numerical simulation to investigate the three dimensional flow instabilities for a convex curved cylinder the spanwise velocity changes drastically due to the effect of curvature resulting in larger mean pressure gradient in the upper part of the cylinder where the cylinder axis is perpendicular to the flow gallardo et al 2014a b further investigated the turbulent wake behind the convex curved cylinder with horizontal and vertical extensions at subcritical reynolds number re 3900 the results show that the vorticity strength is significantly reduced and the three dimensional characteristics are drastically enhanced near the horizontal section the turbulent wake and reynolds stress intensity for a convex curved cylinder vary along the span of a curved cylinder gallardo et al 2014a b the wake flow features such as reverse flow region and roll up of shear layers gradually disappear near the horizontal extension similarly the reynolds stress magnitude is reduced along the curved span which is attributed to combined effects of the weak vortices strength and existence of the axis flow gallardo et al 2013 and jiang et al 2018a b found the attached extension reduces the effect of the boundary condition on the wake of curved section jiang et al 2018a b investigated the flow past a concave curved cylinder at low reynolds numbers and classified the flow into three different flow regimes non shedding oblique shedding and parallel shedding shang et al 2018 performed a series of experiments on flow past a concave and convex curved cylinders at different reynolds numbers and aspect ratios the spanwise velocity and streamwise vorticity are found to increase with the increase of the curvature at concave configuration and the vortex shedding is completely suppressed when the curvature is sufficiently high when multiple cylinders are arranged in a side by side configuration the wake flow features become more complex and are affected by the spacing ratio l d where l is the center to center spacing between two cylinders and d is the cylinder diameter and the reynolds number re where re ud υ u is the free stream velocity and υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid sumner et al 1999 2010 xu et al 2013 alam et al 2003 2007 2011 2013 tong et al 2014 2015 depending on l d and re the wake flow pattern could present as a single street asymmetrical flow and two coupled streets alam and zhou 2013 observed four flow regimes with the increase of l d for two side by side square cylinders i e the single bluff body regime the asymmetric regime the transition regime and the coupled vortex street regime at an intermediate spacing ratio the gap flow is deflected towards one cylinder resulting into a narrow wake and a wide wake behind the two cylinders respectively the deflection direction of the gap flow switches from one cylinder to another intermittently forming a flip flop flow pattern ishigai et al 1972 extensive experimental and numerical studies have been performed to investigate the mechanisms of the gap flow deflection for two side by side straight cylinders afgan et al 2011 observed narrow and wide wakes for two side by side cylinders at subcritical reynolds numbers and as the spacing ratio increases the vortex streets become symmetrical the narrow and wide wakes are formed due to the anti phase gap vortices that are close to each other alam and zhou 2013 wang and zhou 2005 reported that the asymmetrical flow regime could be divided into the stably deflected gap flow and changeover of the gap flow deflection regimes gao et al 2020 performed a series of experiments to investigate the effect of the inclination angle on the gap flow patterns behind two and three side by side cylinders the switchover phenomenon from the deflected flow pattern into the flip flop pattern is observed when the inclination angle is in a certain range the spacing ratio is found to have a significant effect on the force coefficient as l d increases the force coefficient and mean pressure coefficients decrease bearman and wadcock 1973 vu et al 2016 the reason for the formation of gap flow and its direction changeover is explained by wang and zhou 2005 they found that when the vortices in the wide wake are in phase and the opposite signed vortices in the narrow wake are engaged in pairing the gap flow is deflected to one side due to the formation of a low pressure zone the phase lagging of the vortices existed between the wide and narrow wakes will lead to the changeover of the gap flow deflection from one side to another as mentioned above most of the previous studies are focused on the flow behaviors behind two side by side straight cylinders that are perpendicular to the flow direction there is a lack of information on the effects of the spacing ratio and the reynolds number on the wake flow features along the curved spans of two cylinders therefore the principal aim of the present study is to investigate the three dimensional flow characteristics behind two side by side curved cylinders at different spacing ratios and reynolds numbers the paper is organized as follows the numerical methods and model validation are described in section 2 and 3 in section 4 the results for the instantaneous wake flow patterns time averaged flow fields axis flow characteristics and mean pressure coefficients are presented finally the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 numerical method fig 1 shows a sketch of the computational domain for simulating flow past two parallel side by side curved cylinders with the same diameter of d and a center to center distance of l the diameter of each cylinder is 0 01m each cylinder comprises a horizontal straight section a vertical straight section and an arc section with a 90 angle and a radius of r 12 5d flow past a same single cylinder has been widely used in the previous numerical studies miliou et al 2003 2007 2007 gallardo et al 2014a b jiang et al 2018a b the spacing ratio l d is varied from 1 25 to 5 the parameters l v and l h are defined as the vertical straight extension length and horizontal straight extension length respectively the lengths of the horizontal and vertical straight extensions are l h 10d and l v 6d respectively which are sufficiently long to ensure negligible effects of the top and right boundaries on the flow features of the curved part of the cylinder gallardo et al 2013 jiang et al 2018a b the computational domain is 32 5d long in the streamwise direction x direction 20d l wide in the y direction and 28 5d high in the z direction the inlet boundary is located 10d from the center of vertical portion the distance between the bottom boundary and the horizontal cylinder is 10d two lateral side boundaries are located 10d from the centers of two cylinders the horizontal section of the cylinder ends at the outlet boundary the parameter s is defined as the distance from the top end of the curved part along the cylinder span i e s rφ where φ is the local inclination angle of the curved axis with respect to the vertical direction the uniform flow is parallel to the planes of two curved cylinders i e the system is in a convex arrangement for the purpose of convenience the two side by side cylinders are labeled as c1 and c2 respectively direct numerical simulation dns is used to simulate the flow past two side by side curved cylinders the flow past two side by side curved cylinders is governed by the three dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations 1 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j 2 u i x i 0 where the coordinates x 1 x x 2 y and x 3 z u i is the fluid velocity in the x i direction t is the time ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure and ν is the kinematic viscosity the navier stokes equations are solved using the open source field operation and manipulation openfoam v1806 c libraries the icofoam solver is adopted in the present study the convection terms are discretized using the second order cell limited gauss linear scheme the pressure terms and laplace terms are discretized using the second order gauss linear scheme the velocity and pressure coupling fields are solved by piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm the second order crank nicholson implicit scheme is adopted for the temporal discretization a uniform flow velocity is imposed on the inlet boundary i e u i u v w u 0 0 where u v and w are the velocities in the x y and z directions respectively three flow velocities are set to be u 0 01 m s 0 03 m s 0 05 m s corresponding to reynolds numbers re 100 300 and 500 respectively the viscosity of the fluid is 1 10 6 m2 s no slip boundary is employed on the surfaces of the two cylinders the velocity is zero a symmetry boundary condition is given to the top boundary i e u z 0 v z 0 w 0 and p z 0 on the outflow boundary the neumann boundary condition is applied for velocity i e u x 0 v x 0 and w x 0 and the pressure is set to zero free slip condition is applied on the two lateral boundaries i e v 0 u y 0 w y 0 p y 0 and bottom boundary i e w 0 u z 0 v z 0 p z 0 the non dimensional computational time step δ t u d 0 01 is adopted to ensure the maximum courant number of 0 55 which is sufficient to ensure the stability and convergence of the numerical simulations 3 mesh dependency study and numerical validation to test the mesh dependency flows past a straight cylinder and single curved cylinder at re 100 and 500 are simulated using three meshes with different densities the non dimensional distance between the first layer mesh node next to the cylinder and the cylinder surface defined as y u f δ ν where u f is the friction velocity and δ is the radial distance between a mesh node and the cylinder surface the radial size of the cell on the cylinder surface is 0 06 and 0 01 for re 100 and 500 respectively table 1 shows the comparison of the numerical results obtained from meshes with different densities where δx min is the minimum mesh size in the streamwise direction the comparisons of the mean drag coefficient c d root mean square lift coefficient c l and strouhal number st obtained from the medium mesh with literature results at re 100 and 500 are presented in table 2 the drag and lift coefficients c d and c l pressure coefficient c p and strouhal numbers st are defined as follows 3 c d 2 f d ρ a u 2 4 c l 2 f l ρ a u 2 5 c p 2 p p ρ u 2 6 s t f s d u where f d and f l are the drag and lift forces on a straight cylinder in the in line and cross flow directions respectively and they are calculated by integrating the pressure and shear stress around the surface of the cylinder c p is the mean pressure coefficient p is the pressure at the inlet boundary a is the projected area of the curved cylinder in the flow direction calculated as a r d 2 l v d f s is the vortex shedding frequency which is obtained by performing the fast fourier transition fft analysis of the lift coefficient fig 2 shows the time histories of the lift and drag coefficients for the vertical extension of the single curved cylinder calculated from the coarse medium and fine meshes at re 100 and 500 it can be seen that both the lift and drag coefficients from the medium and fine meshes agree well with each other at re 100 at re 500 due to the three dimensionality of the flow the fluctuations of the force coefficients behave not regularly periodic the results from the medium mesh are in consistent with those from the fine mesh as shown in table 1 the mean drag coefficient c d and strouhal number st for the straight cylinder from the medium mesh are nearly the same as the values from the fine mesh at re 100 the difference between the root mean square lift coefficients c l of the medium and fine meshes is less than 1 3 for the straight cylinder with the length of h 6d at re 100 the differences in c d and c l between the medium and fine meshes are about are 0 4 and 0 7 between the medium and fine meshes for the vertical extension of the curved cylinder respectively at re 500 for the straight cylinder the percentage changes of c d and st are less than 0 6 and 0 5 between the medium and fine meshes respectively while the variation of c l is approximately 1 7 for both cases the mesh refinement from medium to fine leads to 0 5 decreasing in c d and 1 3 decreasing in c l for the vertical extension of the curved cylinder therefore the medium mesh density is considered to be sufficient to obtain accuracy results for flow past two side by side curved cylinders the c d of the straight cylinder from the medium mesh agree with the results of meneghini et al 2001 and braza et al 1986 for re 100 and the present results of c l and st agree well with the published results it is observed that the c l of the curved cylinder obtained from the mid span of the straight vertical extension are larger than the results of the straight cylinder while the c d agrees well with the results of muddada and patnaik 2010 and burbeau and sagaut 2002 as for re 500 the c d and st of the straight cylinder obtained from the medium mesh are in good agreement with the results of batcho and karniadakis 1991 mittal and balachandar 1995 and thapa et al 2015 the difference of c l between the present simulation and published results is less than 2 2 fig 3 shows the wake topology for flow past a single curved cylinder at re 100 and 500 it can be seen that at re 100 the shed vortex cores are straight in the wake of the vertical straight section and distorted further downstream this section as re increases to 500 the wake flow exhibits three dimensional wake instabilities many small rib shaped streamwise vortical structures are observed and the vortical structures along the span of the curved cylinder become more energetic the present results of wake topologies agree well with those reported in miliou et al 2007 the time averaged flow is obtained by averaging the flow fields from ut d 400 to 700 and the streamlines of time averaged flow are presented in fig 4 it can be seen that the time average streamlines are parallel to the free stream in the downstream of the curved cylinder but distorted near the curved segment due to the effect of the curvature the recirculation zone near the rear stagnation line gradually decreases along the cylinder span which is in good agreement with those in canabes 2010 fig 5 shows the comparisons of the mean pressure coefficient and time averaged flow velocity in the z direction along the span of the convex configuration for flow past a single curved cylinder at re 100 and 500 with the published literature results the time averaged flow velocity in z direction along the span is extracted 0 3d upstream of the front stagnation line of the curved cylinder the variation trend of the absolute values of the base pressure coefficients along the span of the curved cylinder is in good agreement with those of miliou et al 2007 and zhu et al 2018 the discrepancies between the present result of c ps and that of canabes 2010 may be caused by the adoption of different computational domains the non dimensional time averaged flow velocity along the span w u shows firstly an increasing and then decreasing trend with the increase of s d and reaches to the minimum value at s d 10 the variations of the flow velocities with s d are in good agreement with those of miliou et al 2007 and lee et al 2020 to further validate the present numerical method the comparisons of the mean stagnation pressure coefficients on the vertical cylinder surfaces for flow past a straight cylinder between the present numerical study and literature results are performed and the variation of the mean stagnation pressure coefficient c p for a single straight cylinder with reynolds number is plotted in fig 6 it can be seen that the mean stagnation pressure coefficient decreases with the increase of reynolds number the c p for the straight cylinder in the present study is in good agreement with the variation trend of the fitted curve and the literature results batham 1973 canabes 2010 homann 1936 kravchenko and moin 2000 lei et al 2001 norberg 1994 rajani et al 2009 thom 1933 4 numerical results 4 1 instantaneous wake flow patterns the instantaneous vortex flow structures at different spacing ratios 1 25 l d 5 0 and reynolds numbers 100 re 500 at ut d 650 are presented in fig 7 and the top views of these three dimensional vortex tubes at the x y plane are also depicted in fig 8 the non dimensional vortices iso surfaces are identified by the q criterion q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where the ω and s are the anti symmetric and symmetrical parts of the velocity gradient tensor respectively the non dimensional q is defined as q q d 2 u 2 the wake flow pattern behind two curved cylinders varies significantly along the span similar to those for a single curved cylinder gallardo et al 2014a b shang et al 2018 both the spacing ratio and reynolds number have significant effects on the three dimensional wake flow topologies for two curved cylinders at small spacing ratio of l d 1 25 two curved cylinders are in a close proximity regime where only one pair of vortex tubes is formed in the wake and the two cylinders behave as a single bluff body behind the vertical parts of two curved cylinders the shear layers roll up and form a single vortex street with large scale vortex tubes behind two cylinders at re 100 the primary vortex tubes are nearly parallel to the curved axis and the wake width along the curved sections of two cylinders decreases due to the phase difference of vortex shedding along the cylinder span the vortices re 300 and 500 become inclined with the increase of the reynolds number the waviness of the wake flow is observed behind two side by side curved cylinders and the streamwise vortices becomes stronger as l d increases to 1 5 the vortex dislocation is observed at the junction of the vertical and curved sections of two cylinders the dislocation of the primary vortices is caused by the mode a wake which occurs at higher reynolds number for straight cylinders the continuities of the vortex cores are obviously destroyed and the wake flow becomes less coherent along the span although the spanwise vorticities are wavy at high reynolds number they are perpendicular to the incoming direction at re 300 and parallel to the upper part of the curved cylinder at re 500 this is similar to flow past a straight inclined cylinder where the wake vortices are always parallel to the cylinder zhao et al 2013 as l d is increased to 2 the spanwise vortex tubes are twisted at the junction of the vertical and the curved section for re 100 where the spanwise vortices are inclined and weak the scales of the vortex tubes generated from the curved part of the cylinder decrease as re increases to 300 and 500 the wake flow is weakly turbulent the energy is transferred from the spanwise vortices to the streamwise vortices that dissipates quickly the location of the primary vortex moves towards to the surface of curved cylinders and the small vortices are amalgamated to form a cluster of vortical structures near the horizontal extension the vortex tubes behind the vertical extension are parallel to the cylinder the shape of vortex tubes remains parallel to the axis of the cylinder at lower part of the curved section at large spacing ratios of 3 l d 5 symmetric vortex shedding is observed in the wake of the vertical extensions of two curved cylinders for re 100 in figs 7 and 8 two vortex tubes that are shed from the cylinder are parallel to the vertical section of the cylinder indicating the two dimensional flow for the vertical extension at re 100 the two curved cylinders behave more independent at re 100 on the lower sides of two curved cylinders the axial flows are directed towards the vertical extensions vortex shedding is vanished close to the horizontal extensions the wavy primary vortices are parallel to the axis of the vertical segment of two curved cylinders the distortion of the spanwise vortices and the generation of the strong streamwise vortices are observed behind the vertical segment similar to the wake flow of mode b for flow past a vertical cylinder williamson 1988 barkley and henderson 1996 the vortical structure at the curved parts of two cylinders become more enhanced the coherence of the wake caused by the alternating primary vortices disappears the vorticity structures are moved towards to the surfaces of two cylinders leading to the oblique shedding phenomenon in the wake of the curved segments on the other hand the non shedding regime at re 100 and the shear layer instabilities for re 300 and 500 are observed close to the horizontal extension the wake flow behaviors behind two side by side curved cylinders are further investigated by studying the instantaneous non dimensional vorticity contours at different horizontal sections of two curved cylinders with re 100 and 300 shown in fig 9 the non dimensional instantaneous spanwise vorticity ω z is defined as ω z ω z d u where ω z v x u y when l d 1 25 a single vortex street is observed along the vertical parts of the cylinder span of two curved cylinders for re 100 and 300 it is interesting to note that the deflected gap flow is observed at re 300 where a narrow wake and a wide wake are formed behind two curved cylinders the inner vortices developed in the gap flow are squeezed and merged with the shed vortices on the outer sides of the cylinders resulting in a single large scale vortex street formed in the downstream wake the flow feature for l d 1 5 is the same as that for l d 1 25 it is interesting to note that different from those of two side by side straight cylinders the switchover of the gap flow deflection occurs along the curved spans for two curved cylinders at re 100 and 300 the phase differences of vortex shedding along the cylinder span cause the inclination of the spanwise vortices and result into the oblique vortex shedding pattern at low reynolds number re 100 depending on the deflected direction of the gap flow the asymmetrical wake flow pattern with a narrow and a wide wake is observed at the upper part of the vertical extension z d 27 5 17 5 at the lower side close to the horizontal plane z d 12 the shear layers become parallel to the incoming flow direction with the suppression of vortex shedding process as re increases the switchover of the gap flow deflection occurs at z d 17 5 and 12 with the increase of l d to 2 two parallel vortex streets are observed along both the curved and vertical straight spans with the coupling vortices formed behind two cylinders which could be regarded as the dual vortex street regime different from the cases of two straight cylinders a distinct flow feature of the transition from the in phase to the anti phase vortex shedding pattern is observed along the curved spans of two cylinders take the case of re 300 for example at the upper part of vertical extension z d 27 5 the vortex shedding is predominantly in the in phase pattern where the vortices with the same rotational signs are synchronized shed behind two cylinders the shed vortices become weakened due to the interactions of the vortices with opposite signs at the lower part close to the horizontal extension z d 12 the anti phase vortex shedding occurs behind two cylinders where the vortices are shed synchronized in the opposite directions as l d increases to 3 the proximity interference between two cylinders becomes weak and each cylinder behaves like an isolated bluff body two parallel shed vortices in the anti phase and in phase patterns are observed along the curved span the vortices observed at the upper and lower parts are out of phases where two rows of parallel shed vortices are predominantly in the anti phase pattern at z d 22 5 and 27 5 and changes to in phase pattern at the lower side horizontal planes z d 17 5 for re 100 at z d 12 the large inclination suppresses the vortex shedding and the shear layers separated from two cylinders are stretched no regular vortex shedding is observed the three dimensionality of the wake flow behind two side by side curved cylinders are enhanced at re 300 the regular in phase vortex shedding is observed at all the examined horizontal planes for l d 3 the streamwise evolutions of the wake behind the horizontal extensions of two curved cylinders are also illustrated fig 10 shows the non dimensional instantaneous vorticity contours ω x at different vertical y z planes at different spacing ratios 1 25 l d 3 and reynolds numbers re 100 and 300 the non dimensional instantaneous streamwise vorticity ω x is defined as ω x ω x d u where ω x w y v z it is interesting to note that the wake flow patterns are significantly affected by the reynolds numbers and spacing ratios behave different along the spans of horizontal extensions for two curved cylinders at the vertical plane x d 12 close to the vertical segment of two curved cylinders two counter rotating vortices evolve along the axis of each curved cylinder for low reynolds number re 100 the two cylinders behave as a single bluff body at l d 1 25 an alternate vortex shedding is observed at the further downstream location x d 28 as l d increases to 1 5 an asymmetrical wake flow pattern is also observed in the streamwise vorticity contours as l d increases to 3 0 the anti phase vortex shedding mode is observed along the horizontal extension spans of two cylinders with the increase of re the streamwise wake flow exhibits high turbulence and the intense of the vortices increases 4 2 time averaged flow characteristics fig 11 shows the time averaged streamlines at different spanwise locations in the x y planes with different spacing ratios behind two side by side curved cylinders for re 300 the time averaged streamline topologies are obtained by averaging the velocity and pressure over the time period 400 ut d 700 where the gap flow is only biased to one cylinder behind the vertical straight section at 1 25 l d 1 5 at l d 1 25 the gap flow is deflected downwards resulting into an asymmetrical streamline pattern a large scale of recirculation zone is formed behind c1 and a small scale of recirculation zone is formed behind c2 the streamlines in the downstream are distorted due to the proximity interference between two cylinders due to the curvatures of two curved cylinders the variation of the streamwise velocity along the span direction is irregular the scale of the recirculation zone gradually decreases from z d 27 5 to z d 17 5 as l d increases to 2 and 3 the streamline topologies between two curved cylinders become parallel and regular at the horizontal plane z d 12 the recirculation zone disappears at l d 2 and 3 the scale of the reverse flow zone behind each curved cylinder decreases and is approximately symmetrical with the centerline between two cylinders at different spanwise locations the contours of the time averaged reynolds normal stresses u u u 2 v v u 2 and reynolds shear stress u v u 2 at different z d locations for l d 1 25 2 and 3 with re 300 are presented in figs 12 14 where the positive and negative values are represented by solid and dashed lines u and v are the root mean square velocities in the x and y directions respectively with the increase of l d different reynolds stress characteristics are observed along the spans of two curved cylinders at small spacing ratio l d 1 25 the reynolds stress contours exhibit asymmetrical distribution a small reynolds normal stress contour u u u 2 exists behind two cylinders the reynolds stress intensity decreases along the span of curved cylinders in consistent with the variations of vortices strengths the reynolds normal stress contour v v u 2 exhibits a single peak causing by the vortex shedding with the increase of l d to 2 and 3 the reynolds stress distributions at z d 27 5 22 5 and 17 5 for two side by side curved cylinders are similar to that of a single cylinder the reynolds normal stress and reynolds shear stress contours are symmetric and anti symmetric with the centerline between two curved cylinders respectively the amalgamation phenomena of the inner reynolds normal stress contours are observed between two curved cylinders the intensity of the reynolds normal stress u u u 2 reaches to the maximum value at x 1 5d downstream of the cylinder two small lobes are observed in the reynolds shear stress contour u v u 2 in the upstream and two large lobes in the downstream no reynolds shear stress contour is observed close to the rear of cylinder which may be contributed to the little fluctuations of the velocity in the x z plane in the wake dong et al 2006 4 3 axial flow characteristics figs 15 and 16 show the contour plots of the mean streamwise velocity u and vertical velocity w at two x z slices i e y d 10 and y d 10 l d for different spacing ratios l d 1 25 2 3 and re 300 the curvature has a significant effect on the flow velocity distributions along the span of two side by side cylinders a recirculation zone is observed in front of the vertical and curved segments for two cylinders where the values of u and w are negative the flow direction shifts counterclockwise in the horizontal extension along the curved span the vertical component gradually increases and finally aligns with the incoming flow velocity the scale of recirculation zone decreases with increasing of l d the length of the reverse flow zone in the streamwise direction is significantly reduced the mean streamwise velocities gradually decrease as approaching to the surface of the curved cylinders the distribution of the spanwise velocity near the curved section of two cylinders exhibits a similar trend to that of a single curved cylinder the spanwise velocity is negative at both the front and rear of the curved segment and positive at the rear of the vertical extension with the increase of l d the scale of the recirculation zone decreases where the spanwise velocity is negative the reverse flow is suppressed at the location close to the horizontal extension the contours of w depict an upwards and downwards flow in upper and lower part of two curved cylinders respectively with the increase of the depth the three dimensionality of the flow can be illustrated by the profiles of mean vertical velocity w at z d 27 5 and 22 5 the profile exhibits an upwelling flow from the axial curvature of two curved cylinders propagating upwards along the vertical extension the vertical velocity close to the horizontal extension reaches to 0 2u further downstream the profiles of w at z d 17 5 and 12 exhibit a downdraft flow where the downdraft vertical velocity increases with depth and reaches almost 20 of the free stream velocity u at the curved parts of two cylinders fig 17 plots the time averaged axial velocity u a x distribution along a line behind each cylinder surface at different spacing ratios and reynolds numbers the line is defined as a curve parallel to the curved cylinder with offset of 1 1d as shown in fig 17 c following jiang et al 2018 2019 the axial velocity u a x used in the present study is defined as the local tangential velocity along the curved cylinder and calculated based on the streamwise velocity u and vertical velocity w u a x u sin φ w cos φ when the u a x increases the predominant vortex shedding pattern will change from the normal vortex shedding mode to the oblique vortex shedding mode at re 100 the vortex tube behind the vertical extension is perpendicular to the incoming flow the axis flow velocity is close to zero due to the oblique vortex shedding phenomenon the fluctuations of the axis flow velocities along the vertical section increase with reynolds number at the curved section the axial flow velocity increases with the inclined angle φ and approaches to the maximum value at the junction of the curved and horizontal sections of two cylinders for each spacing ratio except for the cases of l d 1 25 and 1 5 the axial velocity of the curved section for each cylinder at re 300 and 500 is much larger than that at re 100 where the existence of the high streamwise vorticity strength causes the increase of the axial velocity at re 300 and 500 the axial flow velocity is remained to be zero at l d 1 25 and 1 5 along the curved spans of two cylinders at the horizontal extensions of two curved cylinders the axial flow velocity reaches a maximum of 67 of the free stream velocity at small spacing ratio l d 1 25 it is interesting to note that at low reynolds number re 100 the axial flow velocity is almost zero at l d 1 5 as re increases to 300 and 500 the axial flow velocity increases with l d and reaches to a maximum of 88 of the free stream velocity at l d 5 along the horizontal extensions of two cylinders the axial flow velocity decreases to about 10 and 7 of the free stream velocity for each cylinder at l d 1 25 respectively 4 4 mean pressure coefficients the variations of the mean pressure coefficients on the surfaces of two side by side curved cylinders at different horizontal planes z d 27 5 17 5 and 12 for re 300 are presented in fig 18 in general the distributions of the mean pressure coefficient c p for both two curved cylinders are almost symmetrical about θ 180 i e the base point on the cylinder surfaces at different z d similar to those for flow past straight cylinders lam et al 2008 however it is interesting to note that the distributions of mean pressure coefficients for c1 and c2 at z d 12 are significantly different from those at z d 17 5 and 27 5 where the fluctuation amplitude of c p is significantly reduced from 1 0 to 0 5 along the span the vortex shedding is suppressed at z d 12 for the curved ellipse cross section the inclination angle of the curved cylinder increases when close to the horizontal extension leading to the decreasing of normal velocity component similar variation trend of the pressure coefficient with spanwise depth is observed for a single curved cylinder gallardo et al 2014a b with the increase of the inclination angle the surface pressure coefficient decreases the separation points are found to be more sensitive to the variation of the spacing ratios the positions of separation points are located about θ 80 for 3 l d 5 at different reynolds numbers similar to that of a single cylinder however the separation point for c2 is located at θ 100 for l d 1 25 and 1 5 fig 19 depicts the variations of the base pressure coefficient c p b and stagnation pressure coefficient c p s along the stagnation lines from the vertical extension to the junction of curved segment and horizontal extension at different spacing ratios for re 100 300 and 500 respectively the base pressure coefficient c p b and stagnation pressure coefficient c p s are defined as the pressure coefficient at the base line and the front stagnation line tong et al 2015 the fluctuation of pressure causes the emergence of spanwise flow resulting into the oblique vortex shedding hammache and gharib 1991 the stagnation pressure coefficient does not vary with z d at the same spacing ratio in the vertical extension indicating that the upstream flow conditions are irresponsible to the oblique vortex shedding in the wake due to the spanwise velocity reduce along the span the absolute values of c p b and c p s decrease monotonically with increasing of s d and approach to zero at the junction of the curved segment and the horizontal extension in consistent with those of a single curved cylinder observed by miliou et al 2007 and canabes 2010 the base pressure coefficient is sensitive to the variation of flow instability and reynolds number since the change of base pressure coefficient becomes more irregular with the increase of reynolds number in agreement with the results for a straight cylinder obtained by williamson 1996 the values of stagnation of pressure coefficients increase with l d for each curved cylinder however the absolute value of base pressure at l d 4 is larger than that of a single cylinder 4 5 strouhal number the non dimensional vortex shedding frequency strouhal number s t f s d u is obtained by fast fourier transform fft analysis of the transverse flow velocity which is extracted from a distance of 5d behind the axis of curved cylinder at different spanwise locations fig 20 shows the power spectra of the transverse flow velocity at different spacing ratios for re 300 at small spacing ratios 1 25 l d 2 multiple harmonic peaks are observed in the power spectra for two cylinders with increasing of l d two prominent peaks are observed at different spanwise locations and the spectral amplitude decreases along the spanwise of the curved cylinders which is similar with the literature results of flow past the inclined cylinder and curved cylinder zhao et al 2009 gallardo et al 2014a b fig 21 shows the variation of the strouhal number with spacing ratio for both two side by side curved cylinders which is determined based on the vortex shedding frequency corresponding to the primary peak the strouhal number for each cylinder increases with l d and approaches to that of a single cylinder at large spacing ratios l d 4 and 5 in general the strouhal number at the vertical extension z d 27 5 is significantly larger than that at z d 12 at l d 3 the discrepancies of the strouhal numbers along the span decrease the interaction between two cylinders is reduced at large spacing ratios l d 4 and 5 the strouhal number is almost identical to that of a single curved cylinder 5 conclusions a series of three dimensional numerical simulations are performed to investigate flow past two side by side curved cylinders the effects of the reynolds number and spacing ratio on the wake topologies time average flow fields and mean pressure coefficient distributions are studied the results are summarized as follows 1 the wake behind the vertical straight sections of the two side by side cylinders are classified into four flow regimes a single bluff body pattern biased flow pattern coupling vortex shedding pattern and co shedding pattern as re increases the critical spacing ratio for different flow regimes decreases the flows along the curved sections of two cylinders are classified into five flow regimes normal vortex shedding vortex dislocation oblique vortex shedding non shedding and shear layer instability regimes 2 the reverse flow is found to be significantly suppressed at the spanwise location close to the horizontal extension due to the effect of axial flow velocity with the increase of l d the axial flow velocity increases and the streamline pattern behind two cylinders behaves from the asymmetrical to symmetrical distribution 3 the reynolds stress the vortex strengths and the mean pressure coefficients behind two curved cylinders are significantly reduced along the curved section the absolute value of base pressure coefficient decreases with the increase of l d as the reynolds number increases the base coefficients of two curved cylinders increase data

pressure coefficients 1 introduction the complex flow in the wake of multiple cylinders in side by side configuration has attracted considerable attention due to its relevance to offshore and ocean engineering applications such as risers pipelines and cables etc the top ends of the catenary risers and mooring lines are attached on the floating production system and the horizontal parts near the bottom ends are laid on the seabed resulting in curved spans between the touch down points and the vertical pipes the changing local inclination angle along the span of the curved cylinders contributes to a wake flow much more complex than the ones behind straight cylinders numerous numerical studies on flow past a single curved cylinder have been performed to investigate the effects of the reynolds number the curvature radius and flow direction on the flow behaviors strouhal numbers and force coefficients miliou et al 2003 2007 canabes 2010 gallardo et al 2013 2014 assi et al 2014 shang et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 2019 jiang et al 2018a b 2019 zhu et al 2018 2019 it was found that at low reynolds numbers the curvature of cylinder induces the out of phase mode of the vortex tubes along the curved span of the single cylinder miliou et al 2007 gallardo et al 2014a b the vortex tubes are deformed and the phase of vortex shedding is shifted close to the horizontal section however the vortex tubes are almost parallel to the cylindrical axis and vortex shedding is in phase mode along the span at high reynolds numbers the wake flow features of flow past a curved cylinder with convex and concave configurations are very different from each other miliou et al 2003 2007 the vortex tubes are slightly inclined and follow the curved span only a single predominant vortex shedding frequency exists along the span in the convex case while the vortex shedding is significantly suppressed by the axial flow in the concave case gallardo et al 2014a b and canabes 2010 performed a series of numerical simulation to investigate the three dimensional flow instabilities for a convex curved cylinder the spanwise velocity changes drastically due to the effect of curvature resulting in larger mean pressure gradient in the upper part of the cylinder where the cylinder axis is perpendicular to the flow gallardo et al 2014a b further investigated the turbulent wake behind the convex curved cylinder with horizontal and vertical extensions at subcritical reynolds number re 3900 the results show that the vorticity strength is significantly reduced and the three dimensional characteristics are drastically enhanced near the horizontal section the turbulent wake and reynolds stress intensity for a convex curved cylinder vary along the span of a curved cylinder gallardo et al 2014a b the wake flow features such as reverse flow region and roll up of shear layers gradually disappear near the horizontal extension similarly the reynolds stress magnitude is reduced along the curved span which is attributed to combined effects of the weak vortices strength and existence of the axis flow gallardo et al 2013 and jiang et al 2018a b found the attached extension reduces the effect of the boundary condition on the wake of curved section jiang et al 2018a b investigated the flow past a concave curved cylinder at low reynolds numbers and classified the flow into three different flow regimes non shedding oblique shedding and parallel shedding shang et al 2018 performed a series of experiments on flow past a concave and convex curved cylinders at different reynolds numbers and aspect ratios the spanwise velocity and streamwise vorticity are found to increase with the increase of the curvature at concave configuration and the vortex shedding is completely suppressed when the curvature is sufficiently high when multiple cylinders are arranged in a side by side configuration the wake flow features become more complex and are affected by the spacing ratio l d where l is the center to center spacing between two cylinders and d is the cylinder diameter and the reynolds number re where re ud υ u is the free stream velocity and υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid sumner et al 1999 2010 xu et al 2013 alam et al 2003 2007 2011 2013 tong et al 2014 2015 depending on l d and re the wake flow pattern could present as a single street asymmetrical flow and two coupled streets alam and zhou 2013 observed four flow regimes with the increase of l d for two side by side square cylinders i e the single bluff body regime the asymmetric regime the transition regime and the coupled vortex street regime at an intermediate spacing ratio the gap flow is deflected towards one cylinder resulting into a narrow wake and a wide wake behind the two cylinders respectively the deflection direction of the gap flow switches from one cylinder to another intermittently forming a flip flop flow pattern ishigai et al 1972 extensive experimental and numerical studies have been performed to investigate the mechanisms of the gap flow deflection for two side by side straight cylinders afgan et al 2011 observed narrow and wide wakes for two side by side cylinders at subcritical reynolds numbers and as the spacing ratio increases the vortex streets become symmetrical the narrow and wide wakes are formed due to the anti phase gap vortices that are close to each other alam and zhou 2013 wang and zhou 2005 reported that the asymmetrical flow regime could be divided into the stably deflected gap flow and changeover of the gap flow deflection regimes gao et al 2020 performed a series of experiments to investigate the effect of the inclination angle on the gap flow patterns behind two and three side by side cylinders the switchover phenomenon from the deflected flow pattern into the flip flop pattern is observed when the inclination angle is in a certain range the spacing ratio is found to have a significant effect on the force coefficient as l d increases the force coefficient and mean pressure coefficients decrease bearman and wadcock 1973 vu et al 2016 the reason for the formation of gap flow and its direction changeover is explained by wang and zhou 2005 they found that when the vortices in the wide wake are in phase and the opposite signed vortices in the narrow wake are engaged in pairing the gap flow is deflected to one side due to the formation of a low pressure zone the phase lagging of the vortices existed between the wide and narrow wakes will lead to the changeover of the gap flow deflection from one side to another as mentioned above most of the previous studies are focused on the flow behaviors behind two side by side straight cylinders that are perpendicular to the flow direction there is a lack of information on the effects of the spacing ratio and the reynolds number on the wake flow features along the curved spans of two cylinders therefore the principal aim of the present study is to investigate the three dimensional flow characteristics behind two side by side curved cylinders at different spacing ratios and reynolds numbers the paper is organized as follows the numerical methods and model validation are described in section 2 and 3 in section 4 the results for the instantaneous wake flow patterns time averaged flow fields axis flow characteristics and mean pressure coefficients are presented finally the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 numerical method fig 1 shows a sketch of the computational domain for simulating flow past two parallel side by side curved cylinders with the same diameter of d and a center to center distance of l the diameter of each cylinder is 0 01m each cylinder comprises a horizontal straight section a vertical straight section and an arc section with a 90 angle and a radius of r 12 5d flow past a same single cylinder has been widely used in the previous numerical studies miliou et al 2003 2007 2007 gallardo et al 2014a b jiang et al 2018a b the spacing ratio l d is varied from 1 25 to 5 the parameters l v and l h are defined as the vertical straight extension length and horizontal straight extension length respectively the lengths of the horizontal and vertical straight extensions are l h 10d and l v 6d respectively which are sufficiently long to ensure negligible effects of the top and right boundaries on the flow features of the curved part of the cylinder gallardo et al 2013 jiang et al 2018a b the computational domain is 32 5d long in the streamwise direction x direction 20d l wide in the y direction and 28 5d high in the z direction the inlet boundary is located 10d from the center of vertical portion the distance between the bottom boundary and the horizontal cylinder is 10d two lateral side boundaries are located 10d from the centers of two cylinders the horizontal section of the cylinder ends at the outlet boundary the parameter s is defined as the distance from the top end of the curved part along the cylinder span i e s rφ where φ is the local inclination angle of the curved axis with respect to the vertical direction the uniform flow is parallel to the planes of two curved cylinders i e the system is in a convex arrangement for the purpose of convenience the two side by side cylinders are labeled as c1 and c2 respectively direct numerical simulation dns is used to simulate the flow past two side by side curved cylinders the flow past two side by side curved cylinders is governed by the three dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations 1 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j 2 u i x i 0 where the coordinates x 1 x x 2 y and x 3 z u i is the fluid velocity in the x i direction t is the time ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure and ν is the kinematic viscosity the navier stokes equations are solved using the open source field operation and manipulation openfoam v1806 c libraries the icofoam solver is adopted in the present study the convection terms are discretized using the second order cell limited gauss linear scheme the pressure terms and laplace terms are discretized using the second order gauss linear scheme the velocity and pressure coupling fields are solved by piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm the second order crank nicholson implicit scheme is adopted for the temporal discretization a uniform flow velocity is imposed on the inlet boundary i e u i u v w u 0 0 where u v and w are the velocities in the x y and z directions respectively three flow velocities are set to be u 0 01 m s 0 03 m s 0 05 m s corresponding to reynolds numbers re 100 300 and 500 respectively the viscosity of the fluid is 1 10 6 m2 s no slip boundary is employed on the surfaces of the two cylinders the velocity is zero a symmetry boundary condition is given to the top boundary i e u z 0 v z 0 w 0 and p z 0 on the outflow boundary the neumann boundary condition is applied for velocity i e u x 0 v x 0 and w x 0 and the pressure is set to zero free slip condition is applied on the two lateral boundaries i e v 0 u y 0 w y 0 p y 0 and bottom boundary i e w 0 u z 0 v z 0 p z 0 the non dimensional computational time step δ t u d 0 01 is adopted to ensure the maximum courant number of 0 55 which is sufficient to ensure the stability and convergence of the numerical simulations 3 mesh dependency study and numerical validation to test the mesh dependency flows past a straight cylinder and single curved cylinder at re 100 and 500 are simulated using three meshes with different densities the non dimensional distance between the first layer mesh node next to the cylinder and the cylinder surface defined as y u f δ ν where u f is the friction velocity and δ is the radial distance between a mesh node and the cylinder surface the radial size of the cell on the cylinder surface is 0 06 and 0 01 for re 100 and 500 respectively table 1 shows the comparison of the numerical results obtained from meshes with different densities where δx min is the minimum mesh size in the streamwise direction the comparisons of the mean drag coefficient c d root mean square lift coefficient c l and strouhal number st obtained from the medium mesh with literature results at re 100 and 500 are presented in table 2 the drag and lift coefficients c d and c l pressure coefficient c p and strouhal numbers st are defined as follows 3 c d 2 f d ρ a u 2 4 c l 2 f l ρ a u 2 5 c p 2 p p ρ u 2 6 s t f s d u where f d and f l are the drag and lift forces on a straight cylinder in the in line and cross flow directions respectively and they are calculated by integrating the pressure and shear stress around the surface of the cylinder c p is the mean pressure coefficient p is the pressure at the inlet boundary a is the projected area of the curved cylinder in the flow direction calculated as a r d 2 l v d f s is the vortex shedding frequency which is obtained by performing the fast fourier transition fft analysis of the lift coefficient fig 2 shows the time histories of the lift and drag coefficients for the vertical extension of the single curved cylinder calculated from the coarse medium and fine meshes at re 100 and 500 it can be seen that both the lift and drag coefficients from the medium and fine meshes agree well with each other at re 100 at re 500 due to the three dimensionality of the flow the fluctuations of the force coefficients behave not regularly periodic the results from the medium mesh are in consistent with those from the fine mesh as shown in table 1 the mean drag coefficient c d and strouhal number st for the straight cylinder from the medium mesh are nearly the same as the values from the fine mesh at re 100 the difference between the root mean square lift coefficients c l of the medium and fine meshes is less than 1 3 for the straight cylinder with the length of h 6d at re 100 the differences in c d and c l between the medium and fine meshes are about are 0 4 and 0 7 between the medium and fine meshes for the vertical extension of the curved cylinder respectively at re 500 for the straight cylinder the percentage changes of c d and st are less than 0 6 and 0 5 between the medium and fine meshes respectively while the variation of c l is approximately 1 7 for both cases the mesh refinement from medium to fine leads to 0 5 decreasing in c d and 1 3 decreasing in c l for the vertical extension of the curved cylinder therefore the medium mesh density is considered to be sufficient to obtain accuracy results for flow past two side by side curved cylinders the c d of the straight cylinder from the medium mesh agree with the results of meneghini et al 2001 and braza et al 1986 for re 100 and the present results of c l and st agree well with the published results it is observed that the c l of the curved cylinder obtained from the mid span of the straight vertical extension are larger than the results of the straight cylinder while the c d agrees well with the results of muddada and patnaik 2010 and burbeau and sagaut 2002 as for re 500 the c d and st of the straight cylinder obtained from the medium mesh are in good agreement with the results of batcho and karniadakis 1991 mittal and balachandar 1995 and thapa et al 2015 the difference of c l between the present simulation and published results is less than 2 2 fig 3 shows the wake topology for flow past a single curved cylinder at re 100 and 500 it can be seen that at re 100 the shed vortex cores are straight in the wake of the vertical straight section and distorted further downstream this section as re increases to 500 the wake flow exhibits three dimensional wake instabilities many small rib shaped streamwise vortical structures are observed and the vortical structures along the span of the curved cylinder become more energetic the present results of wake topologies agree well with those reported in miliou et al 2007 the time averaged flow is obtained by averaging the flow fields from ut d 400 to 700 and the streamlines of time averaged flow are presented in fig 4 it can be seen that the time average streamlines are parallel to the free stream in the downstream of the curved cylinder but distorted near the curved segment due to the effect of the curvature the recirculation zone near the rear stagnation line gradually decreases along the cylinder span which is in good agreement with those in canabes 2010 fig 5 shows the comparisons of the mean pressure coefficient and time averaged flow velocity in the z direction along the span of the convex configuration for flow past a single curved cylinder at re 100 and 500 with the published literature results the time averaged flow velocity in z direction along the span is extracted 0 3d upstream of the front stagnation line of the curved cylinder the variation trend of the absolute values of the base pressure coefficients along the span of the curved cylinder is in good agreement with those of miliou et al 2007 and zhu et al 2018 the discrepancies between the present result of c ps and that of canabes 2010 may be caused by the adoption of different computational domains the non dimensional time averaged flow velocity along the span w u shows firstly an increasing and then decreasing trend with the increase of s d and reaches to the minimum value at s d 10 the variations of the flow velocities with s d are in good agreement with those of miliou et al 2007 and lee et al 2020 to further validate the present numerical method the comparisons of the mean stagnation pressure coefficients on the vertical cylinder surfaces for flow past a straight cylinder between the present numerical study and literature results are performed and the variation of the mean stagnation pressure coefficient c p for a single straight cylinder with reynolds number is plotted in fig 6 it can be seen that the mean stagnation pressure coefficient decreases with the increase of reynolds number the c p for the straight cylinder in the present study is in good agreement with the variation trend of the fitted curve and the literature results batham 1973 canabes 2010 homann 1936 kravchenko and moin 2000 lei et al 2001 norberg 1994 rajani et al 2009 thom 1933 4 numerical results 4 1 instantaneous wake flow patterns the instantaneous vortex flow structures at different spacing ratios 1 25 l d 5 0 and reynolds numbers 100 re 500 at ut d 650 are presented in fig 7 and the top views of these three dimensional vortex tubes at the x y plane are also depicted in fig 8 the non dimensional vortices iso surfaces are identified by the q criterion q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where the ω and s are the anti symmetric and symmetrical parts of the velocity gradient tensor respectively the non dimensional q is defined as q q d 2 u 2 the wake flow pattern behind two curved cylinders varies significantly along the span similar to those for a single curved cylinder gallardo et al 2014a b shang et al 2018 both the spacing ratio and reynolds number have significant effects on the three dimensional wake flow topologies for two curved cylinders at small spacing ratio of l d 1 25 two curved cylinders are in a close proximity regime where only one pair of vortex tubes is formed in the wake and the two cylinders behave as a single bluff body behind the vertical parts of two curved cylinders the shear layers roll up and form a single vortex street with large scale vortex tubes behind two cylinders at re 100 the primary vortex tubes are nearly parallel to the curved axis and the wake width along the curved sections of two cylinders decreases due to the phase difference of vortex shedding along the cylinder span the vortices re 300 and 500 become inclined with the increase of the reynolds number the waviness of the wake flow is observed behind two side by side curved cylinders and the streamwise vortices becomes stronger as l d increases to 1 5 the vortex dislocation is observed at the junction of the vertical and curved sections of two cylinders the dislocation of the primary vortices is caused by the mode a wake which occurs at higher reynolds number for straight cylinders the continuities of the vortex cores are obviously destroyed and the wake flow becomes less coherent along the span although the spanwise vorticities are wavy at high reynolds number they are perpendicular to the incoming direction at re 300 and parallel to the upper part of the curved cylinder at re 500 this is similar to flow past a straight inclined cylinder where the wake vortices are always parallel to the cylinder zhao et al 2013 as l d is increased to 2 the spanwise vortex tubes are twisted at the junction of the vertical and the curved section for re 100 where the spanwise vortices are inclined and weak the scales of the vortex tubes generated from the curved part of the cylinder decrease as re increases to 300 and 500 the wake flow is weakly turbulent the energy is transferred from the spanwise vortices to the streamwise vortices that dissipates quickly the location of the primary vortex moves towards to the surface of curved cylinders and the small vortices are amalgamated to form a cluster of vortical structures near the horizontal extension the vortex tubes behind the vertical extension are parallel to the cylinder the shape of vortex tubes remains parallel to the axis of the cylinder at lower part of the curved section at large spacing ratios of 3 l d 5 symmetric vortex shedding is observed in the wake of the vertical extensions of two curved cylinders for re 100 in figs 7 and 8 two vortex tubes that are shed from the cylinder are parallel to the vertical section of the cylinder indicating the two dimensional flow for the vertical extension at re 100 the two curved cylinders behave more independent at re 100 on the lower sides of two curved cylinders the axial flows are directed towards the vertical extensions vortex shedding is vanished close to the horizontal extensions the wavy primary vortices are parallel to the axis of the vertical segment of two curved cylinders the distortion of the spanwise vortices and the generation of the strong streamwise vortices are observed behind the vertical segment similar to the wake flow of mode b for flow past a vertical cylinder williamson 1988 barkley and henderson 1996 the vortical structure at the curved parts of two cylinders become more enhanced the coherence of the wake caused by the alternating primary vortices disappears the vorticity structures are moved towards to the surfaces of two cylinders leading to the oblique shedding phenomenon in the wake of the curved segments on the other hand the non shedding regime at re 100 and the shear layer instabilities for re 300 and 500 are observed close to the horizontal extension the wake flow behaviors behind two side by side curved cylinders are further investigated by studying the instantaneous non dimensional vorticity contours at different horizontal sections of two curved cylinders with re 100 and 300 shown in fig 9 the non dimensional instantaneous spanwise vorticity ω z is defined as ω z ω z d u where ω z v x u y when l d 1 25 a single vortex street is observed along the vertical parts of the cylinder span of two curved cylinders for re 100 and 300 it is interesting to note that the deflected gap flow is observed at re 300 where a narrow wake and a wide wake are formed behind two curved cylinders the inner vortices developed in the gap flow are squeezed and merged with the shed vortices on the outer sides of the cylinders resulting in a single large scale vortex street formed in the downstream wake the flow feature for l d 1 5 is the same as that for l d 1 25 it is interesting to note that different from those of two side by side straight cylinders the switchover of the gap flow deflection occurs along the curved spans for two curved cylinders at re 100 and 300 the phase differences of vortex shedding along the cylinder span cause the inclination of the spanwise vortices and result into the oblique vortex shedding pattern at low reynolds number re 100 depending on the deflected direction of the gap flow the asymmetrical wake flow pattern with a narrow and a wide wake is observed at the upper part of the vertical extension z d 27 5 17 5 at the lower side close to the horizontal plane z d 12 the shear layers become parallel to the incoming flow direction with the suppression of vortex shedding process as re increases the switchover of the gap flow deflection occurs at z d 17 5 and 12 with the increase of l d to 2 two parallel vortex streets are observed along both the curved and vertical straight spans with the coupling vortices formed behind two cylinders which could be regarded as the dual vortex street regime different from the cases of two straight cylinders a distinct flow feature of the transition from the in phase to the anti phase vortex shedding pattern is observed along the curved spans of two cylinders take the case of re 300 for example at the upper part of vertical extension z d 27 5 the vortex shedding is predominantly in the in phase pattern where the vortices with the same rotational signs are synchronized shed behind two cylinders the shed vortices become weakened due to the interactions of the vortices with opposite signs at the lower part close to the horizontal extension z d 12 the anti phase vortex shedding occurs behind two cylinders where the vortices are shed synchronized in the opposite directions as l d increases to 3 the proximity interference between two cylinders becomes weak and each cylinder behaves like an isolated bluff body two parallel shed vortices in the anti phase and in phase patterns are observed along the curved span the vortices observed at the upper and lower parts are out of phases where two rows of parallel shed vortices are predominantly in the anti phase pattern at z d 22 5 and 27 5 and changes to in phase pattern at the lower side horizontal planes z d 17 5 for re 100 at z d 12 the large inclination suppresses the vortex shedding and the shear layers separated from two cylinders are stretched no regular vortex shedding is observed the three dimensionality of the wake flow behind two side by side curved cylinders are enhanced at re 300 the regular in phase vortex shedding is observed at all the examined horizontal planes for l d 3 the streamwise evolutions of the wake behind the horizontal extensions of two curved cylinders are also illustrated fig 10 shows the non dimensional instantaneous vorticity contours ω x at different vertical y z planes at different spacing ratios 1 25 l d 3 and reynolds numbers re 100 and 300 the non dimensional instantaneous streamwise vorticity ω x is defined as ω x ω x d u where ω x w y v z it is interesting to note that the wake flow patterns are significantly affected by the reynolds numbers and spacing ratios behave different along the spans of horizontal extensions for two curved cylinders at the vertical plane x d 12 close to the vertical segment of two curved cylinders two counter rotating vortices evolve along the axis of each curved cylinder for low reynolds number re 100 the two cylinders behave as a single bluff body at l d 1 25 an alternate vortex shedding is observed at the further downstream location x d 28 as l d increases to 1 5 an asymmetrical wake flow pattern is also observed in the streamwise vorticity contours as l d increases to 3 0 the anti phase vortex shedding mode is observed along the horizontal extension spans of two cylinders with the increase of re the streamwise wake flow exhibits high turbulence and the intense of the vortices increases 4 2 time averaged flow characteristics fig 11 shows the time averaged streamlines at different spanwise locations in the x y planes with different spacing ratios behind two side by side curved cylinders for re 300 the time averaged streamline topologies are obtained by averaging the velocity and pressure over the time period 400 ut d 700 where the gap flow is only biased to one cylinder behind the vertical straight section at 1 25 l d 1 5 at l d 1 25 the gap flow is deflected downwards resulting into an asymmetrical streamline pattern a large scale of recirculation zone is formed behind c1 and a small scale of recirculation zone is formed behind c2 the streamlines in the downstream are distorted due to the proximity interference between two cylinders due to the curvatures of two curved cylinders the variation of the streamwise velocity along the span direction is irregular the scale of the recirculation zone gradually decreases from z d 27 5 to z d 17 5 as l d increases to 2 and 3 the streamline topologies between two curved cylinders become parallel and regular at the horizontal plane z d 12 the recirculation zone disappears at l d 2 and 3 the scale of the reverse flow zone behind each curved cylinder decreases and is approximately symmetrical with the centerline between two cylinders at different spanwise locations the contours of the time averaged reynolds normal stresses u u u 2 v v u 2 and reynolds shear stress u v u 2 at different z d locations for l d 1 25 2 and 3 with re 300 are presented in figs 12 14 where the positive and negative values are represented by solid and dashed lines u and v are the root mean square velocities in the x and y directions respectively with the increase of l d different reynolds stress characteristics are observed along the spans of two curved cylinders at small spacing ratio l d 1 25 the reynolds stress contours exhibit asymmetrical distribution a small reynolds normal stress contour u u u 2 exists behind two cylinders the reynolds stress intensity decreases along the span of curved cylinders in consistent with the variations of vortices strengths the reynolds normal stress contour v v u 2 exhibits a single peak causing by the vortex shedding with the increase of l d to 2 and 3 the reynolds stress distributions at z d 27 5 22 5 and 17 5 for two side by side curved cylinders are similar to that of a single cylinder the reynolds normal stress and reynolds shear stress contours are symmetric and anti symmetric with the centerline between two curved cylinders respectively the amalgamation phenomena of the inner reynolds normal stress contours are observed between two curved cylinders the intensity of the reynolds normal stress u u u 2 reaches to the maximum value at x 1 5d downstream of the cylinder two small lobes are observed in the reynolds shear stress contour u v u 2 in the upstream and two large lobes in the downstream no reynolds shear stress contour is observed close to the rear of cylinder which may be contributed to the little fluctuations of the velocity in the x z plane in the wake dong et al 2006 4 3 axial flow characteristics figs 15 and 16 show the contour plots of the mean streamwise velocity u and vertical velocity w at two x z slices i e y d 10 and y d 10 l d for different spacing ratios l d 1 25 2 3 and re 300 the curvature has a significant effect on the flow velocity distributions along the span of two side by side cylinders a recirculation zone is observed in front of the vertical and curved segments for two cylinders where the values of u and w are negative the flow direction shifts counterclockwise in the horizontal extension along the curved span the vertical component gradually increases and finally aligns with the incoming flow velocity the scale of recirculation zone decreases with increasing of l d the length of the reverse flow zone in the streamwise direction is significantly reduced the mean streamwise velocities gradually decrease as approaching to the surface of the curved cylinders the distribution of the spanwise velocity near the curved section of two cylinders exhibits a similar trend to that of a single curved cylinder the spanwise velocity is negative at both the front and rear of the curved segment and positive at the rear of the vertical extension with the increase of l d the scale of the recirculation zone decreases where the spanwise velocity is negative the reverse flow is suppressed at the location close to the horizontal extension the contours of w depict an upwards and downwards flow in upper and lower part of two curved cylinders respectively with the increase of the depth the three dimensionality of the flow can be illustrated by the profiles of mean vertical velocity w at z d 27 5 and 22 5 the profile exhibits an upwelling flow from the axial curvature of two curved cylinders propagating upwards along the vertical extension the vertical velocity close to the horizontal extension reaches to 0 2u further downstream the profiles of w at z d 17 5 and 12 exhibit a downdraft flow where the downdraft vertical velocity increases with depth and reaches almost 20 of the free stream velocity u at the curved parts of two cylinders fig 17 plots the time averaged axial velocity u a x distribution along a line behind each cylinder surface at different spacing ratios and reynolds numbers the line is defined as a curve parallel to the curved cylinder with offset of 1 1d as shown in fig 17 c following jiang et al 2018 2019 the axial velocity u a x used in the present study is defined as the local tangential velocity along the curved cylinder and calculated based on the streamwise velocity u and vertical velocity w u a x u sin φ w cos φ when the u a x increases the predominant vortex shedding pattern will change from the normal vortex shedding mode to the oblique vortex shedding mode at re 100 the vortex tube behind the vertical extension is perpendicular to the incoming flow the axis flow velocity is close to zero due to the oblique vortex shedding phenomenon the fluctuations of the axis flow velocities along the vertical section increase with reynolds number at the curved section the axial flow velocity increases with the inclined angle φ and approaches to the maximum value at the junction of the curved and horizontal sections of two cylinders for each spacing ratio except for the cases of l d 1 25 and 1 5 the axial velocity of the curved section for each cylinder at re 300 and 500 is much larger than that at re 100 where the existence of the high streamwise vorticity strength causes the increase of the axial velocity at re 300 and 500 the axial flow velocity is remained to be zero at l d 1 25 and 1 5 along the curved spans of two cylinders at the horizontal extensions of two curved cylinders the axial flow velocity reaches a maximum of 67 of the free stream velocity at small spacing ratio l d 1 25 it is interesting to note that at low reynolds number re 100 the axial flow velocity is almost zero at l d 1 5 as re increases to 300 and 500 the axial flow velocity increases with l d and reaches to a maximum of 88 of the free stream velocity at l d 5 along the horizontal extensions of two cylinders the axial flow velocity decreases to about 10 and 7 of the free stream velocity for each cylinder at l d 1 25 respectively 4 4 mean pressure coefficients the variations of the mean pressure coefficients on the surfaces of two side by side curved cylinders at different horizontal planes z d 27 5 17 5 and 12 for re 300 are presented in fig 18 in general the distributions of the mean pressure coefficient c p for both two curved cylinders are almost symmetrical about θ 180 i e the base point on the cylinder surfaces at different z d similar to those for flow past straight cylinders lam et al 2008 however it is interesting to note that the distributions of mean pressure coefficients for c1 and c2 at z d 12 are significantly different from those at z d 17 5 and 27 5 where the fluctuation amplitude of c p is significantly reduced from 1 0 to 0 5 along the span the vortex shedding is suppressed at z d 12 for the curved ellipse cross section the inclination angle of the curved cylinder increases when close to the horizontal extension leading to the decreasing of normal velocity component similar variation trend of the pressure coefficient with spanwise depth is observed for a single curved cylinder gallardo et al 2014a b with the increase of the inclination angle the surface pressure coefficient decreases the separation points are found to be more sensitive to the variation of the spacing ratios the positions of separation points are located about θ 80 for 3 l d 5 at different reynolds numbers similar to that of a single cylinder however the separation point for c2 is located at θ 100 for l d 1 25 and 1 5 fig 19 depicts the variations of the base pressure coefficient c p b and stagnation pressure coefficient c p s along the stagnation lines from the vertical extension to the junction of curved segment and horizontal extension at different spacing ratios for re 100 300 and 500 respectively the base pressure coefficient c p b and stagnation pressure coefficient c p s are defined as the pressure coefficient at the base line and the front stagnation line tong et al 2015 the fluctuation of pressure causes the emergence of spanwise flow resulting into the oblique vortex shedding hammache and gharib 1991 the stagnation pressure coefficient does not vary with z d at the same spacing ratio in the vertical extension indicating that the upstream flow conditions are irresponsible to the oblique vortex shedding in the wake due to the spanwise velocity reduce along the span the absolute values of c p b and c p s decrease monotonically with increasing of s d and approach to zero at the junction of the curved segment and the horizontal extension in consistent with those of a single curved cylinder observed by miliou et al 2007 and canabes 2010 the base pressure coefficient is sensitive to the variation of flow instability and reynolds number since the change of base pressure coefficient becomes more irregular with the increase of reynolds number in agreement with the results for a straight cylinder obtained by williamson 1996 the values of stagnation of pressure coefficients increase with l d for each curved cylinder however the absolute value of base pressure at l d 4 is larger than that of a single cylinder 4 5 strouhal number the non dimensional vortex shedding frequency strouhal number s t f s d u is obtained by fast fourier transform fft analysis of the transverse flow velocity which is extracted from a distance of 5d behind the axis of curved cylinder at different spanwise locations fig 20 shows the power spectra of the transverse flow velocity at different spacing ratios for re 300 at small spacing ratios 1 25 l d 2 multiple harmonic peaks are observed in the power spectra for two cylinders with increasing of l d two prominent peaks are observed at different spanwise locations and the spectral amplitude decreases along the spanwise of the curved cylinders which is similar with the literature results of flow past the inclined cylinder and curved cylinder zhao et al 2009 gallardo et al 2014a b fig 21 shows the variation of the strouhal number with spacing ratio for both two side by side curved cylinders which is determined based on the vortex shedding frequency corresponding to the primary peak the strouhal number for each cylinder increases with l d and approaches to that of a single cylinder at large spacing ratios l d 4 and 5 in general the strouhal number at the vertical extension z d 27 5 is significantly larger than that at z d 12 at l d 3 the discrepancies of the strouhal numbers along the span decrease the interaction between two cylinders is reduced at large spacing ratios l d 4 and 5 the strouhal number is almost identical to that of a single curved cylinder 5 conclusions a series of three dimensional numerical simulations are performed to investigate flow past two side by side curved cylinders the effects of the reynolds number and spacing ratio on the wake topologies time average flow fields and mean pressure coefficient distributions are studied the results are summarized as follows 1 the wake behind the vertical straight sections of the two side by side cylinders are classified into four flow regimes a single bluff body pattern biased flow pattern coupling vortex shedding pattern and co shedding pattern as re increases the critical spacing ratio for different flow regimes decreases the flows along the curved sections of two cylinders are classified into five flow regimes normal vortex shedding vortex dislocation oblique vortex shedding non shedding and shear layer instability regimes 2 the reverse flow is found to be significantly suppressed at the spanwise location close to the horizontal extension due to the effect of axial flow velocity with the increase of l d the axial flow velocity increases and the streamline pattern behind two cylinders behaves from the asymmetrical to symmetrical distribution 3 the reynolds stress the vortex strengths and the mean pressure coefficients behind two curved cylinders are significantly reduced along the curved section the absolute value of base pressure coefficient decreases with the increase of l d as the reynolds number increases the base coefficients of two curved cylinders increase data
