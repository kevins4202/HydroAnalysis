11595,an interval linear multi objective programming ilmp model for irrigation water allocation was developed considering conflicting objectives and uncertainties based on the generation of interval numbers through statistical simulation the ilmp model was solved using a fuzzy programming method the model balances contradictions among economic net benefit crop yield and water saving in irrigation systems incorporating uncertainties in both objective functions and constraints that are based on the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater the model was applied to hulan river irrigation district northeast china tradeoffs between various crops in different subareas under different frequencies were analyzed and scenarios with different objectives were considered to evaluate the changing trend of irrigation water allocation results indicated that the ilmp model provided effective linkages between revenue output promotion and water saving and offers insights into tradeoffs for irrigation water management under uncertainty keywords irrigation water allocation multi objective programming interval number bootstrap scenario analysis 1 introduction these days water crisis is occurring too frequently and at too many places underscoring the importance of sustainable and efficient water resources management among all the water users agriculture is the dominant user and irrigated agriculture consumes more than 70 of available water resources in the world galán martín et al 2017 due to rapid socio economic development and continuing population growth future irrigated agriculture will face challenges to meet the growing food demand while the water available for agriculture will simultaneously be decreasing wang et al 2017 therefore optimal allocation of water availability for agricultural irrigation in an efficient manner is a critical issue for agricultural water management optimal allocation of agricultural irrigation water can be determined using optimization techniques a number of optimization techniques such as linear programming dynamic programming nonlinear programming and stochastic programming have been employed to drive optimal irrigation patterns subject to the maximization or minimization of certain objectives singh 2012 among these optimization techniques linear programming for irrigation water allocation has been most popular das et al 2015 however irrigation water allocation systems depend on various independent aspects such as economic social and natural that often conflict with each other and are therefore too complex for linear programming such a water allocation problem can be handled by multi objective programming mop that is capable of incorporating multiple conflicting objectives functions such as maximizing net return crop yield versus reducing water consumption some investigators have used mop for allocating irrigation water with a different emphasis for example su et al 2014 developed a multi objective optimal allocation model for agricultural water resources considering three objectives of the maximum net benefit from agriculture the minimum fairness difference in the utilization of water and the maximum proportion of green water utilization galán martín et al 2017 formulated a multi objective linear programming model that simultaneously accounts for the maximization of crop production and the minimization of environmental impact caused by water consumption however optimal allocation of irrigation water in real world is complicated by various uncertainties that arise in the interactions among many system components examples include temporal and spatial variations of hydrological elements fluctuations of economic parameters and errors in estimating other related parameters therefore it is essential to optimize irrigation water allocation in the framework of mop considering uncertainties in order to better represent the complexity of irrigation systems generally the widely used uncertainty methods are stochastic mathematical programming smp fuzzy mathematical programming fmp and interval mathematical programming imp smp is an optimization model wherein parameters in the objective functions or constraints can be represented by probability distributions fmp addresses vagueness in decision maker aspirations or preference and ambiguity in knowledge or information in an optimization model imp deals with uncertainties that are approximated by only the lower and upper boundaries these uncertainty methods can handle different types of uncertainties but some deficiencies also exist for example although smp is capable for adequately tackling uncertainties but the high computations data requirement for specifying probability distributions may affect its practical application for the fmp there exists subjectivity in the membership function determination and results generation recently some investigators focused on fuzzy uncertainties in the mop model for irrigation water allocation regulwar and gurav 2011 mirajkar and patel 2013 li and guo 2014 morankar et al 2016 li et al 2016a b in practice specification of fuzzy sets or probability distributions is more difficult than obtaining interval numbers especially in the absence of data for an irrigation system many basic data are obtained by field experiments and monitoring resulting in the time series of these primary data are fairly short therefore considering the availability of data and computational efficiency the use of interval numbers is particularly appealing for an irrigation system compared with smp and fmp although the imp may encounter difficulties in tackling higher uncertain parameters thus far few investigations have considered interval uncertainties in mop for irrigation water allocation because of the capability to consider uncertainties with known lower and upper bounds in both objective functions and constraints imp has been successfully integrated in several single objective programming models for irrigation water allocation lu et al 2011 li et al 2014 guo et al 2014 yang et al 2015 2016 however few studies provide details on methods for acquisition of interval numbers in the optimization of irrigation water allocation hydrological elements such as runoff precipitation and evapotranspiration directly affect optimal irrigation water allocation these elements spatially and temporally change and can essentially be regarded as random parameters considerable differences occur in the quantities of these hydrological elements for different frequencies determining the fluctuation values of these elements for each frequency in advance can not only benefit irrigation optimization but also help ameliorate natural disasters such as flooding and drought therefore generation of interval numbers of hydrological elements for different frequencies that are incorporated in the mop optimization model can be valuable not only for avoiding sophisticated calculations but also for precision irrigation the primary objective of this study therefore is to develop an interval linear multi objective programming ilmp model for optimal irrigation water allocation under uncertainty the model incorporates the optimization technique of interval parameters into linear multi objective programming to handle uncertainties of irrigation systems and achieves a balance among net revenue output and water saving by optimally allocating available water the study entails several elements first interval numbers for social economic data and hydrological elements for different frequencies are generated second the ilmp model is developed for irrigation water allocation based on the generation of interval parameters third results are analyzed for different hydrological frequencies fourth a scenarios analysis is done as a complementary method to develop more decision making plans under different policy conditions and the model is tested by applying to a real world study in northeast china 2 methodology this section develops an interval linear multi objective programming ilmp framework with emphasis on the 1 generation of interval parameters using bootstrap method 2 development of the ilmp model based on the generation of interval parameters 3 solution of the ilmp model based on fuzzy programming fp method and 4 development of a framework for multi objective programming under uncertainty each of these elements is now discussed 2 1 bootstrap method the bootstrap method is a resampling technique this method only needs resampling from the original sample series without making assumptions for the overall distribution then continually estimates parameter values of the drawn samples and finally deduces the parameter characteristics of the unknown overall samples and quantitatively describes the uncertainty of parameter estimation thus it is an effective way to estimate and generate interval numbers based on long term data assuming x x 1 x 2 x n is an original sample and θ is the unknown parameter of the overall distribution from the lowest value to the highest value the original sample can be written as x 1 x 2 x n the empirical distribution fn for the sample can be described as follows hu et al 2015 1 f n 0 x x 1 k n x k x x k 1 k 1 2 n 1 1 x x n by resampling from the distribution f n the same size sample x x 1 x 2 x n can be obtained based on the bootstrap sample x the estimation θ of parameter θ of the distribution function can be calculated by a proper parameter estimation method repeating the bootstrap sampling n times the n groups of bootstrap samples can be obtained and can be described as x j x 1 j x 2 j x n j j 1 2 n then n parameter estimates θ j j 1 2 n of parameter θ can be derived taking θ j j 1 2 n as the sample of the unknown parameter θ the distribution of parameter θ can thus be obtained based on this distribution interval estimation of the values under each frequency can be derived based on the confidence intervals under predetermined confidence levels 2 2 interval linear multi objective programming 2 2 1 property of the interval numbers before formulating the ilmp model it is appropriate to first discuss the properties of interval numbers property 1 let a denote a closed and bounded set of real numbers and a define an interval number with known upper and lower bounds of a then a can be expressed as a a a a z a a 0 z 1 with a and a representing the lower and upper bounds of interval number a respectively and z representing an auxiliary variable that can be used to transform the interval parameter into a determination one property 2 for a the following relationships hold 1 a 0 if a 0 and a 0 and 2 a 0 if a 0 and a 0 further for a and b the other relations are as follows 1 a b if a b and a b and 2 a b if a b and a b property 3 let be a binary operation on interval numbers for a and b we have a b min a b max a b a a a b b b in the case of division it is assumed that b does not contain a zero hence we have a b a b a b a b a b a b a b min a b max a b a a a b b b a b min a b max a b a a a b b b 2 2 2 model development the ilmp model can be formulated as follows 2a min f k x c k x k 1 2 p subject to 2b a x b 2c x 0 where f k x k 1 2 p is the linear objective function x x 1 x 2 x n t is the independent variable vector c k c k 1 c k 2 c k n k 1 2 p is the coefficient of the objective function a a 1 j a 2 j a m j t j 1 2 n is the coefficient matrix of the constraints and b b 1 b 2 b m t is the vector on the right hand of constraints 2 2 3 solution method the solution for the ilmp model is based on the fp method the essence of which is the membership function the membership function for a vector minimum problem can usually be written as 3 μ f k x 1 f k x f k min f k m a x f k x f k m a x f k m i n f k min f k x f k max 1 k p 0 f k x f k max where μ f k x is the membership function of the kth objective function f k min and f k max are the lower and upper bounds of f k x respectively and it is assumed that f k min is not equal to f k max the models for calculating f k min and f k max share the same constraints with different objective functions and are described as follows objective function for calculating f k min 4a min f k x j 1 n c k j z k j c k j c k j x j objective for calculating f k max 4b max f k x j 1 n c k j z k j c k j c k j x j both 4a and 4b are subject to 4c j 1 n a i j s i j a i j a i j x j b t i b b 4d x j 0 4e z k j s i j t i 0 1 where i 1 2 m j 1 2 n k 1 2 p and they are adapted for all the models in this section zkj sij ti are auxiliary variables to transform the interval numbers of c k j a i j and b i into the corresponding deterministic expressions combined with the max min operator bellmanr and zaden 1970 the ilmp model can be transformed into the following two forms corresponding to the linear and non linear membership functions respectively hulsurkar et al 1997 a equivalence model for linear membership function 5a max λ subject to 5b μ f k x λ 5c j 1 n a i j s i j a i j a i j x j b t i b b 5d x j 0 5e λ s i j t i 0 1 where λ refers to the overall satisfactory degree b equivalence model for non linear membership function 6a max k 1 p λ k 6b μ f k x λ k 6c j 1 n a i j s i j a i j a i j x j b t i b b 6d x j 0 6e λ k s i j t i 0 1 where λk refers to the satisfactory degree of the kth objective function from the equivalence model for non linear membership function the importance of each objective can be quantitatively expressed by endowing with weights thus the objective function of 6a can be described as max k 1 p λ k ω k based on the weighted geometric method where ωk refers to the weight of the kth objective function guo et al 2015 models 5 and 6 are single objective programming models and the best worst models are available to obtain the interval solutions of the ilmp model for linear membership function the best and worst models are expressed as follows best model 7a max λ 7b j 1 n c k j x j λ f k max f k min f k max 7c j 1 n a i j x j b i 7d x j 0 7e 0 λ 1 worst model 8a max λ 8b j 1 n c k j x j λ f k max f k min f k max 8c j 1 n a i j x j b i 8d x j 0 8e 0 λ 1 for nonlinear membership function the best and worst models are expressed as follows best model 9a max k 1 p λ k ω k 9b j 1 n c k j x j λ k f k max f k min f k max 9c j 1 n a i j x j b i 9d x j 0 9e 0 λ k 1 worst model 10a max k 1 p λ k ω k 10b j 1 n c k j x j λ k f k max f k min f k max 10c j 1 n a i j x j b i 10d x j 0 10e 0 λ k 1 models 7 10 are the ultimate solution models for the generation of interval results of the ilmp model 2 2 4 framework for multi objective programming under uncertainty the framework for multi objective programming under uncertainty contains mainly two parts the first part focuses on the generation of interval parameters in which the bootstrap method is introduced for water resources management the bootstrap method is capable of generating interval numbers for hydrological elements such as runoff precipitation and evapotranspiration under different frequencies based on long terms data however there are still short term data for some parameters associated with economy and society such as market price crop planting area grain production efficiency for such parameters with short term data a ci which is derived by ordering all potential values and later identifying the upper and lower thresholds that act as good estimates of unknown data sets shen et al 2011 and a probable error range for which each simulated or measured data point is determined with an error range chen et al 2014 are effective ways for the generation of interval numbers based on the solution of the first part the second part based on the ilmp model will be undertaken the interval numbers generated in the first part was regarded as the inputs of the ilmp model in the second part and this is the connection of the two parts the basic properties of interval numbers the model establishment and the solution method have been discussed and the flow chart of the developed framework is shown in fig 1 3 application 3 1 area description hulan river irrigation district is located in qing an county suihua city the middle of heilongjiang province in northeast china it ranges from 125 55 to 128 43 e and 45 52 to 48 03 n with a total area of 1 89 105 ha among which the actual irrigation area is 2 03 104 ha the irrigation district is in temperate semi arid and semi humid continental monsoon climate with characteristics of seasonal weather annual average precipitation evaporation temperature and frost free days are 545mm 665mm 1 7 c and 128 d respectively hulan river irrigation district faces water shortage problems only surface water cannot satisfy the water demand leading to the necessity of the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater the district is divided by hulan river into two sub districts where the southern part includes heping jianye and liuhe areas while the northern part includes lanhe fengtian and laomo areas heping area contains three headworks lishantun which brings water from hulan river anbanghe which brings water from anbang river and zhengwenju which brings water from lalinqing river jianye area has one headwork bringing water from lalinqing river liuhe area brings water from liuhe reservoir the headworks of lanhe district and laomo district are respectively fucheng and begai and they both bring water from ougen river the fengtian area contains two headworks among which fengtian headwork brings water from yijimi river and wanghai headwork brings water from hulan river anbang river lalinqing river yijimi river and ougen river are all branches of hulan river the location of these partitions can be seen in fig 2 food crops including rice maize and soybean occupy most of the planting area of hulan river irrigation district among which rice is the main crop to plant because of higher net benefits most water consumption in hulan river irrigation district is for agricultural irrigation therefore optimally allocating available water resources for food crops is significant for the commend area because of natural and artificial factors the elements that affect agricultural irrigation water allocation present uncertainties especially hydrological elements such as runoff precipitation and crop evapotranspiration in this study many rivers are involved and they present different values under different flow levels these provoke managers to ask as to 1 how to consider the uncertainties of both hydrological elements and non hydrological elements 2 for hydrological elements how to quantitatively express the uncertainties for different frequencies of different water supplies and 3 how to generate desired water allocation both surface water and groundwater schemes to achieve the goal of yield and or benefit promotion and blue water saving based on the above considerations a multi objective programming model with interval parameters can be developed the optimal results of which will provide a certain guide in the development of water saving and efficient agriculture 3 2 model development this part develops the ilmp model for optimally allocating available irrigation water for different food crops in different subareas of hulan river irrigation district for different frequencies of different water supplies the model consists of three linear objective functions and a set of constraints 3 2 1 objective functions 1 economic objective function with consideration of crop planting cost and water use cost the target for economic objective function is to maximize the net return from different crops grown 11a max f e i 1 i j 1 j m p i j y a i j

renewable blue water including streamflow and shallow groundwater is the target of water saving objective function this is because that irrigated agriculture uses both green water and blue water and both of them are important for food production besides its contribution to crop production blue water can also be directly used by socio economic sectors while green water cannot therefore green water should be well utilized and thus the blue water can be saved to increase irrigation efficiency in the premise of ensuring the minimum water demand of crops therefore in this study the blue water including both water from rivers and groundwater should be minimized 11c min f w i 1 i j 1 j s w i j g w i j where fe is the objective function for economic benefit 104yuan and yuan is the monetary

collection and processing the data for the ilmp model can be divided into four parts in this study they are hydrological parameters social economic parameters other parameters and weight scenario for each objective function rice maize and soybean are the studied crops and their growth periods are from may to september 3 3 1 hydrological parameters hydrological parameters contain runoff of each related river effective precipitation evapotranspiration of each crop and groundwater availability these hydrological parameters are essentially random and the values of most of them have significant variations for different frequencies accordingly it is necessary to estimate the interval values for different frequencies for these hydrological elements to reflect the randomness hydrological parameters usually have longer data series more than 30 years relative to non hydrological parameters thus the interval number generation of these hydrological elements can be obtained using the bootstrap method the time series for all these hydrological parameters are 55 years and they were collected from hydrological stations and meteorological network for runoff the bootstrap method was directly applied to generate interval numbers based on the time series data of each river in this study the interval numbers of runoff of hulan river q h l anbang river q a b lalinqing river q l l q yijimi river q y j m and ougen river q o g were all generated by bootstrap method first the empirical distribution was calculated and based on which a certain theoretical frequency curve was determined by comparing the fit with the empirical frequency curve then using monte carlo method resampling from the original sample was done 1000 times and parameters were estimated for each new sample that yielded 1000 groups of parameter estimates thereafter the probability distribution of a certain frequency was obtained finally the distribution of each frequency was obtained and the corresponding interval numbers were generated in this study the frequencies were chosen 25 50 75 and 95 corresponding to the wet condition normal condition dry condition and extreme dry condition respectively according to the dividing standard of wet and dry conditions of china and the planning and design report of hulan river irrigation district the effective precipitation was calculated by multiplying precipitation by an effective coefficient according to kang and cai 1996 if precipitation was less than 50mm then the coefficient was 0 9 if precipitation was greater than 50mm but less than 150mm then the coefficient was 0 75 and if precipitation was greater than 150 the coefficient was 0 7 in this manner the effective precipitation was obtained and the corresponding interval numbers for the selected frequencies were obtained with the same way as runoff for crop evapotranspiration etc the fao56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 was used to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration et 0 the fao56 penman monteith method was adopted because it was regarded as the basic method for calculating reference et 0 by food and agriculture organization of united nations in 1998 and it has strong theoretical property and computational accuracy the fao56 penman monteith method was widely used throughout the world and climate factors including average temperature lowest temperature highest temperature average wind speed sunshine duration average relative humidity were the basic input data for the method monthly and annual values of et 0 were obtained by summing daily values in this study the coefficient of variation cv of et 0 was only 0 06 much less than the cv values of the five rivers cv 0 53 for hulan river cv 0 57 for anbang river cv 0 77 for lalinqing river cv 0 50 for yijimin river and cv 0 55 for ougen river indicating yearly et 0 changed little the yearly trend can also be seen from fig 3 which suggests that it makes little sense to estimate the interval numbers of et 0 under each frequency which will otherwise add to the complexity of the optimization solution the stochastic simulation method li et al 2016a b was employed to estimate the interval number of et 0 based on the known probability distribution function the difference between bootstrap method and stochastic simulation method for the generation of interval number of hydrological elements is that the former is capable of conveniently generating interval numbers under different frequencies without the assumption of the overall distribution compared with the results of generation using bootstrap method the interval number of et 0 was expressed by only one value while the interval numbers of runoff of each river and precipitation were expressed by four values corresponding to the frequencies of 25 50 75 and 95 based on et 0 the etc was obtained using the formula etc kcet 0 pereira et al 2015 where kc is the crop coefficient which changes with growth periods of each crop the kc value for each crop of each month is listed in table 1 in this study the value of water requirement equaled the value of etc for each crop the calculated annual variations of et 0 and effective precipitation are shown in fig 3 and their monthly variation in fig 4 because of the lack of observation data availability of groundwater was expressed as the average value according to the planning report groundwater available for different subareas and the corresponding irrigation proportions are given in table 2 fengtian area is not designed for well irrigation the product of available groundwater and the irrigation proportion of groundwater is the value that was adopted for optimization in this study 3 3 2 socio economic parameters socio economic parameters in this study included market price planting area yield per unit area maximum irrigation amount planting cost water use productivity and water utilization cost these parameters were obtained mainly from yearbook report website field survey and previous studies the time series of these socio economic parameters were shorter than hydrological parameters less than 10 years so the bootstrap method was not suitable for the generation of interval numbers for these parameters for market price the maximum and minimum values during the whole growth period of each crop were collected from agricultural product price net crop planting area data and yield per unit area were obtained from planning report and yearbook 2010 2015 and the corresponding interval numbers were calculated from the method of μ x where μ is the mean and x is the deviation then interval numbers of yield per unit area were obtained by dividing the yield of each crop of each irrigation area by the interval planting area the maximum irrigation amount was the upper threshold in the right hand of the irrigation constraint indicating that the optimal water allocation amount for different regions cannot exceed the maximum irrigation amount in this study the maximum irrigation amount was obtained by multiplying the irrigation quota under higher design dependability with the interval planting area as the planting area was expressed as interval numbers leading to that the maximum irrigation amount was expressed as interval numbers as well water use productivities for the three crops were obtained from data analysis of field experiments planting cost and water utilization cost were obtained from previous works li and zhang 2016 fu et al 2016 tables 1 3 provide detailed information 3 3 3 other parameters other parameters mainly included irrigation proportion of groundwater irrigation proportions for each irrigation area from the corresponding rivers canal and field water utilization coefficient and hydraulic parameters all these parameters were deterministic in this study that came from planning and design report of hulan river irrigation district detailed information can be seen in table 2 the values of php 1 php 2 php 3 pjy plhr pft 1 pft plh were 0 84 9 8 18 1 7 5 11 1 0 84 4 1 6 8 3 4 respectively the values of canal and field irrigation utilization coefficients were 0 5 and 0 8 respectively for each area the coefficients for conveyance loss of surface water field water application loss rainfall infiltration were respectively 0 49 0 10 0 08 3 3 4 weight scenarios for objective functions the weighting coefficient method was used in the solution of the ilmp model when the membership function was non linear as a typical meta synthesis engineering method from quality analysis to quantity analysis analytical hierarchy process ahp has been widely used in the field of water resources management srdjevic and medeiros 2008 therefore in this study the weights of importance for the three objectives of the developed ilmp model were determined by the ahp method four scenarios were set scenario 1 referred to the equal importance of the three objectives scenario 2 referred to the case where the objective of economic benefit was paramount scenario 3 referred to the case where the objective of yield increase was paramount and scenario 4 referred to the case where the objective of water saving was paramount results of weights determined from the ahp method are shown in table 4 4 analysis of results and discussion 4 1 generation of interval numbers for hydrological parameters the interval numbers of hydrological parameters were obtained using the bootstrap method through hydrological curve fitting the probability distribution of each hydrological parameter was determined and parameters were estimated the pearson type iii distribution was fitted to the values of runoff of hulan river lalinqing river and yijimi river and of precipitation and the distribution parameters were estimated using the method of moments the runoff of anbang river followed a 2 parameter gamma distribution and the runoff of ougen river followed a generalized extreme value distribution the parameters of these hydrological parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method the runoff of lalinqing river which supplied water for most areas including heping area jianye area and liuhe area was used as an example to demonstrate the generation of interval numbers by the bootstrap method the probability distribution and the mann kendall m k test hamed and rao 1998 of the runoff of lalinqing river are shown in fig 5 the m k test showed a low temporal variability of the runoff time series of lalinqin river indicating that the sample could be considered continuous fig 6 presents the frequency histogram and the normal probability plot of the runoff values of lalinqing river under the frequencies of 25 50 75 and 95 the figure shows that the normal distribution function fitted the frequency histogram well under each frequency the scatters were evenly distributed around the 45 line which showed the distribution of runoff values of lalinqing river under each frequency wa approximately a normal distribution therefore using the normal distribution the interval number of each frequency was obtained for the 95 confidence interval similarly the interval numbers of other hydrological parameters are listed in table 5 the pearson type iii distribution was fitted to the et 0 values and the acceptance rejection method gu et al 2008 was used for the stochastic simulation to generate interval numbers with the 95 confidence interval the results of generation of these interval numbers were then input in the ilmp model 4 2 agricultural irrigation water allocation the ilmp model was then solved based on interval inputs a series of water allocation results for different crops in different areas under different frequencies membership functions and weight scenarios were obtained 4 2 1 results of linear membership function for linear membership function the results of total irrigation amount expressed as intervals of different areas under different frequencies are shown in fig 7 the figure shows that the amount of water allocated to heping area was the highest then was laomo area and the last one was jianye area it can also be seen from the figure that the total water allocation amount under different frequencies changed distinctly from 1 01 1 60 108 m3 under the frequency of 25 to 0 98 1 33 108 m3 under the frequency of 95 indicating the importance to prepare alternative water allocation plans to deal with the unknown water supply for the efficient use of limited water resources in fact when solving for the worst case of the ilmp model under the frequency of 95 which corresponded to the condition of extreme dry there was no feasible solution because both surface water and groundwater supplies were not able to meet crops highest irrigation demand in such a case one way was to transfer 2791 104 m3 from areas with relative abundant water supply or pumping of more groundwater within the allowable range which would increase the accompanying cost and the impact on groundwater the other way was to decrease irrigation requirement which would reduce production and would affect benefit this is worth a further study for seeking a satisfactory water allocation solution under extreme conditions on the other hand groundwater allocation under the frequency of 25 was the least because the optimization model tended to prefer allocating surface water this was attributed to two reasons one was that the cost of groundwater was higher than that of surface water and the other was that the surplus of groundwater was considered for transfer to other water use sectors for example industry to avoid wasting extra water for irrigation and meanwhile increasing profit comparison among water utilization water requirement wr intervals and maximum irrigation for each area under different frequencies is shown in fig 8 among which the total water allocation contained both the net water allocation amount and effective precipitation the net water allocation amount equaled the gross water allocation amount optimal results multiplied by the water use coefficients for canal and field the figure shows that under all frequencies the total water allocation was in the interval of maximum and minimum water requirement for frequency of 25 the total water allocation amounts of heping area jianye area liuhe area and fengtian area even exceeded their maximum water requirements and nearly reached their maximum irrigation thresholds indicating that water supply was abundant under the frequency of 25 however for the 95 frequency the total water allocation could only satisfy the minimum water requirement for most areas except for fengtian area for the 50 and 75 frequencies the total water allocation in most of the areas was in the intervals of minimum water requirement and maximum irrigation threshold the water allocation for smaller areas such jianye liuhe and fentian was reaching the maximum irrigation threshold in order to obtain the optimized comprehensive benefit taking the 50 frequency which represented the normal condition as an example the water allocation for each crop in each area is shown in fig 9 the total water allocation amount for rice wa larger than that for maize and soybean because of the relative higher market price and water production efficiency the total average water allocation for rice maize and soybean was 5798 104m3 2518 104m3 and 4174 104m3 respectively since maize is a water consuming crop with lower benefit it is inadvisable to plant it in large quantities especially in heping irrigation area 4 2 2 results of non linear membership function for nonlinear membership function of the ilmp model the objective weight scenarios were taken into account different scenarios indicated different weights of importance for different objectives and information on the weights is given in table 4 taking the 50 frequency as an example fig 10 shows different values of the three objectives under different scenarios in fig 10 of1 means the first objective i e the maximum net benefit 104yuan of2 means the second objective i e the maximum crop yield 104kg and of3 means the third objective i e the minimum blue water use 104m3 in this figure both the upper bound and the lower bound of the values of objectives were in the range of maximum and minimum objectives for each scenario the first and third objectives were always given a priority with the upper bounds nearly achieving the corresponding maximum values scenario 1 yielded optimal results with equal importance of the three objectives scenario 2 focused more on the system net benefit scenario 3 focused more on crop yield and scenario 4 focused more on water saving for scenario 2 and scenario 4 the changing trends of upper and lower bounds of all the three objectives were the same this was attributed to the same properties of objective 1 and objective 3 whose aim was to decrease the water utilization cost and achieve water saving specifically the net benefit was 31348 38524 104 yuan with 430 104 yuan lower than the maximum net benefit and the lower bound of which was equal to the minimum net benefit the crop yield was 17772 20630 104 kg with 5691 104 kg lower than the maximum net benefit and 3309 104 kg higher than the minimum net benefit the water allocation was 12435 14763 104 m3 with 7458 104 m3 higher than the minimum water allocation and the upper bound of which was equal to the maximum water allocation amount the changing trend of the three objectives for scenario 3 which emphasized allocating more water to get more yield was contrary to that of scenario 2 and scenario 4 the crop yield of scenario 3 was 167 104 kg higher than that of scenario 2 and scenario 4 for scenario 1 as the importance of all the three objectives was equal the values of net benefit crop yield and water allocation were in the range of that of scenarios 2 4 for the area that water was insufficient the water use productivity was an important index to reflect the water use efficiency and it was expressed as the yield per unit water use calculating it the water use productivity under the four scenarios was 1 34 1 50 kg m3 1 40 1 74 kg m3 1 34 1 71 kg m3 1 40 1 74 kg m3 respectively it was clear that water use productivities of scenario 2 and 4 were higher than those under other scenarios attributing to the smaller water allocation amount under those two scenarios the objective of transformations of the original ilmp model was to maximize the degree of overall satisfaction fig 11 shows the satisfaction degrees under different frequencies and different scenarios it can be seen from the figure that the satisfaction degrees vary as the frequencies and scenarios change the changing trends of different frequencies under the four scenarios were nearly the same with different changing amplitudes the lower bounds of satisfaction degrees were in the vicinity of 0 3 while the upper bounds of satisfaction degrees were in the vicinity of 0 8 in addition for the area that water was insufficient decision makers usually paid more attention to water allocation schemes with higher frequency to reduce the water shortage risk because of the randomness of water supply thus taking the 75 frequency as an example whose frequency was higher but not the extreme condition the irrigation water allocation amount of both surface water and groundwater for each crop under different scenarios are shown in fig 12 it is clear that surface water was the primary water source for all the areas in every scenario the percentages of surface water and groundwater were about 60 and 40 and the total surface water allocation amount was the same while the groundwater allocation amount was changing under different scenarios this was because surface water was fully utilized and the groundwater utilization percentage was large because water supply from different rivers was lower under the 75 frequency leading to more groundwater use to guarantee the growth of crops 4 3 discussion in summary based on the generation of interval parameters the ilmp model was developed with three objective functions based on the fuzzy programming method the ilmp model was solved with a series of results associated with water allocation and objective values generated under different frequencies and scenarios in this study there were in total six parameters varying with different frequencies five of them were the runoffs of hulan river anbang river lalinqing river ougen river and yijimi river and the remaining one was precipitation the yearly changing trends of all the five rivers were nearly the same based on historical data however there was a difference of yearly changing trend between runoffs of the five rivers and precipitation taking huanlan river as an example the occurrence probabilities of runoff and precipitation under the same frequency were the highest except for the condition when the frequencies of runoff and precipitation were both 75 therefore the corresponding values of runoff and precipitation with combinations of the same frequency were used to decrease computation for the condition when the frequencies of runoff and precipitation were both 75 the runoffs under the 75 frequency and precipitation under 95 frequency were combined however such combinations would lead to the loss of information and thus affect results taking runoff under the 25 frequency as an example there also existed occurrence probabilities when the frequencies of precipitation were 50 75 and 95 and such conditions were not considered in this study this suggests further researches on how to develop a joint probability function to reflect all the combinations of related elements the aim of the ilmp model was to balance the contradictions among economic benefit crop yield and water saving in irrigation systems the solutions contained a combination of interval and deterministic information and thus reflected uncertainty better reflecting real conditions the interval solutions can help managers obtain multiple decision alternatives as well as provide a basis for further analyses of tradeoffs between different contradictories in an irrigation system 5 conclusion considering uncertain factors in the course of water resources allocation interval parameters were generated the interval numbers of hulan river anbang river lalinqing river ougen river yijimi river and precipitation were generated by the bootstrap method the interval numbers of evapotranspiration were generated by stochastic simulation and those of other parameters by the upper and lower thresholds or the probable error range thus an interval linear multi objective programming ilmp model was developed for irrigation water resources management considering the contradictory objectives of system net benefit crop yield and water saving the interval parameter generation and the developed model constitute a framework which has advantages in 1 generating relatively accurate interval ranges of different hydrological elements under different frequencies for water resources management 2 allowing uncertainties presented as interval values to be incorporated within a general multi objective optimization framework in which tradeoffs between the aspects of economy society and resources were considered to generate solutions the model was transformed into two deterministic sub models based on fuzzy programming with the consideration of both linear and non linear membership functions the developed framework was applied to a real case study for allocating limited water resources to different crops in different subareas in hulan river irrigation district northeast of china results suggest that the methodology is applicable for reflecting the complexities of multi objective and uncertainties of agricultural irrigation management systems this study attempts to provide a framework for comprehensive allocation of agricultural irrigation water to reflect uncertainties and multi objective more precisely the framework can also been applied to management of other resources where hydrological elements are involved for example regional water resources management in this study the impacts of the changes of different hydrological elements such as runoff and precipitation on the water resources allocation schemes were analyzed as independent scenarios without considering the joint distributions of these hydrological elements this may limit the allocative effect of the developed framework and requires further research acknowledgments this research was supported by the national key r d plan of china no

11595,an interval linear multi objective programming ilmp model for irrigation water allocation was developed considering conflicting objectives and uncertainties based on the generation of interval numbers through statistical simulation the ilmp model was solved using a fuzzy programming method the model balances contradictions among economic net benefit crop yield and water saving in irrigation systems incorporating uncertainties in both objective functions and constraints that are based on the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater the model was applied to hulan river irrigation district northeast china tradeoffs between various crops in different subareas under different frequencies were analyzed and scenarios with different objectives were considered to evaluate the changing trend of irrigation water allocation results indicated that the ilmp model provided effective linkages between revenue output promotion and water saving and offers insights into tradeoffs for irrigation water management under uncertainty keywords irrigation water allocation multi objective programming interval number bootstrap scenario analysis 1 introduction these days water crisis is occurring too frequently and at too many places underscoring the importance of sustainable and efficient water resources management among all the water users agriculture is the dominant user and irrigated agriculture consumes more than 70 of available water resources in the world galán martín et al 2017 due to rapid socio economic development and continuing population growth future irrigated agriculture will face challenges to meet the growing food demand while the water available for agriculture will simultaneously be decreasing wang et al 2017 therefore optimal allocation of water availability for agricultural irrigation in an efficient manner is a critical issue for agricultural water management optimal allocation of agricultural irrigation water can be determined using optimization techniques a number of optimization techniques such as linear programming dynamic programming nonlinear programming and stochastic programming have been employed to drive optimal irrigation patterns subject to the maximization or minimization of certain objectives singh 2012 among these optimization techniques linear programming for irrigation water allocation has been most popular das et al 2015 however irrigation water allocation systems depend on various independent aspects such as economic social and natural that often conflict with each other and are therefore too complex for linear programming such a water allocation problem can be handled by multi objective programming mop that is capable of incorporating multiple conflicting objectives functions such as maximizing net return crop yield versus reducing water consumption some investigators have used mop for allocating irrigation water with a different emphasis for example su et al 2014 developed a multi objective optimal allocation model for agricultural water resources considering three objectives of the maximum net benefit from agriculture the minimum fairness difference in the utilization of water and the maximum proportion of green water utilization galán martín et al 2017 formulated a multi objective linear programming model that simultaneously accounts for the maximization of crop production and the minimization of environmental impact caused by water consumption however optimal allocation of irrigation water in real world is complicated by various uncertainties that arise in the interactions among many system components examples include temporal and spatial variations of hydrological elements fluctuations of economic parameters and errors in estimating other related parameters therefore it is essential to optimize irrigation water allocation in the framework of mop considering uncertainties in order to better represent the complexity of irrigation systems generally the widely used uncertainty methods are stochastic mathematical programming smp fuzzy mathematical programming fmp and interval mathematical programming imp smp is an optimization model wherein parameters in the objective functions or constraints can be represented by probability distributions fmp addresses vagueness in decision maker aspirations or preference and ambiguity in knowledge or information in an optimization model imp deals with uncertainties that are approximated by only the lower and upper boundaries these uncertainty methods can handle different types of uncertainties but some deficiencies also exist for example although smp is capable for adequately tackling uncertainties but the high computations data requirement for specifying probability distributions may affect its practical application for the fmp there exists subjectivity in the membership function determination and results generation recently some investigators focused on fuzzy uncertainties in the mop model for irrigation water allocation regulwar and gurav 2011 mirajkar and patel 2013 li and guo 2014 morankar et al 2016 li et al 2016a b in practice specification of fuzzy sets or probability distributions is more difficult than obtaining interval numbers especially in the absence of data for an irrigation system many basic data are obtained by field experiments and monitoring resulting in the time series of these primary data are fairly short therefore considering the availability of data and computational efficiency the use of interval numbers is particularly appealing for an irrigation system compared with smp and fmp although the imp may encounter difficulties in tackling higher uncertain parameters thus far few investigations have considered interval uncertainties in mop for irrigation water allocation because of the capability to consider uncertainties with known lower and upper bounds in both objective functions and constraints imp has been successfully integrated in several single objective programming models for irrigation water allocation lu et al 2011 li et al 2014 guo et al 2014 yang et al 2015 2016 however few studies provide details on methods for acquisition of interval numbers in the optimization of irrigation water allocation hydrological elements such as runoff precipitation and evapotranspiration directly affect optimal irrigation water allocation these elements spatially and temporally change and can essentially be regarded as random parameters considerable differences occur in the quantities of these hydrological elements for different frequencies determining the fluctuation values of these elements for each frequency in advance can not only benefit irrigation optimization but also help ameliorate natural disasters such as flooding and drought therefore generation of interval numbers of hydrological elements for different frequencies that are incorporated in the mop optimization model can be valuable not only for avoiding sophisticated calculations but also for precision irrigation the primary objective of this study therefore is to develop an interval linear multi objective programming ilmp model for optimal irrigation water allocation under uncertainty the model incorporates the optimization technique of interval parameters into linear multi objective programming to handle uncertainties of irrigation systems and achieves a balance among net revenue output and water saving by optimally allocating available water the study entails several elements first interval numbers for social economic data and hydrological elements for different frequencies are generated second the ilmp model is developed for irrigation water allocation based on the generation of interval parameters third results are analyzed for different hydrological frequencies fourth a scenarios analysis is done as a complementary method to develop more decision making plans under different policy conditions and the model is tested by applying to a real world study in northeast china 2 methodology this section develops an interval linear multi objective programming ilmp framework with emphasis on the 1 generation of interval parameters using bootstrap method 2 development of the ilmp model based on the generation of interval parameters 3 solution of the ilmp model based on fuzzy programming fp method and 4 development of a framework for multi objective programming under uncertainty each of these elements is now discussed 2 1 bootstrap method the bootstrap method is a resampling technique this method only needs resampling from the original sample series without making assumptions for the overall distribution then continually estimates parameter values of the drawn samples and finally deduces the parameter characteristics of the unknown overall samples and quantitatively describes the uncertainty of parameter estimation thus it is an effective way to estimate and generate interval numbers based on long term data assuming x x 1 x 2 x n is an original sample and θ is the unknown parameter of the overall distribution from the lowest value to the highest value the original sample can be written as x 1 x 2 x n the empirical distribution fn for the sample can be described as follows hu et al 2015 1 f n 0 x x 1 k n x k x x k 1 k 1 2 n 1 1 x x n by resampling from the distribution f n the same size sample x x 1 x 2 x n can be obtained based on the bootstrap sample x the estimation θ of parameter θ of the distribution function can be calculated by a proper parameter estimation method repeating the bootstrap sampling n times the n groups of bootstrap samples can be obtained and can be described as x j x 1 j x 2 j x n j j 1 2 n then n parameter estimates θ j j 1 2 n of parameter θ can be derived taking θ j j 1 2 n as the sample of the unknown parameter θ the distribution of parameter θ can thus be obtained based on this distribution interval estimation of the values under each frequency can be derived based on the confidence intervals under predetermined confidence levels 2 2 interval linear multi objective programming 2 2 1 property of the interval numbers before formulating the ilmp model it is appropriate to first discuss the properties of interval numbers property 1 let a denote a closed and bounded set of real numbers and a define an interval number with known upper and lower bounds of a then a can be expressed as a a a a z a a 0 z 1 with a and a representing the lower and upper bounds of interval number a respectively and z representing an auxiliary variable that can be used to transform the interval parameter into a determination one property 2 for a the following relationships hold 1 a 0 if a 0 and a 0 and 2 a 0 if a 0 and a 0 further for a and b the other relations are as follows 1 a b if a b and a b and 2 a b if a b and a b property 3 let be a binary operation on interval numbers for a and b we have a b min a b max a b a a a b b b in the case of division it is assumed that b does not contain a zero hence we have a b a b a b a b a b a b a b min a b max a b a a a b b b a b min a b max a b a a a b b b 2 2 2 model development the ilmp model can be formulated as follows 2a min f k x c k x k 1 2 p subject to 2b a x b 2c x 0 where f k x k 1 2 p is the linear objective function x x 1 x 2 x n t is the independent variable vector c k c k 1 c k 2 c k n k 1 2 p is the coefficient of the objective function a a 1 j a 2 j a m j t j 1 2 n is the coefficient matrix of the constraints and b b 1 b 2 b m t is the vector on the right hand of constraints 2 2 3 solution method the solution for the ilmp model is based on the fp method the essence of which is the membership function the membership function for a vector minimum problem can usually be written as 3 μ f k x 1 f k x f k min f k m a x f k x f k m a x f k m i n f k min f k x f k max 1 k p 0 f k x f k max where μ f k x is the membership function of the kth objective function f k min and f k max are the lower and upper bounds of f k x respectively and it is assumed that f k min is not equal to f k max the models for calculating f k min and f k max share the same constraints with different objective functions and are described as follows objective function for calculating f k min 4a min f k x j 1 n c k j z k j c k j c k j x j objective for calculating f k max 4b max f k x j 1 n c k j z k j c k j c k j x j both 4a and 4b are subject to 4c j 1 n a i j s i j a i j a i j x j b t i b b 4d x j 0 4e z k j s i j t i 0 1 where i 1 2 m j 1 2 n k 1 2 p and they are adapted for all the models in this section zkj sij ti are auxiliary variables to transform the interval numbers of c k j a i j and b i into the corresponding deterministic expressions combined with the max min operator bellmanr and zaden 1970 the ilmp model can be transformed into the following two forms corresponding to the linear and non linear membership functions respectively hulsurkar et al 1997 a equivalence model for linear membership function 5a max λ subject to 5b μ f k x λ 5c j 1 n a i j s i j a i j a i j x j b t i b b 5d x j 0 5e λ s i j t i 0 1 where λ refers to the overall satisfactory degree b equivalence model for non linear membership function 6a max k 1 p λ k 6b μ f k x λ k 6c j 1 n a i j s i j a i j a i j x j b t i b b 6d x j 0 6e λ k s i j t i 0 1 where λk refers to the satisfactory degree of the kth objective function from the equivalence model for non linear membership function the importance of each objective can be quantitatively expressed by endowing with weights thus the objective function of 6a can be described as max k 1 p λ k ω k based on the weighted geometric method where ωk refers to the weight of the kth objective function guo et al 2015 models 5 and 6 are single objective programming models and the best worst models are available to obtain the interval solutions of the ilmp model for linear membership function the best and worst models are expressed as follows best model 7a max λ 7b j 1 n c k j x j λ f k max f k min f k max 7c j 1 n a i j x j b i 7d x j 0 7e 0 λ 1 worst model 8a max λ 8b j 1 n c k j x j λ f k max f k min f k max 8c j 1 n a i j x j b i 8d x j 0 8e 0 λ 1 for nonlinear membership function the best and worst models are expressed as follows best model 9a max k 1 p λ k ω k 9b j 1 n c k j x j λ k f k max f k min f k max 9c

solution models for the generation of interval results of the ilmp model 2 2 4 framework for multi objective programming under uncertainty the framework for multi objective programming under uncertainty contains mainly two parts the first part focuses on the generation of interval parameters in which the bootstrap method is introduced for water resources management the bootstrap method is capable of generating interval numbers for hydrological elements such as runoff precipitation and evapotranspiration under different frequencies based on long terms data however there are still short term data for some parameters associated with economy and society such as market price crop planting area grain production efficiency for such parameters with short term data a ci which is derived by ordering all potential values and later identifying the upper and lower thresholds that act as good estimates of unknown data sets shen et al 2011 and a probable error range for which each simulated or measured data point is determined with an error range chen et al 2014 are effective ways for the generation of interval numbers based on the solution of the first part the second part based on the ilmp model will be undertaken the interval numbers generated in the first part was regarded as the inputs of the ilmp model in the second part and this is the connection of the two parts the basic properties of interval numbers the model establishment and the solution method have been discussed and the flow chart of the developed framework is shown in fig 1 3 application 3 1 area description hulan river irrigation district is located in qing an county suihua city the middle of heilongjiang province in northeast china it ranges from 125 55 to 128 43 e and 45 52 to 48 03 n with a total area of 1 89 105 ha among which the actual irrigation area is 2 03 104 ha the irrigation district is in temperate semi arid and semi humid continental monsoon climate with characteristics of seasonal weather annual average precipitation evaporation temperature and frost free days are 545mm 665mm 1 7 c and 128 d respectively hulan river irrigation district faces water shortage problems only surface water cannot satisfy the water demand leading to the necessity of the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater the district is divided by hulan river into two sub districts where the southern part includes heping jianye and liuhe areas while the northern part includes lanhe fengtian and laomo areas heping area contains three headworks lishantun which brings water from hulan river anbanghe which brings water from anbang river and zhengwenju which brings water from lalinqing river jianye area has one headwork bringing water from lalinqing river liuhe area brings water from liuhe reservoir the headworks of lanhe district and laomo district are respectively fucheng and begai and they both bring water from ougen river the fengtian area contains two headworks among which fengtian headwork brings water from yijimi river and wanghai headwork brings water from hulan river anbang river lalinqing river yijimi river and ougen river are all branches of hulan river the location of these partitions can be seen in fig 2 food crops including rice maize and soybean occupy most of the planting area of hulan river irrigation district among which rice is the main crop to plant because of higher net benefits most water consumption in hulan river irrigation district is for agricultural irrigation therefore optimally allocating available water resources for food crops is significant for the commend area because of natural and artificial factors the elements that affect agricultural irrigation water allocation present uncertainties especially hydrological elements such as runoff precipitation and crop evapotranspiration in this study many rivers are involved and they present different values under different flow levels these provoke managers to ask as to 1 how to consider the uncertainties of both hydrological elements and non hydrological elements 2 for hydrological elements how to quantitatively express the uncertainties for different frequencies of different water supplies and 3 how to generate desired water allocation both surface water and groundwater schemes to achieve the goal of yield and or benefit promotion and blue water saving based on the above considerations a multi objective programming model with interval parameters can be developed the optimal results of which will provide a certain guide in the development of water saving and efficient agriculture 3 2 model development this part develops the ilmp model for optimally allocating available irrigation water for different food crops in different subareas of hulan river irrigation district for different frequencies of different water supplies the model consists of three linear objective functions and a set of constraints 3 2 1 objective functions 1 economic objective function with consideration of crop planting cost and water use cost the target for economic objective function is to maximize the net return from different crops grown 11a max f e i 1 i j 1 j m p i j y a i j

renewable blue water including streamflow and shallow groundwater is the target of water saving objective function this is because that irrigated agriculture uses both green water and blue water and both of them are important for food production besides its contribution to crop production blue water can also be directly used by socio economic sectors while green water cannot therefore green water should be well utilized and thus the blue water can be saved to increase irrigation efficiency in the premise of ensuring the minimum water demand of crops therefore in this study the blue water including both water from rivers and groundwater should be minimized 11c min f w i 1 i j 1 j s w i j g w i j where fe is the objective function for economic benefit 104yuan and yuan is the monetary

collection and processing the data for the ilmp model can be divided into four parts in this study they are hydrological parameters social economic parameters other parameters and weight scenario for each objective function rice maize and soybean are the studied crops and their growth periods are from may to september 3 3 1 hydrological parameters hydrological parameters contain runoff of each related river effective precipitation evapotranspiration of each crop and groundwater availability these hydrological parameters are essentially random and the values of most of them have significant variations for different frequencies accordingly it is necessary to estimate the interval values for different frequencies for these hydrological elements to reflect the randomness hydrological parameters usually have longer data series more than 30 years relative to non hydrological parameters thus the interval number generation of these hydrological elements can be obtained using the bootstrap method the time series for all these hydrological parameters are 55 years and they were collected from hydrological stations and meteorological network for runoff the bootstrap method was directly applied to generate interval numbers based on the time series data of each river in this study the interval numbers of runoff of hulan river q h l anbang river q a b lalinqing river q l l q yijimi river q y j m and ougen river q o g were all generated by bootstrap method first the empirical distribution was calculated and based on which a certain theoretical frequency curve was determined by comparing the fit with the empirical frequency curve then using monte carlo method resampling from the original sample was done 1000 times and parameters were estimated for each new sample that yielded 1000 groups of parameter estimates thereafter the probability distribution of a certain frequency was obtained finally the distribution of each frequency was obtained and the corresponding interval numbers were generated in this study the frequencies were chosen 25 50 75 and 95 corresponding to the wet condition normal condition dry condition and extreme dry condition respectively according to the dividing standard of wet and dry conditions of china and the planning and design report of hulan river irrigation district the effective precipitation was calculated by multiplying precipitation by an effective coefficient according to kang and cai 1996 if precipitation was less than 50mm then the coefficient was 0 9 if precipitation was greater than 50mm but less than 150mm then the coefficient was 0 75 and if precipitation was greater than 150 the coefficient was 0 7 in this manner the effective precipitation was obtained and the corresponding interval numbers for the selected frequencies were obtained with the same way as runoff for crop evapotranspiration etc the fao56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 was used to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration et 0 the fao56 penman monteith method was adopted because it was regarded as the basic method for calculating reference et 0 by food and agriculture organization of united nations in 1998 and it has strong theoretical property and computational accuracy the fao56 penman monteith method was widely used throughout the world and climate factors including average temperature lowest temperature highest temperature average wind speed sunshine duration average relative humidity were the basic input data for the method monthly and annual values of et 0 were obtained by summing daily values in this study the coefficient of variation cv of et 0 was only 0 06 much less than the cv values of the five rivers cv 0 53 for hulan river cv 0 57 for anbang river cv 0 77 for lalinqing river cv 0 50 for yijimin river and cv 0 55 for ougen river indicating yearly et 0 changed little the yearly trend can also be seen from fig 3 which suggests that it makes little sense to estimate the interval numbers of et 0 under each frequency which will otherwise add to the complexity of the optimization solution the stochastic simulation method li et al 2016a b was employed to estimate the interval number of et 0 based on the known probability distribution function the difference between bootstrap method and stochastic simulation method for the generation of interval number of hydrological elements is that the former is capable of conveniently generating interval numbers under different frequencies without the assumption of the overall distribution compared with the results of generation using bootstrap method the interval number of et 0 was expressed by only one value while the interval numbers of runoff of each river and precipitation were expressed by four values corresponding to the frequencies of 25 50 75 and 95 based on et 0 the etc was obtained using the formula etc kcet 0 pereira et al 2015 where kc is the crop coefficient which changes with growth periods of each crop the kc value for each crop of each month is listed in table 1 in this study the value of water requirement equaled the value of etc for each crop the calculated annual variations of et 0 and effective precipitation are shown in fig 3 and their monthly variation in fig 4 because of the lack of observation data availability of groundwater was expressed as the average value according to the planning report groundwater available for different subareas and the corresponding irrigation proportions are given in table 2 fengtian area is not designed for well irrigation the product of available groundwater and the irrigation proportion of groundwater is the value that was adopted for optimization in this study 3 3 2 socio economic parameters socio economic parameters in this study included market price planting area yield per unit area maximum irrigation amount planting cost water use productivity and water utilization cost these parameters were obtained mainly from yearbook report website field survey and previous studies the time series of these socio economic parameters were shorter than hydrological parameters less than 10 years so the bootstrap method was not suitable for the generation of interval numbers for these parameters for market price the maximum and minimum values during the whole growth period of each crop were collected from agricultural product price net crop planting area data and yield per unit area were obtained from planning report and yearbook 2010 2015 and the corresponding interval numbers were calculated from the method of μ x where μ is the mean and x is the deviation then interval numbers of yield per unit area were obtained by dividing the yield of each crop of each irrigation area by the interval planting area the maximum irrigation amount was the upper threshold in the right hand of the irrigation constraint indicating that the optimal water allocation amount for different regions cannot exceed the maximum irrigation amount in this study the maximum irrigation amount was obtained by multiplying the irrigation quota under higher design dependability with the interval planting area as the planting area was expressed as interval numbers leading to that the maximum irrigation amount was expressed as interval numbers as well water use productivities for the three crops were obtained from data analysis of field experiments planting cost and water utilization cost were obtained from previous works li and zhang 2016 fu et al 2016 tables 1 3 provide detailed information 3 3 3 other parameters other parameters mainly included irrigation proportion of groundwater irrigation proportions for each irrigation area from the corresponding rivers canal and field water utilization coefficient and hydraulic parameters all these parameters were deterministic in this study that came from planning and design report of hulan river irrigation district detailed information can be seen in table 2 the values of php 1 php 2 php 3 pjy plhr pft 1 pft plh were 0 84 9 8 18 1 7 5 11 1 0 84 4 1 6 8 3 4 respectively the values of canal and field irrigation utilization coefficients were 0 5 and 0 8 respectively for each area the coefficients for conveyance loss of surface water field water application loss rainfall infiltration were respectively 0 49 0 10 0 08 3 3 4 weight scenarios for objective functions the weighting coefficient method was used in the solution of the ilmp model when the membership function was non linear as a typical meta synthesis engineering method from quality analysis to quantity analysis analytical hierarchy process ahp has been widely used in the field of water resources management srdjevic and medeiros 2008 therefore in this study the weights of importance for the three objectives of the developed ilmp model were determined by the ahp method four scenarios were set scenario 1 referred to the equal importance of the three objectives scenario 2 referred to the case where the objective of economic benefit was paramount scenario 3 referred to the case where the objective of yield increase was paramount and scenario 4 referred to the case where the objective of water saving was paramount results of weights determined from the ahp method are shown in table 4 4 analysis of results and discussion 4 1 generation of interval numbers for hydrological parameters the interval numbers of hydrological parameters were obtained using the bootstrap method through hydrological curve fitting the probability distribution of each hydrological parameter was determined and parameters were estimated the pearson type iii distribution was fitted to the values of runoff of hulan river lalinqing river and yijimi river and of precipitation and the distribution parameters were estimated using the method of moments the runoff of anbang river followed a 2 parameter gamma distribution and the runoff of ougen river followed a generalized extreme value distribution the parameters of these hydrological parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method the runoff of lalinqing river which supplied water for most areas including heping area jianye area and liuhe area was used as an example to demonstrate the generation of interval numbers by the bootstrap method the probability distribution and the mann kendall m k test hamed and rao 1998 of the runoff of lalinqing river are shown in fig 5 the m k test showed a low temporal variability of the runoff time series of lalinqin river indicating that the sample could be considered continuous fig 6 presents the frequency histogram and the normal probability plot of the runoff values of lalinqing river under the frequencies of 25 50 75 and 95 the figure shows that the normal distribution function fitted the frequency histogram well under each frequency the scatters were evenly distributed around the 45 line which showed the distribution of runoff values of lalinqing river under each frequency wa approximately a normal distribution therefore using the normal distribution the interval number of each frequency was obtained for the 95 confidence interval similarly the interval numbers of other hydrological parameters are listed in table 5 the pearson type iii distribution was fitted to the et 0 values and the acceptance rejection method gu et al 2008 was used for the stochastic simulation to generate interval numbers with the 95 confidence interval the results of generation of these interval numbers were then input in the ilmp model 4 2 agricultural irrigation water allocation the ilmp model was then solved based on interval inputs a series of water allocation results for different crops in different areas under different frequencies membership functions and weight scenarios were obtained 4 2 1 results of linear membership function for linear membership function the results of total irrigation amount expressed as intervals of different areas under different frequencies are shown in fig 7 the figure shows that the amount of water allocated to heping area was the highest then was laomo area and the last one was jianye area it can also be seen from the figure that the total water allocation amount under different frequencies changed distinctly from 1 01 1 60 108 m3 under the frequency of 25 to 0 98 1 33 108 m3 under the frequency of 95 indicating the importance to prepare alternative water allocation plans to deal with the unknown water supply for the efficient use of limited water resources in fact when solving for the worst case of the ilmp model under the frequency of 95 which corresponded to the condition of extreme dry there was no feasible solution because both surface water and groundwater supplies were not able to meet crops highest irrigation demand in such a case one way was to transfer 2791 104 m3 from areas with relative abundant water supply or pumping of more groundwater within the allowable range which would increase the accompanying cost and the impact on groundwater the other way was to decrease irrigation requirement which would reduce production and would affect benefit this is worth a further study for seeking a satisfactory water allocation solution under extreme conditions on the other hand groundwater allocation under the frequency of 25 was the least because the optimization model tended to prefer allocating surface water this was attributed to two reasons one was that the cost of groundwater was higher than that of surface water and the other was that the surplus of groundwater was considered for transfer to other water use sectors for example industry to avoid wasting extra water for irrigation and meanwhile increasing profit comparison among water utilization water requirement wr intervals and maximum irrigation for each area under different frequencies is shown in fig 8 among which the total water allocation contained both the net water allocation amount and effective precipitation the net water allocation amount equaled the gross water allocation amount optimal results multiplied by the water use coefficients for canal and field the figure shows that under all frequencies the total water allocation was in the interval of maximum and minimum water requirement for frequency of 25 the total water allocation amounts of heping area jianye area liuhe area and fengtian area even exceeded their maximum water requirements and nearly reached their maximum irrigation thresholds indicating that water supply was abundant under the frequency of 25 however for the 95 frequency the total water allocation could only satisfy the minimum water requirement for most areas except for fengtian area for the 50 and 75 frequencies the total water allocation in most of the areas was in the intervals of minimum water requirement and maximum irrigation threshold the water allocation for smaller areas such jianye liuhe and fentian was reaching the maximum irrigation threshold in order to obtain the optimized comprehensive benefit taking the 50 frequency which represented the normal condition as an example the water allocation for each crop in each area is shown in fig 9 the total water allocation amount for rice wa larger than that for maize and soybean because of the relative higher market price and water production efficiency the total average water allocation for rice maize and soybean was 5798 104m3 2518 104m3 and 4174 104m3 respectively since maize is a water consuming crop with lower benefit it is inadvisable to plant it in large quantities especially in heping irrigation area 4 2 2 results of non linear membership function for nonlinear membership function of the ilmp model the objective weight scenarios were taken into account different scenarios indicated different weights of importance for different objectives and information on the weights is given in table 4 taking the 50 frequency as an example fig 10 shows different values of the three objectives under different scenarios in fig 10 of1 means the first objective i e the maximum net benefit 104yuan of2 means the second objective i e the maximum crop yield 104kg and of3 means the third objective i e the minimum blue water use 104m3 in this figure both the upper bound and the lower bound of the values of objectives were in the range of maximum and minimum objectives for each scenario the first and third objectives were always given a priority with the upper bounds nearly achieving the corresponding maximum values scenario 1 yielded optimal results with equal importance of the three objectives scenario 2 focused more on the system net benefit scenario 3 focused more on crop yield and scenario 4 focused more on water saving for scenario 2 and scenario 4 the changing trends of upper and lower bounds of all the three objectives were the same this was attributed to the same properties of objective 1 and objective 3 whose aim was to decrease the water utilization cost and achieve water saving specifically the net benefit was 31348 38524 104 yuan with 430 104 yuan lower than the maximum net benefit and the lower bound of which was equal to the minimum net benefit the crop yield was 17772 20630 104 kg with 5691 104 kg lower than the maximum net benefit and 3309 104 kg higher than the minimum net benefit the water allocation was 12435 14763 104 m3 with 7458 104 m3 higher than the minimum water allocation and the upper bound of which was equal to the maximum water allocation amount the changing trend of the three objectives for scenario 3 which emphasized allocating more water to get more yield was contrary to that of scenario 2 and scenario 4 the crop yield of scenario 3 was 167 104 kg higher than that of scenario 2 and scenario 4 for scenario 1 as the importance of all the three objectives was equal the values of net benefit crop yield and water allocation were in the range of that of scenarios 2 4 for the area that water was insufficient the water use productivity was an important index to reflect the water use efficiency and it was expressed as the yield per unit water use calculating it the water use productivity under the four scenarios was 1 34 1 50 kg m3 1 40 1 74 kg m3 1 34 1 71 kg m3 1 40 1 74 kg m3 respectively it was clear that water use productivities of scenario 2 and 4 were higher than those under other scenarios attributing to the smaller water allocation amount under those two scenarios the objective of transformations of the original ilmp model was to maximize the degree of overall satisfaction fig 11 shows the satisfaction degrees under different frequencies and different scenarios it can be seen from the figure that the satisfaction degrees vary as the frequencies and scenarios change the changing trends of different frequencies under the four scenarios were nearly the same with different changing amplitudes the lower bounds of satisfaction degrees were in the vicinity of 0 3 while the upper bounds of satisfaction degrees were in the vicinity of 0 8 in addition for the area that water was insufficient decision makers usually paid more attention to water allocation schemes with higher frequency to reduce the water shortage risk because of the randomness of water supply thus taking the 75 frequency as an example whose frequency was higher but not the extreme condition the irrigation water allocation amount of both surface water and groundwater for each crop under different scenarios are shown in fig 12 it is clear that surface water was the primary water source for all the areas in every scenario the percentages of surface water and groundwater were about 60 and 40 and the total surface water allocation amount was the same while the groundwater allocation amount was changing under different scenarios this was because surface water was fully utilized and the groundwater utilization percentage was large because water supply from different rivers was lower under the 75 frequency leading to more groundwater use to guarantee the growth of crops 4 3 discussion in summary based on the generation of interval parameters the ilmp model was developed with three objective functions based on the fuzzy programming method the ilmp model was solved with a series of results associated with water allocation and objective values generated under different frequencies and scenarios in this study there were in total six parameters varying with different frequencies five of them were the runoffs of hulan river anbang river lalinqing river ougen river and yijimi river and the remaining one was precipitation the yearly changing trends of all the five rivers were nearly the same based on historical data however there was a difference of yearly changing trend between runoffs of the five rivers and precipitation taking huanlan river as an example the occurrence probabilities of runoff and precipitation under the same frequency were the highest except for the condition when the frequencies of runoff and precipitation were both 75 therefore the corresponding values of runoff and precipitation with combinations of the same frequency were used to decrease computation for the condition when the frequencies of runoff and precipitation were both 75 the runoffs under the 75 frequency and precipitation under 95 frequency were combined however such combinations would lead to the loss of information and thus affect results taking runoff under the 25 frequency as an example there also existed occurrence probabilities when the frequencies of precipitation were 50 75 and 95 and such conditions were not considered in this study this suggests further researches on how to develop a joint probability function to reflect all the combinations of related elements the aim of the ilmp model was to balance the contradictions among economic benefit crop yield and water saving in irrigation systems the solutions contained a combination of interval and deterministic information and thus reflected uncertainty better reflecting real conditions the interval solutions can help managers obtain multiple decision alternatives as well as provide a basis for further analyses of tradeoffs between different contradictories in an irrigation system 5 conclusion considering uncertain factors in the course of water resources allocation interval parameters were generated the interval numbers of hulan river anbang river lalinqing river ougen river yijimi river and precipitation were generated by the bootstrap method the interval numbers of evapotranspiration were generated by stochastic simulation and those of other parameters by the upper and lower thresholds or the probable error range thus an interval linear multi objective programming ilmp model was developed for irrigation water resources management considering the contradictory objectives of system net benefit crop yield and water saving the interval parameter generation and the developed model constitute a framework which has advantages in 1 generating relatively accurate interval ranges of different hydrological elements under different frequencies for water resources management 2 allowing uncertainties presented as interval values to be incorporated within a general multi objective optimization framework in which tradeoffs between the aspects of economy society and resources were considered to generate solutions the model was transformed into two deterministic sub models based on fuzzy programming with the consideration of both linear and non linear membership functions the developed framework was applied to a real case study for allocating limited water resources to different crops in different subareas in hulan river irrigation district northeast of china results suggest that the methodology is applicable for reflecting the complexities of multi objective and uncertainties of agricultural irrigation management systems this study attempts to provide a framework for comprehensive allocation of agricultural irrigation water to reflect uncertainties and multi objective more precisely the framework can also been applied to management of other resources where hydrological elements are involved for example regional water resources management in this study the impacts of the changes of different hydrological elements such as runoff and precipitation on the water resources allocation schemes were analyzed as independent scenarios without considering the joint distributions of these hydrological elements this may limit the allocative effect of the developed framework and requires further research acknowledgments this research was supported by the national key r d plan of china no

has been cultivated in agricultural lands mainly for bioenergy purposes it can reach excellent biomass yield more than 30mgha 1 dry matter under certain environmental high global radiation and average temperature values and agronomic irrigation conditions lewandowski et al 2000 symphytum x uplandicum nyman comfrey it is a perennial herb known as comfrey gum plant or boneset it is used mainly for its anti inflammatory emollient and anaesthetic properties wet soils and sunny positions typical of ditches are suitable for the growth of the species once established the biomass produced can be harvested several times during a vegetative season due to the fast regeneration 2 3 meteorological data water balance and crop coefficients meteorological data and reference evapotranspiration et0 calculated by the fao penman montieth equation allen et al 1998 were recorded from january 1st 2010 to december 31st 2013 by a weather station located near the experimental site that belongs to the regional agency for environmental protection arpav monthly crop evapotranspiration etc mm was calculated from july to september in 2010 may to september in 2011 april to june in 2012 and july to august in 2013 by a simplified water balance equation as follows etc r i δs dw where r mm is rainfall i mm is water provision by irrigation δs is the soil moisture variation between the beginning and end of the month and dw is drained water mm the contribution of water table was not computed because the growth boxes were installed at 1 3m above ground level excluding the effect of capillary rise no surface run off occurred because their rims were about 10cm above the level of the soil inside crop coefficients kc were estimated according to fao 56 crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 according to kc etc et0 kc values were calculated on a monthly basis excluding the data of the first year when the crops were establishing the calculations were made merging the data of the second and third years together when crops were fully developed and well watered on average 1763 1mmyear 1 during the cropping season and taking the fourth year separately when the crops were grown under not well watered conditions 974 4mm for comparison water use efficiency wue was calculated as the ratio between aboveground dry biomass production florio 2014 and water received by plants rainfall irrigation during the growing seasons march october etc kc and volumetric soil moisture values determined during the first growing season 2010 were left out because plants were affected by the late transplant which did not allow a complete colonization and soil coverage 2 4 belowground biomass production and nutrient contents at the end of the fourth growing season november 2013 soil and roots were sampled in the center of each growth box 0 5 0 5 surface area at two depths 0 20cm and 20 50cm at the beginning of january 2014 root systems were washed to remove soil and then manually divided into root and rhizome fractions the dry weights of the two components were determined by drying in a forced air oven at 65 c until constant weight was reached dry biomass was milled at 2mm and then analyzed to determine nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations using the kjeldhal method and spectrophotometric analysis the total nitrogen and phosphorus contents in roots and rhizomes kgha 1 were determined as the product of their dry biomass yields and nutrient concentrations 2 5 statistical analysis since c indica c pseudocyperus p arundinacea s sylvaticus did not survive till the end of the experiment they were not included in the statistical analysis for the other ten species the normality of data was checked with the kolmogorov smirnov test as belowground production data did not show a normal distribution they were statistically analyzed with kruskal wallis multiple independent samples comparison and mann whitney two independent samples comparison non parametric tests to find the significant differences at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological data during the whole experimental period global radiation followed the typical seasonal bell shaped trend with the highest values recorded during summer july and the lowest during winter december and january fig 1 the average global radiation values measured in 2011 and 2012 15 1 and 14 8mjm 2 respectively were higher than the long term average 13 6mjm 2 which was instead in line with values detected in the first 13 5mjm 2 and fourth 13 7mjm 2 years of the study average air temperature followed the trend of solar radiation increasing from january to july when the highest values were measured and then decreasing until december on the average of the four experimental years the monthly air temperature exceeded the long term average 1995 2010 from march to april and from june to november whereas no evident differences were detected for the other months different distribution and amount of monthly rainfall was detected over the four years fig 1 with the maximum in march 2013 260mm and minimum in july 2012 0 4mm during the first and the fourth years the annual rainfall of 1140 8mm and 1083 6mm respectively exceeded the long term average 867 4mm whereas values were lower than the long term average in the second and third years 601 1mm and 630 2mm which corresponded to the driest growing seasons march october there were protracted periods of severe drought during june and july of the third and fourth growing seasons fig 1 during the experimental period et0 maintained the same seasonal trend as global radiation and air temperature fig 1 maximum values were recorded in july of all years ranging from 153 5mm 2011 to 164 0mm 2012 when the water losses by evapotranspiration were not sufficiently balanced by rainfall average et0 values calculated in 2011 and 2012 were higher 10 8 and 8 4 respectively than the long term average 69 7mm whereas in the other years there were no substantial differences 3 2 soil moisture content data on soil moisture content were gathered in the second 2011 and third 2012 growing seasons for each species since the plants were abundantly irrigated and fully developed in these seasons the monthly volumetric soil moisture trend was characterized by a species specific behavior through the soil profile 0 90cm fig 2 for the majority of studied species soil moisture was lower in the first layer 0 20cm than in the deeper one 20 90cm due to the high root density in the upper profile monti and zatta 2009 maucieri et al 2014 barbera et al 2015 indeed soil moisture depends on crop water uptake which in turn is influenced by crop root density kätterer et al 1995 lai and katul 2000 king et al 2003 in april before starting the irrigation on the average of studied species and soil profiles soil moisture was 19 3 with evident differences among species c riparia m giganteus g maxima and h tuberosus showed the lowest values especially in the 0 50cm layer the highest soil moisture values were measured when irrigation started in may in fact excluding the top 10cm of soil which is usually the driest due to the combined action of both surface root system and evaporation the field capacity was surpassed in many soil layers fig 2 because the volumes supplied with irrigation exceeded crop requirements from may to june the moisture decreased for all species and in july august and september soil moisture values through the profile showed limited monthly variations suggesting that water supplied was equal to plants water requirements in these three months a donax m giganteus and h tuberosus soil moisture values were almost always lower than wilting point in the entire soil profile during the same period c acutiformis i pseudacosur and a lappa soil moisture values were maintained between wilting point and field capacity fig 2 for the other species soil moisture was lower than wilting point in the upper soil 0 20cm and increased in the deeper layers 20 90cm remaining lower than field capacity fig 2 a donax m giganteus and h tuberosus showed the highest capacity to absorb water from the entire profile since they depleted the reservoir up to 90cm in full summer on the contrary i pseudacosur was the species with least ability to affect soil moisture in the deeper layers of the profile 3 3 water consumption and crop coefficients on the average of the second and third growing seasons the monthly etc values of all species were higher than monthly et0 ones table 3 confirming the characteristic high etc values of wetland plants borin et al 2011 toscano et al 2015 maucieri et al 2016b on the average of the species etc increased from april on average 152 7mm to june on average 365 4mm with plant size and leaf area increment and then decreased until september 124 8mm with plant senescence the seasonal cumulated etc varied among species with the highest values for a donax and h tuberosus on average 1657 5mm and the lowest for g maxima 1406 0mm in agreement with the findings obtained by triana et al 2015 a donax showed higher cumulative evapotranspiration rates than m giganteus probably due to the different photosynthetic pathways a donax c3 vs m giganteus c4 kc values showed a similar seasonal trend to that of etc increasing from april 1 8 2 3 to june 2 4 2 8 and then decreasing until september 1 3 1 5 for the majority of species kc calculated from april to september were higher than those reported for unfertilized woody perennial crops such as populus spp and salix spp guidi et al 2008 and for traditional field crops such as zea mays allen et al 1998 piccinni et al 2009 in the fourth growing season all species exhibited lower evapotranspiration rates and consequently kc values than in the previous years due to the low amount of water supplied through irrigation table 4 in particular etc values ranged from 82 5mm to 170 2mm in july and from 121 7mm to 181 4 in august similarly kc values varied from 0 8 to 1 1 in july and from 0 9 to 1 4 in august kc values calculated in 2013 were within the ranges reported by allen et al 1998 for different wetland plants such as thypa latifolia 0 3 1 2 and phragmites australis 0 90 1 20 the majority of species studied in this experiment are suitable for a wetland environment vymazal 2011 2013 but their et rates are not yet well studied except in some pilot applications performed with a donax and m giganteus hickman et al 2010 toscano et al 2015 triana et al 2015 for the other species etc has not yet been thoroughly examined probably because good etc estimations are difficult to obtain usepa 2000 3 4 water use efficiency on the average of the second and the third growing seasons different wue values were obtained among the species a donax and m giganteus exhibited the highest values g maxima the lowest fig 3 the wue of a donax was about 1 5 times that reported by triana et al 2015 in the second year after transplant 2 9gl 1 the wue of m giganteus was 67 4 and 78 4 those reported by triana et al 2015 in the second 4 3gl 1 and third 3 7gl 1 year after transplant respectively in the last growing season 2013 when lower water volumes were supplied with irrigation the majority of species enhanced their wue values except for c acutiformis c riparia and s x uplandicum which reduced them this contrasts with results reported in the scientific literature since clifton brown and lewandowski 2000 and janket et al 2013 reported a higher wue for m giganteus and h tuberosus with increasing water supply 3 5 belowground biomass production for all species both rhizome and root biomass productions were higher in the 0 20cm than 20 50cm layer mann whitney p 0 05 this result suggests that plants do not deepen the root systems if managed with high nutrients and water supply as reported by bengough et al 2006 belowground biomass production was heterogeneous among the species due to their different capacity to explore the soil table 5 a donax and m giganteus showed the significantly highest kruskal wallis p 0 05 rhizome productions in the top soil layer 0 20cm g maxima s x uplandicum and a lappa the lowest table 5 lower productions than these have been reported at 0 30cm depth for both a donax 16 0mgha 1 nassi o di nasso et al 2013 and m giganteus from 9 8mgha 1 to 17 3mgha 1 amougou et al 2011 at 20 50cm depth a lappa showed significantly higher kruskal wallis p 0 05 rhizome production than all the other species regarding roots at 0 20cm depth m giganteus c acutiformis and a donax biomass productions were significantly higher kruskal wallis p 0 05 than that of a lappa in the deeper studied layer 20 50cm m giganteus and a donax were the only two species producing a notable amount of roots indeed m giganteus presented a deep and extensive root system confirming the findings of neukirchen et al 1999 and cadoux et al 2012 the correct knowledge of plant root systems distribution in soil profiles represents a key factor to be considered especially when pedo climatic impediments occur e g water and nutrients scarcity polluted soil layers moreover root systems assume an indirect role in atmospheric carbon dioxide emission reduction and soil quality improvement in fact about 36 of plant net photosynthetic carbon is mobilized from shoots to root of this 50 remains in the root biomass while almost 12 is released into the soil jones et al 2009 in addition the turnover of root organic biomass increases the soil stable organic carbon content mclaughlin and walsh 1998 rasse et al 2005 somerville et al 2010 especially in sites cultivated with perennial herbaceous species which are not subjected to the regular tillage that occurs for annual cropping cycles corno et al 2014 3 6 n and p concentrations and contents in belowground tissues n and p percentage concentrations in belowground tissues were heterogeneous among the species but similar between the two soil layers within the same species table 6 belowground tissues had higher n concentration than p with the lowest n and p in the roots and the highest in the rhizomes as reserve organs the nutritive resources temporarily stored in rhizomes are mobilized during the spring to support shoots vegetative regrowth beale and long 1977 himken et al 1997 nassi o di nasso et al 2013 on the average of soil profiles rhizome n concentrations ranged from 2 48 to 0 54 with the highest value for s x uplandicum and the lowest for m giganteus higher rhizome n concentrations than ours were reported for m giganteus by himken et al 1997 from 0 75 to 1 5 amougou et al 2011 0 70 1 50 and kahle et al 2001 1 13 within the 0 50cm layer rhizome p concentrations ranged from 0 33 for h tuberosus to 0 13 for a donax the highest root n and p concentrations were detected for h tuberosus 2 34 and 0 49 respectively and s x uplandicum 1 80 and 0 28 whereas the lowest were detected for m giganteus 0 40 and 0 14 and a donax 0 48 and 0 10 as with n and p concentrations the n and p contents were heterogeneous among species thus reflecting their different belowground productions table 7 a donax i pseudacorus and m giganteus showed the highest rhizome n and p standing stocks at 0 20cm depth whereas a lappa in the deeper layer m giganteus showed the highest root n contents in both the 0 20cm and 20 50cm soil layers table 7 all other species had lower n contents than those observed for c acutiformis at 0 20cm depth and a donax at 20 50cm depth higher root p contents were calculated for m giganteus in both 0 20cm and 20 50cm soil layers than other species table 7 nutrient content in root system biomass is of practical agronomic importance especially taking into account the high quantity of n and p stored in the root systems of the studied species in fact after perennial plants cultivation the application of conventional agronomic practices such as inversion tillage to prepare soil for another crop could enhance the organic matter mineralization rate stockfisch et al 1999 increasing nutrient release directly in the rhizosphere in this context the knowledge of stored nutrients is important to arrange sustainable fertilization plans to reduce both fertilizers input and nutrients especially n leaching 4 conclusions this paper provides a water balance calculation and a quantitative and qualitative characterization of root systems of ten plant species suitable for biomass production and wastewater treatment in constructed wetland systems in a four year study with high organic fertilizer and water supplies monthly etc and kc followed the same seasonal trend for all studied species although a high variability was detected the cumulated etc values ranged from 1406 0mm for g maxima to 1675 1mm for a donax while average seasonal kc values varied between 1 9 a lappa and g maxima to 2 6 m x giganteus the correct estimation of these parameters could have practical repercussions for sludge dewatering and zero discharge plants design and natural wetland water balance calculation soil moisture trend over the monitoring period was species specific with the lowest values at 0 20cm depth due to the high root colonization rate highly variable root system production was found between species with the highest values at 0 50cm depth obtained for m giganteus median value 62 6mgha 1 and a donax median value 49 4mgha 1 and the lowest for s x uplandicum median value 0 5mgha 1 and g maxima median value 1 0mgha 1 to our knowledge these topics have up to now not been well investigated for all the studied species in the scientific literature our initial results therefore need to be confirmed through further investigations in different climatic contexts acknowledgements the research was supported by the italian ministry of agriculture food and forestry within fitoprobio project production of macrophyte wetland biomass irrigated with

sustainability concerns in this context renewable energy resources can largely substitute fossil fuels with important positive effects on the environment new energy technologies have to contribute to reduce greenhouse gases emission in the atmosphere as required by european union in its policy objectives popp et al 2014 for this purpose the agricultural sector contributes by producing several

calculated by the fao penman montieth equation allen et al 1998 were recorded from january 1st 2010 to december 31st 2013 by a weather station located near the experimental site that belongs to the regional agency for environmental protection arpav monthly crop evapotranspiration etc mm was calculated from july to september in 2010 may to september in 2011 april to june in 2012 and july to august in 2013 by a simplified water balance equation as follows etc r i δs dw where r mm is rainfall i mm is water provision by irrigation δs is the soil moisture variation between the beginning and end of the month and dw is drained water mm the contribution of water table was not computed because the growth boxes were installed at 1 3m above ground level excluding the effect of capillary rise no surface run off occurred because their rims were about 10cm above the level of the soil inside crop coefficients kc were estimated according to fao 56 crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 according to kc etc et0 kc values were calculated on a monthly basis excluding the data of the first year when the crops were establishing the calculations were made merging the data of the second and third years together when crops were fully developed and well watered on average 1763 1mmyear 1 during the cropping season and taking the fourth year separately when the crops were grown under not well watered conditions 974 4mm for comparison water use efficiency wue was calculated as the ratio between aboveground dry biomass production florio 2014 and water received by plants rainfall irrigation during the growing seasons march october etc kc and volumetric soil moisture values determined during the first growing season 2010 were left out because plants were affected by the late transplant which did not allow a complete colonization and soil coverage 2 4 belowground biomass production and nutrient contents at the end of the fourth growing season november 2013 soil and roots were sampled in the center of each growth box 0 5 0 5 surface area at two depths 0 20cm and 20 50cm at the beginning of january 2014 root systems were washed to remove soil and then manually divided into root and rhizome fractions the dry weights of the two components were determined by drying in a forced air oven at 65 c until constant weight was reached dry biomass was milled at 2mm and then analyzed to determine nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations using the kjeldhal method and spectrophotometric analysis the total nitrogen and phosphorus contents in roots and rhizomes kgha 1 were determined as the product of their dry biomass yields and nutrient concentrations 2 5 statistical analysis since c indica c pseudocyperus p arundinacea s sylvaticus did not survive till the end of the experiment they were not included in the statistical analysis for the other ten species the normality of data was checked with the kolmogorov smirnov test as belowground production data did not show a normal distribution they were statistically analyzed with kruskal wallis multiple independent samples comparison and mann whitney two independent samples comparison non parametric tests to find the significant differences at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological data during the whole experimental period global radiation followed the typical seasonal bell shaped trend with the highest values recorded during summer july and the lowest during winter december and january fig 1 the average global radiation values measured in 2011 and 2012 15 1 and 14 8mjm 2 respectively were higher than the long term average 13 6mjm 2 which was instead in line with values detected in the first 13 5mjm 2 and fourth 13 7mjm 2 years of the study average air temperature followed the trend of solar radiation increasing from january to july when the highest values were measured and then decreasing until december on the average of the four experimental years the monthly air temperature exceeded the long term average 1995 2010 from march to april and from june to november whereas no evident differences were detected for the other months different distribution and amount of monthly rainfall was detected over the four years fig 1 with the maximum in march 2013 260mm and minimum in july 2012 0 4mm during the first and the fourth years the annual rainfall of 1140 8mm and 1083 6mm respectively exceeded the long term average 867 4mm whereas values were lower than the long term average in the second and third years 601 1mm and 630 2mm which corresponded to the driest growing seasons march october there were protracted periods of severe drought during june and july of the third and fourth growing seasons fig 1 during the experimental period et0 maintained the same seasonal trend as global radiation and air temperature fig 1 maximum values were recorded in july of all years ranging from 153 5mm 2011 to 164 0mm 2012 when the water losses by evapotranspiration were not sufficiently balanced by rainfall average et0 values calculated in 2011 and 2012 were higher 10 8 and 8 4 respectively than the long term average 69 7mm whereas in the other years there were no substantial differences 3 2 soil moisture content data on soil moisture content were gathered in the second 2011 and third 2012 growing seasons for each species since the plants were abundantly irrigated and fully developed in these seasons the monthly volumetric soil moisture trend was characterized by a species specific behavior through the soil profile 0 90cm fig 2 for the majority of studied species soil moisture was lower in the first layer 0 20cm than in the deeper one 20 90cm due to the high root density in the upper profile monti and zatta 2009 maucieri et al 2014 barbera et al 2015 indeed soil moisture depends on crop water uptake which in turn is influenced by crop root density kätterer et al 1995 lai and katul 2000 king et al 2003 in april before starting the irrigation on the average of studied species and soil profiles soil moisture was 19 3 with evident differences among species c riparia m giganteus g maxima and h tuberosus showed the lowest values especially in the 0 50cm layer the highest soil moisture values were measured when irrigation started in may in fact excluding the top 10cm of soil which is usually the driest due to the combined action of both surface root system and evaporation the field capacity was surpassed in many soil layers fig 2 because the volumes supplied with irrigation exceeded crop requirements from may to june the moisture decreased for all species and in july august and september soil moisture values through the profile showed limited monthly variations suggesting that water supplied was equal to plants water requirements in these three months a donax m giganteus and h tuberosus soil moisture values were almost always lower than wilting point in the entire soil profile during the same period c acutiformis i pseudacosur and a lappa soil moisture values were maintained between wilting point and field capacity fig 2 for the other species soil moisture was lower than wilting point in the upper soil 0 20cm and increased in the deeper layers 20 90cm remaining lower than field capacity fig 2 a donax m giganteus and h tuberosus showed the highest capacity to absorb water from the entire profile since they depleted the reservoir up to 90cm in full summer on the contrary i pseudacosur was the species with least ability to affect soil moisture in the deeper layers of the profile 3 3 water consumption and crop coefficients on the average of the second and third growing seasons the monthly etc values of all species were higher than monthly et0 ones table 3 confirming the characteristic high etc values of wetland plants borin et al 2011 toscano et al 2015 maucieri et al 2016b on the average of the species etc increased from april on average 152 7mm to june on average 365 4mm with plant size and leaf area increment and then decreased until september 124 8mm with plant senescence the seasonal cumulated etc varied among species with the highest values for a donax and h tuberosus on average 1657 5mm and the lowest for g maxima 1406 0mm in agreement with the findings obtained by triana et al 2015 a donax showed higher cumulative evapotranspiration rates than m giganteus probably due to the different photosynthetic pathways a donax c3 vs m giganteus c4 kc values showed a similar seasonal trend to that of etc increasing from april 1 8 2 3 to june 2 4 2 8 and then decreasing until september 1 3 1 5 for the majority of species kc calculated from april to september were higher than those reported for unfertilized woody perennial crops such as populus spp and salix spp guidi et al 2008 and for traditional field crops such as zea mays allen et al 1998 piccinni et al 2009 in the fourth growing season all species exhibited lower evapotranspiration rates and consequently kc values than in the previous years due to the low amount of water supplied through irrigation table 4 in particular etc values ranged from 82 5mm to 170 2mm in july and from 121 7mm to 181 4 in august similarly kc values varied from 0 8 to 1 1 in july and from 0 9 to 1 4 in august kc values calculated in 2013 were within the ranges reported by allen et al 1998 for different wetland plants such as thypa latifolia 0 3 1 2 and phragmites australis 0 90 1 20 the majority of species studied in this experiment are suitable for a wetland environment vymazal 2011 2013 but their et rates are not yet well studied except in some pilot applications performed with a donax and m giganteus hickman et al 2010 toscano et al 2015 triana et al 2015 for the other species etc has not yet been thoroughly examined probably because good etc estimations are difficult to obtain usepa 2000 3 4 water use efficiency on the average of the second and the third growing seasons different wue values were obtained among the species a donax and m giganteus exhibited the highest values g maxima the lowest fig 3 the wue of a donax was about 1 5 times that reported by triana et al 2015 in the second year after transplant 2 9gl 1 the wue of m giganteus was 67 4 and 78 4 those reported by triana et al 2015 in the second 4 3gl 1 and third 3 7gl 1 year after transplant respectively in the last growing season 2013 when lower water volumes were supplied with irrigation the majority of species enhanced their wue values except for c acutiformis c riparia and s x uplandicum which reduced them this contrasts with results reported in the scientific literature since clifton brown and lewandowski 2000 and janket et al 2013 reported a higher wue for m giganteus and h tuberosus with increasing water supply 3 5 belowground biomass production for all species both rhizome and root biomass productions were higher in the 0 20cm than 20 50cm layer mann whitney p 0 05 this result suggests that plants do not deepen the root systems if managed with high nutrients and water supply as reported by bengough et al 2006 belowground biomass production was heterogeneous among the species due to their different capacity to explore the soil table 5 a donax and m giganteus showed the significantly highest kruskal wallis p 0 05 rhizome productions in the top soil layer 0 20cm g maxima s x uplandicum and a lappa the lowest table 5 lower productions than these have been reported at 0 30cm depth for both a donax 16 0mgha 1 nassi o di nasso et al 2013 and m giganteus from 9 8mgha 1 to 17 3mgha 1 amougou et al 2011 at 20 50cm depth a lappa showed significantly higher kruskal wallis p 0 05 rhizome production than all the other species regarding roots at 0 20cm depth m giganteus c acutiformis and a donax biomass productions were significantly higher kruskal wallis p 0 05 than that of a lappa in the deeper studied layer 20 50cm m giganteus and a donax were the only two species producing a notable amount of roots indeed m giganteus presented a deep and extensive root system confirming the findings of neukirchen et al 1999 and cadoux et al 2012 the correct knowledge of plant root systems distribution in soil profiles represents a key factor to be considered especially when pedo climatic impediments occur e g water and nutrients scarcity polluted soil layers moreover root systems assume an indirect role in atmospheric carbon dioxide emission reduction and soil quality improvement in fact about 36 of plant net photosynthetic carbon is mobilized from shoots to root of this 50 remains in the root biomass while almost 12 is released into the soil jones et al 2009 in addition the turnover of root organic biomass increases the soil stable organic carbon content mclaughlin and walsh 1998 rasse et al 2005 somerville et al 2010 especially in sites cultivated with perennial herbaceous species which are not subjected to the regular tillage that occurs for annual cropping cycles corno et al 2014 3 6 n and p concentrations and contents in belowground tissues n and p percentage concentrations in belowground tissues were heterogeneous among the species but similar between the two soil layers within the same species table 6 belowground tissues had higher n concentration than p with the lowest n and p in the roots and the highest in the rhizomes as reserve organs the nutritive resources temporarily stored in rhizomes are mobilized during the spring to support shoots vegetative regrowth beale and long 1977 himken et al 1997 nassi o di nasso et al 2013 on the average of soil profiles rhizome n concentrations ranged from 2 48 to 0 54 with the highest value for s x uplandicum and the lowest for m giganteus higher rhizome n concentrations than ours were reported for m giganteus by himken et al 1997 from 0 75 to 1 5 amougou et al 2011 0 70 1 50 and kahle et al 2001 1 13 within the 0 50cm layer rhizome p concentrations ranged from 0 33 for h tuberosus to 0 13 for a donax the highest root n and p concentrations were detected for h tuberosus 2 34 and 0 49 respectively and s x uplandicum 1 80 and 0 28 whereas the lowest were detected for m giganteus 0 40 and 0 14 and a donax 0 48 and 0 10 as with n and p concentrations the n and p contents were heterogeneous among species thus reflecting their different belowground productions table 7 a donax i pseudacorus and m giganteus showed the highest rhizome n and p standing stocks at 0 20cm depth whereas a lappa in the deeper layer m giganteus showed the highest root n contents in both the 0 20cm and 20 50cm soil layers table 7 all other species had lower n contents than those observed for c acutiformis at 0 20cm depth and a donax at 20 50cm depth higher root p contents were calculated for m giganteus in both 0 20cm and 20 50cm soil layers than other species table 7 nutrient content in root system biomass is of practical agronomic importance especially taking into account the high quantity of n and p stored in the root systems of the studied species in fact after perennial plants cultivation the application of conventional agronomic practices such as inversion tillage to prepare soil for another crop could enhance the organic matter mineralization rate stockfisch et al 1999 increasing nutrient release directly in the rhizosphere in this context the knowledge of stored nutrients is important to arrange sustainable fertilization plans to reduce both fertilizers input and nutrients especially n leaching 4 conclusions this paper provides a water balance calculation and a quantitative and qualitative characterization of root systems of ten plant species suitable for biomass production and wastewater treatment in constructed wetland systems in a four year study with high organic fertilizer and water supplies monthly etc and kc followed the same seasonal trend for all studied species although a high variability was detected the cumulated etc values ranged from 1406 0mm for g maxima to 1675 1mm for a donax while average seasonal kc values varied between 1 9 a lappa and g maxima to 2 6 m x giganteus the correct estimation of these parameters could have practical repercussions for sludge dewatering and zero discharge plants design and natural wetland water balance calculation soil moisture trend over the monitoring period was species specific with the lowest values at 0 20cm depth due to the high root colonization rate highly variable root system production was found between species with the highest values at 0 50cm depth obtained for m giganteus median value 62 6mgha 1 and a donax median value 49 4mgha 1 and the lowest for s x uplandicum median value 0 5mgha 1 and g maxima median value 1 0mgha 1 to our knowledge these topics have up to now not been well investigated for all the studied species in the scientific literature our initial results therefore need to be confirmed through further investigations in different climatic

argentina after vineyards and it is key to the economy of the provinces of mendoza san juan la rioja and catamarca more than 95 of olive plantations are located in arid and semi arid environments between latitudes 28 s and 40 s having annual rainfall ranging from 100 to 500mm concentrated during the summer months gómez del campo et al 2010 consequently irrigation throughout the growing season mainly spring and autumn is essential for profitable yield and quality rousseaux et al 2009 trentacoste et al 2015 water is actually the most limiting factor to both olive production and area expansion in the coming years lower water availability and higher costs are expected due to competition among different uses industrial urbanization recreation etc fereres and evans 2006 at present many agronomic interventions are available in argentinian olive orchards to increase irrigation technology and water use efficiency however the evaluation of olive cultivars under water deficit

visible morphological and physiological signs of drought and ii there is a tendency for studies to be conducted on young non producing plants however an integrated view of olive cultivar response to

653 masl one year old olive trees were transplanted in 40l plastic pots 1 per pot in the spring of 2013 two years before initiating the experiment the pots were filled with a mixture of sandy soil and peat 4 1 v v pots were made from black plastic covered with aluminium foil in order to avoid soil evaporation minimize container temperature and exclude the entrance of rain plants were well irrigated and fertilized before starting the experiment the pots were kept on the field under plastic netting of high transmittance 75 to avoid hail damage and to prevent changes in microclimatic conditions seven olive cultivars were evaluated including five foreign cultivars arbequina changlot morchiaio nevadillo blanco and villalonga and two local cultivars arauco and selección mendoza trentacoste and puertas 2011 three different watering regimes were assigned to four plants per cultivar in the control irrigation ci regime plants were irrigated to replace evapotranspiration loss the amount of water evapotranspired was calculated once per week weighing one pot per cultivar for two consecutive days next the average daily weight difference across cultivars was applied during the rest of the week sustained deficit irrigation sdi was restricted to 35 of the control amount in both ci and sdi irrigation was performed daily cyclic deficit irrigation cdi was restricted to 35 of the control amount but irrigation was applied on one day each event approximately 30days apart exposing plants to five cycles of water deficit rewatering during the experiment the plants under cdi and sdi received the same amount of water but with a different frequency the contrasting watering regimes were maintained from september 2015 to april 2016 after which all treatments were irrigated with the same amount of water as the control treatment until november 2016 average maximum absolute and minimum absolute temperatures from september 2015 to april 2016 were 23 7 c 41 5 c and 2 0 c respectively before the experiment the water retention characteristics of the soil substrate were determined for two additional pots under the same experimental conditions these pots were irrigated to excess and allowed to drain until they achieved constant weight in cdi treatment the end of irrigation withholding cycles was determined when water applied and accumulated in sdi treatment by pots achieved the maximum storable water during the experiment soil water content was monitored by a 10cm long capacitance sensor ec 5 decagon pullman wa inserted vertically into the middle of one pot per treatment only in arbequina fig 1 since there were only three sensors available 2 2 plant water status and stomatal conductance midday stem water potential swp was measured in all irrigation treatments and cultivars one day before and after irrigation in the cdi treatment midday swp was measured on sunny days between 11 30h and 12 30h solar time using a scholander type pressure chamber biocontrol buenos aires argentina one leaf per plant was sampled following the procedure outlined by mccutchan and shackel 1992 mature leaves were enclosed in a small plastic bag covered with aluminium foil at least 90min before measurements as olive leaf petioles are too short to allow measurements with a pressure chamber approximately 1cm of leaf lamina on each side of the petiole was cut with a sharp blade and then immediately placed inside the chamber stomatal conductance gs was measured the same days as swp measurements measurements of abaxial stomatal conductance were taken from two fully expanded leaves per

circumference was measured at 20cm from the ground together with shoot length fifteen mature leaves from each pot were gathered on current year shoots from each pot in april 2016 the leaf area la of those leaves was estimated taking photographs and subsequently using the program imagej national institute of health usa http imagej nih gov ij then the leaves were oven dried at 60 c for 48h and their dry weight ldw determined specific leaf area sla la ldw in m2 kg 1 was estimated plant leaf area was estimated in april 2016 as the product between total leaves per plant and average leaf area spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr was measured in four leaves from each pot on november 18th 2015 beginning of cycle 2 when the leaves of the current season were well developed and march 21st 2016 at the end of cycle 5 in recording scmr care was taken to ensure that the spad hansatech model cl 01 uk meter sensor fully covered the leaf lamina average scmr was calculated as the mean of two evaluation times 2 4 inflorescence density the effect of water regime on the following season was evaluated on return bloom during the winter of 2016 length and node number was recorded on four shoots selected in the previous season for each pot the number of inflorescences in the four selected shoots was counted in october 2016 afterwards inflorescence density was determined by dividing the number of inflorescences on each shoot by their length 2 5 data analysis the factorial combination of three water regimes and seven cultivars was arranged in a completely randomized design with four replicates i e 84 pots anova was used to test the effect of cultivar water regime and their interaction on response variables and means were separated using the dgc test di rienzo et al 2002 statistical analyses were performed using the infostat 1 5 program regression analysis was applied to study the relationships between sla and scmr and stem water potential stomatal conductance and

stem water potential fig 1 shows the seasonal pattern of soil water content swc in three irrigation regime treatments of arbequina in control irrigation ci the seasonal pattern of scw tended to be maintained around 0 22m3 m 3 over the experimental period during the experiment irrigation for all treatments was occasionally interrupted due to power cuts on these days the control treatment swc dropped near to 0 1m3 m 3 but it increased rapidly when irrigation was restored in sustained deficit irrigation sdi swc values were almost constant around 0 14m3 m 3 in october and november after which they declined fluctuating around 0 12 and 0 08m3m 3 until mid march in cyclic deficit irrigation cdi irrigation increased swc up to values even higher than the control treatment but then dropped sharply the first seven days after irrigation remaining low at around 0 01m3 m 3 until a new irrigation event occurred in cdi the first second and fourth cycle lasted four weeks during which irrigation was completely stopped the third cycle lasted five weeks while the fifth cycle was shorter and lasted three weeks average midday swp through the experiment revealed a significant interaction between cultivars and irrigation regime p 0 01 fig 2 a stem water potential under well irrigated conditions remained almost constant around 1 3mpa which was similar for the seven cultivars fig 2 under the sdi treatment the swp pattern exhibited a similar trend in all cultivars swp decreased during the first two months reaching minimum values in december swp ranged from 2 8 to 3 7mpa then swp increased fluctuating between values of 1 1 and 2 3mpa among cultivars arbequina and nevadillo blanco showed a significantly lower average swp over the season than arauco morchiaio and villalonga while selección and changlot showed intermediate values in all cultivars average midday swp under sdi was significantly lower than under ci fig 2a under cdi swp dropped sharply during drought periods and tended to recover to the level of the control well irrigated plants and this was similar in all cultivars during the drought period swp varied from 2 0 to 3 0mpa in the two first drought cycles and from 4 0 to 6 0mpa in the last three cycles with minimum values of 8mpa in arauco and changlot cultivars changlot and arbequina showed a significantly lower average swp over the season than villalonga while the other cultivars showed intermediate values in all cultivars the average midday swp under cdi decreased significantly compared to sdi and ci fig 2a 3 2 stomatal

relative gs pattern was similar to control irrigation at the beginning of the experiment afterwards relative gs declined and remained 40 to 50 lower than ci until february march when stomatal conductance increased to the level of ci similar in all cultivars under cdi differential recovery levels of relative gs with intermittent cycles of drought rewatering among cultivars were observed 1 relative gs increased to the level of ci in the five cycles of drought re watering for morchiaio 2 relative gs increased to the level of ci or occasionally higher than ci when pots were re watered in four cycles for arauco nevadillo blanco and changlot 3 relative gs increased to the level of ci in three cycles for selección mendoza and villalonga and 4 relative gs was similar to ci after

while changlot 46mmolm 2 s 1 showed a lower average gs value than the rest of the cultivars fig 3a 3 3 vegetative growth and leaf morphological characteristics shoot growth and increase in trunk circumference did not respond to the interaction between cultivars and water regime hence the effects of each factor were studied individually table 1 villalonga nevadillo blanco morchiaio changlot arauco and selección mendoza showed significantly higher shoot growth over the experimental period than arbequina total increment of trunk circumference showed a similar pattern among cultivars although the differences were more evident villalonga changlot morchiaio and arauco cultivars had a significantly higher increase in trunk circumference nevadillo blanco and selección had an intermediate trunk increase and arbequina had the smallest increase in trunk circumference of all cultivars plants under sdi and cdi showed similar shoot length but significantly lower than ci shoot length under sdi and cdi was reduced by 45 and 55 respectively compared to ci the increase in trunk circumference was significantly reduced under sdi 28 and cdi 50 than ci while plants under cdi showed remarkably lower trunk circumference increase than sdi by 31 the interaction between cultivars and water regimes was not statistically significant for plant leaf area leaf area sla and scmr table 1 therefore the effects of each factor are discussed separately across water regimes leaf area and plant leaf area varied among cultivars while sla did not vary leaf area was significantly higher in villalonga than in the rest of cultivars arauco and selección mendoza showed higher leaf area than changlot nevadillo blanco morchiaio and arbequina cultivars plant leaf area was highest in selección mendoza villalonga nevadillo blanco arauco changlot and morchiaio cultivars while arbequina showed the lowest values across cultivars plant leaf area was reduced by both sdi and cdi treatments by 27 and 36 in comparison to ci leaf area expansion was reduced by 20 in plants under cdi with respect to ci while sdi regime did not affect leaf area in comparison with ci similarly specific leaf area sla was reduced by 25 in cdi over ci sla was similar between plants under sdi and ci treatments average scmr values were highest in changlot arauco villalonga and nevadillo blanco cultivars while morchiaio arbequina and selección mendoza showed the lowest values scmr was 1 3 and 1 6 times greater under sdi and cdi than under ci respectively while plants under cdi showed 1 3 times greater scmr than under sdi amongst the well irrigated and water deficit regime plants the increase in specific leaf area was positive and linearly related to average stem water potential r2 0

conductance r2 0 52 p 0 001 fig 4e and increase in trunk circumference r2 0 25 p 0 02 fig 4f decreased linearly with the increase in scmr sla and scmr were closely and negatively related r2 0 62 p 0 001 fig 4g arbequina showed a particular response i e a narrow variation in sla and scmr and a marked variation in swp fig 4a and d gs fig 4b and e and trunk circumference increase fig 4c and f as a result of contrasting water regimes 3 4 inflorescence density the number of inflorescences per centimeter of shoot chosen during the experimental season water regime and measured during the following season did not respond to the interaction between cultivars and water regime table 1 inflorescence density was significantly different among cultivars arbequina and selección mendoza showed the highest inflorescence density 0 47 inflorescences on average per cm of shoot followed by morchiaio nevadillo blanco and arauco 0 24 inflorescences per cm of shoot while the lowest inflorescence density was observed in villalonga and changlot 0 01 inflorescences on average per cm of shoot both water deficit regimes sdi and cdi had 2 3 times greater inflorescence density than well irrigated plants inflorescence density was negative and slightly related to the node number r2 0 44 p 0 006 formed in the previous season when water treatments were applied fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 stem water potential and stomatal conductance the pattern and average values of midday swp an indicator of plant water status widely used in olive plants trentacoste et al 2015 were similar for the seven well irrigated cultivars confirming the low genetic variability of swp under well watered conditions previously observed in olive cultivars by tugendhaft et al 2016 the exposure to water deficit regimes however led to a differential response of midday swp among cultivars similar to those reported in previous studies bacelar et al 2006 boughalleb and hajlaoui 2011 lo bianco and scalisi 2017 in these studies olive cultivars were mainly compared under various levels of sustained deficit irrigation but not under multiples cycles of drought with intermittent recovery during the growth season abdallah et al 2017 here the amount of water applied in both sdi and cdi regimes was similar however in terms of average swp the cultivars under cdi regimes were exposed to higher deficit conditions than those under sdi all cultivars reaching average minimum values of swp within a range of 4 to 6mpa and a rapid recovery of water status after resumption of full irrigation at values similar to control plants in olive trees have been reported water potentials as low as 8mpa keeping a rapid recovery capacity after rehydration boughalleb and hajlaoui 2011 giorio et al 1999 guerfel et al 2009 similarly ennajeh et al 2008 observed that a water potential of around 6mpa was not enough to generate a significant reduction of hydraulic conductivity in olive cultivars among cultivars during sdi and cdi regimes villalonga maintained the highest average swp and arbequina and nevadillo blanco cultivars showed the lowest average swp under sdi while arbequina and changlot showed the lowest swp under cd bacelar et al 2009 compared five adult olive cultivars including arbequina under field experimental conditions with low water availability the authors found that arbequina had the lowest predawn and midday swp compared to the rest of cultivars associated with the low cell wall elasticity of arbequina leaves average abaxial stomatal conductance ranged between 50 and 400mmolm2 s 1 higher than those previously reported in an experiment conducted on arbequina in mendoza field conditions trentacoste et al 2011 this may be due to the fact that the current experiment was conducted under plastic netting inside a tunnel structure where plants were exposed to higher relative humidity and lower wind speed i e low deficit pressure vapor which is associated to an increase in stomatal conductance similar to that observed by tugendhaft et al 2016 cultivars differences in stomatal conductance were observed under well irrigated conditions where arbequina tended to have higher gs than the rest of cultivars the reduction of the plant water status under sdi induced a non significant decrease in stomatal conductance in arauco in contrast to a significant reduction of gs in the rest of cultivars under cdi regardless the cultivar the full recovery of stem water potential was probably due to the partial recovery of stomatal conductance previously descripted in olive trees by xiloyannis et al 1997 the slow recovery of gs after the restoration of plant water status is not yet clear in olive trees torres ruiz et al 2015 in this study some level of genetic variation in gas exchange recovery to water deficit suggests an intraspecific variability of stomatal response to drought chartzoulakis et al 1999 tognetti et al 2002 arauco and villalonga under sdi and nevadillo blanco under cdi had a lower grade of gs variation compared to the control regime and a larger capacity for recovering stomatal conductance changlot showed reduced swp and gs under cdi with a marked ability to recover plant water status rapidly in comparison arbequina maintained higher gs under both well watered and water deficit regimes leading to the lowest values of swp a high grade of gs depressed in sdi and cdi and a lower ability to gs recovery after irrigation under cdi thus arauco villalonga nevadillo blanco and changlot cultivars appear to employ a conservative strategy in water use in contrast to arbequina which uses a non conservative strategy this coincides with the findings of torres ruiz et al 2015 in arbequina who reported a complete and rapid recovery of water potential but not of stomatal conductance in plants exposed to cycles of water deficit followed by water recovery 4 2 vegetative growth and leaf morphology it is well established in olive plants that vegetative growth depends on the amount of water used all cultivars reduced vegetative growth when irrigation was restricted trunk growth was more sensitive than shoot growth as found in previous works livellara et al 2011 thus trunk growth has been proposed as a good estimator of olive plant water status fernández et al 2011 across water regimes villalonga changlot arauco and morchiaio cultivars showed both higher trunk and shoot growth in contrast with the lower vigor of arbequina total leaf area was sharply reduced in all cultivars in both restrictive water regimes with respect to well watered plants lower plant leaf area in sdi was mainly explained by a combination of lower leaf production over the growing season and or the shedding of older leaves under cdi reduced leaf plant area was a result of the loss of leaves lower leaf production and additionally a reduced expansion of younger leaves table 1 the decrease in total leaf area and consequently of whole plant transpiration has been described in olive trees as common drought response connor 2005 comparing cultivars arbequina presented the smallest area per leaf and whole plant which could prevent even more marked plant water status decrease in water deficit conditions similar to those observed by bacelar et al 2004 in contrast villalonga showed both greatest area per leaf and plant also had higher vegetative growth table 1 these traits could confer greater susceptibility to drought bacelar et al 2004 4 3 inflorescence density a single relationship between inflorescence density and node number per shoot fig 5 showed that low vigor cultivars or water deficit promoted early bearing grattan et al 2006 arbequina was the most precocious cultivar while changlot and villalonga were the most delayed in addition our results suggest that cultivar with non reproductive development changes such as changlot provided fitness benefits in dry environments possible explanations for this apparent behavior need further research in adult trees but they could be related to lower stomatal conductance with the subsequent improvement in efficient water use observed in changlot during reproductive bud formation in contrast to arbequina 4 4 relationships between sla and scmr with physiological plant traits analysis of variance confirmed that 1 specific leaf area was the most stable trait among cultivars growing under broad water regime conditions ennajeh et al 2010 guerfel et al 2009 and that 2 there was a significant decrease of sla in response to the shortage of water applied previously it had been widely observed in olive plants that sla is reduced under drought conditions which provides fitness benefits in dry environments bacelar et al 2006 ennajeh et al 2010 guerfel et al 2009 scmr was influenced by genotype and proved to be more responsive to plant water status than sla across cultivars scmr increased significantly from ci to sdi and cdi consistent with previous studies on peanuts nigam and aruna 2008 this is the first quantitative report in olive trees to demonstrate a single negative and close correlation between sla and scmr using a contrasting range of cultivars and water regimes fig 4g in previous studies in grain crops this close relationship between sla and scmr was reported under different water regimes nigam and aruna 2008 upadhyaya 2005 where both parameters were used in selecting genotypes for more drought prone environments scmr had a closer association than sla with plant water status and vegetative growth traits such as midday swp stomatal conductance and trunk growth whereas scmr had higher genotype variability compared with sla thus scmr could be a valuable tool for screening of large number of olive genotypes under contrasting environments changlot arauco and nevadillo blanco cultivars maintained lower sla and higher scmr under drought conditions and consequently should have greater water use efficiency in drought prone environments puangbut et al 2009 arbequina exhibited more stability in sla scmr and vegetative growth traits to tackle reduction in water availability this could be evidence of a low plastic response caruso et al 2006 nicotra and davidson 2010 similar to bacelar et al 2009 who found that arbequina showed a low capacity to acclimate to drought conditions acknowledgements we thank walter galarza adriana banco facundo calderón and cecilia sánchez inta

1 introduction in argentina olive cultivation has expanded considerably since the 1990s to reach approximately 100 000ha sagpya 2010 currently this is the second most widely planted fruit crop in argentina after vineyards and it is key to the economy of the provinces of mendoza san juan la rioja and catamarca more than 95 of olive plantations are located in arid and semi arid environments between latitudes 28 s and 40 s having annual rainfall ranging from 100 to 500mm concentrated during the summer months gómez del campo et al 2010 consequently irrigation throughout the growing season mainly spring and autumn is essential for profitable yield and quality rousseaux et al 2009 trentacoste et al 2015 water is actually the most limiting factor to both olive production and area expansion in the coming years lower water availability and higher costs are expected due to competition among different uses industrial urbanization recreation etc fereres and evans 2006 at present many agronomic interventions are available in argentinian olive orchards to increase irrigation technology and water use efficiency however the evaluation of olive cultivars under water deficit conditions commonly known as drought could be the best strategy to cope with water availability uncertainty rousseaux et al 2009 ruane et al 2008 the olive is widely considered to be well adapted to drought connor 2005 lo gullo and salleo 1988 a large number of morphological and physiological traits have been found to be related to drought adaptation such as restriction of water loss through modulation of stomatal closure sofo et al 2008 development of osmotic adjustment dichio et al 2003 higher water potential gradient between canopy and root system chartzoulakis et al 1999 xiloyannis et

better adapted to drought conditions reveal smaller leaf area lower specific leaf area and leaf water potential lower stomatal conductance and stem growth under drought compared to well irrigated conditions bacelar et al 2006 bosabalidis and kofidis 2002 ennajeh et al 2010 tugendhaft et al 2016 most studies on olive trees focus on leaf traits because i leaves are the first organs to show visible morphological and physiological signs of drought and ii there is a tendency for studies to be conducted on young non producing plants however an integrated view of olive cultivar response to water deficit should include reproductive traits such as return bloom gucci et al 2007 among leaf traits specific leaf area sla ratio between leaf area and leaf dry weight and spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr have been investigated in a wide range of annual species such as peanut puangbut et al 2009 songsri et al 2009 cowpea anyia 2004 wheat fotovat et al 2007 and trees aspelmeier and leuschner 2006 as a useful selection criteria of genotypes to drought conditions leaf water content is the most important factor to determine sla which is related to both leaf thickness and tissue density meziane and shipley 1999 sla is generally lower in genotypes adapted to more drought prone environments rieger et al 2003 because leaf expansion is generally more sensitive than photosynthesis when plant water potential decreases tardieu et al 1999 in olive cultivars lower sla in leaves developed under water deficit has been related to an increase in leaf tissue density bacelar et al 2006 boughalleb and hajlaoui 2011 scmr is an indicator of the light transmittance characteristics of the leaf which is dependent on the leaf chlorophyll content richardson et al 2002 a reduction of the relative water content of leaves causes an increase in scmr martínez and guiamet 2004 sla is negatively and closely correlated to water use efficiency while scmr and water use efficiency are positively related songsri et al 2009 in this context in annual species it has been hypothesized that genotypes with high scmr and low sla have more photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area and hence potential for greater assimilation under water stress nigam and aruna 2008 puangbut et al 2009 olive cultivar response to drought can vary in relation to the severity and duration of water deficit boussadia et al 2008 in mendoza the target region for the present work two future drought patterns are probable in relation to the irrigation technology used by farmers i sustained deficit irrigation applied by modern farmers utilizing reservoirs and drip irrigation and ii cycles of drought and posterior rewatering by traditional farmers using surface irrigation and without reservoirs

enabled to recover the main physiological processes after severe water deficit angelopoulos et al 1996 the aims of this work were i to evaluate the response of five foreign and two local olive cultivars under sustained deficit and cyclic drought alleviated conditions on morphological and physiological traits at leaf level and vegetative growth and inflorescence density at plant level and ii to investigate the relationships between specific leaf area and scmr with physiological parameters stem water potential stomatal conductance and plant growth in a wide range of olive cultivars and water conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and watering regimes the study was carried out from september 2015 to november 2016 at the experimental farm of inta junín 33 06 s 68 29 w 653 masl one year old olive trees were transplanted in 40l plastic pots 1 per pot in the spring of 2013 two years before initiating the experiment the pots were filled with a mixture of sandy soil and peat 4 1 v v pots were made from black plastic covered with aluminium foil in order to avoid soil evaporation minimize container temperature and exclude the entrance of rain plants were well irrigated and fertilized before starting the experiment the pots were kept on the field under plastic netting of high transmittance 75 to avoid hail damage and to prevent changes in microclimatic conditions seven olive cultivars were evaluated including five foreign cultivars arbequina changlot morchiaio nevadillo blanco and villalonga and two local cultivars arauco and selección mendoza trentacoste and puertas 2011 three different watering regimes were assigned to four plants per cultivar in the control irrigation ci regime plants were irrigated to replace evapotranspiration loss the amount of water evapotranspired was calculated once per week weighing one pot per cultivar for two consecutive days next the average daily weight difference across cultivars was applied during the rest of the week sustained deficit irrigation sdi was restricted to 35 of the control amount in both ci and sdi irrigation was performed daily cyclic deficit irrigation cdi was restricted to 35 of the control amount but irrigation was applied on one day each event approximately 30days apart exposing plants to five cycles of water deficit rewatering during the experiment the plants under cdi and sdi received the same amount of water but with a different frequency the contrasting watering regimes were maintained from september 2015 to april 2016 after which all treatments were irrigated with the same amount of water as the control treatment until november 2016 average maximum absolute and minimum absolute temperatures from september 2015 to april 2016 were 23 7 c 41 5 c and 2 0 c respectively before the experiment the water retention characteristics of the soil substrate were determined for two additional pots under the same experimental conditions these pots were irrigated to excess and allowed to drain until they achieved constant weight in cdi treatment the end of irrigation withholding cycles was determined when water applied and accumulated in sdi treatment by pots achieved the maximum storable water during the experiment soil water content was monitored by a 10cm long capacitance sensor ec 5 decagon pullman wa inserted vertically into the middle of one pot per treatment only in arbequina fig 1 since there were only three sensors available 2 2 plant water status and stomatal conductance midday stem water potential swp was measured in all irrigation treatments and cultivars one day before and after irrigation in the cdi treatment midday swp was measured on sunny days between 11 30h and 12 30h solar time using a scholander type pressure chamber biocontrol buenos aires argentina one leaf per plant was sampled following the procedure outlined by mccutchan and shackel 1992 mature leaves were enclosed in a small plastic bag covered with aluminium foil at least 90min before measurements as olive leaf petioles are too short to allow measurements with a pressure chamber approximately 1cm of leaf lamina on each side of the petiole was cut with a sharp blade and then immediately placed inside the chamber stomatal conductance gs was measured the same days as swp measurements measurements of abaxial stomatal conductance were taken from two fully expanded leaves per plant during mid morning 10 00 11 30h using a steady state porometer decagon device sc 1 usa 2 3 vegetative growth and morphological leaf traits in winter 2015 before budburst four one year old shoots

circumference was measured at 20cm from the ground together with shoot length fifteen mature leaves from each pot were gathered on current year shoots from each pot in april 2016 the leaf area la of those leaves was estimated taking photographs and subsequently using the program imagej national institute of health usa http imagej nih gov ij then the leaves were oven dried at 60 c for 48h and their dry weight ldw determined specific leaf area sla la ldw in m2 kg 1 was estimated plant leaf area was estimated in april 2016 as the product between total leaves per plant and average leaf area spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr was measured in four leaves from each pot on november 18th 2015 beginning of cycle 2 when the leaves of the current season were well developed and march 21st 2016 at the end of cycle 5 in recording scmr care was taken to ensure that the spad hansatech model cl 01 uk meter sensor fully covered the leaf lamina average scmr was calculated as the mean of two evaluation times 2 4 inflorescence density the effect of water regime on the following season was evaluated on return bloom during the winter of 2016 length and node number was recorded on four shoots selected in the previous season for each pot the number of inflorescences in the four selected shoots was counted in october 2016 afterwards inflorescence density was determined by dividing the number of inflorescences on each shoot by their length 2 5 data analysis the factorial combination of three water regimes and seven cultivars was arranged in a completely randomized design with four replicates i e 84 pots anova was used to test the effect of cultivar water regime and their interaction on response variables and means were separated using the dgc test di rienzo et al 2002 statistical analyses were performed using the infostat 1 5 program regression analysis was applied to study the relationships between sla and scmr and stem water potential stomatal conductance and increase in trunk circumference these analyses and the resulting plots were made using graphpad prism version 5 01 software graphpad prism software california usa 3 results 3 1 soil water content and stem water potential fig 1 shows the seasonal pattern of soil water content swc in three irrigation regime treatments of arbequina in control irrigation ci the seasonal pattern of scw tended to be maintained around 0 22m3 m 3 over the experimental period during the experiment irrigation for all treatments was occasionally interrupted due to power cuts on these days the control treatment swc dropped near to 0 1m3 m 3 but it increased rapidly when irrigation was restored in sustained deficit irrigation sdi swc values were almost constant around 0 14m3 m 3 in october and november after which they declined fluctuating around 0 12 and 0 08m3m 3 until mid march in cyclic deficit irrigation cdi irrigation increased swc up to values even higher than the control treatment but then dropped sharply the first seven days after irrigation remaining low at around 0 01m3 m 3 until a new irrigation event occurred in cdi the first second and fourth cycle lasted four weeks during which irrigation was completely stopped the third cycle lasted five weeks while the fifth cycle was shorter and lasted three weeks average midday swp through the experiment revealed a significant interaction between cultivars and irrigation regime p 0 01 fig 2 a stem water potential under well irrigated conditions remained almost constant around 1 3mpa which was similar for the seven cultivars fig 2 under the sdi treatment the swp pattern exhibited a similar trend in all cultivars swp decreased during the first two months reaching minimum values in december swp ranged from 2 8 to 3 7mpa then swp increased fluctuating between values of 1 1 and 2 3mpa among cultivars arbequina and nevadillo blanco showed a significantly lower average swp over the season than arauco morchiaio and villalonga while selección and changlot showed intermediate values in all cultivars average midday swp under sdi was significantly lower than under ci fig 2a under cdi swp dropped sharply during drought periods and tended to recover to the level of the control well irrigated plants and this was similar in all cultivars during the drought period swp varied from 2 0 to 3 0mpa in the two first drought cycles and from 4 0 to 6 0mpa in the last three cycles with minimum values of 8mpa in arauco and changlot cultivars changlot and arbequina showed a significantly lower average swp over the season than villalonga while the other cultivars showed intermediate values in all cultivars the average midday swp under cdi decreased significantly compared to sdi and ci fig 2a 3 2 stomatal conductance in fig 3 stomatal conductance patterns under sdi and cdi are shown as proportions of values reached in ci which was assigned a value of 1 in each cultivar and measurement date under sdi relative gs pattern was similar to control irrigation at the beginning of the experiment afterwards relative gs declined and remained 40 to 50 lower than ci until february march when stomatal conductance increased to the level of ci similar in all cultivars under cdi differential recovery levels of relative gs with intermittent cycles of drought rewatering among cultivars were observed 1 relative gs increased to the level of ci in the five cycles of drought re watering for morchiaio 2 relative gs increased to the level of ci or occasionally higher than ci when pots were re watered in four cycles for arauco nevadillo blanco and changlot 3 relative gs increased to the level of ci in three cycles for selección mendoza and villalonga and 4 relative gs was similar to ci after rewatering in two cycles for arbequina average gs in the experiment revealed a significant interaction between cultivars and irrigation regime p 0 001 fig 3a average gs under well irrigated conditions

arauco and selección mendoza showed significantly higher shoot growth over the experimental period than arbequina total increment of trunk circumference showed a similar pattern among cultivars although the differences were more evident villalonga changlot morchiaio and arauco cultivars had a significantly higher increase in trunk circumference nevadillo blanco and selección had an intermediate trunk increase and arbequina had the smallest increase in trunk circumference of all cultivars plants under sdi and cdi showed similar shoot length but significantly lower than ci shoot length under sdi and cdi was reduced by 45 and 55 respectively compared to ci the increase in trunk circumference was significantly reduced under sdi 28 and cdi 50 than ci while plants under cdi showed remarkably lower trunk circumference increase than sdi by 31 the interaction between cultivars and water regimes was not statistically significant for plant leaf area leaf area sla and scmr table 1 therefore the effects of each factor are discussed separately across water regimes leaf area and plant leaf area varied among cultivars while sla did not vary leaf area was significantly

selección mendoza villalonga nevadillo blanco arauco changlot and morchiaio cultivars while arbequina showed the lowest values across cultivars plant leaf area was reduced by both sdi and cdi treatments by 27 and 36 in comparison to ci leaf area expansion was reduced by 20 in plants under cdi with respect to ci while sdi regime did not affect leaf area in comparison with ci similarly specific leaf area sla was reduced by 25 in cdi over ci sla was similar between plants under sdi and ci treatments average scmr values were highest in changlot arauco villalonga and nevadillo blanco

result of contrasting water regimes 3 4 inflorescence density the number of inflorescences per centimeter of shoot chosen during the experimental season water regime and measured during the following season did not respond to the interaction between cultivars and water regime table 1 inflorescence density was significantly different among cultivars arbequina and selección mendoza showed the highest inflorescence density 0 47 inflorescences on average per cm of shoot followed by morchiaio nevadillo blanco and arauco 0 24 inflorescences per cm of shoot while the lowest inflorescence density was observed in villalonga and changlot 0 01 inflorescences on average per cm of shoot both water deficit regimes sdi and cdi had 2 3 times greater inflorescence density than well irrigated

potential and stomatal conductance the pattern and average values of midday swp an indicator of plant water status widely used in olive plants trentacoste et al 2015 were similar for the seven well irrigated cultivars confirming the low genetic variability of swp under well watered conditions previously observed in olive cultivars by tugendhaft et al 2016 the exposure to water deficit regimes however led to a differential response of midday swp among cultivars similar to those reported in previous studies bacelar et al 2006 boughalleb and hajlaoui 2011 lo bianco and scalisi 2017 in these studies olive cultivars were mainly compared under various levels of sustained deficit irrigation but not under multiples cycles of drought with intermittent recovery during the growth season abdallah et al 2017 here the amount of water applied in both sdi and cdi regimes was similar however in terms of average swp the cultivars under cdi regimes were exposed to higher deficit conditions than those under sdi all cultivars reaching average minimum values of swp within a range of 4 to 6mpa and a rapid recovery of water status after resumption of full irrigation at values similar to control plants in olive trees have been reported water potentials as low as 8mpa keeping a rapid recovery capacity after rehydration boughalleb and hajlaoui 2011 giorio et al 1999 guerfel et al 2009 similarly ennajeh et al 2008 observed that a water potential of around 6mpa was not enough to generate a significant reduction of hydraulic conductivity in olive cultivars among cultivars during sdi and cdi regimes villalonga maintained the highest average swp and arbequina and nevadillo blanco cultivars showed the lowest average swp under sdi while arbequina and changlot showed the lowest swp under cd bacelar et al 2009 compared five adult olive cultivars including arbequina under field experimental conditions with low water availability the authors found that arbequina had the lowest predawn and midday swp compared to the rest of cultivars associated with the low cell wall elasticity of arbequina leaves average abaxial stomatal conductance ranged between 50 and 400mmolm2 s 1 higher than those previously reported in an experiment conducted on arbequina in mendoza field conditions trentacoste et al 2011 this may be due to the fact that the current experiment was conducted under plastic netting inside a tunnel structure where plants were exposed to higher relative humidity and lower wind speed i e low deficit pressure vapor which is associated to an increase in stomatal conductance similar to that observed by tugendhaft et al 2016 cultivars differences in stomatal conductance were observed under well irrigated conditions where arbequina tended to have higher gs than the rest of cultivars the reduction of the plant water status under sdi induced a non significant decrease in stomatal conductance in arauco in contrast to a significant reduction of gs in the rest of cultivars under cdi regardless the cultivar the full recovery of stem water potential was probably due to the partial recovery of stomatal conductance previously descripted in olive trees by xiloyannis et al 1997 the slow recovery of gs after the restoration of plant water status is not yet clear in olive trees torres ruiz et al 2015 in this study some level of genetic variation in gas exchange recovery to water deficit suggests an intraspecific variability of stomatal response to drought chartzoulakis et al 1999 tognetti et al 2002 arauco and villalonga under sdi and nevadillo blanco under cdi had a lower grade of gs variation compared to the control regime and a larger capacity for recovering stomatal conductance changlot showed reduced swp and gs under cdi with a marked ability to recover plant water status rapidly in comparison arbequina maintained higher gs under both well watered and water deficit regimes leading to the lowest values of swp a high grade of gs depressed in sdi and cdi and a lower ability to gs recovery after irrigation under cdi thus arauco villalonga nevadillo blanco and changlot cultivars appear to employ a conservative strategy in water use in contrast to arbequina which uses a non conservative strategy this coincides with the findings of torres ruiz et al 2015 in arbequina who reported a complete and rapid recovery of water potential but not of stomatal conductance in plants exposed to cycles of water deficit followed by water recovery 4 2 vegetative growth and leaf morphology it is well established in olive plants that vegetative growth depends on the amount of water used all cultivars reduced vegetative growth when irrigation was restricted trunk growth was more sensitive than shoot growth as found in previous works livellara et al 2011 thus trunk growth has been proposed as a good estimator of olive plant water status fernández et al 2011 across water regimes villalonga changlot arauco and morchiaio cultivars showed both higher trunk and shoot growth in contrast with the lower vigor of arbequina total leaf area was sharply reduced in all cultivars in both restrictive water regimes with respect to well watered plants lower plant leaf area in sdi was mainly explained by a combination of lower leaf production over the growing season and or the shedding of older leaves under cdi reduced leaf plant area was a result of the loss of leaves lower leaf production and additionally a reduced expansion of younger leaves table 1 the decrease in total leaf area and consequently of whole plant transpiration has been described in olive trees as common drought response connor 2005 comparing cultivars arbequina presented the smallest area per leaf and whole plant which could prevent even more marked plant water status decrease in water deficit conditions similar to those observed by bacelar et al 2004 in contrast villalonga showed both greatest area per leaf and plant also had higher vegetative growth table 1 these traits could confer greater susceptibility to drought bacelar et al 2004 4 3 inflorescence density a single relationship between inflorescence density and node number per shoot fig 5 showed that low vigor cultivars or water deficit promoted early bearing grattan et al 2006 arbequina was the most precocious cultivar while changlot and villalonga were the most delayed in addition our results suggest that cultivar with non reproductive development changes such as changlot provided fitness benefits in dry environments possible explanations for this apparent behavior need further research in adult trees but they could be related to lower stomatal conductance with the subsequent improvement in efficient water use observed in changlot during reproductive bud formation in contrast to arbequina 4 4 relationships between sla and scmr with physiological plant traits analysis of variance confirmed that 1 specific leaf area was the most stable trait among cultivars growing under broad water regime conditions ennajeh et al 2010 guerfel et al 2009 and that 2 there was a significant decrease of sla in response to the shortage of water applied previously it had been widely observed in olive plants that sla is reduced under drought conditions which provides fitness benefits in dry environments bacelar et al 2006 ennajeh et al 2010 guerfel et al 2009 scmr was influenced by genotype and proved to be more responsive to plant water status than sla across cultivars scmr increased significantly from ci to sdi and cdi consistent with previous studies on peanuts nigam and aruna 2008 this is the first quantitative report in olive trees to demonstrate a single negative and close correlation between sla and scmr using a contrasting range of cultivars and water regimes fig 4g in previous studies in grain crops this close relationship between sla and scmr was reported under different water regimes nigam and aruna 2008 upadhyaya 2005 where both parameters were used in selecting genotypes for more drought prone environments scmr had a closer association than sla with plant water status and vegetative growth traits such as midday swp stomatal conductance and trunk growth whereas scmr had higher genotype variability compared with sla thus scmr could be a valuable tool for screening of large number of olive genotypes under contrasting environments changlot arauco and nevadillo blanco cultivars maintained lower sla and higher scmr under drought conditions and consequently should have greater water use efficiency in drought prone environments puangbut et al 2009 arbequina exhibited more stability in sla scmr and vegetative growth traits to tackle reduction in water availability this could be evidence of a low plastic response caruso et al 2006 nicotra and davidson 2010 similar to bacelar et al 2009 who found that arbequina showed a low capacity to acclimate to drought conditions acknowledgements we thank walter galarza adriana banco facundo calderón and cecilia sánchez inta

11598,the degree of coupling to the environment of almond prunus dulcis orchards during periods of transient water stress was investigated in a two year study in california plant water status was monitored weekly before and or after irrigation measuring midday stem water potential ψstem that ranged from 0 5 to 2mpa while actual evapotranspiration eta was measured with an eddy covariance tower irrigation was applied weekly following common commercial practice resulting in weekly cycles of ψstem despite ψstem reaching levels shown to induce substantial stomatal closure the ratio actual to reference evapotranspiration eta eto ka did not show a decrease during weekly periods of low ψstem in the two years of the study midday average canopy surface resistance rcmid computed by reversing the penman monteith equation from eddy covariance et data yielded a statistically significant increase with a decrease in ψstem but just in the first year of the study however rcmid did not show a significant relationship with stomatal resistance measured at the leaf level with porometry and scaled up to the canopy level in the first year rcmid showed a sharp increase after harvest when ka also decreased perhaps produced by the composite effect of defoliation associated with harvest and stomatal closure associated with water stress during the growing season rcmid ranged from 0 to 100sm 1 and midday average aerodynamic resistance ramid ranged between 0 and 50sm 1 despite rcmid being generally larger than ra the midday average decoupling factor ω averaged 0 7 during the irrigation season indicating decoupled conditions however there was a large day to day fluctuation of midday ω ranging from 0 16 to 0 98 mostly associated with rcmid and wind speed this study indicated that tall and rough canopies can be relatively decoupled depending on the effect of wind speed and canopy resistance on the decoupling factor from a water management point of view this result suggests that inducing transient mild to moderate water stress may not produce substantial water savings in areas having low to moderate winds abbreviations cp air heat capacity at constant pressure ea air vapor pressure es

stem water potential 1 introduction almonds are the second largest crop of california by acreage with 328 thousand hectares 810 thousand acres estimated in 2013 and produced a value of 3 387 billion in 2012 almond board of california essentially all commercial almond orchards are irrigated making almonds the second largest crop of the state in terms of water use california department of water resources water stress occurs in commercial orchards as a result of water shortage but short periods of water stress can also be induced as a management tool to control vegetative growth reduce fungal diseases at hull split and facilitate harvest operations in a previous study spinelli 2016 we showed that a substantial reduction about 50 in both leaf level photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance occurs for the range of water status commonly observed in commercial orchards from 0 5 to 2mpa similar results were obtained by klein et al 2001 and shackel 2011 comparable reductions of stomatal conductance in association with water stress in almond trees have been shown using various measures of water availability such as the osmotic potential of a nutrient solution wartinger et al 1990 predawn leaf water potential rouhi et al 2007 and leaf water potential castel and fereres 1982 photosynthetic rates ultimately determine biomass accumulation and indirectly yield hence it can be argued that stomatal closure caused by periods of water stress may also reduce plant productivity the question is whether transpiration is also reduced as a result of stomatal closure and if irrigation water is saved the answer to this question lies in the sensitivity of transpiration to stomatal closure in the context of an entire canopy since transpiration is not only a function of stomatal conductance but also of the evaporative demand of the atmosphere the effect of environmental factors needs to be taken into account this is commonly achieved by calculating the actual crop coefficient ka the ratio of actual evapotranspiration eta and reference evapotranspiration eto the latter indicates the evapotranspiration of an unstressed grass field and hence is a composite measure of environmental factors two studies conducted on perennial crops planted in lysimeters johnson et al 2005 in peach williams et al 2012 in grapevines have shown a reduction of the ratio eta eto associated with a decreasing stem or leaf water potential as a result of stomatal closure however the use of the ratio eta eto is not devoid of problems especially in the case of tall trees because a tall canopy responds to environmental variables such as wind differently to grass and hence eto may not be the appropriate metric to make allowance for environmental variability annandale and stockle 1994 a more appropriate way to separate physiological from environmental effects on eta for tall canopies may be to solve the penman monteith big leaf model for canopy surface resistance 1 1 different authors use resistance or conductance to express the degree to which a particular segment of the transport pathway produces a flux in presence of a gradient but resistance and conductance are inversely related and their meaning is equivalent in this study we will use resistances because in a canopy the physiological and aerodynamic segments of the transport pathway are in series and thus the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances in this case the use of resistances is more informative about the relative contribution of each segment to the total transport path rc which is the variable under physiological control in the model and should show an increase associated with stomatal closure kelliher and leuning 1995 baldocchi et al 1991 nevertheless canopy resistance calculated using the big leaf model includes the effects of non physiological variables mostly aerodynamic and is affected by soil surface wetness baldocchi et al 1991 paw u and meyers 1989 kjelgaard and stockle 2001 other studies have shown that at high leaf area indexes canopy conductance is mostly a function of leaf area and it is not strongly affected by stomatal conductance steduto and hsiao 1998b the concept of coupling is an approach to describe the sensitivity of evapotranspiration to stomatal closure jarvis 1984 proposed a decoupling factor ω that mathematically describes the relative change in evapotranspiration for a given relative change in rc jones 1992 eq 5 29 coupling varies across scales a leaf being more coupled to the environment than a single plant and a plant being more coupled than a crop canopy jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 plants evolved adaptations to survive as individuals in a much more coupled environment than a full crop canopy which justifies the evolutionary effort of developing control mechanisms like stomatal regulation on transpiration it may not be surprising that such mechanisms are not as effective in a decoupled crop canopy jarvis 1985 however even considering a single leaf which is generally more coupled than a canopy a large decrease in stomatal conductance may result in a marginal reduction in transpiration depending on leaf boundary layer conditions bange 1953 forests tree canopies and tall and rough vegetation are generally considered more coupled than grass or agricultural crops with short vegetation since ω decreases with the relative importance of rc with respect to ra in other words a canopy gets more coupled as rc increases water stress and as ra decreases ra is always lower for a tall rough canopy than for a short smooth canopy and ra decreases as wind speed increases rana and katerji 1998 found that in tall sorghum canopies et depends strongly on rc especially when water stressed therefore in theory a water stressed almond canopy should be one of the most coupled agricultural crops the decoupling factor however should not be considered a fixed characteristic of a canopy because it is also dependent on wind speed through its effect on ra and on air temperature through the effect of temperature on δ the slope of the relationship between vapor pressure and temperature monteith and unsworth 1990 for instance kostner et al 1992 report a fourfold variation in the daily pattern of ω in a forest paw u and gao 1988 showed that the omega factor when derived from linear models such as the ω proposed by jarvis and mcnaughton can be in great error compared to quadratic or quartic solutions of the energy balance they show considerable discrepancies of the result between the two models especially when ω 0 8 and when net radiation is considered constant as surface temperature increases ω was also shown to be highly dependent on leaf area index lai by steduto and hsiao 1998b they found relatively high midday values of ω ranging from 0 4 to 0 8 in well watered and water stressed relatively tall 3m maize canopies in that study the observed high lai was the major determinant of the large ω only when senescence caused a drop in lai ω decreased and canopy resistance began to exert a significant effect on transpiration most of the decrease in canopy resistance was attributable to a drop in lai and only a minor component was due to stomatal closure the course of lai in an almond orchard is different than in field crops almonds leaf out very rapidly starting from march with complete canopy closure occurring early but vegetative growth continues until about the end of june thus lai is relatively constant during summer months and leaf senescence and abscission occurs in late fall however partial defoliation is common in california almond orchards as they approach harvest end of august and leaf abscission is intensified by the mechanical stress of tree shaking during harvest klein et al 2001 showed a close correlation between water stress and leaf abscission the objective of this study was investigating the following question is orchard water use reduced with reductions in almond tree water status in the field this question was developed into each step of the chain of processes leading stress related stomatal closure to reduce et namely a to what degree is canopy resistance increased when water stress causes stomatal closure b what is the relative sensitivity ω of evapotranspiration to canopy resistance c what environmental and physiological variables affect this sensitivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in 2009 and 2010 in a high yielding almond prunus dulcis d a webb orchard at the paramount farming company in lost hills ca n 35 30 37 w 119 40 3 the plot was a rectangular irrigation set of the following dimensions 256m east west and 790m north south the trees were 10 years old at the initiation of the study trees were planted at 6 4 7 9m spacing with north south row orientation the soil was classified as milham sandy loam average wind speed for the months may to august were 1 65ms 1 in 2009 and 1 68ms 1 in 2010 harvest dates were 21 aug 2009 and 27 aug 2010 during winter 2009 at the beginning of the 2010 season the orchard was mechanically hedged every row cutting a 1 2m swath down the middle of the drive the average interception of the entire orchard was 78 2 in 2009 and 79 8 in 2010 lampinen personal communication more defoliation was observed in the orchard in 2010 late in the season presumably due to reduced soil water availability as verified with the neutron probe in an attempt to reduce hull rot through partial deficit irrigation 2 2 irrigations the irrigation system consisted of two micro sprinklers per tree placed on the tree line at about 1m from the trees each applying a field measured 36lh 1 nominal 40lh 1 for bowsmith a40 over a 4 3m diameter the soil surface wetted by the irrigation system was limited to a weed free 3 5 4m wide band along the tree berm with alley space between the berms that was mowed and essentially weed free during the summer the orchard was irrigated weekly based primarily on soil moisture measurements neutron probes but also considering estimated et and stem water potential irrigation sets lasted 24 or 48h total irrigation applied plus precipitations for 2009 was 1497mm and in 2010 was 1418mm reference evapotranspiration was 1488mm in 2009 and 1377mm in 2010 2 3 water stress measurement midday stem water potential ψstem shackel et al 1997 was measured approximately weekly with a scholander pressure chamber soilmoisture equipment corp or pms instruments inc based on the irrigation schedule of the grower in some cases ψstem was measured directly following an irrigation and in other cases just prior to an irrigation in order to evaluate the range of plant water stress conditions prevalent in the orchard one or two fully expanded shaded leaves from the trunk or main scaffold were enclosed in opaque plastic bags covered with aluminum foil for a minimum 30min before the measurement fulton et al 2001 thirty trees that were evenly distributed within the orchard were measured in 2009 with thirty five trees measured in 2010 following the method proposed by mccutchan and shackel 1992 for prune an unstressed baseline was calculated from atmospheric vapor pressure deficit obtained for the period 12 00 to 15 00 from a cimis california irrigation management information system weather station located 3 km south west of the experiment 2 4 eddy covariance and crop coefficient flux measurements were performed with a tower located 90m from the southwestern corner of the plot the location of the tower was chosen due to the prevalence of west northwest winds in the area during the period may september instruments were installed 9m from the ground the canopy was 7 8m tall and there was a fetch of 220m which is adequate based on the assumption that the fetch should equal 50 times the sensor height above the zero plane displacement monteith and unsworth 1990 the plot was surrounded by almonds irrigated with similar irrigation regime and was not in a wind protected environment latent heat flux was calculated as a residual of the energy balance equation 1 l e r n g h where net radiation rn was measured

decagon ec5 sensible heat flux h was measured using eddy covariance and data from a sonic anemometer rm young inc 81000re the quality of the eddy covariance measurements of et was evaluated by comparison to independent et measurements obtained with the surface renewal method using data from high frequency temperature measured with a 76 2 micrometer diameter thermocouple campbell scientific inc fw3 hourly actual evapotranspiration eta was obtained by dividing the average hourly latent heat flux by the latent heat of vaporization l to take into account the environmental variability on eta the ratio between actual and reference evapotranspiration eta eto at midday midday ka was calculated eto was obtained from the nearby cimis california irrigation management information system california department of water resources station for the period between 12 00 and 15 00 cimis calculates eto from the asce standardized reference et equation allen et al 2006 the estimated almond crop coefficient ka was used as an estimate of the reduction in plant transpiration caused by physiological stress the seasonal course of ka for the same orchard and the two years of the study is reported in spinelli et al 2016 2 5 micrometeorology applying the big leaf model surface canopy resistance baldocchi et al 1991 was obtained using the penman monteith equation to calculate rc 2 r c δ r n g ρ c p e s t a e a r a l e δ γ r a γ where δ is the slope of the relationship between vapor pressure and temperature at air temperature rn is net radiation ρ is air density cp is air heat capacity at

cimis station γ is the psychrometric constant air temperature ta was measured in the orchard with thermocouples aerodynamic resistance ra was calculated from wind speed uz and friction velocity u using the equation given by monteith and unsworth 1990 3 r a u z u 2 however penman monteith s derivation contains a first order taylor linearization thus we expect this method to be inaccurate particularly when surface temperature departs substantially from air temperature a second method used to calculate rc was to solve the sensible heat equation for apparent aerodynamic surface temperature ts 4 t s t a h r a ρ c p subsequently using ts to obtain the saturation vapor pressure at big leaf temperature es ts the value obtained for es ts is then used in the latent heat flux density equation to solve for rc 5 r c ρ c p e s t s e a l e γ r a from hourly rc and ra midday rc rcmid and midday ra ramid were calculated as the average of hourly value for the period between 12 00 and 15 00 for the days when ψstem was measured the expected stomatal conductance of each tree for sunlit sun and shaded sh leaves was calculated using the relationships between stomatal conductance gs and ψstem shown in the work of spinelli et al 2016 subsequently stomatal conductance was scaled up to the canopy level using the average conductances of sunlight and shaded leaves weighted by the lai of each category of leaves as proposed by sinclair et al 1976 and leuning et al 1995 the inverse of scaled up canopy conductance was taken to obtain scaled up canopy resistance rs 6 r s 1 l a i s u n g s s u n l a i s h g s s h and averaged across trees to represent the whole orchard a mean lai 3 25 was obtained from zarate valdez et al 2012 study in the same orchard and was assumed constant from june to august to obtain the theoretical relationship between eta and rc the surface temperature ts was iterated in the following energy balance equation adapted from jones 1992 equations 5 2 5 17 5 20 and 5 22 and campbell and norman 1998 equation 14 1 7 r i ε σ t s 4 ρ c p e s t s e a γ r c r a ρ c p r a t s t a g where ri is input radiation the sum of absorbed shortwave radiation and incoming

saturated vapor pressure at surface temperature the right hand side of eq 7 is the sum of le h and g the following conditions ri 1200wm 2 ea 1400pa and ta 27 c were used in the iteration process to derive the theoretical relationship daytime g was assumed to be 10 of rn allen et al 1998 once ts was obtained the le was calculated from the flux equation using canopy resistance from 0 to 200sm 1 and three levels of aerodynamic resistance 5 30 and 100sm 1 the decoupling factor ω proposed by mcnaughton and jarvis 1983 was calculated as 8 ω δ γ δ γ 1 r c r a jones 1992 eq 5 29 shows that ω relates to the relative sensitivity of le to gs with the following relationship 9 1 ω d l e l e d g s g s similarly it can be shown that the decoupling factor can be used to calculate the relative sensitivity of le to rc 10 ω 1 d l e l e d r c r c d l e d r c r c l e the negative sign resulting from ω 1 denotes the inverse relationship of le and rc 3 results in 2009 the average ψstem of the orchard in a day ranged from 0 65mpa to 1 89mpa and in 2010 ranged from 0 48mpa to 2 19mpa table 1 the midday ka i e the ratio eta eto for the midseason may to september ranged from 0 92 to 1 69 in 2009 and from 0 78 to 1 36 in 2010 similar to the daily ka values reported in spinelli 2016 with a somewhat more limited range for the regression analysis shown in table 1 the relationship between midday stem water potential and actual crop coefficient calculated at midday 12 00 15 00 was non significant for both years fig 1 a b table 1 in 2009 there was a significant negative relationship between midday canopy resistance and ψstem fig 2 a table 1 in 2010 the relationship between midday canopy resistance and ψstem was also negative and significant p value 0 0053 but the relationship was strongly affected by one late season datapoint collected on sep 28th 2010 with an rcmid 292sm 1and ψstem 2mpa which may have been an outlier with this point removed the relationship was also negative and only significant at the 0 05 level p value 0 0273 fig 2b table 1 in 2009 the average midday 12 00 15 00 aerodynamic resistance ramid ranged between 9 and 175sm 1 average midday canopy resistance rcmid ranged between 35 and 201sm 1 fig 3 a in 2010 ramid ranged from 6 and 136sm 1and rcmid ranged from 32 to 292sm 1 in both years rcmid was generally higher than ramid although there were days when ramid was higher in 2010 rcmid showed a sharp increase during the last week of august fig 3b however in 2009 rcmid did not show similar pattern but it was generally higher at the end of the season in both years ψstem exhibited similar ranges and fluctuations over the season fig 3 and table 1 tree to tree variation on a particular day was similar to that shown for 2010 in spinelli 2016 fig 3 there was an inverse relationship between ramid and midday average wind speed the relationship was highly predictable above a wind speed of 1 5ms 1 but showed considerable scatter between 1 and 1 5ms 1 fig 4 however at every wind speed the observed ramid was substantially lower than the aerodynamic resistance calculated for grass with the method proposed by allen et al 1998 for both years there was no relationship between the midday observed canopy resistance from eddy covariance and the scaled up stomatal resistance rs expected for the average stem water potential of the orchard in each day of measurement midday canopy resistance averaged 84 5sm 1 in 2009 and 67 6sm 1 in 2010 scaled up stomatal resistance averaged 60 8sm 1 in 2009 and 68sm 1 in 2010 fig 5 latent heat flux measured by the tower ranged from 63wm 2 to 718wm 2 and showed a negative relationship with rcmid the modeled relationship between le and rcmid showed steeper slopes associated with low midday aerodynamic resistance and flatter slopes during high aerodynamic resistance days fig 6 however during low ramid windy days low canopy resistance was never observed being never lower than 35sm 1 when rcmid was lower than 50sm 1 for such days the theoretical model indicated values of le substantially above 700wm 2 s 1 for values of rcmid below about 40sm 1 fig 6 the seasonal course of midday average decoupling factor ω showed high day to day variability with values ranging from 0 26 to 0 96 dimensionless in 2009 and from 0 16 to 0 98 in 2010 values higher than 0 5 were observed for most of the midseason both in 2009 and in 2010 fig 7 in 2010ω showed relatively low values during two periods the beginning may and the end of the season late august september similar patterns were not observed in 2009 ω didn t show any association with ψstem not shown midday ω showed an inverse relationship with wind speed the relationship being dependent on canopy resistance fig 8 ω was higher at lower categories of rcmid however at wind speed above about 1 5ms 1 ω was always lower than about 0 4 the magnitude of rcmid not affecting ω greatly at any level of wind speed ω was lower than the ω calculated for grass from fao56 4 discussion 4 1 no relationship between ka and ψstem as reported previously spinelli 2016 ka showed very stable values during the may to september period in both years of the study in 2010 ka was generally lower than in 2009 this difference was associated to a lower canopy development due to pruning operations differential vegetative growth and a different degree of late season defoliation between the two years despite the clear relation of almond leaf conductance to ψstem across locations and years spinelli 2016 there was no relationship found between ka and ψstem this result is in contrast with what was found in grapes by williams et al 2012 and in peach by johnson et al 2005 during short dry down periods in lysimeters for dry down cycles of 5 and 10days williams showed that a substantial decrease in ka from 0 85 to 0 50 was linearly correlated with a decrease in leaf water potential from 0 65 to 1 3mpa similarly ka was linearly correlated with stomatal conductance indicating that the decrease in vine transpiration was triggered by the plant physiological response to water stress the leaf area index of the vines was not reported in the study however an estimate of 20m2 per vine was given the total area per vine in the vineyard was 7 55m2 williams et al 2003 yielding a lai 2 65 this value is lower than the 3 25 mean lai measured in the almond orchard where this study was conducted and may account for the higher sensitivity of et to stomatal closure observed in the lysimeter see section coupling to the environment johnson et al 2005 showed a close linear correlation between ka and midday stem water potential in peach during two 5 7day dry down cycles during the july cycle of water stress when the canopy was fully developed the crop coefficient decreased from 1 2 to 0 8 when ψstem decreased from 0 75 to 1 35mpa the johnson et al 2005 study did not report data on stomatal conductance or leaf area both studies were conducted under the same soil and environmental conditions at a research station parlier ca and based on the et and plant water status of trees vines in lysimeters our study was conducted using measurements of et and plant water status in a commercial orchard but espadafor et al 2014 reported good relative agreement between eddy covariance and lysimetry measurements in almond and hence the different results between our study and these previous studies may indicate real difference in the behavior of almond canopies compared to grape and peach canopies from a water management standpoint the implications of a unresponsive relationship between ka or eta to ψstem observed in this research are that little or no water savings may result from short periods of mild to moderate water stress in almond orchards an additional question is whether such short periods of water stress reduced yield a substantial reduction of stomatal conductance and instantaneous leaf photosynthetic rate was reported for almond in spinelli et al 2016 implying that carbon assimilation should have been reduced by the observed levels of water stress photosynthetic rate determines biomass accumulation and ultimately yield but the relationship between instantaneous leaf level photosynthetic rate and crop yield in almond is complex and influenced by many factors schellenberg et al 2012 measured high yield in 2010 in the same almond orchard used in this study and a comparable yield was obtained in 2009 thus it seems unlikely that large losses in yield resulted from these levels of water stress in commercial orchards 4 2 relationship between rcmid and ψstem for both years of this study the expected negative relation of higher rcmid with lower ψstem was observed although the relation was only significant in one year 2009 data from the 20days 2009 and 22days 2010 when ψstem was measured showed a relatively wide range of ψstem but a small range in rcmid particularly in 2009 table 1 but the slopes of the relation were comparable in both years additionally only about 5 10days of each year had ψstem more negative than 1 2mpa and only a few values approached 2 0mpa in both years less than half of the measurement days had ψstem that would indicate moderate stress there was no statistically significant relationship for eta versus rcmid or for eta versus ψstem in either year the occurrence of water stress following the irrigation cut off prior to harvest is apparent during the three days before harvest in 2010 fig 3 after harvest rcmid shows values consistently higher than observed before harvest and this may be related to the loss of leaf area that occurs as a result of harvest operations presumably the sharp increase in rcmid prior to harvest was related to stomatal closure interestingly in 2009 when the canopy had a higher lai than in 2010 due to pruning rcmid was relatively constant throughout the season and showed no increase in rcmid after harvest 4 3 no relationship between rcmid and scaled up stomatal conductance the work of baldocchi et al 1991 indicates that canopy surface resistance obtained from reversing the penman monteith equation differs markedly from that obtained by scaling up stomatal conductance baldocchi et al 1991 modeled stomatal conductance whereas in this work stomatal conductance was estimated from an empirical relation between porometer measurements and ψstem however the scaled up data obtained in both studies are conceptually similar for the purpose of the comparison with rc baldocchi et al 1991 suggest that discrepancies between rc and scaled up rs may be attributed to incomplete canopy cover the presence of understory vegetation complexities in terrain heterogeneities in upwind vegetation and the considered canopy and temporal trends in weather conditions it appears that none of these circumstances were present in our study site since in an adult almond orchard the canopy cover is almost full and the ground is flat and kept as bare soil the irrigation system wetted only a strip of bare soil close to the trees such that low soil evaporation would have occurred additionally there was no correlation between rcmid and irrigation events data not shown in 2009 this study obtained results comparable to the study of baldocchi et al conducted on soybeans that rc appears to overestimate the scaled up rs but this was not the case in 2010 this may be related to the fact that in 2009 there was more vegetation in the almond canopy than in 2010 so that leaf physiological properties had relatively more influence than non physiological canopy properties on rc kjelgaard and stockle 2001 used the concept of an additional non stomatal excess resistance originally proposed by perrier 1975 working in series with rc to determine the total resistance to water vapor their work is based on the fact that rc obtained from lysimeters consistently overestimates the scaled up rs this result is consistent with the results of baldocchi et al 1991 fig 2 however in our study only year 2009 shows evidence of such overestimation furthermore in kjelgaard and stockle data the discrepancy between rc and rs may be caused by the equation used to calculate rs scaling up leaf level to canopy level resistance their eq 1 that was proposed by allen et al 1998 for grass in this equation epidermal conductance is divided by the ratio laieff lai 0 5 to obtain rs this ratio was proposed for grass but may be too high for use on tall crops with high leaf areas and high fractions of shaded leaves resulting in an underestimation of rs kelliher et al 1995 compiled a dataset from 33 independent studies encompassing different types of natural vegetation and crops in well watered conditions and obtained an average ratio between canopy conductance and leaf level non scaled up stomatal conductance close to 3 an attempt is made to compare their data with the studies above using the same scale up function used by kjelgaard and stockle and the average lai 4 4 for the whole dataset we obtain a ratio between scaled up stomatal resistance and canopy resistance of 1 36 this result indicates that the scaled up canopy resistance overestimates canopy resistance and is in contrast with what found by kjelgaard and stockle and baldocchi in our study the scaled up canopy resistance was obtained by the expected stomatal behavior for the observed stem water potential recorded at each day for two classes of light interception it is acknowledged that in contrast with other modeling studies baldocchi et al 1991 the effect of variables such as vapor pressure deficit and leaf temperature on stomatal conductance was not explicitly considered but our dataset covered a wide set of conditions and hence it should be empirically accurate 4 4 coupling to the environment the relative sensitivity of le to rcmid can be described as the slope of curves in fig 6 multiplied by the term rc le eq 10 and this corresponds to the quantity ω 1 on the other hand the highest absolute sensitivities are associated with the steepest slopes in fig 6 which correspond to low aerodynamic resistances high winds and low canopy resistances open stomata however this conditions do not give the lowest values of ω most coupled conditions because of the effect of the term le rc the lowest values of ω are found at low aerodynamic resistances and at high canopy resistances high rc is also necessarily associated to low le therefore as rc increases the ratio rc le becomes very large resulting in a larger ω and hence in decoupled conditions in this context it should be noted that ω describes the relative not absolute sensitivity of evapotranspiration to water stress therefore ω will suggest that the most coupled conditions occur at about rc 200sm 1 and le 350wm 2 where a 10 change in rc results in a 50 change in le however these conditions describe a very dry or sparse canopy and they are not particularly meaningful when the objective is studying mild stress in well irrigated crops it appears that in irrigated crops the most likely conditions to show a significant decrease in et following an increase in rc correspond to the steeper part of the curves in fig 6 associated with low ra and low rc jarvis 1981 interestingly no observed data in fig 6 are in the range of low rc and low ra that would have represented conditions of high absolute sensitivity of le to rc in the range rcmid 0 to 25sm 1 we only observe data with midday ra higher than 50sm 1 assuming that most of the variability in rcmid is determined by stomatal behavior it appears that the highest stomatal conductance was observed only on calm days stomatal closure in response to wind speed has been shown grace and malcolm 1975 but stomatal responses to environmental variables have been shown to be caused by the indirect effect of higher leaf transpirational flow associated with high evaporative demand days mott and parkhurst 1991 monteith 1995 the stomatal conductance data shown in spinelli et al 2016 was analyzed using wind speed from cimis stations close to each data collection site but the data didn t support the hypothesis of a stomatal closure response in windy days data not shown it is also surprising that if data in the low range of ra and rc were observed the resulting values of le would be easily above 800wm 2 in practice such values are not observed in agricultural crops but there seem to be no physical reason to believe that such a scenario cannot happen based on an energy balance approach for example the penman monteith equation with ra rc 25sm 1 rs 1000wm 2 and g 0 1rn values commonly observed for environmental variables in the central valley in california gives a canopy minus air temperature of 8 4c and le 964wm 2 the data in fig 8 show evidence that coupling increases as wind speed increases and as rc increases as expected from eq 8 the data suggest that coupling changes dramatically in the observed wind range 1 3ms 1 it appears that wind speeds above about 1 5ms 1 mostly determine coupled conditions ω 0 5 whereas at wind speeds below 1 5ms 1 ω assumes a wide range of values and depends on canopy resistance this fact is interesting considering that the range of values of ω showed by monteith and unsworth 2007 for different vegetated surfaces are reported at 1ms 1 of wind speed our data shows that when wind speed equals 1ms 1 ω could assume a very wide range of values mostly depending on rcmid and secondly on tair through its effect on δ but at higher wind speed ω stabilizes and becomes independent of rc therefore it appears that for the orchard subject of our study a typical value of ω should be reported at wind speeds higher than 2sm 1 in the study of maize canopies conducted by steduto and hsiao 1998a canopy resistance constituted on the average 55 of the total resistance for water vapor transport indicating that aerodynamic and canopy resistance had about the same importance in determining the total resistance to water vapor transport in our study aerodynamic resistance was generally lower than canopy resistance fig 3 therefore a higher effect of rc on et would be expected nevertheless their study shows a decrease in the ratio eta eto when rc increases above about 70sm 1 whereas such a decrease was observed in our study only when rc reached 120sm 1 this difference is probably caused by the generally lower ω observed at their site where windier conditions were observed steduto and hsiao 1998b 4 5 sensitivity of canopy resistance to leaf area index and to stomatal conductance stomatal closure and defoliation are well known responses of plants to water stress hsiao 1973 the former is thought to have shorter response time than the latter and stomatal closure is reversible while defoliation is not eq 6 was modeled with the intent of exploring the sensitivity of canopy resistance to stomatal closure and to leaf area index it was found that a change in ψstem from 0 5 to 2mpa elicited an increase in rcmid from 64 to 204sm 1 at lai 2 but only from 21 to 69sm 1 at lai 6 the relative change in canopy conductance for a change in ψstem was about 220 and was relatively stable across lai s on the other hand at a constant ψstem 0 5mpa reducing lai from 6 to 2 caused an increase in rcmid from 24 to 64sm 1 but at ψstem 2mpa the increase in rcmid was from 79 to 204sm 1 furthermore as lai increases most of the added leaves are shaded and these show a lower slope in the relationship between stomatal conductance and water stress spinelli 2016 therefore at high lai water stress has a lower effect on whole canopy conductance than at low lai where there is a higher fraction of sunlit leaves responsive to water stress in this study the contribution to canopy resistance of sunlit leaves compared to shaded leaves ranged from about 40 60 in well watered conditions to 50 50 in water stressed conditions this is again attributable to the greater stomatal sensitivity of sunlit leaves to water stress the fraction of shaded leaves is increased as lai increases leading to a change in the contribution of sunlit shaded leaves to overall canopy resistance reaching 25 75 at lai 6 in this respect our data is consistent to what shown by steduto and hsiao 1998a that lai is the major determinant of rc and stomatal closure is of lesser importance lai was not measured in this study however from data collected in a similar almond orchard in the same area it appears that lai is mostly stable starting from mid june until it drops at shaking data not shown some defoliation of lower canopy leaves particularly in water stressed trees is visually apparent during the two last weeks of august concomitant with a pre harvest irrigation cut off the increase in rcmid observed in 2010 prior to shaking may be associated with a composite effect of some defoliation and some stomatal closure in conclusion for the chain of almond canopy processes that were examined in this study a canopy resistance rcmid tended to increase with water stress midday ψstem but did not show a strong dependence on ψstem b an unexpectedly high and variable decoupling ω was observed for this tall and rough canopy indicating a low but variable sensitivity of evapotranspiration to canopy resistance and c this sensitivity was strongly influenced by windspeed and rcmid exhibiting a particularly wide range of sensitivity at low but commonly occurring windspeeds it is important to note that atmospheric coupling in almonds appears not to be a fixed or nearly fixed characteristic of the almond canopy this study further shows evidence of how high vegetation high lai can override the effect of substantial stomatal closure and maintain an unchanged canopy evapotranspiration in presence of moderate water stress the implications of our results for irrigation management are that fine tuned deficit irrigation such as has been suggested for control of hull rot which seeks to impose limited but not severe stress may have little potential for measurable water savings particularly in high lai crops and in low wind areas future research should focus on exploring the dynamics of leaf area throughout the season and its role in influencing atmospheric coupling acknowledgements the authors wish to express their gratitude to the plant sciences department

11598,the degree of coupling to the environment of almond prunus dulcis orchards during periods of transient water stress was investigated in a two year study in california plant water status was monitored weekly before and or after irrigation measuring midday stem water potential ψstem that ranged from 0 5 to 2mpa while actual evapotranspiration eta was measured with an eddy covariance tower irrigation was applied weekly following common commercial practice resulting in weekly cycles of ψstem despite ψstem reaching levels shown to induce substantial stomatal closure the ratio actual to reference evapotranspiration eta eto ka did not show a decrease during weekly periods of low ψstem in the two years of the study midday average canopy surface resistance rcmid computed by reversing the penman monteith equation from eddy covariance et data yielded a statistically significant increase with a decrease in ψstem but just in the first year of the study however rcmid did not show a significant relationship with stomatal resistance measured at the leaf level with porometry and scaled up to the canopy level in the first year rcmid showed a sharp increase after harvest when ka also decreased perhaps produced by the composite effect of defoliation associated with harvest and stomatal closure associated with water stress during the growing season rcmid ranged from 0 to 100sm 1 and midday average aerodynamic resistance ramid ranged between 0 and 50sm 1 despite rcmid being generally larger than ra the midday average decoupling factor ω averaged 0 7 during the irrigation season indicating decoupled conditions however there was a large day to day fluctuation of midday ω ranging from 0 16 to 0 98 mostly associated with rcmid and wind speed this study indicated that tall and rough canopies can be relatively decoupled depending on the effect of wind speed and canopy resistance on the decoupling factor from a water management point of view this result suggests that inducing transient mild to moderate water stress may not produce substantial water savings in areas having low to moderate winds abbreviations cp air heat capacity at constant pressure ea air vapor pressure es

stem water potential 1 introduction almonds are the second largest crop of california by acreage with 328 thousand hectares 810 thousand acres estimated in 2013 and produced a value of 3 387 billion in 2012 almond board of california essentially all commercial almond orchards are irrigated making almonds the second largest crop of the state in terms of water use california department of water resources water stress occurs in commercial orchards as a result of water shortage but short periods of water stress can also be induced as a management tool to control vegetative growth reduce fungal diseases at hull split and facilitate harvest operations in a previous study spinelli 2016 we showed that a substantial reduction about 50 in both leaf level photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance occurs for the range of water status commonly observed in commercial orchards from 0 5 to 2mpa similar results were obtained by klein et al 2001 and shackel 2011 comparable reductions of stomatal conductance in association with water stress in almond trees have been shown using various measures of water availability such as the osmotic potential of a nutrient solution wartinger et al 1990 predawn leaf water potential rouhi et al 2007 and leaf water potential castel and fereres 1982 photosynthetic rates ultimately determine biomass accumulation and indirectly yield hence it can be argued that stomatal closure caused by periods of water stress may also reduce plant productivity the question is whether transpiration is also reduced as a result of stomatal closure and if irrigation water is saved the answer to this question lies in the sensitivity of transpiration to stomatal closure in the context of an entire canopy since transpiration is not only a function of stomatal conductance but also of the evaporative demand of the atmosphere the effect of environmental factors needs to be taken into account this is commonly achieved by calculating the actual crop coefficient ka the ratio of actual evapotranspiration eta and reference evapotranspiration eto the latter indicates the evapotranspiration of an unstressed grass field and hence is a composite measure of environmental factors two studies conducted on perennial crops planted in lysimeters johnson et al 2005 in peach williams et al 2012 in grapevines have shown a reduction of the ratio eta eto associated with a decreasing stem or leaf water potential as a result of stomatal closure however the use of the ratio eta eto is not devoid of problems especially in the case of tall trees because a tall canopy responds to environmental variables such as wind differently to grass and hence eto may not be the appropriate metric to make allowance for environmental variability annandale and stockle 1994 a more appropriate way to separate physiological from environmental effects on eta for tall canopies may be to solve the penman monteith big leaf model for canopy surface resistance 1 1 different authors use resistance or conductance to express the degree to which a particular segment of the transport pathway produces a flux in presence of a gradient but resistance and conductance are inversely related and their meaning is equivalent in this study we will use resistances because in a canopy the physiological and aerodynamic segments of the transport pathway are in series and thus the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances in this case the use of resistances is more informative about the relative contribution of each segment to the total transport path rc which is the variable under physiological control in the model and should show an increase associated with stomatal closure kelliher and leuning 1995 baldocchi et al 1991 nevertheless canopy resistance calculated using the big leaf model includes the effects of non physiological variables mostly aerodynamic and is affected by soil surface wetness baldocchi et al 1991 paw u and meyers 1989 kjelgaard and stockle 2001 other studies have shown that at high leaf area indexes canopy conductance is mostly a function of leaf area and it is not strongly affected by stomatal conductance steduto and hsiao 1998b the concept of coupling is an approach to describe the sensitivity of evapotranspiration to stomatal closure jarvis 1984 proposed a decoupling factor ω that mathematically describes the relative change in evapotranspiration for a given relative change in rc jones 1992 eq 5 29 coupling varies across scales a leaf being more coupled to the environment than a single plant and a plant being more coupled than a crop canopy jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 plants evolved adaptations to survive as individuals in a much more coupled environment than a full crop canopy which justifies the evolutionary effort of developing control mechanisms like stomatal regulation on transpiration it may not be surprising that such mechanisms are not as effective in a decoupled crop canopy jarvis 1985 however even considering a single leaf which is generally more coupled than a canopy a large decrease in stomatal conductance may result in a marginal reduction in transpiration depending on leaf boundary layer conditions bange 1953 forests tree canopies and tall and rough vegetation are generally considered more coupled than grass or agricultural crops with short vegetation since ω decreases with the relative importance of rc with respect to ra in other words a canopy gets more coupled as rc increases water stress and as ra decreases ra is always lower for a tall rough canopy than for a short smooth canopy and ra decreases as wind speed increases rana and katerji 1998 found that in tall sorghum canopies et depends strongly on rc especially when water stressed therefore in theory a water stressed almond canopy should be one of the most coupled agricultural crops the decoupling factor however should not be considered a fixed characteristic of a canopy because it is also dependent on wind speed through its effect on ra and on air temperature through the effect of temperature on δ the slope of the relationship between vapor pressure and temperature monteith and unsworth 1990 for instance kostner et al 1992 report a fourfold variation in the daily pattern of ω in a forest paw u and gao 1988 showed that the omega factor when derived from linear models such as the ω proposed by jarvis and mcnaughton can be in great error compared to quadratic or quartic solutions of the energy balance they show considerable discrepancies of the result between the two models especially when ω 0 8 and when net radiation is considered constant as surface temperature increases ω was also shown to be highly dependent on leaf area index lai by steduto and hsiao 1998b they found relatively high midday values of ω ranging from 0 4 to 0 8 in well watered and water stressed relatively tall 3m maize canopies in that study the observed high lai was the major determinant of the large ω only when senescence caused a drop in lai ω decreased and canopy resistance began to exert a significant effect on transpiration most of the decrease in canopy resistance was attributable to a drop in lai and only a minor component was due to stomatal closure the course of lai in an almond orchard is different than in field crops almonds leaf out very rapidly starting from march with complete canopy closure occurring early but vegetative growth continues until about the end of june thus lai is relatively constant during summer months and leaf senescence and abscission occurs in late fall however partial defoliation is common in california almond orchards as they approach harvest end of august and leaf abscission is intensified by the mechanical stress of tree shaking during harvest klein et al 2001 showed a close correlation between water stress and leaf abscission the objective of this study was investigating the following question is orchard water use reduced with reductions in almond tree water status in the field this question was developed into each step of the chain of processes leading stress related stomatal closure to reduce et namely a to what degree is canopy resistance increased when water stress causes stomatal closure b what is the relative sensitivity ω of evapotranspiration to canopy resistance c what environmental and physiological variables affect this sensitivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in 2009 and 2010 in a high yielding almond prunus dulcis d a webb orchard at the paramount farming company in lost hills ca n 35 30 37 w 119 40 3 the plot was a rectangular irrigation set of the following dimensions 256m east west and 790m north south the trees were 10 years old at the initiation of the study trees were planted at 6 4 7 9m spacing with north south row orientation the soil was classified as milham sandy loam average wind speed for the months may to august were 1 65ms 1 in 2009 and 1 68ms 1 in 2010 harvest dates were 21 aug 2009 and 27 aug 2010 during winter 2009 at the beginning of the 2010 season the orchard was mechanically hedged every row cutting a 1 2m swath down the middle of the drive the average interception of the entire orchard was 78 2 in 2009 and 79 8 in 2010 lampinen personal communication more defoliation was observed in the orchard in 2010 late in the season presumably due to reduced soil water availability as verified with the neutron probe in an attempt to reduce hull rot through partial deficit irrigation 2 2 irrigations the irrigation system consisted of two micro sprinklers per tree placed on the tree line at about 1m from the trees each applying a field measured 36lh 1 nominal 40lh 1 for bowsmith a40 over a 4 3m diameter the soil surface wetted by the irrigation system was limited to a weed free 3 5 4m wide band along the tree berm with alley space between the berms that was mowed and essentially weed free during the summer the orchard was irrigated weekly based primarily on soil moisture measurements neutron probes but also considering estimated et and stem water potential irrigation sets lasted 24 or 48h total irrigation applied plus precipitations for 2009 was 1497mm and in 2010 was 1418mm reference evapotranspiration was 1488mm in 2009 and 1377mm in 2010 2 3 water stress measurement midday stem water potential ψstem shackel et al 1997 was measured approximately weekly with a scholander pressure chamber soilmoisture equipment corp or pms instruments inc based on the irrigation schedule of the grower in some cases ψstem was measured directly following an irrigation and in other cases just prior to an irrigation in order to evaluate the range of plant water stress conditions prevalent in the orchard one or two fully expanded shaded leaves from the trunk or main scaffold were enclosed in opaque plastic bags covered with aluminum foil for a minimum 30min before the measurement fulton et al 2001 thirty trees that were evenly distributed within the orchard were measured in 2009 with thirty five trees measured in 2010 following the method proposed by mccutchan and shackel 1992 for prune an unstressed baseline was calculated from atmospheric vapor pressure deficit obtained for the period 12 00 to 15 00 from a cimis california irrigation management information system weather station located 3 km south west of the experiment 2 4 eddy covariance and crop coefficient flux measurements were performed with a tower located 90m from the southwestern corner of the plot the location of the tower was chosen due to the prevalence of west northwest winds in the area during the period may september instruments were installed 9m from the ground the canopy was 7 8m tall and there was a fetch of 220m which is adequate based on the assumption that the fetch should equal 50 times the sensor height above the zero plane displacement monteith and unsworth 1990 the plot was surrounded by almonds irrigated with

using the equation given by monteith and unsworth 1990 3 r a u z u 2 however penman monteith s derivation contains a first order taylor linearization thus we expect this method to be inaccurate

and 15 00 for the days when ψstem was measured the expected stomatal conductance of each tree for sunlit sun and shaded sh leaves was calculated using the relationships between stomatal conductance gs and ψstem shown in the work of spinelli et al 2016 subsequently stomatal conductance was scaled up to the canopy level using the average conductances of sunlight and shaded leaves weighted by the lai of each category of leaves as proposed by sinclair et al 1976 and leuning et al 1995 the inverse of scaled up canopy conductance was taken to obtain scaled up canopy resistance rs 6 r s 1 l a i s u n

june to august to obtain the theoretical relationship between eta and rc the surface temperature ts was iterated in the following energy balance equation adapted from jones 1992 equations 5 2 5 17 5

orchard in a day ranged from 0 65mpa to 1 89mpa and in 2010 ranged from 0 48mpa to 2 19mpa table 1 the midday ka i e the ratio eta eto for the midseason may to september ranged from 0 92 to 1 69 in 2009 and from 0 78 to 1 36 in 2010 similar to the daily ka values reported in spinelli 2016 with a somewhat more limited range for the regression analysis shown in table 1 the relationship between midday stem water potential and actual crop coefficient calculated at midday 12 00 15 00 was non significant for both years fig 1 a b table 1 in 2009 there was a significant negative relationship between midday canopy resistance and ψstem fig 2 a table 1 in 2010 the relationship between midday canopy resistance and ψstem was also negative and significant p value 0 0053 but the relationship was strongly affected by one late season datapoint collected on sep 28th 2010 with an rcmid 292sm 1and ψstem 2mpa which may have been an outlier with this point removed the relationship was also negative and only significant at the 0 05 level p value 0 0273 fig 2b table 1 in 2009 the average midday 12 00 15 00 aerodynamic resistance ramid ranged between 9 and 175sm 1 average midday canopy resistance rcmid ranged between 35 and 201sm 1 fig 3 a in 2010 ramid ranged from 6 and 136sm 1and rcmid ranged from 32 to 292sm 1 in both years rcmid was generally higher than ramid although there were days when ramid was higher in 2010 rcmid showed a sharp increase during the last week of august fig 3b however in 2009 rcmid did not show similar pattern but it was generally higher at the end of the season in both years ψstem exhibited similar ranges and fluctuations over the season fig 3 and table 1 tree to tree variation on a particular day was similar to that shown for 2010 in spinelli 2016 fig 3 there was an inverse relationship between ramid and midday average wind speed the relationship was highly predictable above a wind speed of 1 5ms 1 but showed considerable scatter between 1 and 1 5ms 1 fig 4 however at every wind speed the observed ramid was substantially lower than the aerodynamic resistance calculated for grass with the method proposed by allen et al 1998 for both years there was no relationship between the midday observed canopy resistance from eddy covariance and the scaled up stomatal resistance rs expected for the average stem water potential of the orchard in each day of measurement midday canopy resistance averaged 84 5sm 1 in 2009 and 67 6sm 1 in 2010 scaled up stomatal resistance averaged 60 8sm 1 in 2009 and 68sm 1 in 2010 fig 5 latent heat flux measured by the tower ranged from 63wm 2 to 718wm 2 and showed a negative relationship with rcmid the modeled relationship between le and rcmid showed steeper slopes associated with low midday aerodynamic resistance and flatter slopes during high aerodynamic resistance days fig 6 however during low ramid windy days low canopy resistance was never observed being never lower than 35sm 1 when rcmid was lower than 50sm 1 for such days the theoretical model indicated values of le substantially above 700wm 2 s 1 for values of rcmid below about 40sm 1 fig 6 the seasonal course of midday average decoupling factor ω showed high day to day variability with values ranging from 0 26 to 0 96 dimensionless in 2009 and from 0 16 to 0 98 in 2010 values higher than 0 5 were observed for most of the midseason both in 2009 and in 2010 fig 7 in 2010ω showed relatively low values during two periods the beginning may and the end of the season late august september similar patterns were not observed in 2009 ω didn t show any association with ψstem not shown midday ω showed an inverse relationship with wind speed the relationship being dependent on canopy resistance fig 8 ω was higher at lower categories of rcmid however at wind speed above about 1 5ms 1 ω was always lower than about 0 4 the magnitude of rcmid not affecting ω greatly at any level of wind speed ω was lower than the ω calculated for grass from fao56 4 discussion 4 1 no relationship between ka and ψstem as reported previously spinelli 2016 ka showed very stable values during the may to september period in both years of the study in 2010 ka was generally lower than in 2009 this difference was associated to a lower canopy development due to pruning operations differential vegetative growth and a different degree of late season defoliation between the two years despite the clear relation of almond leaf conductance to ψstem across locations and years spinelli 2016 there was no relationship found between ka and ψstem this result is in contrast with what was found in grapes by williams et al 2012 and in peach by johnson et al 2005 during short dry down periods in lysimeters for dry down cycles of 5 and 10days williams showed that a substantial decrease in ka from 0 85 to 0 50 was linearly correlated with a decrease in leaf water potential from 0 65 to 1 3mpa similarly ka was linearly correlated with stomatal conductance indicating that the decrease in vine transpiration was triggered by the plant physiological response to water stress the leaf area index of the vines was not reported in the study however an estimate of 20m2 per vine was given the total area per vine in the vineyard was 7 55m2 williams et al 2003 yielding a lai 2 65 this value is lower than the 3 25 mean lai measured in the almond orchard where this study was conducted and may account for the higher sensitivity of et to stomatal closure observed in the lysimeter see section coupling to the environment johnson et al 2005 showed a close linear correlation between ka and midday stem water potential in peach during two 5 7day dry down cycles during the july cycle of water stress when the canopy was fully developed the crop coefficient decreased from 1 2 to 0 8 when ψstem decreased from 0 75 to 1 35mpa the johnson et al 2005 study did not report data on stomatal conductance or leaf area both studies were conducted under the same soil and environmental conditions at a research station parlier ca and based on the et and plant water status of trees vines in lysimeters our study was conducted using measurements of et and plant water status in a commercial orchard but espadafor et al 2014 reported good relative agreement between eddy covariance and lysimetry measurements in almond and hence the different results between our study and these previous studies may indicate real difference in the behavior of almond canopies compared to grape and peach canopies from a water management standpoint the implications of a unresponsive relationship between ka or eta to ψstem observed in this research are that little or no water savings may result from short periods of mild to moderate water stress in almond orchards an additional question is whether such short periods of water stress reduced yield a substantial reduction of stomatal conductance and instantaneous leaf photosynthetic rate was reported for almond in spinelli et al 2016 implying that carbon assimilation should have been reduced by the observed levels of water stress photosynthetic rate determines biomass accumulation and ultimately yield but the relationship between instantaneous leaf level photosynthetic rate and crop yield in almond is complex and influenced by many factors schellenberg et al 2012 measured high yield in 2010 in the same almond orchard used in this study and a comparable yield was obtained in 2009 thus it seems unlikely that large losses in yield resulted from these levels of water stress in commercial orchards 4 2 relationship between rcmid and ψstem for both years of this study the expected negative relation of higher rcmid with lower ψstem was observed although the relation was only significant in one year 2009 data from the 20days 2009 and 22days 2010 when ψstem was measured showed a relatively wide range of ψstem but a small range in rcmid particularly in 2009 table 1 but the slopes of the relation were comparable in both years additionally only about 5 10days of each year had ψstem more negative than 1 2mpa and only a few values approached 2 0mpa in both years less than half of the measurement days had ψstem that would indicate moderate stress there was no statistically significant relationship for eta versus rcmid or for eta versus ψstem in either year the occurrence of water stress following the irrigation cut off prior to harvest is apparent during the three days before harvest in 2010 fig 3 after harvest rcmid shows values consistently higher than observed before harvest and this may be related to the loss of leaf area that occurs as a result of harvest operations presumably the sharp increase in rcmid prior to harvest was related to stomatal closure interestingly in 2009 when the canopy had a higher lai than in 2010 due to pruning rcmid was relatively constant throughout the season and showed no increase in rcmid after harvest 4 3 no relationship between rcmid and scaled up stomatal conductance the work of baldocchi et al 1991 indicates that canopy surface resistance obtained from reversing the penman monteith equation differs markedly from that obtained by scaling up stomatal conductance baldocchi et al 1991 modeled stomatal conductance whereas in this work stomatal conductance was estimated from an empirical relation between porometer measurements and ψstem however the scaled up data obtained in both studies are conceptually similar for the purpose of the comparison with rc baldocchi et al 1991 suggest that discrepancies between rc and scaled up rs may be attributed to incomplete canopy cover the presence of understory vegetation complexities in terrain heterogeneities in upwind vegetation and the considered canopy and temporal trends in weather conditions it appears that none of these circumstances were present in our study site since in an adult almond orchard the canopy cover is almost full and the ground is flat and kept as bare soil the irrigation system wetted only a strip of bare soil close to the trees such that low soil evaporation would have occurred additionally there was no correlation between rcmid and irrigation events data not shown in 2009 this study obtained results comparable to the study of baldocchi et al conducted on soybeans that rc appears to overestimate the scaled up rs but this was not the case in 2010 this may be related to the fact that in 2009 there was more vegetation in the almond canopy than in 2010 so that leaf physiological properties had relatively more influence than non physiological canopy properties on rc kjelgaard and stockle 2001 used the concept of an additional non stomatal excess resistance originally proposed by perrier 1975 working in series with rc to determine the total resistance to water vapor their work is based on the fact that rc obtained from lysimeters consistently overestimates the scaled up rs this result is consistent with the results of baldocchi et al 1991 fig 2 however in our study only year 2009 shows evidence of such overestimation furthermore in kjelgaard and stockle data the discrepancy between rc and rs may be caused by the equation used to calculate rs scaling up leaf level to canopy level resistance their eq 1 that was proposed by allen et al 1998 for grass in this equation epidermal conductance is divided by the ratio laieff lai 0 5 to obtain rs this ratio was proposed for grass but may be too high for use on tall crops with high leaf areas and high fractions of shaded leaves resulting in an underestimation of rs kelliher et al 1995 compiled a dataset from 33 independent studies encompassing different types of natural vegetation and crops in well watered conditions and obtained an average ratio between canopy conductance and leaf level non scaled up stomatal conductance close to 3 an attempt is made to compare their data with the studies above using the same scale up function used by kjelgaard and stockle and the average lai 4 4 for the whole dataset we obtain a ratio between scaled up stomatal resistance and canopy resistance of 1 36 this result indicates that the scaled up canopy resistance overestimates canopy resistance and is in contrast with what found by kjelgaard and stockle and baldocchi in our study the scaled up canopy resistance was obtained by the expected stomatal behavior for the observed stem water potential recorded at each day for two classes of light interception it is acknowledged that in contrast with other modeling studies baldocchi et al 1991 the effect of variables such as vapor pressure deficit and leaf temperature on stomatal conductance was not explicitly considered but our dataset covered a wide set of conditions and hence it should be empirically accurate 4 4 coupling to the environment the relative sensitivity of le to rcmid can be described as the slope of curves in fig 6 multiplied by the term rc le eq 10 and this corresponds to the quantity ω 1 on the other hand the highest absolute sensitivities are associated with the steepest slopes in fig 6 which correspond to low aerodynamic resistances high winds and low canopy resistances open stomata however this conditions do not give the lowest values of ω most coupled conditions because of the effect of the term le rc the lowest values of ω are found at low aerodynamic resistances and at high canopy resistances high rc is also necessarily associated to low le therefore as rc increases the ratio rc le becomes very large resulting in a larger ω and hence in decoupled conditions in this context it should be noted that ω describes the relative not absolute sensitivity of evapotranspiration to water stress therefore ω will suggest that the most coupled conditions occur at about rc 200sm 1 and le 350wm 2 where a 10 change in rc results in a 50 change in le however these conditions describe a very dry or sparse canopy and they are not particularly meaningful when the objective is studying mild stress in well irrigated crops it appears that in irrigated crops the most likely conditions to show a significant decrease in et following an increase in rc correspond to the steeper part of the curves in fig 6 associated with low ra and low rc jarvis 1981 interestingly no observed data in fig 6 are in the range of low rc and low ra that would have represented conditions of high absolute sensitivity of le to rc in the range rcmid 0 to 25sm 1 we only observe data with midday ra higher than 50sm 1 assuming that most of the variability in rcmid is determined by stomatal behavior it appears that the highest stomatal conductance was observed only on calm days stomatal closure in response to wind speed has been shown grace and malcolm 1975 but stomatal responses to environmental variables have been shown to be caused by the indirect effect of higher leaf transpirational flow associated with high evaporative demand days mott and parkhurst 1991 monteith 1995 the stomatal conductance data shown in spinelli et al 2016 was analyzed using wind speed from cimis stations close to each data collection site but the data didn t support the hypothesis of a stomatal closure response in windy days data not shown it is also surprising that if data in the low range of ra and rc were observed the resulting values of le would be easily above 800wm 2 in practice such values are not observed in agricultural crops but there seem to be no physical reason to believe that such a scenario cannot happen based on an energy balance approach for example the penman monteith equation with ra rc 25sm 1 rs 1000wm 2 and g 0 1rn values commonly observed for environmental variables in the central valley in california gives a canopy minus air temperature of 8 4c and le 964wm 2 the data in fig 8 show evidence that coupling increases as wind speed increases and as rc increases as expected from eq 8 the data suggest that coupling changes dramatically in the observed wind range 1 3ms 1 it appears that wind speeds above about 1 5ms 1 mostly determine coupled conditions ω 0 5 whereas at wind speeds below 1 5ms 1 ω assumes a wide range of values and depends on canopy resistance this fact is interesting considering that the range of values of ω showed by monteith and unsworth 2007 for different vegetated surfaces are reported at 1ms 1 of wind speed our data shows that when wind speed equals 1ms 1 ω could assume a very wide range of values mostly depending on rcmid and secondly on tair through its effect on δ but at higher wind speed ω stabilizes and becomes independent of rc therefore it appears that for the orchard subject of our study a typical value of ω should be reported at wind speeds higher than 2sm 1 in the study of maize canopies conducted by steduto and hsiao 1998a canopy resistance constituted on the average 55 of the total resistance for water vapor transport indicating that aerodynamic and canopy resistance had about the same importance in determining the total resistance to water vapor transport in our study aerodynamic resistance was generally lower than canopy resistance fig 3 therefore a higher effect of rc on et would be expected nevertheless their study shows a decrease in the ratio eta eto when rc increases above about 70sm 1 whereas such a decrease was observed in our study only when rc reached 120sm 1 this difference is probably caused by the generally lower ω observed at their site where windier conditions were observed steduto and hsiao 1998b 4 5 sensitivity of canopy resistance to leaf area index and to stomatal conductance stomatal closure and defoliation are well known responses of plants to water stress hsiao 1973 the former is thought to have shorter response time than the latter and stomatal closure is reversible while defoliation is not eq 6 was modeled with the intent of exploring the sensitivity of canopy resistance to stomatal closure and to leaf area index it was found that a change in ψstem from 0 5 to 2mpa elicited an increase in rcmid from 64 to 204sm 1 at lai 2 but only from 21 to 69sm 1 at lai 6 the relative change in canopy conductance for a change in ψstem was about 220 and was relatively stable across lai s on the other hand at a constant ψstem 0 5mpa reducing lai from 6 to 2 caused an increase in rcmid from 24 to 64sm 1 but at ψstem 2mpa the increase in rcmid was from 79 to 204sm 1 furthermore as lai increases most of the added leaves are shaded and these show a lower slope in the relationship between stomatal conductance and water stress spinelli 2016 therefore at high lai water stress has a lower effect on whole canopy conductance than at low lai where there is a higher fraction of sunlit leaves responsive to water stress in this study the contribution to canopy resistance of sunlit leaves compared to shaded leaves ranged from about 40 60 in well watered conditions to 50 50 in water stressed conditions this is again attributable to the greater stomatal sensitivity of sunlit leaves to water stress the fraction of shaded leaves is increased as lai increases leading to a change in the contribution of sunlit shaded leaves to overall canopy resistance reaching 25 75 at lai 6 in this respect our data is consistent to what shown by steduto and hsiao 1998a that lai is the major determinant of rc and stomatal closure is of lesser importance lai was not measured in this study however from data collected in a similar almond orchard in the same area it appears that lai is mostly stable starting from mid june until it drops at shaking data not shown some defoliation of lower canopy leaves particularly in water stressed trees is visually apparent during the two last weeks of august concomitant with a pre harvest irrigation cut off the increase in rcmid observed in 2010 prior to shaking may be associated with a composite effect of some defoliation and some stomatal closure in conclusion for the chain of almond canopy processes that were examined in this study a canopy resistance rcmid tended to increase with water stress midday ψstem but did not show a strong dependence on ψstem b an unexpectedly high and variable decoupling ω was observed for this tall and rough canopy indicating a low but variable sensitivity of evapotranspiration to canopy resistance and c this sensitivity was strongly influenced by windspeed and rcmid exhibiting a particularly wide range of sensitivity at low but commonly occurring windspeeds it is important to note that atmospheric coupling in almonds appears not to be a fixed or nearly fixed characteristic of the almond canopy this study further shows evidence of how high vegetation high lai can override the effect of substantial stomatal closure and maintain an unchanged canopy evapotranspiration in presence of moderate water stress the implications of our results for irrigation management are that fine tuned deficit irrigation such as has been suggested for control of hull rot which seeks to impose limited but not severe stress may have little potential for measurable water savings particularly in high lai crops and in low wind areas future research should focus on exploring the dynamics of leaf area throughout the season and its role in influencing atmospheric coupling acknowledgements the authors wish to express their gratitude to the plant sciences department

11599,climate change projections for southern europe reveal warming and drying trends for the upcoming decades bringing important challenges to portuguese viticulture in particular the present study analyses irrigation as an adaptation measure to ensure the future sustainability of viticultural yields in portugal the stics crop model was used to simulate baseline 1981 2005 and future 2041 2070 grapevine yields in portugal future yield decreases yields are 60 with respect to baseline over some of the innermost and most renowned winemaking regions of the country are found following the decrease of precipitation in the growing season as an adaptation measure grapevine irrigation was tested for future climates stics irrigation replicates a highly efficient water use strategy only applied when a certain water stress level is reached the results indicate higher yields with this irrigation strategy thus largely alleviating the projected yield decreases nonetheless in some warmer and dryer regions such as inner alentejo and douro porto yield levels are still projected to decrease with irrigation 70 80 of baseline yields though to a lesser extent when compared to non irrigated simulations this decrease is attributed to the synergistic effect of severe heat and water stresses in the future although these simulations aim at achieving the same yields and alcohol level in future scenarios as in baseline applying irrigation may modify the wine typicity of each region and threaten the currently scarce water resources outlining appropriate timely and cost effective adaptation measures is critical for the sustainability of both the environment and the national portuguese winemaking sector keywords viticulture climate change irrigation grapevine yield crop modelling portugal 1 introduction grapevine growth and development is largely controlled by atmospheric conditions jones and goodrich 2008 jones et al 2005 tonietto and carbonneau 2004 van leeuwen et al 2004 in fact weather factors such as temperatures solar radiation and water availability strongly influence vine growth and development which ultimately impact yield and wine quality makra et al 2009 van leeuwen et al 2008 although grapevines show a strong adaptation to different environmental conditions many of the renowned winemaking regions worldwide are located in areas with mediterranean

around 100mm fraga et al 2015 water is essential for grapevine vegetative and reproductive growth being a major forcing factor of crop yields hardie and martin 2000 iglesias and garrote 2015 water availability while more critical at certain development stages will define in most the case the crop suitability feasibility in a specific area caubel et al 2015 severe water stress may result in a wide range of negative impacts such as low flower and berry set low leaf area limited photosynthesis flower abortion and cluster abscission during 1986 hardie and considine 1976 conversely excessive humidity overstimulates growth leading to denser canopies and higher risk of specific pests and diseases additionally for the production of a high quality wine a certain level of water stress at certain development stages may be required jones and davis 2000 nemani et al 2001 ramos et al 2008 reynolds and naylor 1994 storchi et al 2005 tonietto 1999 for the portuguese viticulture which is currently the european 5th largest wine producer with a total of 6 7 mhl ivv 2015 oiv 2015 precipitation is for most regions traditionally considered the only source of available water for plant growth in almost all of the 12 portuguese mainland viticultural regions fig 1 water stress levels can be severe especially in the warm and dry summers irrigation application is often not advised or even not allowed as it can alter grape yield and quality attributes in many european countries this practice has indeed been historically forbidden by strict wine regulations specifically established for each winemaking region this is also the case of the portuguese douro demarcated region where irrigation has been outlawed except in very specific cases e g experimental plots vineyards endangered due to excessive water stress despite this limitation viticultural irrigation in portugal has been increasing though still limited to the dryer inner southern areas of the country such as in alentejo costa et al 2016 permanhani et al 2016 climate change may challenge these traditional concepts fraga and santos 2017 fraga et al 2016b jones 2005 kenny and harrison 1992 neethling et al 2016 nesbitt

waves and extreme droughts ipcc 2013 santos et al 2017 may negatively affect final yields and quality attributes jones and alves 2012 a recent study clearly points to a decrease in yields over some areas of portugal under climate change scenarios if no adaptation measures are adopted fraga et al 2016a these findings are encouraging the research and development of climate change adaptation measures namely the implementation of irrigation systems costa et al 2016 permanhani et al 2016 as a result throughout southern europe many winemaking countries have been loosening their regulations regarding irrigation permanhani et al 2016 still the assessment of the potential positive effects of viticultural irrigation under climate change scenarios in portugal was not previously performed being of utmost importance for growers under the increasingly dryer portuguese climates water is considered a threatened resource water scarcity is increasing not only due to climate change but also due to population growth industrial use and intensive agriculture water demands amongst other factors hence applying irrigation to this historically rainfed crop brings additional economic environmental and social costs as adaptation to water scarcity is required under future climates costa et al 2016 smart e g deficit irrigation strategies should be implemented permanhani et al 2016 romero and martinez cutillas 2012 santos et al 2003 both to reduce non beneficial water consumption pereira et al 2012 perry 2011 and to optimize grape composition junquera et al 2012 providing a balanced solution between environmental costs and plant water requirements garcia et al 2012 many recent studies focus on the adaptation of grapevine under future warmer and dryer conditions by testing irrigation under controlled conditions and or in experimental vineyards bellvert et al 2014 chaves et al 2007 kizildeniz et al 2015 oliveira et al 2011 nonetheless a regional scale approach is still lacking which can provide an answer on how much irrigation water is required to mitigate the detrimental impacts of climate change a possible solution to this problem is through the use of crop models crop models dynamically simulate crop responses to management practices e g irrigation soil properties e g texture depth as well as crop physiological responses to atmospheric conditions e g air temperature precipitation co2 hence by coupling crop models with high resolution climatic simulations such as the regional climate models from the euro cordex project jacob et al 2014 a regional characterization of water requirements for grapevines can be accomplished the present study aims at characterizing present and future grapevine water requirements and its influences on yields therefore the present study objectives are four fold 1 to couple a dynamic crop model with high resolution climatic simulations for current and future climate change scenarios specifically adapted to the portuguese viticulture 2 to assess grapevine yield differences under future climates at a regional scale for each winemaking region 3 to simulate suitable irrigation strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on yield and 4 to analyze the impacts of the introduction of viticultural irrigation in the future 2 material and methods 2 1 the stics crop soil model grapevine modelling was performed using the stics simulateur multidisciplinaire pour les cultures standard crop model brisson et al 2008 developed by the french national institute for agronomic research inra this is one of the few crop models that can be applied to perennial crops such as grapevines this model has been tested and validated for grapevines under different management soil water conditions and irrigation regimes coucheney et al 2015 fraga et al 2015 valdes gomez et al 2009 furthermore this model has previously been used in assessing the impacts of climate change on european viticulture fraga et al 2016a for portugal using data from experimental vineyards this model has previously shown a high agreement between observed and simulated yields phenology and water stress levels fraga et al 2015 given the model high skill in simulating grapevine yields and water relations fraga et al 2015 garcía de cortazar atauri 2006 valdes gomez et al 2009 it was used herein to develop different irrigation strategies for climate change adaptation at a regional level 2 2 datasets several datasets for daily weather variables soil characteristics topographic features management practices and plant data were used as stics inputs daily weather data required for model simulation were minimum and maximum 2 m air temperature c solar radiation mjm 2 precipitation mm wind speed ms 1 water vapour pressure hpa and near surface atmospheric co2 concentration ppmv these variables were retrieved for the baseline period 1981 2005 from the evaluation run of the regional climate model rcm smhi rca4 samuelsson et al 2011 forced by the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 it is an observation based dataset thus representing the actual atmospheric conditions over the baseline data was extracted over the portuguese mainland at a spatial resolution of 0 125 latitude longitude approximately corresponding to 1350 gridboxes regarding the climate change projections smhi rca4 rcm was driven by two different

this future scenario co2 emissions are projected to rise until the end of the 21st century resulting in an intensification of heat and water stresses over portugal although rcp4 5 was also considered a previous study shows that this scenarios projects similar impacts on viticultural yields in portugal fraga et al 2016a the selected gcms have previously showed a high skill in simulating current atmospheric dynamical mechanisms over the north atlantic and western europe santos et al 2016 and may therefore be considered suitable for simulating future climates in portugal model data were first submitted to bias corrections using the evaluation run as a reference dee et al 2011 stics was initialized for each gridbox 1350 of each climate model for each year in the baseline 25 years 1981 2005 and future period 30 years 2041 2070 corresponding to approximately 150 000 simulations as the two climate models provided very similar outcomes not shown only the 2 model ensemble mean will be shown henceforth for each run the dominant most frequent soil characteristics and topographic features within each gridbox were set in stics the main soil characteristics were obtained from the harmonized world soil dataset fao and isric 2014 jones and thornton 2015 such as physical chemical properties e g bulk density albedo and ph of topsoil 30cm and subsoil 70cm the predominant topographic characteristics of each gridbox such as slope degree and elevation were obtained from the gtopo30 digital elevation dataset https lta cr usgs gov gtopo30 as it is not feasible to study all the existing varieties within each gridbox a single grapevine variety was selected for the simulations the most commonly planted variety in portugal aragonez syn tempranillo or tinta roriz was selected and considered for all gridboxes ivv 2015 the required stics parameterizations for this variety were previously defined by fraga et al 2015 viticultural management practices were also universally defined and therefore site independent for this purpose the default trellis system was cordon and vine density was set to 4000 vines ha 1 which are common parameters in portuguese vineyards in order to allow a better comparison between baseline and future yields while maintaining wine characteristics the simulated harvest dates were determined automatically by stics once berry water content reached 77 probable alcohol concentration in the wine of 12 5 v v garcía de cortazar atauri et al 2009 2 3 simulations and irrigation strategies previous studies indicate a general decrease in yields over portugal under climate change scenarios in case no adaptation measures are implemented fraga et al 2016a given this previous knowledge the main objective would be to minimize yield losses in the future therefore to assess the role played by irrigation on viticulture under future climates three trial runs are performed focusing on grapevine yields rainfed baseline period rainfed future period and irrigated future period the growing season precipitation gsp accumulated precipitation from april to september changes between the baseline and the future period are firstly assessed as well as its main impacts on yields the ratio between irrigated yields and non irrigated yields molden et al 1997 was also computed for the future period 2041 2070 irrigation was simulated for each year but only for the future period automatic irrigation is controlled by stics based on a pre defined level of the water stress index swfac parameter in the model which represents stomatal stress index brisson et al 2008 to reduce non beneficial water consumption and maximize crop water productivity irrigation is applied only when a certain level of plant water stress is reached for each gridbox five stress levels were tested ranging from high stress to low stress swfac 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 subsequently for each gridbox the irrigation amount that provides yields closer to the baseline was selected lowest deviation between future and baseline yields thus five irrigation maps amounts mm were generated for each stress level swfac 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 but only one final map was considered stics irrigation is applied as follows on a daily basis stics assesses the plant water status and when a certain stress threshold is reached irrigation is automatically started with a predefined dosage the irrigation simulates a dripping system buried at 10cm underground allowing to reduce non beneficial water consumption by ca 90 brisson et al 2008 the daily maximum amount of irrigation was set at 2mm following previous studies garcía de cortazar atauri 2006 3 results 3 1 baseline and future precipitation in the growing season portugal presents the highest amounts of gsp in the north western regions minho and beira atlântico wine regions and the lowest amounts in the southernmost regions alentejo and algarve fig 2 a as precipitation mostly occurs in the winter half of the year a typical feature of the mediterranean climates gsp is substantially lower than annual precipitation totals 20 30 data not shown under rcp8 5 the 2 model ensemble mean projects a clear drying trend over all of portugal fig 2b c more pronounced in the more humid regions the least affected regions by gsp decrease are the currently driest such as inner alentejo and algarve although these projections rely only on two gcm rcm model pairs the climate change signal is in clear agreement with the full ensemble provided by the euro cordex project jacob et al 2014 3 2 baseline and future yields grapevine yield modelled by stics fig 3 a shows higher values in the more humid coastal areas of the country and lower values in its innermost regions alentejo and douro overall simulated yields tend to overestimate the actual country s productivity which is typically around 3 8t ha ivv nonetheless this issue has already been reported by other studies using stics to model grapevine yields fraga et al 2015 valdes gomez et al 2009 the high resolution yield map shows great detail even allowing the differentiation of the three sub regions inside the douro porto winemaking region i e the west east yield gradient despite the overall agreement with empirical knowledge excluding the positive bias the validation of these yield maps becomes difficult as the only countrywide dataset of observed yields comprises a much coarser spatial resolution additionally these maps correspond to potential yields and do not take into account other factors such as yield limit enforcements pest and diseases impacts or some technical limitations not described by the model furthermore in these present study the specific soil characteristics used as model inputs represent the predominant soils inside each gridbox which may differ from the soils at vineyard level regarding future yields fig 3b c also in accordance to fraga et al 2016a projections indicate large decreases in productivity over the innermost half of the country future yields are 60 70 with respect to baseline in opposition in the coastal regions the yield reduction is much weaker 80 90 w r t baseline and there are even some yield increases in some areas 100 110 w r t baseline these outcomes are certainly tied to the projected decrease in gsp over these regions fig 2c which leads to high levels of water stress locally reducing yields 3 3 irrigation as an adaptation measure herein irrigation is applied as a possible adaptation measure against the decreasing yield projected for the future supplementary fig s1 cnrm

north south and west east gradient over portugal higher irrigation amounts are located in the inner south of alentejo 250mm or 2500m3 ha whereas lower irrigation values or even no irrigation are located in the northern coastal areas although some regional variability is present irrigation closely reflects the gsp patterns over portugal fig 2a by applying these irrigation levels yield losses for the future can be greatly alleviated fig 4b however the applied irrigation is not enough to completely mitigate the yield losses in inner alentejo and douro where yield values still decrease being 70 80 with respect to baseline this may indicate that additional water per day more than a maximum of 2mm or even additional measures may be required for these regions from the spatial averages of the yield change for each winemaking region table 1 it is clear that alentejo terras da beira and douro will be the most affected regions these are also the regions where irrigation will show a weaker mitigation effect on future yield decreases based on these findings a new metric was developed taking into account the required irrigation amounts and the absolute value of the gsp decrease under future climate change scenarios future minus baseline δ it is defined as the ratio between irrigation and the δ of gsp thus highlighting the most sensitive regions to water availability under future climates fig 5 a the most sensitive regions are southern alentejo southern terras da beira and inner algarve for these regions the required irrigation will exceed 5 8 times the reduction of precipitation for inner douro porto upper alentejo and tejo the irrigation required is around 4 times the gsp decrease regarding ratio between irrigated and non irrigated yields for the future scenario fig 5b it is clear that irrigation will definitely play a more important role in the inner regions of the country these results corroborate that the higher water input will not be enough to maintain present level yields 4 discussion the present study assesses the importance of irrigation as an adaptation measure to ensure the future sustainability of viticultural yields in portugal the stics crop model was used to simulate present and future grapevine yields in portugal pointing to a yield decrease over some of the innermost and most renowned winemaking regions of the country future projections also depict a decrease of the precipitation over these regions which partially explains the yield decrease furthermore the synergistic effect of severe heat and water stresses in the future may also lead to lower yields as an adaptation measure grapevine irrigation was tested for the future climates it should be noted that stics simulates crop water stress and irrigation is only applied at a certain water stress level mimicking a high efficiency water use strategy deficit irrigation strategies the results indicate that irrigation provides a general improvement in yields over the country without irrigation on average table 1 all regions are projected to have yield reduction in the future from lisboa 97 and minho 90 the least affected regions to alentejo 67 and terras da beira 67 the most affected regions it is important to note that minho has the largest average decrease in gsp 132mm but shows a relatively low decrease in yields 90 this gsp decrease is not very important as this region is one of the rainiest in europe after irrigation the region that has the strongest yield increase is douro porto from 74 to 90 table 1 thus making irrigation a plausible adaptation measure for the future although the only regions that reach 100 of the current yield level in the future are lisboa and minho table 1 in all other regions especially in alentejo and inner douro porto yield levels are still projected to decrease this decrease may be due to the synergistic effect of severe heat and water stresses keller 2010 in fact in most of the portuguese winemaking regions to attain future yields closer to current levels a higher amount of water must be supplied than the projected reduction in gsp table 1 and fig 5a this clearly indicates that future warming also has an important role in yield reduction which can be explained by the enhanced evapotranspiration demands and the higher number of days with severe heat stress under warmer climates van leeuwen and darriet 2016 it should be noted that stics projections take into account the beneficial effects of higher co2 in the future in fact fraga et al 2016a demonstrated that this effect partially mitigates the negative impacts of future climates on viticultural yields however some studies indicate that the beneficial effects of higher co2 concentrations may be lower than expected for perennial plants crops korner et al 2005 particularly in the long term as such it is possible that future yield decrease is even stronger than herein anticipated nonetheless other modelling limitations should be noted stics is a field scale model that only simulates water flows within a given grid cell rather than within a whole hydrological basin the model considers runoff and deep percolation at a single point as such the model does not take into account the interaction between different points in space though some runoff and deep percolation may occur depending on the precipitation projected by the climate models furthermore these local losses may or may not be reusable by downstream users which is another aspect not taken into account by the model given the projected yield levels for these

levels are carefully monitored and controlled this practice may indeed be beneficial in some cases costa et al 2016 van leeuwen and darriet 2016 one challenge to the proposed adaptation measure will be providing sufficient water during the necessary irrigation periods which coincide with the driest periods of the year in portugal traditional irrigation systems e g manual irrigation are still usually applied but often have high non beneficial water consumption high soil runoff and evaporation technological advances in irrigation science such as the adoption of deficit irrigation strategies as the drip system simulated in the current study will thereby be critical in the next decades however to meet irrigation demands the creation or maintenance of large water reservoirs is indeed one of the key aspects batista et al 2001 in portugal over the last decade a significant effort has been devoted to create a large artificial reservoir in the alentejo region alqueva dam for irrigation purposes which can also be used by regional viticulture nevertheless decision makers must ensure that these new approaches do not aggravate the adverse effects of increasing agricultural water usage including the sustainability of the water resources eea 2009 and the commitment to the eu water framework directive http ec europa eu environment water water framework index en html balanced decisions based on research and on innovation technologies and solutions should be envisioned in order to maintain the sustainability of both the winemaking sector and the environment 5 conclusions future projections for viticultural yield in portugal show decreases throughout the country particularly in the innermost winemaking regions the present study analyzed irrigation as a possible adaptation measure which may significantly alleviate some detrimental climate change impacts thus reducing the projected yield decreases nonetheless in some warmer and dryer regions such as inner alentejo and douro porto yield levels are still projected to decrease even with suitable irrigation hence given these projections additional adaptation measures should also be envisioned for the future

11599,climate change projections for southern europe reveal warming and drying trends for the upcoming decades bringing important challenges to portuguese viticulture in particular the present study analyses irrigation as an adaptation measure to ensure the future sustainability of viticultural yields in portugal the stics crop model was used to simulate baseline 1981 2005 and future 2041 2070 grapevine yields in portugal future yield decreases yields are 60 with respect to baseline over some of the innermost and most renowned winemaking regions of the country are found following the decrease of precipitation in the growing season as an adaptation measure grapevine irrigation was tested for future climates stics irrigation replicates a highly efficient water use strategy only applied when a certain water stress level is reached the results indicate higher yields with this irrigation strategy thus largely alleviating the projected yield decreases nonetheless in some warmer and dryer regions such as inner alentejo and douro porto yield levels are still projected to decrease with irrigation 70 80 of baseline yields though to a lesser extent when compared to non irrigated simulations this decrease is attributed to the synergistic effect of severe heat and water stresses in the future although these simulations aim at achieving the same yields and alcohol level in future scenarios as in baseline applying irrigation may modify the wine typicity of each region and threaten the currently scarce water resources outlining appropriate timely and cost effective adaptation measures is critical for the sustainability of both the environment and the national portuguese winemaking sector keywords viticulture climate change irrigation grapevine yield crop modelling portugal 1 introduction grapevine growth and development is largely controlled by atmospheric conditions jones and goodrich 2008 jones et al 2005 tonietto and carbonneau 2004 van leeuwen et al 2004 in fact weather factors such as temperatures solar radiation and water availability strongly influence vine growth and development which ultimately impact yield and wine quality makra et al 2009 van leeuwen et al 2008 although grapevines show a strong adaptation to different environmental conditions many of the renowned winemaking regions worldwide are located in areas with mediterranean type climates characterized by stressful conditions for plant growth fraga et al 2016a toth and vegvari 2016 van leeuwen and darriet 2016 in portugal fig 1 grapevines are often exposed to severe heat and water stresses in the most internal regions during summer in the douro porto wineregion fig 1 world renowned for its port wine total precipitation in the summer months june july august is usually around 100mm fraga et al 2015 water is essential for grapevine vegetative and reproductive growth being a major forcing factor of crop yields hardie and martin 2000 iglesias and garrote 2015 water availability while more critical at certain development stages will define in most the case the crop suitability feasibility in a specific area caubel et al 2015 severe water stress may result in a wide range of negative impacts such as low flower and berry set low leaf area limited photosynthesis flower abortion and cluster abscission during 1986 hardie and considine 1976 conversely excessive humidity overstimulates growth leading to denser canopies and higher risk of specific pests and diseases additionally for the production of a high quality wine a certain level of water stress at certain development stages may be required jones and davis 2000 nemani et al 2001 ramos et al 2008 reynolds and naylor 1994 storchi et al 2005 tonietto 1999 for the portuguese viticulture which is currently the european 5th largest wine producer with a total of 6 7 mhl ivv 2015 oiv 2015 precipitation is for most regions traditionally considered the only source of available water for plant growth in almost all of the 12 portuguese mainland viticultural regions fig 1 water stress levels can be severe especially in the warm and dry summers irrigation application is often not advised or even not allowed as it can alter grape yield and quality attributes in many european countries this practice has indeed been historically forbidden by strict wine regulations specifically established for each winemaking region this is also the case of the portuguese douro demarcated region where irrigation has been outlawed except in very specific cases e g experimental plots vineyards endangered due to excessive water stress despite this limitation viticultural irrigation in portugal has been increasing though still limited to the dryer inner southern areas of the country such as in alentejo costa et al 2016 permanhani et al 2016 climate change may challenge these traditional concepts fraga and santos 2017 fraga et al 2016b jones 2005 kenny and harrison 1992 neethling et al 2016 nesbitt et al 2016 toth and vegvari 2016 in the future the projected lower precipitations in southern europe combined with higher temperatures and more frequent and longer extreme climate events such as heat waves and extreme droughts ipcc 2013 santos et al 2017 may negatively affect final yields and quality attributes jones and alves 2012 a recent study clearly points to a decrease in yields over some areas of portugal under climate change scenarios if no adaptation measures are adopted fraga et al 2016a these findings are encouraging the research and development of climate change adaptation measures namely the implementation of irrigation systems costa et al 2016 permanhani et al 2016 as a result throughout southern europe many winemaking countries have been loosening their regulations regarding irrigation permanhani et al 2016 still the assessment of the potential positive effects of viticultural irrigation under climate change scenarios in portugal was not previously performed being of utmost importance for growers under the increasingly dryer portuguese climates water is considered a threatened resource water scarcity is increasing not only due to climate change but also due to population growth industrial use and intensive agriculture water demands amongst other factors hence applying irrigation to this historically rainfed crop brings additional economic environmental and social costs as adaptation to water scarcity is required under future climates costa et al 2016 smart e g deficit irrigation strategies should be implemented permanhani et al 2016 romero and martinez cutillas 2012 santos et al 2003 both to reduce non beneficial water consumption pereira et al 2012 perry 2011 and to optimize grape composition junquera et al 2012 providing a balanced solution between environmental costs and plant water requirements garcia et al 2012 many recent studies focus on the adaptation of grapevine under future warmer and dryer conditions by testing irrigation under controlled conditions and or in experimental vineyards bellvert et al 2014 chaves et al 2007 kizildeniz et al 2015 oliveira et al 2011 nonetheless a regional scale approach is still lacking which can provide an answer on how much irrigation water is required to mitigate the detrimental impacts of climate change a possible solution to this problem is through the use of crop models crop models dynamically simulate crop responses to management practices e g irrigation soil properties e g texture depth as well as crop physiological responses to atmospheric conditions e g air temperature precipitation co2 hence by coupling crop models with high resolution climatic simulations such as the regional climate models from the euro cordex project jacob et al 2014 a regional characterization of water requirements for grapevines can be accomplished the present study aims at characterizing present and future grapevine water requirements and its influences on yields therefore the present study objectives are four fold 1 to couple a dynamic crop model with high resolution climatic simulations for current and future climate change scenarios specifically adapted to the portuguese viticulture 2 to assess grapevine yield differences under future climates at a regional scale for each winemaking region 3 to simulate suitable irrigation strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on yield and 4 to analyze the impacts of the introduction of viticultural irrigation in the future 2 material and methods 2 1 the stics crop soil model grapevine modelling was performed using the stics simulateur multidisciplinaire pour les cultures standard crop model brisson et al 2008 developed by the french national institute for agronomic research inra this is one of the few crop models that can be applied to perennial crops such as grapevines this model has been tested and validated for grapevines under different management soil water conditions and irrigation regimes coucheney et al 2015 fraga et al 2015 valdes gomez et al 2009 furthermore this model has previously been used in assessing the impacts of climate change on european viticulture fraga et al 2016a for portugal using data from experimental vineyards this model has previously shown a high agreement between observed and simulated yields phenology and water stress levels fraga et al 2015 given the model high skill in simulating grapevine yields and water relations fraga et al 2015 garcía de cortazar atauri 2006 valdes gomez et al 2009 it was used herein to develop different irrigation strategies for climate change adaptation at a regional level 2 2 datasets several datasets for daily weather variables soil characteristics topographic features management practices and plant data were used as stics inputs daily weather data required for model simulation were minimum and maximum 2 m air temperature c solar radiation mjm 2 precipitation mm wind speed ms 1 water vapour pressure hpa and near surface atmospheric co2 concentration ppmv these variables were retrieved for the baseline period 1981 2005 from the evaluation run of the regional climate model rcm smhi rca4 samuelsson et al 2011 forced by the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 it is an observation based dataset thus representing the actual atmospheric conditions over the baseline data was extracted over the portuguese mainland at a spatial resolution of 0 125 latitude longitude approximately corresponding to 1350 gridboxes regarding the climate change projections smhi rca4 rcm was driven by two different global climate models gcm mpi m mpi esm lr giorgetta et al 2013 and cnrm cm5 voldoire et al 2013 under the representative concentration pathway rcp8 5 van vuuren et al 2011 and for 2041 2070 under this future scenario co2 emissions are projected to rise until the end of the 21st century resulting in an intensification of heat and water stresses over portugal although rcp4 5 was also considered a previous study shows that this scenarios projects similar impacts on viticultural yields in portugal fraga et al 2016a the selected gcms have previously showed a high skill in simulating current atmospheric dynamical mechanisms over the north atlantic and western europe santos et al 2016 and may therefore be considered suitable for simulating future climates in portugal model data were first submitted to bias corrections using the evaluation run as a reference dee et al 2011 stics was initialized for each gridbox 1350 of each climate model for each year in the baseline 25 years 1981 2005 and future period 30 years 2041 2070 corresponding to approximately 150 000 simulations as the two climate models provided very similar outcomes not shown only the 2 model ensemble mean will be shown henceforth for each run the dominant most frequent soil characteristics and topographic features within each gridbox were set in stics the main soil characteristics were obtained from the harmonized world soil dataset fao and isric 2014 jones and thornton 2015 such as physical chemical properties e g bulk density albedo and ph of topsoil 30cm and subsoil 70cm the predominant topographic characteristics of each gridbox such as slope degree and elevation were obtained from the gtopo30 digital elevation dataset https lta cr usgs gov gtopo30 as it is not feasible to study all the existing varieties within each gridbox a single grapevine variety was selected for the simulations the most commonly planted variety in portugal aragonez syn tempranillo or tinta roriz was selected and considered for all gridboxes ivv 2015 the required stics parameterizations for this variety were previously defined by fraga et al 2015 viticultural management practices were also universally defined and therefore site independent for this purpose the default trellis system was cordon and vine density was set to 4000 vines ha 1 which are common parameters in portuguese vineyards in order to allow a better comparison between baseline and future yields while maintaining wine characteristics the simulated harvest dates were determined automatically by stics once berry water content reached 77 probable alcohol concentration in the wine of 12 5 v v garcía de cortazar atauri et al 2009 2 3 simulations and irrigation strategies previous studies indicate a general decrease in yields over portugal under climate change scenarios in case no adaptation measures are implemented fraga et al 2016a given this previous knowledge the main objective would be to minimize yield losses in the future therefore to assess the role played by irrigation on viticulture under future climates three trial runs are performed focusing on grapevine yields rainfed baseline period rainfed future period and irrigated future period the growing season precipitation gsp accumulated precipitation from april to september changes between the baseline and the future period are firstly assessed as well as its main impacts on yields the ratio between irrigated yields and non irrigated yields molden et al 1997 was also computed for the future period 2041 2070 irrigation was simulated for each year but only for the future period automatic irrigation is controlled by stics based on a pre defined level of the water stress index swfac parameter in the model which represents stomatal stress index brisson et al 2008 to reduce non beneficial water consumption and maximize crop water productivity irrigation is applied only when a certain level of plant water stress is reached for each gridbox five stress levels were tested ranging from high stress to low stress swfac 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 subsequently for each gridbox the irrigation amount that provides yields closer to the baseline was selected lowest deviation between future and baseline yields thus five irrigation maps amounts mm were generated for each stress level swfac 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 but only one final map was considered stics irrigation is applied as follows on a daily basis stics assesses the plant water status and when a certain stress threshold is reached irrigation is automatically started with a predefined dosage the irrigation simulates a dripping system buried at 10cm underground allowing to reduce non beneficial water consumption by ca 90 brisson et al 2008 the daily maximum amount of irrigation was set at 2mm following previous studies garcía de cortazar atauri 2006 3 results 3 1 baseline and future precipitation in the growing season portugal presents the highest amounts of gsp in the north western regions minho and beira atlântico wine regions and the lowest amounts in the southernmost regions alentejo and algarve fig 2 a as precipitation mostly occurs in the winter half of the year a typical feature of the mediterranean climates gsp is substantially lower than annual precipitation totals 20 30 data not shown under rcp8 5 the 2 model ensemble mean projects a clear drying trend over all of portugal fig 2b c more pronounced in the more humid regions the least affected regions by gsp decrease are the currently driest such as inner alentejo and algarve although these projections rely only on two gcm rcm model pairs the climate change signal is in clear agreement with the full ensemble provided by the euro cordex project jacob et al 2014 3 2 baseline and future yields grapevine yield modelled by stics fig 3 a shows higher values in the more humid coastal areas of the country and lower values in its innermost regions alentejo and douro overall simulated yields tend to overestimate the actual country s productivity which is typically around 3 8t ha ivv nonetheless this issue has already been reported by other studies using stics to model grapevine yields fraga et al 2015 valdes gomez et al 2009 the high resolution yield map shows great detail even allowing the differentiation of the three sub regions inside the douro porto winemaking region i e the west east yield gradient despite the overall agreement with empirical knowledge excluding the positive bias the validation of these yield maps becomes difficult as the only countrywide dataset of observed yields comprises a much coarser spatial resolution additionally these maps correspond to potential yields and do not take into account other factors such as yield limit enforcements pest and diseases impacts or some technical limitations not described by the model furthermore in these present study the specific soil characteristics used as model inputs represent the predominant soils inside each gridbox which may differ from the soils at vineyard level regarding future yields fig 3b c also in accordance to fraga et al 2016a projections indicate large decreases in productivity over the innermost half of the country future yields are 60 70 with respect to baseline in opposition in the coastal regions the yield reduction is much weaker 80 90 w r t baseline and there are even some yield increases in some areas 100 110 w r t baseline these outcomes are certainly tied to the projected decrease in gsp over these regions fig 2c which leads to high levels of water stress locally

as the drip system simulated in the current study will thereby be critical in the next decades however to meet irrigation demands the creation or maintenance of large water reservoirs is indeed one of the key aspects batista et al 2001 in portugal over the last decade a significant effort has been devoted to create a large artificial reservoir in the alentejo region alqueva dam for irrigation purposes which can also be used by regional viticulture nevertheless decision makers must ensure that these new approaches do not aggravate the adverse effects of increasing agricultural water usage including the sustainability of the water resources eea 2009 and the commitment to the eu water framework directive http ec europa eu environment water water framework index en html balanced decisions based on research and on innovation technologies and solutions should be envisioned in order to maintain the sustainability of both the winemaking sector and the environment 5 conclusions future projections for viticultural yield in portugal show decreases throughout the country particularly in the innermost winemaking regions the present study analyzed irrigation as a possible adaptation measure which may significantly alleviate some detrimental climate change impacts thus reducing the projected yield decreases nonetheless in some warmer and dryer regions such as inner alentejo and douro porto yield levels are still projected to decrease even with suitable irrigation hence given these projections additional adaptation measures should also be envisioned for the future
