concurrent water use potential of popular grass species such as tall fescue festuca arundinacea schreb and hybrid bermudagrass cynodon dactylon l pers cynodon transvaalensis burtt davy the primary objective of this field study was to compare water use characteristics of tiftuf a recently released bermudagrass cultivar with reported drought tolerance with a commonly planted tall fescue bluegrass mix in north carolina a secondary objective was to quantify minimum irrigation requirements during establishment from sod when planted during spring and summer direct measurements of actual evapotranspiration eta were made through weighing of non water stressed lysimeters planted with triple threat tall fescue and tiftuf hybrid bermudagrass actual evapotranspiration rates during the first 14 days after planting dap were 3 3 and 4 3 mm d 1 for bermudagrass and tall fescue respectively averaged across spring plantings tall fescue eta 14 dap was no different during summer establishment while bermudagrass eta increased to 4 3 mm d 1 after 14 dap cumulative bermudagrass eta was 44 less than tall fescue when established in spring cumulative bermudagrass eta was similar to tall fescue 3 less following summer establishment both grasses provided acceptable turf quality tq 6 when planted during spring unlike tall fescue which resulted in unacceptable tq following summer

and survivability in the landscape air temperature sunlight rainfall and other abiotic factors greatly affect the adaptability of turfgrasses across various environments in the united states the influence of these factors help define the three primary regions of turfgrass adaptation the northern cool region the southern warm region and the transition zone furthermore the northern cool and southern warm regions are often subdivided into arid and humid regions emmons 2000 fry and huang 2004 turgeon 2008 the cool season grasses are best adapted to the northern cool region while the warm season grasses are most adapted to the southern warm region between these two regions is the transition zone defined as the 300 700 mile north to south area where the use of cool and warm season grasses overlap dunn and diesburg 2004 due to lack of adaptation of a single turfgrass careful consideration must be given when selecting a turfgrass in the transition zone based upon local environmental conditions north carolina is geographically considered part of the transition zone and as a result turfgrass managers often manage both cool and warm season grasses the most recent comprehensive survey conducted in north carolina indicated that 63 of single family dwellings maintained a cool season grass while 37 maintained warm season grass ncda 1999 tall fescue festuca arundinacea schreb is overwhelmingly the most common lawn grass in north carolina as it comprises 58 of north carolina lawns the improved drought and heat tolerance among the cool season grasses in addition to maintaining year round green color makes tall fescue an attractive choice for homeowners in the transition zone miller et al 2016 bermudagrass cynodon sp is a widely used warm season grass that ranks second among north carolina warm season lawn grasses the superior drought tolerance ability to establish quickly withstand wear and recover quickly from injury encourages the use of bermudagrass however in order for grasses to remain functional in the landscape inputs such as water supplied through supplemental irrigation are required during periods of extended stress the conservation of potable water continues to be a primary concern for many municipalities and water purveyors around the world landscape irrigation is often part of this concern as it has been reported that the majority of the 16 million ha of turfgrass in the united states is irrigated to some extent which is three times the area of any other crop milesi et al 2005 mayer et al 1999 reported that

usually requires the substitution of a cool season grass with a warm season grass that may not be adapted to localized stresses although many use characteristics must be considered when selecting a turfgrass for use in the transition zone it is imperative to consider water use potential of available turfgrasses as water conservation efforts continue measured evapotranspiration eta rates under non limiting soil moisture conditions are routinely used to define water use requirements for turfgrasses previous research has found that tall fescue eta rates range from 3 0 to 9 7 mm d 1 in arid

challenging in the transition zone as both cool and warm season grasses experience elevated stress at various times annually in order to best conserve water reserves turf managers must consider turfgrasses that use less water many of the new turfgrasses available today have been developed to better tolerate drought conditions in 2016 the university of georgia released tiftuf bermudagrass

sod when planted during the spring and summer 2 materials and methods 2 1 lysimeter establishment and management turfgrass water use measurements were collected from may through october during 2017 and 2018 at the lake wheeler turfgrass field laboratory in raleigh nc field lysimeters were constructed from 25 4 cm diameter schedule 40 polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe cut to 33 cm lengths steel rods were inserted through the wall of the pvc pipe to support 6 mm pvc foam board bottom plate recessed 2 54 cm from the bottom of pvc pipe resulting in an effective lysimeter depth of 30 5 cm and 15 444 cm3 volume four 1 75 cm holes were threaded into the bottom pvc foam board allowing for drainage during the establishment of field capacity lysimeter bottom plates were also lined with geotextile fabric to prevent media loss through drainage holes during active measurement holes were plugged with 2 54 cm plugs to prevent water loss to drainage experimental lysimeters were filled with profile greens grade porous ceramic soil amendment profile porous ceramic greens grade buffalo grove il and established with washed triple threat tall fescue festuca arundinacea schreb and tiftuf hybrid bermudagrass cynodon dactylon l pers cynodon transvaalensis burtt davy sod measuring 510 cm2 during may and july of 2017 and 2018 after planting lysimeters were inserted into in ground plastic sleeves which were installed to prevent native soil adherence to lysimeter outer walls in ground holes were also lined with rock below lysimeters to allow for drainage of excess water complete instructions detailing lysimeter construction can be found in a published manuscript by wherley et al 2009 lysimeters were maintained at 10 2 and 5 1 cm mowing heights for tall fescue and bermudagrass respectively using a honda hrx217hza walk behind mower honda power equipment alpharetta ga with clippings returned a starter fertilizer siteone landscape supply roswell ga containing 18 n 24 p2o5 12 k2o was applied based on a p2o5 rate of 24 5 kg ha 1 during each lysimeter planting following planting monthly fertility was applied to all lysimeters at n rates of 24 5 and 49 kg ha 1 depending on species and month tall fescue lysimeters received 49 kg n rates during may september and october while bermudagrass received 49 kg n rates during june july and august a sulfur coated urea fertilizer reed perrine sales tennent nj containing micronutrients and an analysis of 25 n 5 p2o5 10 k2o was used for all monthly fertilizer applications preventative fungicide applications were made every 21 days from june through september to control brown patch rhizoctonia solani and gray leaf spot pyricularia grisea in tall fescue with axozystrobin at 0 6 kg a i ha 1 all management practices were selected based upon recommendations detailed in carolina lawns miller et al 2016 2 2 measurement of actual and reference evapotranspiration lysimeters were housed underneath a portable rainout shelter four season tools kansas city mo to prevent rainfall interference allowing for continuous measurement managed vegetation surrounding lysimeters were identical to experimental lysimeters specifically lysimeters planted with tiftuf were surrounded by established tiftuf hybrid bermudagrass while triple threat lysimeters were surrounded by established tall fescue resulting in a homogenous surface the managed turfgrass area surrounding experimental lysimeters was hand watered to prevent water stress thus preventing micro advective interference an s beam load cell cas s beam ntep coc 96 073a1 east rutherford nj powered by a digital indicator salter brecknell 200 sl salter brecknell weighing products fairmont mn mounted to a tripod hoist cabela s inc springfield mo was used to quantify turfgrass water use during all weighing events measurements of actual evapotranspiration eta were made daily from the initial plant date until 14 days after planting dap between 0600 and 0800 h during all establishment periods following 14 dap eta measurements were collected every 48 to 72 h until october of both years in order to maintain adequate moisture while turfgrass sod began root establishment water applied to all lysimeters during the first week of active measurement varied following each individual planting given the environmental conditions that were present following spring lysimeter establishment water was added at increments of 3 mm up to 3 times daily 0800 1200 and 1600 h resulting in a maximum daily total of 9 mm applied water depth was increased during summer establishment to 4 mm per application with the daily maximum equaling 12 mm the number of applications were determined by the environmental conditions present each day with daily water depth totals found in table 1 after the first week water added was determined by turfgrass water use during the previous weighing interval the corresponding mass was recorded for each lysimeter at planting the difference in mass the following weigh event plus water added was the result of eta after the first month of data collection lysimeters were saturated and allowed to drain for a period of 24 h to establish field capacity for the remainder of water use measurements lysimeters were maintained at field capacity to maintain well watered non stressed conditions throughout the study meteorological data required for reference evapotranspiration eto calculation was collected at 30 min intervals by an on site hobo micro weather station data logger onset corporation bourne ma reference evapotranspiration was determined by the asce ewri standardized method for short grass canopies using the following equation allen et al 2005 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is short

coefficients kc were derived for each grass by dividing eta by eto during weeks two and three to identify irrigation required during grow in 2 3 visual turfgrass quality ratings in addition to turfgrass water use measurements turfgrass quality ratings were made every two weeks beginning one month after planting according to guidelines established by the national turfgrass evaluation program ntep using a 1 9 scale 1 brown low quality turf 9 green high quality morris and shearman 1998 turf quality ratings 6 were considered minimally acceptable 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analyses for water use measurements and turf quality data were performed using statistical analysis system version 9 4 2013 sas institute inc cary nc experimental lysimeters were arranged in a rcbd and data subjected to anova to determine treatment effects using the proc mixed procedure fixed and random effects were assigned based upon guidelines presented by vargas et al 2018 significant interactions were identified and subjected to fisher s protected lsd test at the 0 05 probability level 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological conditions meteorological data collected throughout the study can be found in table 2 minimum air temperature ranged from 2 1 to 17 3 c during the two year study in may and october nightly air temperatures were reduced closer to 4 4 c however minimum air temperature was nearly 5 degrees warmer in may 2018 compared to 2017 maximum air temperature fluctuated much less compared to minimum air temperatures during both years of data collection maximum air temperature was 32 c only once october 2017 maximum air temperature had greater variation during 2017 with values ranging from 30 7 to 37 1 c relative humidity averages remained consistent throughout september 2018 relative humidity was highest 80 1 due to excess moisture as the result of two tropical weather events as expected incoming solar radiation was greatest during the summer months and was reduced during may september and october 3 2 initial turfgrass eta following planting within 14 dap tall fescue and bermudagrass eta varied during spring and summer plantings across both years of the study p 0 0001 fig 1 in 2017 tall fescue eta ranged from 1 0 to 8 0 mm d 1 following spring planting and from 3 4 to 7 3 mm d 1 following summer establishment bermudagrass eta ranged from 0 4 to 5 3 mm d 1 and 2 9 to 5 4 mm d 1 during spring and summer plantings respectively in 2017 during spring of 2018 minimum eta for both tall fescue and bermudagrass was 1 4 mm d 1 maximum eta measured was 5 3 and 4 8 mm d 1 for tall fescue and bermudagrass respectively tall fescue and bermudagrass eta was similar following the 2018 summer planting with ranges of 1 9 6 5 mm d 1 and 1 4 5 9 mm d 1 on average tall fescue used 30 more 4 3 vs 3 3 mm d 1 water than bermudagrass during the 14 dap when established in may however averaged water use was not different between the two grasses when established in july both averaged 4 3 mm d 1 differences in daily turfgrass water use following establishment in may 2017 were more frequent compared to 2018 as 8 out of 14 days indicated significant differences in turfgrass eta similar results occurred following summer establishment in 2017 and 2018 8 and 5 days respectively as expected turfgrass water use for all plantings was heavily influenced by environmental conditions lower eto measured 1 and 3 dap during spring 2017 resulted in lower eta for both grasses fig 1 overall eta was rarely 6 mm d 1 for either grass regardless of eto due to lack of rooting and subsequent lower transpirational water loss unlike bermudagrass increases in tall fescue eta were not measured following both summer plantings this was likely due to the elevated heat stress experienced by the cool season turf resulting in greater water conservation through the closing of plant stomata fry and huang 2004 3 3 turfgrass crop coefficients kc following planting crop coefficients were derived for tall fescue and bermudagrass during the second and third weeks following planting turfgrass crop coefficients were not determined during wk 1 as the result of watering to ensure adequate moisture rather than according to turfgrass eta during new root development derived kc for tall fescue and bermudagrass was lower than previously reported values as the result of a less developed root system carrow 1995 when established in may averaged turfgrass kc was 0 65 and 0 51 for tall fescue and bermudagrass respectively during july establishment bermudagrass kc dropped to 0 48 while tall fescue kc was reduced by 32 to 0 44 irrigation amounts are often in excess during turfgrass establishment in order to prevent stress this is particularly true for cool season grasses that are established in stress inducing conditions similar to conditions present during july in the transition zone although water was applied based upon previous day use tall fescue continued to conserve water following july establishment unlike bermudagrass furthermore results indicated that irrigation amounts immediately following planting in may can be reduced without inducing water stress in the transition zone specifically scheduling irrigation based upon a percentage of eto for both tall fescue 0 65 and bermudagrass 0 51 can be an effective way to conserve potable water during the second and third week after turfgrass establishment in the subsequent weeks following summer bermudagrass establishment irrigating to 0 48 of eto can be implemented in effort to conserve water 3 4 seasonal turfgrass eta water use was consistently different among the two grasses resulting in significance of the highest order date year planting species nested term p 0 0001 therefore interspecific differences among species were measured over short time periods as a result eta was averaged for monthly use during both years of the study tall fescue water use ranged from 3 0 to 7 8 mm d 1 when established in spring table 3 measured tall fescue eta was lower compared to previous trials kopec et al 1988 bowman and macaulay 1991 humid conditions experienced in the lower transition zone likely contributed to lower eta lower water use rates were consistently measured during october of both years furthermore a major difference in tall fescue eta was measured during may 2017 compared to may 2018 tall fescue eta was much lower in 2018 3 3 mm d 1 compared to 2017 6 1 mm d 1 while bermudagrass eta remained consistent in 2017 tall fescue used 53 more water compared to bermudagrass while in 2018 tall fescue eta was 13 less warmer air temperatures in late may 2018 limited ideal growing conditions for tall fescue and as a result eta was reduced for tall fescue while bermudagrass was unaffected spring established tall fescue used the most water during june and july both years in 2017 tall fescue water use peaked in july at 7 4 mm d 1 while in 2018 the highest measured water use of 7 8 mm d 1 occurred in june during these two months tall fescue eta was 51 and 42 higher than bermudagrass respectively spring established bermudagrass was much more consistent across years bermudagrass eta ranged from 1 9 mm d 1 in october 2017 to 5 5 mm d 1 in june 2018 consistent with eta measured in previous studies kim and beard 2010 carrow 1995 wherley et al 2015 amgain et al 2018 trends in turfgrass eta were varied when established during the summer table 3 tall fescue eta was much lower following establishment in july compared to may during the months following summer establishment tall fescue water use ranged from 2 1 mm d 1 in july 2018 to 5 0 mm d 1 in september 2017 over the two years of study when comparing summer established tall fescue eta to that of tall fescue planted in the spring water use was reduced by 65 27 17 and 6 from july october respectively this reduction was likely due to reduced root development as the result of increased heat stress during the first two months following the summer planting of tall fescue sod by october tall fescue water use was similar for both spring and summer established sod as cooler temperatures in september and october promoted recovery of summer established tall fescue conversely bermudagrass eta was consistent with the exception of july summer established bermudagrass used 16 and 30 less water in july 2017 and 2018 respectively compared to bermudagrass planted during the spring of both years this can be attributed to a less developed root system resulting in lower water use however one month following planting august summer established bermudagrass eta was no different compared to bermudagrass established in spring the ability to better tolerate heat during the summer allowed for adequate bermudagrass root development and subsequent establishment 3 5 cumulative tall fescue and bermudagrass eta cumulative eta of tall fescue and bermudagrass maintained under non limiting soil moisture was summarized from may october in 2017 and 2018 data indicated spring established tall fescue required 44 more water than bermudagrass when averaged across both years of study fig 2 specifically consumptive water use of tall fescue was 30 and 22 cm more than bermudagrass during 2017 and 2018 respectively in a manhattan ks study researchers found tall fescue water use rates to be 35 greater than bermudagrass similar differences were found in two studies conducted in desert like arid conditions kneebone and pepper 2010 qian et al 1996 data collected during this field study indicated a larger discrepancy in water use suggesting greater water saving potential with newer bermudagrass cultivars although a shorter measurement period differences in cumulative tall fescue and bermudagrass eta were less when planted during summer in 2017 tall fescue better recovered from heat stress experienced during july establishment compared to 2018 as evidenced by the increased water use in september and october fig 2 cumulative water use among the two grasses in 2018 was identical following july establishment to bring potential cost savings into perspective monthly water rate fees were referenced from the town of cary toc 2008 north carolina the toc has a tiered rate structure for single family residential properties that charge 6 85 usd per 3785 l up to 56 781 l for monthly use volumes exceeding 56 781 l the rate per 3785 l increases to 12 94 usd based upon measured monthly turfgrass eta and historical effective rainfall data for the toc cumulative irrigation usage and associated costs can be found in fig 3 data indicated irrigating a 716 m2 tall fescue lawn from may october requires 464 589 l of water accounting for a total cost of 1437 19 usd in order to replace water lost to evapotranspiration bermudagrass required 272 949 l of irrigation that totaled 727 42 usd nearly half the cost of irrigating tall fescue depending on adaptability and level of irrigation management considerable water and monetary savings can be achieved when managing bermudagrass in place of tall fescue in the transition zone 3 6 turfgrass quality visual turfgrass quality ratings were also collected throughout water use measurements lysimeters were maintained to prevent stress therefore spring established turf quality was rated above the minimally acceptable value of 6 during all rating dates for both grasses fig 4 bermudagrass quality was rated higher than tall fescue during all months bermudagrass quality remained static throughout evaluations as monthly averaged quality ratings failed to fall below 8 similar to bermudagrass tall fescue quality varied little with ratings ranging between 7 and 8 from june october when established during summer tall fescue quality ratings failed to reach an acceptable level fig 5 bermudagrass quality was rated at least 43 higher than tall fescue from august october for all summer established lysimeters growth patterns of the two turfgrass species provide explanation for differences in turf quality since majority of data collection occurred during summer favoring bermudagrass growth christians 2004 research completed by peacock 2001 indicated that tall fescue sod required at least 70 mm cumulative irrigation one week after planting during the summer in order to maintain a minimally acceptable turf quality of 6 during the first week after 2017 and 2018 summer plantings we applied 84 and 72 mm of irrigation respectively and failed to maintain acceptable tall fescue quality similar environmental conditions were present during both studies however the 2001 trial had additional rainfall to supplement the 70 mm irrigation 4 conclusions this two year field study was completed to evaluate the water conservation potential of tiftuf bermudagrass compared to triple threat tall fescue when managed in the transition zone results indicated that maintaining tiftuf can potentially conserve up to 30 cm of irrigation over a six month period compared to tall fescue when managed under non limiting soil moisture conditions immediately following planting 14 dap tall fescue required 30 more water than bermudagrass when planted in spring however water use rates following summer establishment were similar for both grasses due to water conservation strategies employed by tall fescue while experiencing heat stress these strategies also resulted in unacceptable turf quality during the subsequent weeks following planting scheduling irrigation as a percentage of eto can be an effective way to conserve water during establishment tall fescue kc during the second and third weeks following spring planting was determined to be 0 65 while bermudagrass kc was 0 5 following both spring and summer plantings although applied irrigation matched turfgrass water use tall fescue was unable to maintain minimally acceptable turf quality when established during the summer when planted in the spring both tall fescue and bermudagrass were able to maintain acceptable turf quality tiftuf bermudagrass water use from may to october was lower compared to triple threat tall fescue in north carolina demonstrating its water saving potential in the transition zone using less water and the ability to maintain functionality during periods of heat stress make tiftuf an attractive option in the landscape however there are often limitations to bermudagrass use in the landscape most notably in areas with extensive shade therefore much consideration should occur to determine turfgrass adaptability to localized environments prior to establishment when landscape microclimates are conducive for bermudagrass growth the use of new cultivars like tiftuf can be an effective way to conserve potable water as a result of decreased irrigation acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge raymond mccauley for technical support received throughout this research

and 2018 at the lake wheeler turfgrass field laboratory in raleigh nc field lysimeters were constructed from 25 4 cm diameter schedule 40 polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe cut to 33 cm lengths steel rods were inserted through the wall of the pvc pipe to support 6 mm pvc foam board bottom plate recessed 2 54 cm from the bottom of pvc pipe resulting in an effective lysimeter depth of 30 5 cm and 15 444 cm3 volume four 1 75 cm holes were threaded into the bottom pvc foam board allowing for drainage during the establishment of field capacity lysimeter bottom plates were also lined with geotextile fabric to prevent media loss through drainage holes during active measurement holes were plugged with 2 54 cm plugs to prevent water loss to drainage experimental lysimeters were filled with profile greens grade porous ceramic soil amendment profile porous ceramic greens grade buffalo grove il and established with washed triple threat tall fescue festuca arundinacea schreb and tiftuf hybrid bermudagrass cynodon dactylon l pers cynodon transvaalensis burtt davy sod measuring 510 cm2 during may and july of 2017 and 2018 after planting lysimeters were inserted into in ground plastic sleeves which were installed to prevent native soil adherence to lysimeter outer walls in ground holes were also lined with rock below lysimeters to allow for drainage of excess water complete instructions detailing lysimeter construction can be found in a published manuscript by wherley et al 2009 lysimeters were maintained at 10 2 and 5 1 cm mowing heights for tall fescue and bermudagrass respectively using a honda hrx217hza walk behind mower honda power equipment alpharetta ga with clippings returned a starter fertilizer siteone landscape supply roswell ga containing 18 n 24 p2o5 12 k2o was applied based on a p2o5 rate of 24 5 kg ha 1 during each lysimeter planting following planting monthly fertility was applied to all lysimeters at n rates of 24 5 and 49 kg ha 1 depending on species and month tall fescue lysimeters received 49 kg n rates during may september and october while bermudagrass received 49 kg n rates during june july and august a sulfur coated urea fertilizer reed perrine sales tennent nj containing micronutrients and an analysis of 25 n 5 p2o5 10 k2o was used for all monthly fertilizer applications preventative fungicide applications were made every 21 days from june through september to control brown patch rhizoctonia solani and gray leaf spot pyricularia grisea in tall fescue with axozystrobin at 0 6 kg a i ha 1 all management practices were selected based upon recommendations detailed in carolina lawns miller et al 2016 2 2 measurement of actual and reference evapotranspiration lysimeters were housed underneath a portable rainout shelter four season tools kansas city mo to prevent rainfall interference allowing for continuous measurement managed vegetation surrounding lysimeters were identical to experimental lysimeters specifically lysimeters planted with tiftuf were surrounded by established tiftuf hybrid bermudagrass while triple threat lysimeters were surrounded by established tall fescue resulting in a homogenous surface the managed turfgrass area surrounding experimental lysimeters was hand watered to prevent water stress thus preventing micro advective interference an s beam load cell cas s beam ntep coc 96 073a1 east rutherford nj powered by a digital indicator salter brecknell 200 sl salter brecknell weighing products fairmont mn mounted to a tripod hoist cabela s inc springfield mo was used to quantify turfgrass water use during all weighing events measurements of actual evapotranspiration eta were made daily from the initial plant date until 14 days after planting dap between 0600 and 0800 h during all establishment periods following 14 dap eta measurements were collected every 48 to 72 h until october of both years in order to maintain adequate moisture while turfgrass sod began root establishment water applied to all lysimeters during the first week of active measurement varied following each individual planting given the environmental conditions that were present following spring lysimeter establishment water was added at increments of 3 mm up to 3 times daily 0800 1200 and 1600 h resulting in a maximum daily total of 9 mm applied water depth was increased during summer establishment to 4 mm per application with the daily maximum equaling 12 mm the number of applications were determined by the environmental conditions present each day with daily water depth totals found in table 1 after the first week water added was determined by turfgrass water use during the previous weighing interval the corresponding mass was recorded for each lysimeter at planting the difference in mass the following weigh event plus water added was the result of eta after the first month of data collection lysimeters were saturated and allowed to drain for a period of 24 h to establish field capacity for the remainder of water use measurements lysimeters were maintained at field capacity to maintain well watered non stressed conditions throughout the study meteorological data required for reference evapotranspiration eto calculation was collected at 30 min intervals by an on site hobo micro weather station data logger onset corporation bourne ma reference evapotranspiration was determined by the asce ewri standardized method for short grass canopies using the following equation allen et al 2005 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is short

saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is actual vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 turfgrass crop coefficients kc were derived for each grass by dividing eta by eto during weeks two and three to identify irrigation required during grow in 2 3 visual turfgrass quality ratings in addition to turfgrass water use measurements turfgrass quality ratings were made every two weeks beginning one month after planting according to guidelines established by the national turfgrass evaluation program ntep using a 1 9 scale 1 brown low quality turf 9 green high quality morris and shearman 1998 turf quality ratings 6 were considered minimally acceptable 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analyses for water use measurements and turf quality data were performed using statistical analysis system version 9 4 2013 sas institute inc cary nc experimental lysimeters were arranged in a rcbd and data subjected to anova to determine treatment effects using the proc mixed procedure fixed and random effects were assigned based upon guidelines presented by vargas et al 2018 significant interactions were identified and subjected to fisher s protected lsd test at the 0 05 probability level 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological conditions meteorological data collected throughout the study can be found in table 2 minimum air temperature ranged from 2 1 to 17 3 c during the two year study in may and october nightly air temperatures were reduced closer to 4 4 c however minimum air temperature was nearly 5 degrees warmer in may 2018 compared to 2017 maximum air temperature fluctuated much less compared to minimum air temperatures during both years of data collection maximum air temperature was 32 c only once october 2017 maximum air temperature had greater variation during 2017 with values ranging from 30 7 to 37 1 c relative humidity averages remained consistent throughout september 2018 relative humidity was highest 80 1 due to excess moisture as the result of two tropical weather events as expected incoming solar radiation was greatest during the summer months and was reduced during may september and october 3 2 initial turfgrass eta following planting within 14 dap tall fescue and bermudagrass eta varied during spring and summer plantings across both years of the study p 0 0001 fig 1 in 2017 tall fescue eta ranged from 1 0 to 8 0 mm d 1 following spring planting and from 3 4 to 7 3 mm d 1 following summer establishment bermudagrass eta ranged from 0 4 to 5 3 mm d 1 and 2 9 to 5 4 mm d 1 during spring and summer plantings respectively in 2017 during spring of 2018 minimum eta for both tall fescue and bermudagrass was 1 4 mm d 1 maximum eta measured was 5 3 and 4 8 mm d 1 for tall fescue and bermudagrass respectively tall fescue and bermudagrass eta was similar following the 2018 summer planting with ranges of 1 9 6 5 mm d 1 and 1 4 5 9 mm d 1 on average tall fescue used 30 more 4 3 vs 3 3 mm d 1 water than bermudagrass during the 14 dap when established in may however averaged water use was not different between the two grasses when established in july both averaged 4 3 mm d 1 differences in daily turfgrass water use following establishment in may 2017 were more frequent compared to 2018 as 8 out of 14 days indicated significant differences in turfgrass eta similar results occurred following summer establishment in 2017 and 2018 8 and 5 days respectively as expected turfgrass water use for all plantings was heavily influenced by environmental conditions lower eto measured 1 and 3 dap during spring 2017 resulted in lower eta for both grasses fig 1 overall eta was rarely 6 mm d 1 for either grass regardless of eto due to lack of rooting and subsequent lower transpirational water loss unlike bermudagrass increases in tall fescue eta were not measured following both summer plantings this was likely due to the elevated heat stress experienced by the cool season turf resulting in greater water conservation through the closing of plant stomata fry and huang 2004 3 3 turfgrass crop coefficients kc following planting crop coefficients were derived for tall fescue and bermudagrass during the second and third weeks following planting turfgrass crop coefficients were not determined during wk 1 as the result of watering to ensure adequate moisture rather than according to turfgrass eta during new root development derived kc for tall fescue and bermudagrass was lower than previously reported values as the result of a less developed root system carrow 1995 when established in may averaged turfgrass kc was 0 65 and 0 51 for tall fescue and bermudagrass respectively during july establishment bermudagrass kc dropped to 0 48 while tall fescue kc was reduced by 32 to 0 44 irrigation amounts are often in excess during turfgrass establishment in order to prevent stress this is particularly true for cool season grasses that are established in stress inducing conditions similar to conditions present during july in the transition zone although water was applied based upon previous day use tall fescue continued to conserve water following july establishment unlike bermudagrass furthermore results indicated that irrigation amounts immediately following planting in may can be reduced without inducing water stress in the transition zone specifically scheduling irrigation based upon a percentage of eto for both tall fescue 0 65 and bermudagrass 0 51 can be an effective way to conserve potable water during the second and third week after turfgrass establishment in the subsequent weeks following summer bermudagrass establishment irrigating to 0 48 of eto can be implemented in effort to conserve water 3 4 seasonal turfgrass eta water use was consistently different among the two grasses resulting in significance of the highest order date year planting species nested term p 0 0001 therefore interspecific differences among species were measured over short time periods as a result eta was averaged for monthly use during both years of the study tall fescue water use ranged from 3 0 to 7 8 mm d 1 when established in spring table 3 measured tall fescue eta was lower compared to previous trials kopec et al 1988 bowman and macaulay 1991 humid conditions experienced in the lower transition zone likely contributed to lower eta lower water use rates were consistently measured during october of both years furthermore a major difference in tall fescue eta was measured during may 2017 compared to may 2018 tall fescue eta was much lower in 2018 3 3 mm d 1 compared to 2017 6 1 mm d 1 while bermudagrass eta remained consistent in 2017 tall fescue used 53 more water compared to bermudagrass while in 2018 tall fescue eta was 13 less warmer air temperatures in late may 2018 limited ideal growing conditions for tall fescue and as a result eta was reduced for tall fescue while bermudagrass was unaffected spring established tall fescue used the most water during june and july both years in 2017 tall fescue water use peaked in july at 7 4 mm d 1 while in 2018 the highest measured water use of 7 8 mm d 1 occurred in june during these two months tall fescue eta was 51 and 42 higher than bermudagrass respectively spring established bermudagrass was much more consistent across years bermudagrass eta ranged from 1 9 mm d 1 in october 2017 to 5 5 mm d 1 in june 2018 consistent with eta measured in previous studies kim and beard 2010 carrow 1995 wherley et al 2015 amgain et al 2018 trends in turfgrass eta were varied when established during the summer table 3 tall fescue eta was much lower following establishment in july compared to may during the months following summer establishment tall fescue water use ranged from 2 1 mm d 1 in july 2018 to 5 0 mm d 1 in september 2017 over the two years of study when comparing summer established tall fescue eta to that of tall fescue planted in the spring water use was reduced by 65 27 17 and 6 from july october respectively this reduction was likely due to reduced root development as the result of increased heat stress during the first two months following the summer planting of tall fescue sod by october tall fescue water use was similar for both spring and summer established sod as cooler temperatures in september and october promoted recovery of summer established tall fescue conversely bermudagrass eta was consistent with the exception of july summer established bermudagrass used 16 and 30 less water in july 2017 and 2018 respectively compared to bermudagrass planted during the spring of both years this can be attributed to a less developed root system resulting in lower water use however one month following planting august summer established bermudagrass eta was no different compared to bermudagrass established in spring the ability to better tolerate heat during the summer allowed for adequate bermudagrass root development and subsequent establishment 3 5 cumulative tall fescue and bermudagrass eta cumulative eta of tall fescue and bermudagrass maintained under non limiting soil moisture was summarized from may october in 2017 and 2018 data indicated spring established tall fescue required 44 more water than bermudagrass when averaged across both years of study fig 2 specifically consumptive water use of tall fescue was 30 and 22 cm more than bermudagrass during 2017 and 2018 respectively in a manhattan ks study researchers found tall fescue water use rates to be 35 greater than bermudagrass similar differences were found in two studies conducted in desert like arid conditions kneebone and pepper 2010 qian et al 1996 data collected during this field study indicated a larger discrepancy in water use suggesting greater water saving potential with newer bermudagrass cultivars although a shorter measurement period differences in cumulative tall fescue and bermudagrass eta were less when planted during summer in 2017 tall fescue better recovered from heat stress experienced during july establishment compared to 2018 as evidenced by the increased water use in september and october fig 2 cumulative water use among the two grasses in 2018 was identical following july establishment to bring potential cost savings into perspective monthly water rate fees were referenced from the town of cary toc 2008 north carolina the toc has a tiered rate structure for single family residential properties that charge 6 85 usd per 3785 l up to 56 781 l for monthly use volumes exceeding 56 781 l the rate per 3785 l increases to 12 94 usd based upon measured monthly turfgrass eta and historical effective rainfall data for the toc cumulative irrigation usage and associated costs can be found in fig 3 data indicated irrigating a 716 m2 tall fescue lawn from may october requires 464 589 l of water accounting for a total cost of 1437 19 usd in order to replace water lost to evapotranspiration bermudagrass required 272 949 l of irrigation that totaled 727 42 usd nearly half the cost of irrigating tall fescue depending on adaptability and level of irrigation management considerable water and monetary savings can be achieved when managing bermudagrass in place of tall fescue in the transition zone 3 6 turfgrass quality visual turfgrass quality ratings were also collected throughout water use measurements lysimeters were maintained to prevent stress therefore spring established turf quality was rated above the minimally acceptable value of 6 during all rating dates for both grasses fig 4 bermudagrass quality was rated higher than tall fescue during all months bermudagrass quality remained static throughout evaluations as monthly averaged quality ratings failed to fall below 8 similar to bermudagrass tall fescue quality varied little with ratings ranging between 7 and 8 from june october when established during summer tall fescue quality ratings failed to reach an acceptable level fig 5 bermudagrass quality was rated at least 43 higher than tall fescue from august october for all summer established lysimeters growth patterns of the two turfgrass species provide explanation for differences in turf quality since majority of data collection occurred during summer favoring bermudagrass growth christians 2004 research completed by peacock 2001 indicated that tall fescue sod required at least 70 mm cumulative irrigation one week after planting during the summer in order to maintain a minimally acceptable turf quality of 6 during the first week after 2017 and 2018 summer plantings we applied 84 and 72 mm of irrigation respectively and failed to maintain acceptable tall fescue quality similar environmental conditions were present during both studies however the 2001 trial had additional rainfall to supplement the 70 mm irrigation 4 conclusions this two year field study was completed to evaluate the water conservation potential of tiftuf bermudagrass compared to triple threat tall fescue when managed in the transition zone results indicated that maintaining tiftuf can potentially conserve up to 30 cm of irrigation over a six month period compared to tall fescue when managed under non limiting soil moisture conditions immediately following planting 14 dap tall fescue required 30 more water than bermudagrass when planted in spring however water use rates following summer establishment were similar for both grasses due to water conservation strategies employed by tall fescue while experiencing heat stress these strategies also resulted in unacceptable turf quality during the subsequent weeks following planting scheduling irrigation as a percentage of eto can be an effective way to conserve water during establishment tall fescue kc during the second and third weeks following spring planting was determined to be 0 65 while bermudagrass kc was 0 5 following both spring and summer plantings although applied irrigation matched turfgrass water use tall fescue was unable to maintain minimally acceptable turf quality when established during the summer when planted in the spring both tall fescue and bermudagrass were able to maintain acceptable turf quality tiftuf bermudagrass water use from may to october was lower compared to triple threat tall fescue in north carolina demonstrating its water saving potential in the transition zone using less water and the ability to maintain functionality during periods of heat stress make tiftuf an attractive option in the landscape however there are often limitations to bermudagrass use in the landscape most notably in areas with extensive shade therefore much consideration should occur to determine turfgrass adaptability to localized environments prior to establishment when landscape microclimates are conducive for bermudagrass growth the use of new cultivars like tiftuf can be an effective way to conserve potable water as a result of decreased irrigation acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge raymond mccauley for technical support received throughout this research 
10931,saline water utilization combined with drip irrigation is the one of the most efficient way to cope with water shortage for agriculture however a major constraint on the use of saline water in drip irrigation systems is the potential for fouling which result in emitter clogging this research aimed to assess the occurrence of chemical fouling in drip irrigation systems applying saline water and determine the quantity and chemical characteristics of the chemical fouling a field experiment with four salinity levels of water ecw of 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 6 0 ds m in the hetao irrigation district inner mongolia china was performed to determine the formation and growth of chemical fouling in drip irrigation system the results showed that calcium magnesium carbonates calcite caco3 r aragonite caco3 0 mg calcite camgco3 dolomite camg co3 2 were the main clogging materials accounting for 63 3 91 1 when the conductivity ecw of the irrigation water was 1 0 ds m the dominant crystal form was calcite the aragonite angered as ecw increased to 2 0 ds m as ecw 4 ds m and running time increased the aragonite became dominated the emitter type and salinity of saline water had a direct impact on the growth of chemical fouling dry weight dw the dw of chemical fouling increased slightly in the emitter with large flow rates and had a linear positive correlation with ecw the chemical fouling presented an asymptotic growth including rapid and gradual growth periods a kinetic model of the growth of chemical fouling inside the emitters was established after the comprehensive consideration of emitter types and water salinity the model could satisfactorily demonstrate the chemical fouling growth process in drip irrigation system r2 0 96 significant level a 0 01 the results in this paper could provide theoretical references to reveal emitter clogging mechanism for using saline water keywords drip irrigation saline water chemical fouling kinetic model 1 introduction saline water as an alternative resource has already become an effective way to solve the problem of water shortage ayars et al 1993 drip irrigation is considered the most effective and reliable irrigation method for saline water applications due to high irrigation effective and good controllability under drip irrigation the soil moisture distribution is not in accord with the salt distribution while being beneficial to root growth malash et al 2008 many scholars researched the effects of saline water drip irrigation on the water salt distribution in soil hanson and may 2004 sharma et al 2013 growth characteristics yield and quality of crops mantell et al 1985 karlberg et al 2007 aguilar et al 2017 etc in the recent decade or so the chinese government has encouraged the use of saline groundwater for irrigation and many relevant studies have been conducted in the arid and semi arid regions of china lei et al 2003 confirmed the drip irrigation of watermelon with saline water was suitable wan et al 2007 2010 concluded the feasibility of saline water drip irrigation for tomato and cucumber production chen et al 2009 provided the drip irrigation pattern for saline water using in oleic sunflower kang et al 2010 suggested saline water was not higher than 4 0 ds m could be used for drip irrigation on waxy maize in summary studies focus on the soil environment and crop growth show the possibility of using saline water in drip irrigation however saline water contains a variety of salts which easily recombine and form deposits thereby causing chemical clogging the emitter clogging problem is normally found in saline water drip irrigation system dehghanisanij et al 2007 the emitter clogging not only reduces the irrigation uniformity significantly but also has adverse effects on crops thus became the main problem in drip irrigation widely alon 2016 yu et al 2018 emitter clogging including physical chemical and biological clogging is related to the quality of irrigation water current studies on emitter clogging are focused on the biological clogging of reclaimed water drip irrigation tarchitzky et al 2013 pei et al 2014 song et al 2017 and physical clogging of high silt content water drip irrigation niu et al 2013 bounoua et al 2016 a few studies have analyzed the chemical clogging in saline water drip irrigation mainly focus on the outflow change of emitters under different clogging control method hills et al 1989 concluded lowering of water ph by acids could alleviate chemical clogging yuan et al 1998 proposed that chemical clogging could be reduced by adding organic acid to decrease the ph of irrigation water aali et al 2009 using a magnetic field to change the characteristics of irrigation water for controlling the emitter clogging of saline water drip irrigation system feng et al 2017 concluded the better control emitter clogging was provided in the flushing regime with fresh water the studies mainly focused on the macro regulation of the outflow raters of emitters and did not consider the chemical foulings inside the emitters in the micro level emitter clogging in saline water drip irrigation is closely related to the formation and growth of chemical fouling inside emitters recently a few scholars determined characteristics of chemical fouling which mainly was calcium magnesium carbonates precipitations liu et al 2015 zhangzhong et al 2016a however owing to experimental restrictions the emitter sample was obtained at a low frequency the results indicated the differences among different treatments but failed to reflect the formation and dynamic accumulation of chemical fouling the related studies on the mechanism of the formation of chemical fouling mainly focused on the hard water treatment in the industry the chemical foulings growth processes in industry water treatment systems normally include the origin transport adhesion erosion and ageing period and the growth process is of four types linear descending power power and asymptotic curve taborek 1972 barrett and parsons 1998 however the dynamic model to chemical fouling growth within the emitters in saline water drip irrigation system was not reported hence the objectives of this research were 1 to evaluate the quantity and chemical characteristics of the chemical fouling in drip irrigation systems using four salinities of water 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 6 0 ds m ph around 8 60 with different na cl and hco3 concentrations 2 to determine the fouling growth within the emitters we also established and validated a kinetic model for chemical fouling growth in emitters the results achieved in this study provide a reference to demonstrate the chemical clogging mechanism in saline water 2 material and methods 2 1 clogging cultivation experiment for drip irrigation system using saline water a field study was conducted at the shuguang experimental station hetao irrigation district fig 1 it has a temperate continental climate with an annual mean temperature of 6 8 c and an annual mean precipitation of 140 mm the temperature difference between day and night is large and the duration of sunshine is long the annual average sunshine time is 3229 9 h and annual frost free time is 140 d based on the saline water quality in hetao irrigation district we selected four levels of salinity by allocating the plasma concentration ratio as w1 ecw 1 0 ds m w2 ecw 2 0 ds m w3 ecw 4 0 ds m and w4 ecw 6 0 ds m as shown in table 1 each water treatment facility was equipped with an operating system including water buckets and pumps and two levels of filtration screen and disc filter as an independent irrigation system moreover they were also equipped with a check valve control valve pressure gauge water meter and other control equipment three non pressure compensating emitters of e1 flow rates of 1 2 l h produced in israel e2 flow rates of 2 0 l h produced in china and e3 flow rates of 2 8 l h produced in china were used to conduct the field experiment on drip irrigation system there were 21 drip irrigation tapes laid in each system and seven drip irrigation tapes laid in each type of emitter each drip irrigation tape was 30 m long with emitters placed at intervals of 0 3 m the system was irrigated for 9 h every day the filters were flushed every three to four days to ensure that they were in good working condition the system was operated from 16 july 2014 to 12 september 2014 for a total of 448 h during the trial period the temperature of the irrigation water and ecw were monitored everyday using a thermometer and conductivity meter steps germany respectively fig 2 shows the monitoring results of water quality parameters 2 2 chemical fouling sampling and test methods the emitter samples were collected by operating the system for 112 h 168 h 224 h 336 h and 448 h for each treatment five emitters were cut from before and after each 5 cm interval of laterals at the head middle and end parts respectively during the sampling process the selected emitters were stored in a zip lock bag for later use and air dried and thereafter the drip irrigation pipes were peeled to observe the surface topography of chemical scales using field emission scanning electronic microscopy fsem at a magnification of 35 200 the chemical foulings was stripped using an ultrasonic cleaning machine model kq 600kde manufacturer kunshan shumei working power 600 kw oscillation frequency 100 hz the dry weight dw of chemical fouling was weighed using a high precision electronic balance accuracy 10 4 g furthermore the liquid samples were mixed together in order to eliminate the effects of randomness of the growth of biofilm on the obtained results the mixed liquid samples were used to test the chemical constituents using x ray diffraction xrd and the chemical property was analyzed by the topas software 2 3 kinetic model for chemical fouling growth in drip irrigation system a kinetic model of chemical fouling growth inside the emitters of drip irrigation system using saline water was established after the comprehensive consideration of emitter types and water salinity the hypotheses of the model were as follows 1 the material properties of chemical fouling within the emitters are maintained uniformly in every direction during the formation of chemical fouling the variation of the physical characteristics of irrigation water is negligible the depth of flow path was much larger than the thickness of chemical fouling hc 2 the chemical fouling growth includes the sedimentation and denudation period 3 the sedimentation rate αs of chemical fouling is proportional to the ion concentration of irrigation water c and average velocity of flow path section v 4 the denudation of chemical fouling is caused by the shear force τ at the material fluid interfaces the denudation rate αr is proportional to τ and inversely proportional to the hc according to the definition of αs and αd 1 α s m s ρ c t 2 α r m r ρ c t where ms and mr are the sedimentary and denuded chemical fouling inside the emitter flow path per unit area g m 2 respectively ρc is the density of chemical fouling g m 3 t is the running time of the drip irrigation system h according to the assumptions 1 and 2 the chemical fouling was obtained as 3 d h c d t α s α r according to the assumptions 3 and 4 the expressions of αs and αr were obtained as 4 α

1 c ρ c μ b 3 ρ c e x p b 2 μ v t where b1 b2 and b3 are the fitting parameters of the model 3 results and analysis 3 1 distribution and morphology of chemical fouling inside the drip irrigation emitter using saline water table 2 presents the chemical clogged e1 emitters after operating the drip irrigation system for 448 h it can be observed that the chemical fouling was gradually deposited on the flow path of emitters as ecw of saline water increased from the sem figure at a magnification of 35 in the case of w1 and w2 treatments the chemical fouling was mainly deposited on the backwater tooth angle region of the flow path reducing the discharge capacity of the flow path gradually and resulting in emitter clogging for w3 and w4 treatments the chemical fouling almost fully covered the flow path leading to complete clogging from the sem figure at a magnification of 200 the surface topography of chemical fouling was observed to be rough it consisted of inordinate crystal particles which contacted with each other in a mosaic manner and formed tight junctions 3 2 properties of chemical fouling inside the drip irrigation emitter using saline water it can be observed from fig 3 that the chemical components of chemical fouling in different types of emitters are consistent with each other and they consisted of calcium magnesium carbonates calcite caco3 r aragonite caco3 0 mg calcite camgco3 dolomite camg co3 2 quartz sio2 silicates muscovite k mg al 2 04 si3 34al0 66 o10 oh 2 alkaline feldspar knaalsi3o8 a small amount of sodium chloride nacl magnesite mg al 6 si al 4o10 oh 8 and magnetic oxidized iron fe3o4 among these calcium magnesium carbonates were the main chemical constituents accounting for 63 3 91 1 of the total clogging fouling the internal components of chemical fouling inside the emitters were not significantly affected by the emitter types and the laws of change of composition ratio of chemical fouling between different emitters were similar nevertheless as ecw and running time increased the component proportion of chemical fouling changed when ecw of saline water was 1 ds m the dominant crystal forms of calcium magnesium carbonates were calcite and mg calcite when ecw of saline water increased to 2 ds m aragonite appeared and it gradually increased with the operating time in the early stage of system operation 112 h the percentages of chemical fouling s crystal forms in the e1 e2 and e3 emitters were in the descending order calcite mg calcite aragonite muscovite whereas when the system was stopped 448 h the order changed to aragonite calcite mg calcite muscovite when the ecw of saline water was greater than or equal to 4 ds m the dominant crystal form of calcium magnesium carbonates was aragonite and as the conductivity ecw and running time increased the percentage of aragonite increased 3 3 relationship between chemical fouling and saline water quality the analysis of the relationship between the dw of chemical fouling per unit area in the emitter flow path and ecw is shown in fig 4 the dw of chemical fouling had a positive correlation with ecw which indicated that with the increase in ecw the problem of chemical fouling within the emitters became increasingly serious furthermore at different stages of operation the effects of ecw on the chemical fouling inside emitters were different after the system was operated for 112 h ecw of saline water increased by 1 ds m and the dw of chemical fouling per unit area in the e1 e2 and e3 emitters increased by 0 221 g 0 121 g and 0 059 g respectively after the system was operated for 224 h ecw of saline water increased by 1 ds m and the dw of chemical fouling per unit area in the e1 e2 and e3 emitters increased by 0 385 g 0 183 g and 0 102 g respectively after the system was operated for 448 h ecw of saline water increased by 1 ds m and the dw of chemical fouling per unit area in the e1 e2 and e3 emitters increased by 0 448 g 0 304 g and 0 134 g respectively the analysis of the relationship between the content of calcium magnesium carbonates per unit area in the emitter flow path and ecw is shown in fig 5 the content of calcium magnesium carbonates per unit area had a linear positive correlation with ecw of saline water which indicates that with the increase in ecw of saline water there were more calcium magnesium carbonates precipitated inside the emitter as ecw of saline water increased by 1 ds m the content of calcium magnesium carbonates per unit area in the e1 e2 and e3 emitters increased by 0 172 g 0 089 g and 0 043

operated for 448 h 3 4 kinetic model for chemical fouling growth inside the drip irrigation emitter using saline water the dynamic growth process of dw of chemical fouling per unit area in different emitter flow paths under different salinity of saline water is shown in fig 6 and the fitting and statistical results when the established growth kinetic model is applied are presented in table 3 as the operating time of the system increased the chemical fouling asymptotically grew in different types of emitters with different salinity of saline water further this process was divided into a rapid growth period and gradual growth period for different types of emitters the demarcation points of each stage were similar but the dw of chemical fouling was different at different moments the maximum dw of chemical fouling per unit area was observed in emitter e1 whereas its minimum value was observed in emitter e3 for saline water with different ecw the demarcation points were different furthermore with the increase in ecw both the dw of chemical fouling and growth rates increased the established model could satisfactorily describe the dynamic growth processes of the dw of chemical fouling in different drip irrigation emitters with different salinity of saline water r2 0 96 significant level a 0 01 in w1 treatment in the initial 224 h of system operation the dw of chemical fouling inside different types of emitters was in the rapid growth period and reached 0 096 0 390 g m2 at the end of this period subsequently the dw of chemical fouling gradually stabilized and the growth of dw slowed down gradually in the end of the experiment 448 h the dw of chemical fouling attached within the three kinds of emitter reached 0 141 0 484 g m2 in w2 treatment in the initial 224 h of system operation the dw of chemical fouling inside different types of emitters was in the rapid growth period and reached 0 109 0 403 g m2 at the end of this period subsequently the dw of chemical fouling gradually stabilized and the dw of chemical fouling in the three types of emitters reached 0 157 0 560 g m2 at the end of operation in w3 treatment in the initial 336 h of system operation the dw of chemical fouling inside different types of emitters was in the rapid growth period and reached 0 176 0 637 g m2 at the end of this period subsequently the dw of chemical fouling gradually stabilized and reached 0 225 0 762 g m2 after 448 h in w4 treatment in the initial 336 h of system operation the dw of chemical fouling inside different types of emitters was in the rapid growth period and reached 0 204 0 810 g m2 at the end of this period subsequently the dw of chemical fouling gradually stabilized and reached 0 290 0 880 g m2 after 448 h from the model fitting parameters in table 3 as ecw increased a1 and a2 became gradually smaller and there was no obvious regularity between different emitters 3 5 kinetic model for calcium magnesium carbonates growth inside the drip irrigation emitter using saline water the calcium magnesium carbonates were the dominant components of the chemical fouling inside the emitters and their dynamic growth processes with different salinity of saline water are shown in fig 7 the fitting results and statistics data when the established growth kinetic model is applied are listed in table 4 the established model could satisfactorily demonstrate the dynamic growth processes of the calcium magnesium carbonates in different emitters with water sources of different ecw r2 0 97 significant level a 0 01 generally with different ecw of saline water the overall trend of calcium magnesium carbonates in different types of emitter was similar to that of the dw growth of chemical fouling which could be divided into the rapid growth period and gradual growth period for different types of emitter the maximum content of calcium magnesium carbonates per unit area was still observed in emitter e1 whereas the minimum value was observed in emitter e3 for the irrigation water sources with different conductivity the demarcation points of each stage were different furthermore with the increase in ecw both the content and growth rate of calcium magnesium carbonates increased from the model fitting parameters in table 4 as ecw of saline water increased a1 became gradually smaller and there was no obvious regularity between different emitters 4 discussions emitter clogging in saline water drip irrigation is closely related to the formation of precipitation and growth inside emitters current studies focus on the monitoring of variations of flow rates of clogged emitters and few attempt to extract clogged emitter samples and identify the chemical characteristics of the fouling inside the emitter flow path however both approaches fail to reflect the formation and dynamic growth processes of chemical fouling in this study the results showed that calcium magnesium carbonates calcite caco3 r aragonite caco3 0 mg calcite camgco3 dolomite camg co3 2 were the main clogging materials accounting for 63 3 91 1 of the total content fig 3 which proposed that calcium carbonates were the dominant clogging materials in saline water drip irrigation this finding was consistent with the scale deposited on the wall of industrial system using hard water fathi et al 2006 and the scale in reverse osmosis membrane desalination for saline water greenlee et al 2010 the main reaction process was as follows 7 2 h c o 3 c a 2 c a h c o 3 2 c a c o 3 c o 2 h 2 o furthermore it was observed that the crystal form of calcium carbonates changed with the salinity level of water and operating time when ecw of irrigation water was 1 0 ds m the dominant crystal form was calcite the aragonite angered as ecw increased to 2 0 ds m as ecw 4 ds m and operating time increased the aragonite became dominant according to the ladder theory of ostwald saline water with higher ecw contains larger content of hco ions which improves the supersaturation degree of solutions thus accelerating the generation of nucleation and precipitation and inhibiting the conversion of aragonite to calcite when the supersaturation of a solution is low the difference between calcite and aragonite has a larger impact on the crystallization therefore calcite which is a more stable crystal form is easier to obtain for thermodynamics han et al 2006 although the components of chemical fouling inside the three types of emitters were the same the type of emitter influenced the formation of precipitation and growth inside the emitters the dw of chemical fouling inside the emitters with larger flow rates e1 tended to be less overall as the larger flow of emitters had a relatively larger size of flow path allowing a relatively larger particle size to pass through and thus relieving the problem of clogging furthermore it maintained certain flow rates simultaneously which played an important role in flushing the clogged material the results were consistent with those of previous studies wherein a large flow emitter demonstrated a strong anti clogging ability in saline water drip irrigation shinde et al 2012 moreover the precipitation growth was closely related to the water salinity in this study it was observed that ecw as a crucial index had a linear positive correlation with dw and calcium magnesium carbonates as ecw and running time increased chemical fouling increased and the effects of ecw on the fouling growth were exacerbated the result was explained a previous study hills et al 1989 which proposed that high salinity level of saline water is more likely to decrease the flow raters of drip irrigation emitters based on the carbonate equilibrium system the growth tendency of carbonate precipitation was analyzed using the langelier saturation index lsi which characterizes the equilibrium relationship between the calcium carbonate solids and carbon dioxide containing solution the method of calculation is shown in formula 8 from the lsi analysis of the saline water quality of the experiment table 5 the lsi values of saline water were determined to be greater than 0 with the trend of deposition as ecw increased lsi for each saline water treatment w1 w2 w3 and w4 became larger indicating an increased tendency toward fouling which explained the fouling increase inside the emitter in saline water drip 8 l s i p h p h s where ph is the ph of irrigation water and phs is the ph of the saturated solution thus the emitter type and water salinity quality influenced the growth of chemical fouling inside the emitters based on the deposition and erosion process a kinetic model of growth of chemical fouling inside the emitters was established after the comprehensive consideration of the aforementioned influence factors the model could satisfactorily demonstrate the chemical fouling growth process it showed that the chemical fouling presented an asymptotic growth including rapid and gradual growth periods in the early stage of saline water drip irrigation the internal chemical fouling inside the emitters was in the rapid growth stage because the high content of ca2 ions and hco3 ions of saline water produced calcium bicarbonate ca hco3 2 dissolved in water subsequently as the saline water flowed into the capillary and the emitter in order to change the temperature and pressure inside the unstable calcium bicarbonate ca hco3 2 could be easily decomposed into caco3 precipitation and its sedimentation and adhesion continued to occur on the inner wall of the emitter flow path moreover in the gap of the system stopped residual water in the capillary and emitters absorbed the heat under solar radiation effect such that caco3 precipitation was accumulated on the inner wall of the flow path by the pattern of separating crystals the sedimentation and adhesion of calcium magnesium carbonates mentioned above also increased the roughness of the wall changing the collision characteristics between the sediment particles in the irrigation water and the wall resulting in the increment of quartz component this stage was the rapid growth process dominated by chemical deposits thereafter as the thickness of the chemical fouling growth increased the flow shear force of the flow field within the emitter was enhanced studies have shown that from the flow field from near the wall of the emitter to the core area of the flow path the velocity increased apparently moreover a large area of turbulent flow field existed within the emitters and the shearing force of the vortexes had a damaging effect on the particle agglomeration wu et al 2013 zhangzhong et al 2016b hence a part of the chemical fouling was dissolved eroded and peeled off from the sedimentary layer in the form of ions particles and lumps which weakened the deposition ratio to some extent consequently the clogged scales entered the gradual growth period under the action of sedimentation and denudation 5 conclusions by using the saline water for agriculture the ecw of saline water had a linear positive correlation with dw of chemical scales in w1 and w2 treatments the chemical scales were accumulated and deposited in the backwater region of the emitter flow path which resulted in clogging in w3 and w4 treatments the chemical scales were mostly deposited in the flow path resulting in the complete clogging the calcium magnesium carbonates calcite caco3 r aragonite caco3 0 mg calcite camgco3 dolomite camg co3 2 were the main clogging scales ecw and operating time affected the crystal form of calcium magnesium carbonates in w1 treatment the dominant crystal form was calcite in w2 treatment aragonite appeared and it gradually increased with the operating time in w3 and w4 treatments the dominant crystal form was aragonite based on the deposition and erosion process a kinetic model of chemical scales growth was established after the comprehensive consideration of emitter types water salinity etc the chemical scales inside the emitters presented an asymptotic growth including rapid and gradual growth periods acknowledgements we are grateful for the financial

10931,saline water utilization combined with drip irrigation is the one of the most efficient way to cope with water shortage for agriculture however a major constraint on the use of saline water in drip irrigation systems is the potential for fouling which result in emitter clogging this research aimed to assess the occurrence of chemical fouling in drip irrigation systems applying saline water and determine the quantity and chemical characteristics of the chemical fouling a field experiment with four salinity levels of water ecw of 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 6 0 ds m in the hetao irrigation district inner mongolia china was performed to determine the formation and growth of chemical fouling in drip irrigation system the results showed that calcium magnesium carbonates calcite caco3 r aragonite caco3 0 mg calcite camgco3 dolomite camg co3 2 were the main clogging materials accounting for 63 3 91 1 when the conductivity ecw of the irrigation water was 1 0 ds m the dominant crystal form was calcite the aragonite angered as ecw increased to 2 0 ds m as ecw 4 ds m and running time increased the aragonite became dominated the emitter type and salinity of saline water had a direct impact on the growth of chemical fouling dry weight dw the dw of chemical fouling increased slightly in the emitter with large flow rates and had a linear positive correlation with ecw the chemical fouling presented an asymptotic growth including rapid and gradual growth periods a kinetic model of the growth of chemical fouling inside the emitters was established after the comprehensive consideration of emitter types and water salinity the model could satisfactorily demonstrate the chemical fouling growth process in drip irrigation system r2 0 96 significant level a 0 01 the results in this paper could provide theoretical references to reveal emitter clogging mechanism for using saline water keywords drip irrigation saline water chemical fouling kinetic model 1 introduction saline water as an alternative resource has already become an effective way to solve the problem of water shortage ayars et al 1993 drip irrigation is considered the most effective and reliable irrigation method for saline water applications due to high irrigation effective and good controllability under drip irrigation the soil moisture distribution is not in accord with the salt distribution while being beneficial to root growth malash et al 2008 many scholars researched the effects of saline water drip irrigation on the water salt distribution in soil hanson and may 2004 sharma et al 2013 growth characteristics yield and quality of crops mantell et al 1985 karlberg et al 2007 aguilar et al 2017 etc in the recent decade or so the chinese government has encouraged the use of saline groundwater for irrigation and many relevant studies have been conducted in the arid and semi arid regions of china lei et al 2003 confirmed the drip irrigation of watermelon with saline water was suitable wan et al 2007 2010 concluded the feasibility of saline water drip irrigation for tomato and cucumber production chen et al 2009 provided the drip irrigation pattern for saline water using in oleic sunflower kang et al 2010 suggested saline water was not higher than 4 0 ds m could be used for drip irrigation on waxy maize in summary studies focus on the soil environment and crop growth show the possibility of using saline water in drip irrigation however saline water contains a variety of salts which easily recombine and form deposits thereby causing chemical clogging the emitter clogging problem is normally found in saline water drip irrigation system dehghanisanij et al 2007 the emitter clogging not only reduces the irrigation uniformity significantly but also has adverse effects on crops thus became the main problem in drip irrigation widely alon 2016 yu et al 2018 emitter clogging including physical chemical and biological clogging is related to the quality of irrigation water current studies on emitter clogging are focused on the biological clogging of reclaimed water drip irrigation tarchitzky et al 2013 pei et al 2014 song et al 2017 and physical clogging of high silt content water drip irrigation niu et al 2013 bounoua et al 2016 a few studies have analyzed the chemical clogging in saline water drip irrigation mainly focus on the outflow change of emitters under different clogging control method hills et al 1989 concluded lowering of water ph by acids could alleviate chemical clogging yuan et al 1998 proposed that chemical clogging could be reduced by adding organic acid to decrease the ph of irrigation water aali et al 2009 using a magnetic field to change the characteristics of irrigation water for controlling the emitter clogging of saline water drip irrigation system feng et al 2017 concluded the better control emitter clogging was provided in the flushing regime with fresh water the studies mainly focused on the macro regulation of the outflow raters of emitters and did not consider the chemical foulings inside the emitters in the micro level emitter clogging in saline water drip irrigation is closely related to the formation and growth of chemical fouling inside emitters recently a few scholars determined characteristics of chemical fouling which mainly was calcium magnesium carbonates precipitations liu et al 2015 zhangzhong et al 2016a however owing to experimental restrictions the emitter sample was obtained at a low frequency the results indicated the differences among different treatments but failed to reflect the formation and dynamic accumulation of chemical fouling the related studies on the mechanism of the formation of chemical fouling mainly focused on the hard water treatment in the industry the chemical foulings growth processes in industry water treatment systems normally include the origin transport adhesion erosion and ageing period and the growth process is of four types linear descending power power and asymptotic curve taborek 1972 barrett and parsons 1998 however the dynamic model to chemical fouling growth within the emitters in saline water drip irrigation system was not reported hence the objectives of this research were 1 to evaluate the quantity and chemical characteristics of the chemical fouling in drip irrigation systems using four salinities of water 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 6 0 ds m ph around 8 60 with different na cl and hco3 concentrations 2 to determine the fouling growth within the emitters we also established and validated a kinetic model for chemical fouling growth in emitters the results achieved in this study provide a reference to demonstrate the chemical clogging mechanism in saline water 2 material and methods 2 1 clogging cultivation experiment for drip irrigation system using saline water a field study was conducted at the shuguang experimental station hetao irrigation district fig 1 it has a temperate continental climate with an annual mean temperature of 6 8 c and an annual mean precipitation of 140 mm the temperature difference between day and night is large and the duration of sunshine is long the annual average sunshine time is 3229 9 h and annual frost free time is 140 d based on the saline water quality in hetao irrigation district we selected four levels of salinity by allocating the plasma concentration ratio as w1 ecw 1 0 ds m w2 ecw 2 0 ds m w3 ecw 4 0 ds m and w4 ecw 6 0 ds m as shown in table 1 each water treatment facility was equipped with an operating system including water buckets and pumps and two levels of filtration screen and disc filter as an independent irrigation system moreover they were also equipped with a check valve control valve pressure gauge water meter and other control equipment three non pressure compensating emitters of e1 flow rates of 1 2 l h produced in israel e2 flow rates of 2 0 l h produced in china and e3 flow rates of 2 8 l h produced in china were used to conduct the field experiment on drip irrigation system there were 21 drip irrigation tapes laid in each system and seven drip irrigation tapes laid in each type of emitter each drip irrigation tape was 30 m long with emitters placed at intervals of 0 3 m the system was irrigated for 9 h every day the filters were flushed every three to four days to ensure that they were in good working condition the system was operated from 16 july 2014 to 12 september 2014 for a total of 448 h during the trial period the temperature of the irrigation water and ecw were monitored everyday using a thermometer and conductivity meter steps germany respectively fig 2 shows the monitoring results of water quality parameters 2 2 chemical fouling sampling and test methods the emitter samples were collected by operating the system for 112 h 168 h 224 h 336 h and 448 h for each treatment five emitters were cut from before and after each 5 cm interval of laterals at the head middle and end parts respectively during the sampling process the selected emitters were stored in a zip lock bag for later use and air dried and thereafter the drip irrigation pipes were peeled to observe the surface topography of chemical scales using field emission scanning electronic microscopy fsem at a magnification of 35 200 the chemical foulings was stripped using an ultrasonic cleaning machine model kq 600kde manufacturer kunshan shumei working power 600 kw oscillation frequency 100 hz the dry weight dw of chemical fouling was weighed using a high precision electronic balance accuracy 10 4 g furthermore the liquid samples were mixed together in order to eliminate the effects of randomness of the growth of biofilm on the obtained results the mixed liquid samples were used to test the chemical constituents using x ray diffraction xrd and the chemical property was analyzed by the topas software 2 3 kinetic model for chemical fouling growth in drip irrigation system a kinetic model of chemical fouling growth inside the emitters of drip irrigation system using saline water was established after the comprehensive consideration of emitter types and water salinity the hypotheses of the model were as follows 1 the material properties of chemical fouling within the emitters are maintained uniformly in every direction during the formation of chemical fouling the variation of the physical characteristics of irrigation water is negligible the depth of flow path was much larger than the thickness of chemical fouling hc 2 the chemical fouling growth includes the sedimentation and denudation period 3 the sedimentation rate αs of chemical fouling is proportional to the ion concentration of irrigation water c and average velocity of flow path section v 4 the denudation of chemical fouling is caused by the shear force τ at the material fluid interfaces the denudation rate αr is proportional to τ and inversely proportional to the hc according to the definition of αs and αd 1 α s m s ρ c t 2 α r m r ρ c t where ms and mr are the sedimentary and denuded chemical fouling inside the emitter flow path per unit area g m 2 respectively ρc is the density of chemical fouling g m 3 t is the running time of the drip

emitter using saline water table 2 presents the chemical clogged e1 emitters after operating the drip irrigation system for 448 h it can be observed that the chemical fouling was gradually deposited on the flow path of emitters as ecw of saline water increased from the sem figure at a magnification of 35 in the case of w1 and w2 treatments the chemical fouling was mainly deposited on the backwater tooth angle region of the flow path reducing the discharge capacity of the flow path gradually and resulting in emitter clogging for w3 and w4 treatments the chemical fouling almost fully covered the flow path leading to complete clogging from the sem figure at a magnification of 200 the surface topography of chemical fouling was observed to be rough it consisted of inordinate crystal particles which contacted with each other in a mosaic manner and formed tight junctions 3 2 properties of chemical fouling inside the drip irrigation emitter using saline water it can be observed from fig 3 that the chemical components of chemical fouling in different types of emitters are consistent with each other and they consisted of calcium magnesium carbonates calcite caco3 r aragonite caco3 0 mg calcite camgco3 dolomite camg co3 2 quartz sio2 silicates muscovite k mg al 2 04 si3 34al0 66 o10 oh 2 alkaline feldspar knaalsi3o8 a small amount of sodium chloride nacl magnesite mg al 6 si al 4o10 oh 8 and magnetic oxidized iron fe3o4 among these calcium magnesium carbonates were the main chemical constituents accounting for 63 3 91 1 of the total clogging fouling the internal components of chemical fouling inside the emitters were not significantly affected by the emitter types and the laws of change of composition ratio of chemical fouling between different emitters were similar nevertheless as ecw and running time increased the component proportion of chemical fouling changed when ecw of saline water was 1 ds m the dominant crystal forms of calcium magnesium carbonates were calcite and mg calcite when ecw of saline water increased to 2 ds m aragonite appeared and it gradually increased with the operating time in the early stage of system operation 112 h the percentages of chemical fouling s crystal forms in the e1 e2 and e3 emitters were in the descending order calcite mg calcite aragonite muscovite whereas when the system was stopped 448 h the order changed to aragonite calcite mg calcite muscovite when the ecw of saline water was greater than or equal to 4 ds m the dominant crystal form of calcium magnesium carbonates was aragonite and as the conductivity ecw and running time increased the percentage of aragonite increased 3 3 relationship between chemical fouling and saline water quality the analysis of the relationship between the dw of chemical fouling per unit area in the emitter flow path and ecw is shown in fig 4 the dw of chemical fouling had a positive correlation with ecw which indicated that with the increase in ecw the problem of chemical fouling within the emitters became increasingly serious furthermore at different stages of operation the effects of ecw on the chemical fouling inside emitters were different after the system was operated for 112 h ecw of saline water increased by 1 ds m and the dw of chemical fouling per unit area in the e1 e2 and e3 emitters increased by 0 221 g 0 121 g and 0 059 g respectively after the system was operated for 224 h ecw of saline water increased by 1 ds m and the dw of chemical fouling per unit area in the e1 e2 and e3 emitters increased by 0 385 g 0 183 g and 0 102 g respectively after the system was operated for 448 h ecw of saline water increased by 1 ds m and the dw of chemical fouling per unit area in the e1 e2 and e3 emitters increased by 0 448 g 0 304 g and 0 134 g respectively the analysis of the relationship between the content of calcium magnesium carbonates per unit area in the emitter flow path and ecw is shown in fig 5 the content of calcium magnesium carbonates per unit area had a linear positive correlation with ecw of saline water which indicates that with the increase in ecw of saline water there were more calcium magnesium carbonates precipitated inside the emitter as ecw of saline water increased by 1 ds m the content of calcium magnesium carbonates per unit area in the e1 e2 and e3 emitters increased by 0 172 g 0 089 g and 0 043 g respectively after the system was operated for 112 h the content of calcium magnesium carbonates per unit area in e1 e2 and e3 emitters increased by 0 330 g 0 140 g and 0 018 g respectively after the system was operated for 224 h the content of calcium magnesium carbonates per unit area in the e1 e2 and e3 emitters increased by 0 425 g 0 261 g and 0 116 g respectively after the system was operated for 448 h 3 4 kinetic model for chemical fouling growth inside the drip irrigation emitter using saline water the dynamic growth process of dw of chemical fouling per unit area in different emitter flow paths under different salinity of saline water is shown in fig 6 and the fitting and statistical results when the established growth kinetic model is applied are presented in table 3 as the operating time of the system increased the chemical fouling asymptotically grew in different types of emitters with different salinity of saline water further this process was divided into a rapid

carbonates as ecw and running time increased chemical fouling increased and the effects of ecw on the fouling growth were exacerbated the result was explained a previous study hills et al 1989 which proposed that high salinity level of saline water is more likely to decrease the flow raters of drip irrigation emitters based on the carbonate equilibrium system the growth tendency of carbonate precipitation was analyzed using the langelier saturation index lsi which characterizes the equilibrium relationship between the calcium carbonate solids and carbon dioxide containing solution the method of calculation is shown in formula 8 from the lsi analysis of the saline water quality of the experiment table 5 the lsi values of saline water were determined to be greater than 0 with the trend of deposition as ecw increased lsi for each saline water treatment w1 w2 w3 and w4 became larger indicating an increased tendency toward fouling which explained the fouling increase inside the emitter in saline water drip 8 l s i p h p h s where ph is the ph of irrigation water and phs is the ph of the saturated solution thus the emitter type and water salinity quality influenced the growth of chemical fouling inside the emitters based on the deposition and erosion process a kinetic model of growth of chemical fouling inside the emitters was established after the comprehensive consideration of the aforementioned influence factors the model could satisfactorily demonstrate the chemical fouling growth process it showed that the chemical fouling presented an asymptotic growth including rapid and gradual growth periods in the early stage of saline water drip irrigation the internal chemical fouling inside the emitters was in the rapid growth stage because the high content of ca2 ions and hco3 ions of saline water produced calcium bicarbonate ca hco3 2 dissolved in water subsequently as the saline water flowed into the capillary and the emitter in order to change the temperature and pressure inside the unstable calcium bicarbonate ca hco3 2 could be easily decomposed into caco3 precipitation and its sedimentation and adhesion continued to occur on the inner wall of the emitter flow path moreover in the gap of the system stopped residual water in the capillary and emitters absorbed the heat under solar radiation effect such that caco3 precipitation was accumulated on the inner wall of the flow path by the pattern of separating crystals the sedimentation and adhesion of calcium magnesium carbonates mentioned above also increased the roughness of the wall changing the collision characteristics between the sediment particles in the irrigation water and the wall resulting in the increment of quartz component this stage was the rapid growth process dominated by chemical deposits thereafter as the thickness of the chemical fouling growth increased the flow shear force of the flow field within the emitter was enhanced studies have shown that from the flow field from near the wall of the emitter to the core area of the flow path the velocity increased apparently moreover a large area of turbulent flow field existed within the emitters and the shearing force of the vortexes had a damaging effect on the particle agglomeration wu et al 2013 zhangzhong et al 2016b hence a part of the chemical fouling was dissolved eroded and peeled off from the sedimentary layer in the form of ions particles and lumps which weakened the deposition ratio to some extent consequently the clogged scales entered the gradual growth period under the action of sedimentation and denudation 5 conclusions by using the saline water for agriculture the ecw of saline water had a linear positive correlation with dw of chemical scales in w1 and w2 treatments the chemical scales were accumulated and deposited in the backwater region of the emitter flow path which resulted in clogging in w3 and w4 treatments the chemical scales were mostly deposited in the flow path resulting in the complete clogging the calcium magnesium carbonates calcite caco3 r aragonite caco3 0 mg calcite camgco3 dolomite camg co3 2 were the main clogging scales ecw and operating time affected the crystal form of calcium magnesium carbonates in w1 treatment the dominant crystal form was calcite in w2 treatment aragonite appeared and it gradually increased with the operating time in w3 and w4 treatments the dominant crystal form was aragonite based on the deposition and erosion process a kinetic model of chemical scales growth was established after the comprehensive consideration of emitter types water salinity etc the chemical scales inside the emitters presented an asymptotic growth including rapid and gradual growth periods acknowledgements we are grateful for the financial

significant differences p 0 05 between majority of mnbo treatments and ck in the aboveground and underground dry matter of the two crops which in average increased by 13 89 34 31 and 9 33 22 21 for tomato and 16 69 33 87 and 16 53 21 79 for cucumber in gw treatments mnbo also significantly improved tomato dry matter accumulation compared to ck p 0 05 with the average increase of 21 07 56 54 and 18 10 29 52 for aboveground and underground while for cucumber cultivated in spring ro15 fr treatment resulted in lower underground dry matter decreased by 9 27 additionally the results demonstrated that mnbo application at fr had obvious effects on crop dry matter compared with sf treatments and the underground dry matter was positively correlated with do concentration 3 2 yield and iwue the effects of mnbo application on crop yield and iwue are shown in table 2 the obtained results showed that mnbo positively affected crop yield and iwue all mnbo application treatments achieved higher

change of iwue was same with the yield resulting from iwue calculated according to the yield and irrigation amount which the irrigation amount was identical across treatments 3 3 fruit quality tomato and cucumber quality indices for spring and autumn cultivation are presented in table 3 mnbo application treatments increased the vc content for tomato by 6 55 61 41 and 6 72 58 85 for cucumber compared with ck the results also indicated that mnbo applied at fr was more effective than that at sf on crop vc accumulation and significantly distinguished from ck commonly do15 treatments contributed to higher vc content for two crops than do25 while the highest vc content for tomato and cucumber was recorded in rw do15 fr and rw do25 fr treatment respectively with the mean values of 15 84 mg kg and 8 26 mg kg respectively the application of mnbo at fr significantly increased tomato lycopene content p 0 05 compared with ck with the increases of 16 16 55 37 however there was no statically differences between mnbo applied at sf and ck similarly mnbo applied at fr was more effective for improving tomato lycopene content than sf and do15 treatments showed higher tomato lycopene contents than those of do25 among the treatments rw do15 fr led to highest tomato lycopene contents which was 19 17 and 15 49 mg kg for spring and autumn respectively tss and ss contents under mnbo

statistical difference was acquired between do15 and do25 treatments the highest cucumber tss 3 00 was observed in rw do15 fr while the highest tomato tss value 4 05 was obtained in gw do15 fr rw do15 fr treatments resulted in the highest tomato and cucumber ss with the mean value of 2 53 and 1 27 respectively there was no statistical difference on oa among the treatments 3 4 soil enzyme fig 3 shows the effects of do concentration and mnbo application periods on soil urease phosphatase and catalase contents in rs nrs and be the application of mnbo increased urease content in rs which was 1 29 35 43 higher than that of ck the urease content increased when the do concentration increased from 15 mg l to 25 mg l the effects of mnbo on soil phosphatase content in rs nrs and be were not identical mnbo application had positive effects on rs phosphatase content in rw treatments and majority of gw treatments while the phosphatase content in nrs and be showed the negative effect with decreased by 2 21 30 28 and 7 54 30 75 respectively mnbo application increased catalase content in all sampling locations which hydrogen peroxide in rs nrs and be were increased by 12 35 55 0 36 59 and 1 45 25 35 respectively there was no significant difference on soil catalase content between different do concentration treatments while soil catalase content differed between mnbo at sf and fr namely mnbo at fr resulting in higher catalase content 3 5 soil microorganism the effects of micro nano bubble water oxygation on total plfa are shown in fig 4 soil microbial biomass in be rs and nrs were 25 61 229 37 nmol g 38 19 180 72 nmol g 20 24 121 74 nmol g respectively the results indicated that rw treatments contributed to higher microbial biomass than gw the highest microbial biomass in

bacteria the pseudomonas 16 0 and hydrogenobacter 18 0 accounted for 42 80 44 40 18 20 25 39 of the total plfas respectively 4 discussion 4 1 mnbo improved iwue yield and quality of tomato and cucumber in this study the application of mnbo increased tomato and cucumber yield iwue and fruit quality represented the similarities with previous oxygation experiments abuarab et al 2013 bhattarai et al 2015 pendergast et al 2019 mnbs characterized by small specific surface area and long residence time in water significantly improved soil oxygen content liu et al 2019 the results indicated that mnbo application at fr was more effective than that for sf it may be because sf is the vegetative growth stage for tomato and cucumber and the application of mnbo impacted crop shoot and root growth at this stage tomato and cucumber consumed more water air and nutrients for acceleration of plant growth and fruit enlargement at fr stage adequate oxygen content in rhizosphere supplied by oxygation promoted the absorption of soil moisture and nutrients resulting in higher crop yield sang et al 2018 du et al 2018 in addition there was a do concentration threshold during the experiments crop yield did not continuously increase when do concentration was higher than the threshold ehret et al 2010 obtained a similar result that the yield of cucumber and sweet pepper did not continue to increase with the increase in do in the nutrient solution due to limitations of experimental design the specific do concentration threshold needs further investigation in this study do15 fr was the optimal mnbo application pattern for greenhouse tomato and cucumber cultivation additionally it indicated that rw treatments yielded higher than those for gw mainly because of reclaimed water providing multiple nutrients and organic matter for plant growth bourazanis et al 2016 lu et al 2016 4 2 response of soil microorganism species and contents to mnbo microorganisms have vital function in all ecosystems with microorganisms being key drivers of soil nutrient cycling and biogeochemical process fierer 2017 banerjee et al 2018 soil microbial community structure and diversity are regarded as one of soil quality indicators jackson et al 2003 sharma et al 2010 and are sensitive to early warning for soil damage degree and restoration potentiality in soil systems ge et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 fewer soil microbial species was recorded at be than those for other sampling points mainly caused by sterilization of mnbs sumikura et al 2007 microbial diversity index represented by shannon pielou and simpson were shown in table 4 the majority of mnbo application treatments increased shannon and pielou indices of be and rs but decreased that of nrs transporting irrigation water rich in oxygen to the crop root zone improves soil permeability and provides an aerobic environment for soil microorganisms contributing to the proliferation of aerobic microorganisms dixon and kell 2010 intense and thorough nitrification process occurs in good soil permeability and the decomposition of soil organic matter is accelerated to release and accumulate nutrients in soil in the study the highest plfas content was recorded in rs among three sampling locations the cause may be that the roots continuously secrete various metabolites including amino acids organic acids fatty acids and sugars providing enough nutrients dijkstra and cheng 2007 and enhancing the interaction between plant roots and soil microorganisms additionally substances or compounds released by plant root commonly called root exudates enriched soil organic matter and increased microbial amounts and their activities singh and chauhan 2017 the mnbs water entered soil through subsurface emitters resulting in quantity of water nutrient and oxygen accumulated below the emitters the application of mnbo produced comfortable environment for microbial subsistence and proliferation which caused a relatively high content of plfas at be 4 3 response of soil enzymes contents to mnbo as one of the most active organic components of soils soil enzymes are considered soil quality indicators characterizing the changes in soil organic matter dynamics evaluating soil fertility and ecological system liu et al 2017 acosta martinez et al 2018 urease is a primary hydrolase in soil affecting urea hydrolysis and urea nitrogen utilization

orthophosphate in the soil nannipieri et al 2011 godin et al 2015 soil catalase is a type of oxidoreductase that enzymatically breaks down oxygen peroxide and relieves the toxic effects on plants and soils liu et al 2017 in this study the results indicated that soil urease phosphatase and catalase contents were increased in most of mnbo application treatments in rs compared with those for ck the enhanced soil permeability in plant root zone promoted roots growth and metabolism the activity and content of soil enzyme were increased by accelerating of root exudates and soil microbial activities lu et al 2001 5 conclusions the current study clearly demonstrated that mnbo application periods and do concentrations had effects on crop productivity and fruit quality the fruiting stage and 15 mg l were the optimal mnbo application period and do concentration for tomato and cucumber and there was an upper threshold of do concentration for mnbo application rw do15 fr yielded highest production in the study with 40 88 and 69 12 higher yield and vc for tomato compared with no oxygation treatment and those were 24 44 and 75 71 for cucumber in addition urease and phosphatase contents increased by 35 43 and 32 86 under rw do15 fr in rhizosphere and microbial species increased from 11 to 16 compared with ck treatment comprehensive consideration of crop yield iwue fruit quality and soil quality mnbo application in 15 mg l do concentration at fruiting stage is recommended as the optimal pattern for greenhouse tomato and cucumber acknowledgements the research is funded by the national natural

shannon wiener h pielou j and simpson d were employed to calculate the ecological parameters of microbial plfa biomarkers the parameters were calculated with the equations as follows 1 h p i ln p i 2 j p i l n p i l n s 3 d 1 p i 2 where pi ni n ni is number of characteristic plfa and n is the total number of plfa s is the frequency of plfa biomarkers in microbial community 2 4 statistical analysis one way anova was performed to compare the means of crop growth parameters and fruit quality indices using the spss version 22 0 least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 was used to separate treatment means exhibiting significant differences 3 results 3 1 dry matter the changes in tomato and cucumber dry weight with respect to mnbo are shown in fig 2 in rw treatments there were significant differences p 0 05 between majority of mnbo treatments and ck in the aboveground and underground dry matter of the two crops which in average increased by 13 89 34 31 and 9 33 22 21 for tomato and 16 69 33 87 and 16 53 21 79 for cucumber in gw treatments mnbo also significantly improved tomato dry matter accumulation compared to ck p 0 05 with the average increase of 21 07 56 54 and 18 10 29 52 for aboveground and underground while for cucumber cultivated in spring ro15 fr treatment resulted in lower underground dry matter decreased by 9 27 additionally the results demonstrated that mnbo application at fr had obvious effects on crop dry matter compared with sf treatments and the underground dry matter was positively correlated with do concentration 3 2 yield and iwue the effects of mnbo application on crop yield and iwue are shown in table 2 the obtained results showed that mnbo positively affected crop yield and iwue all mnbo application treatments achieved higher yield than ck increased by 3 40 34 49 for tomato and 5 45 19 21 for cucumber mnbo applied at fr yielded higher production compared with sf in both rw and gw and do15 treatments had stronger promotion in crop yield compared with do25 the highest yield for two crops were both recorded in rw do15 fr treatments with mean yield of 62 019 kg ha for tomato and 102 177 kg ha for cucumber additionally the change of iwue was same with the yield resulting from iwue calculated according to the yield and irrigation amount which the irrigation amount was identical across treatments 3 3 fruit quality tomato and cucumber quality indices for spring and autumn cultivation are presented in table 3 mnbo application treatments increased the vc content for tomato by 6 55 61 41 and 6 72 58 85 for cucumber compared with ck the results also indicated that mnbo applied at fr was more effective than that at sf on crop vc accumulation and significantly distinguished from ck commonly do15 treatments contributed to higher vc content for two crops than do25 while the highest vc content for tomato and cucumber was recorded in rw do15 fr and rw do25 fr treatment respectively with the mean values of 15 84 mg kg and 8 26 mg kg respectively the application of mnbo at fr significantly increased tomato lycopene content p 0 05 compared with ck with the increases of 16 16 55 37 however there was no statically differences between mnbo applied at sf and ck similarly mnbo applied at fr was more effective for improving tomato lycopene content than sf and do15 treatments showed higher tomato lycopene contents than those of do25 among the treatments rw do15 fr led to highest tomato lycopene contents which was 19 17 and 15 49 mg kg for spring and autumn respectively tss and ss contents under mnbo treatments were increased by 2 99 21 98 and 4 36 30 30 for tomato and 6 48 39 27 and 2 56 44 57 for cucumber mnbo applied at fr resulted in higher tss and ss values than those for sf while no statistical difference was acquired between do15 and do25 treatments the highest cucumber tss 3 00 was observed in rw do15 fr while the highest tomato tss value 4 05 was obtained in gw do15 fr rw do15 fr treatments resulted in the highest tomato and cucumber ss with the mean value of 2 53 and 1 27 respectively there was no statistical difference on oa among the treatments 3 4 soil enzyme fig 3 shows the effects of do concentration and mnbo application periods on soil urease phosphatase and catalase contents in rs nrs and be the application of mnbo increased urease content in rs which was 1 29 35 43 higher than that of ck the urease content increased when the do concentration increased from 15 mg l to 25 mg l the effects of mnbo on soil phosphatase content in rs nrs and be were not identical mnbo application had positive effects on rs phosphatase content in rw treatments and majority of gw treatments while the phosphatase content in nrs and be showed the negative effect with decreased by 2 21 30 28 and 7 54 30 75 respectively mnbo application increased catalase content in all sampling locations which hydrogen peroxide in rs nrs and be were increased by 12 35 55 0 36 59 and 1 45 25 35 respectively there was no significant difference on soil catalase content between different do concentration treatments while soil catalase content differed between mnbo at sf and fr namely mnbo at fr resulting in higher catalase content 3 5 soil microorganism the effects of micro nano bubble water oxygation on total plfa are shown in fig 4 soil microbial biomass in be rs and nrs were 25 61 229 37 nmol g 38 19 180 72 nmol g 20 24 121 74 nmol g respectively the results indicated that rw treatments contributed to higher microbial biomass than gw the highest microbial biomass in be rs and nrs were recorder in rw do15 fr rw do15 sf and rw do15 fr respectively with 58 195 and 130 higher than those for rw ck biomarkers of soil plfa characteristic in be rs and nrs are presented in fig 5 sixteen types of plfas carbon chain length ranged from 13 to 20 were detected in the study including bacteria in general fungi gram positive bacteria gram negative bacteria pseuodomonos hydrogenobacter and methane oxidizing bacteria eleven plfas were presented under ck treatments including gram positive bacterium 14 0 gram negative bacterium 14 1w6c 16 1w7c 16 1w9c cy17 0 methane oxidizing bacteria 18 1w8t pseuodomonos 14 1w5c 16 0 hydrogenobacter 18 0 and bacteria in general 15 0 20 0 sixteen plfas were detected under the mnbo treatments including 13 0 of the bacteria in general 16 1w14 t of the gram negative bacteria 10 18 1w9c and 18 1w7t of the fungi and the 11 types identified in ck treatments the pseudomonas 16 0 and hydrogenobacter 18 0 were the dominant bacteria the pseudomonas 16 0 and hydrogenobacter 18 0 accounted for 42 80 44 40 18 20 25 39 of the total plfas respectively 4 discussion 4 1 mnbo improved iwue yield and quality of tomato and cucumber in this study the application of mnbo increased tomato and cucumber yield iwue and fruit quality represented the similarities with previous oxygation experiments abuarab et al 2013 bhattarai et al 2015 pendergast et al 2019 mnbs characterized by small specific surface area and long residence time in water significantly improved soil oxygen content liu et al 2019 the results indicated that mnbo application at fr was more effective than that for sf it may be because sf is the vegetative growth stage for tomato and cucumber and the application of mnbo impacted crop shoot and root growth at this stage tomato and cucumber consumed more water air and nutrients for acceleration of plant growth and fruit enlargement at fr stage adequate oxygen content in rhizosphere supplied by oxygation promoted the absorption of soil moisture and nutrients resulting in higher crop yield sang et al 2018 du et al 2018 in addition there was a do concentration threshold during the experiments crop yield did not continuously increase when do concentration was higher than the threshold ehret et al 2010 obtained a similar result that the yield of cucumber and sweet pepper did not continue to increase with the increase in do in the nutrient solution due to limitations of experimental design the specific do concentration threshold needs further investigation in this study do15 fr was the optimal mnbo application pattern for greenhouse tomato and cucumber cultivation additionally it indicated that rw treatments yielded higher than those for gw mainly because of reclaimed water providing multiple nutrients and organic matter for plant growth bourazanis et al 2016 lu et al 2016 4 2 response of soil microorganism species and contents to mnbo microorganisms have vital function in all ecosystems with microorganisms being key drivers of soil nutrient cycling and biogeochemical process fierer 2017 banerjee et al 2018 soil microbial community structure and diversity are regarded as one of soil quality indicators jackson et al 2003 sharma et al 2010 and are sensitive to early warning for soil damage degree and restoration potentiality in soil systems ge et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 fewer soil microbial species was recorded at be than those for other sampling points mainly caused by sterilization of mnbs sumikura et al 2007 microbial diversity index represented by shannon pielou and simpson were shown in table 4 the majority of mnbo application treatments increased shannon and pielou indices of be and rs but decreased that of nrs transporting irrigation water rich in oxygen to the crop root zone improves soil permeability and provides an aerobic environment for soil microorganisms contributing to the proliferation of aerobic microorganisms dixon and kell 2010 intense and thorough nitrification process occurs in good soil permeability and the decomposition of soil organic matter is accelerated to release and accumulate nutrients in soil in the study the highest plfas content was recorded in rs among three sampling locations the cause may be that the roots continuously secrete various metabolites including amino acids organic acids fatty acids and sugars providing enough nutrients dijkstra and cheng 2007 and enhancing the interaction between plant roots and soil microorganisms additionally substances or compounds released by plant root commonly called root exudates enriched soil organic matter and increased microbial amounts and their activities singh and chauhan 2017 the mnbs water entered soil through subsurface emitters resulting in quantity of water nutrient and oxygen accumulated below the emitters the application of mnbo produced comfortable environment for microbial subsistence and proliferation which caused a relatively high content of plfas at be 4 3 response of soil enzymes contents to mnbo as one of the most active organic components of soils soil enzymes are considered soil quality indicators characterizing the changes in soil organic matter dynamics evaluating soil fertility and ecological system liu et al 2017 acosta martinez et al 2018 urease is a primary hydrolase in soil affecting urea hydrolysis and urea nitrogen utilization

orthophosphate in the soil nannipieri et al 2011 godin et al 2015 soil catalase is a type of oxidoreductase that enzymatically breaks down oxygen peroxide and relieves the toxic effects on plants and soils liu et al 2017 in this study the results indicated that soil urease phosphatase and catalase contents were increased in most of mnbo application treatments in rs compared with those for ck the enhanced soil permeability in plant root zone promoted roots growth and metabolism the activity and content of soil enzyme were increased by accelerating of root exudates and soil microbial activities lu et al 2001 5 conclusions the current study clearly demonstrated that mnbo application periods and do concentrations had effects on crop productivity and fruit quality the fruiting stage and 15 mg l were the optimal mnbo application period and do concentration for tomato and cucumber and there was an upper threshold of do concentration for mnbo application rw do15 fr yielded highest production in the study with 40 88 and 69 12 higher yield and vc for tomato compared with no oxygation treatment and those were 24 44 and 75 71 for cucumber in addition urease and phosphatase contents increased by 35 43 and 32 86 under rw do15 fr in rhizosphere and microbial species increased from 11 to 16 compared with ck treatment comprehensive consideration of crop yield iwue fruit quality and soil quality mnbo application in 15 mg l do concentration at fruiting stage is recommended as the optimal pattern for greenhouse tomato and cucumber acknowledgements the research is funded by the national natural

10933,no tillage nt and appropriate irrigation before sowing can increase grain yield and water use efficiency wue of summer maize however their combined effect on crop wue and co2 emissions is not clear here our objective was to document the combined effects of nt and pre summer maize sowing irrigation on utilization of water applied and carbon emission activity during crop production field experiments were carried out in the north china plain ncp in 2016 and 2017 to test nt and conventional tillage ct only performed during the winter wheat planting season and three irrigation treatments termed pre summer maize sowing irrigation 30 70 and 110 mm during the summer maize growing seasons the results showed that compared with ct nt significantly reduced carbon cumulative emissions co2 c and water consumption and it increased grain yield by 11 3 and 7 4 in 2016 and 2017 respectively no significant difference was found for wue between the 70 mm and 110 mm pre sowing irrigation treatments but it was significantly higher in either case than wue under the 30 mm pre sowing irrigation treatment further wue and carbon emission efficiency cee were highest under the 70 and the 110 mm irrigation treatment in both years whereas carbon emissions per unit water consumption wuece were the lowest under the 70 mm irrigation treatment these results indicated that a combination of nt with 70 mm pre sowing irrigation can improve the regulation of soil carbon emissions and water consumption by summer maize in the ncp keywords conventional tillage evapotranspiration grain yield carbon emission pre sowing irrigation straw mulching 1 introduction summer maize is one of the most important crops in china where the planted area accounts for 30 of the total grain planting area in the north china plain ncp and the yield amounts to 50 of total grain yield obtained in the ncp zhang et al 2013 however water shortage is a primary factor limiting agricultural development in the ncp furthermore global climate change and concomitant irregular fluctuations during the rainy season in recent years have threated early growth of summer maize with drought stress consequently affecting the high and stable grain yield ma et al 2012 showed that soil moisture level before sowing had a significant influence on the rate of maize seedling emergence and subsequent growth therefore appropriate pre sowing irrigation is performed in the ncp to ensure high and stable summer maize grain yield nevertheless in addition to the shortage of water resources china also faces drastically increasing global co2 emissions and the resulting climate warming may lead to further significant increase in co2 emissions chun et al 2017 the soil can be a source of or a sink for atmospheric greenhouse gases depending on land use and soil management rastogi et al 2002 reduction of potential agricultural co2 emissions can account for over 20 of the total natural potential 90 of which is accounted for by soil carbon sequestration netz et al 2007 therefore it is necessary to use appropriate pre sowing irrigation in summer maize production to maintain early summer maize growth and thus ensure crop system stability or increase yield yan et al 2017 similarly soil carbon emission and crop water consumption must also to taken into account in short reducing soil carbon emissions and optimal irrigation level before planting are important for the future development of summer maize in ncp no tillage nt is a type of conservation tillage advocated worldwide as a sustainable management strategy to enhance soil health and crop growth while preserving the environment busari et al 2015 compared with conventional tillage ct under nt soil is less damaged ndezugalde et al 2009 water and labor saving is promoted and fuel equipment and production costs are substantially reduced derpsch et al 2010 ren et al 2018 reported that nt effectively reduced soil carbon emissions and increased crop water use efficiency wue in winter wheat in the ncp therefore nt soil management is very important for sustainable agriculture in the ncp soil carbon sequestration is considered an effective alternative to offset the increase of global atmospheric co2 concentration smith 2016 studies have shown that approximately 1500 2000 pg of carbon is stored in the soil as organic carbon additionally farmland is an ecosystem with strong carbon sequestration potential that can be very effective in reducing atmospheric co2 concentration deng et al 2016 indeed soil organic carbon soc plays a basic role in terrestrial ecosystem productivity and soil fertility lal 2010 soil tillage can alter soc decomposition by increasing soil disturbance and soil and crop residue contact thus allowing microbes to rapidly decompose crop residues whereby soc is reduced while concomitantly soil co2 emissions tend to increase al kaisi and yin 2005 in contrast under nt soil disturbance is minimized and straw cover is used although reports are controversial in this regard for example olson et al 2005 showed that nt could increase soc and reduce carbon emissions however du et al 2017 reported that nt did not contribute much to soc fixation therefore accurate measurement of soil carbon sequestration potential in terms of co2 flux in nt agroecosystems is of great significance saving water and reducing greenhouse gas co2 n2o etc emissions are important goals for sustainable agricultural development in the past many studies aimed at improving water carbon and nitrogen use efficiency as well as carbon and nitrogen fixation with respect to the interaction of carbon and nitrogen fixation in the soil gai et al 2018 showed that soil organic carbon plays an important role in soil nitrogen accumulation further xiao et al 2019 have devised a new cropping system that reduces water and fertilizer input increases nitrogen and water use efficiency and reduces greenhouse gas emissions in response to frequent spring drought and nitrogen overuse they reduced basal nitrogen rate to improve maize seedling growth water and nitrogen use efficiencies under drought stress by optimizing root morphology and distribution wang et al 2019 pre sowing irrigation is widely used in ncp as a water management technology to cope with drought caused by climate change li et al 2004 reported that soil moisture content before planting summer maize could affect the moisture content of each soil layer and water consumption at different depths in the soil profile yan et al 2017 showed that a combination of pre sowing irrigation and straw mulching significantly affected summer maize yield and wue in the ncp the relationship between crop water consumption and soil carbon emissions is a complex one under field conditions wue is an important factor affecting carbon absorption and water consumption through a coupling effect of carbon absorption and evapotranspiration keenan et al 2013 in order to objectively evaluate the water use status of the soil system hu et al 2016 used carbon emissions per unit water consumption wuece to coordinate grain yield carbon emissions and water consumption rutkowska et al 2018 showed that nt significantly affected soil carbon emission efficiency cee of summer maize ren et al 2018 indicated that nt increased wue cee and wuece but reduced winter wheat grain yield in summer maize production there is little information on comprehensive factors for assessing crop water and carbon use efficiencies therefore in this study we combined three key wue related factors grain yield evapotranspiration and carbon emission we hypothesized that under nt conditions evapotranspiration of summer maize would decrease and wue would increase under the premise of carbon sequestration thus promoting the development of sustainable agriculture therefore in this study our objective was to determine the following 1 the impact of nt on soil carbon emissions and water consumption 2 the impact of different irrigation amounts on summer maize yield under nt conditions 3 the impact of tillage and pre sowing irrigation on cee wue and wuece our rationale is to provide a sound basis for the establishment of an optimal management strategy that allows a substantial reduction of carbon emissions while significantly saving water without a negative effect on yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in 2016 and 2017 at the agricultural experiment station of shandong agricultural university in the ncp the site has a temperate continental semi humid monsoon climate with a mean precipitation of 453 7 mm in summer july to september which is approximately 65 1 of the annual precipitation each experimental plot was 3 0 m 3 0 m had loamy clay soil texture and was surrounded with concrete slabs to prevent lateral soil moisture flow total nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium contents in the top 0 20 cm soil layer were 108 3 16 2 and 92 6 mg kg respectively following the harvest of the winter wheat crop seeds of the summer maize variety zhengdan958 were planted manually on june 13 2016 and june 13 2017 at a density of 7 5 104 plants ha with a plant and row spacings of 22 2 cm and 60 0 cm respectively total precipitation in the 2016 and 2017 summer maize growing seasons was 495 2 and 369 6 mm fig 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design a split plot design with random zone arrangement was used treatments included two types of tillage nt and ct only performed during the winter wheat planting season combined with three pre summer maize sowing irrigation levels for total six treatments nt and ct with 30 mm pre sowing irrigation n30 and c30 with 70 mm pre sowing irrigation n70 and c70 and with 110 mm pre sowing irrigation n110 and c110 in the nt treatment the soil remained unplowed over the whole year in the ct treatment the soil was manually reversed up to a depth of 20 cm before winter wheat sowing and was not plowed before summer maize sowing straw mulching was performed in all treatments irrigation was performed on the day before sowing with water supplied via a pump outlet near the experimental site and directed to the experimental plots through plastic pipes water flow was controlled using a flow meter no irrigation was supplied during the growing seasons either years 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 co2 c cumulative emissions co2 emission flux was measured using a gxh 3052 l gas analyzer beijing li hua jun fang ltd beijing china with an air measuring chamber containing a pvc tube 12 cm high and 25 cm in diameter when co2 emissions on the soil surface were measured the air chamber was tightly covered to ensure no air leakage at the time of co2 determination the measured surface of the soil must remain intact co2 emissions were measured six times during the growing season each for 1 h between 09 00 am and 10 00 amat 2 min intervals on a sunny day co2 c cumulative emissions were calculated as follows wang et al 2013 chai et al 2014 1 f 60 h m p 8 314 273 t d c d t 2 c e σ f i 1 f i 2 t i 1 t i 12 44 24 in 1 f is the soil surface co2 flux the conversion coefficient of value 60 converts minutes to hours h is the effective height of the static box t is the average temperature of the measuring room d c d t is the linear slope of the gas concentration with time m is the mass of the gas and p is the atmospheric pressure at the time of determination in 2 ce is the total amount of soil carbon emissions f is soil respiration i 1 and i are the previous and the current sampling dates and t is the number of days after sowing 2 3 2 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration of summer maize was calculated using the following equation li et al 2010 3 e t p r d s w where et is evapotranspiration p is precipitation measured using a standard rain gauge at the weather station at the site r is surface runoff there were no major runoff events in the summer maize growth seasons owing to the cement slabs placed around each plot so we assumed surface runoff was insignificant d is the downward flux below the crop root zone deep percolation was ignored as we found negligible drainage at the site and sw is the change in soil storage water calculated as the initial soil moisture minus the soil moisture at the end of the growing season soil moisture content was measured using a cnc 503d neutron moisture meter super energy nuclear technology ltd beijing china readings were taken down to a soil depth of 160 cm at 10 cm intervals 2 3 3 grain yield to estimate grain yield 10 representative summer maize ears were harvested per plot on october 1 2016 and on september 30 2017 data recorded included the number of ears per square meter row numbers per ears kernel number per row 1000 kernel weight and total grain dry weight 2 3 4 water use efficiency water use efficiency wue was defined as follows zhou et al 2011 4 wue y et where y is grain yield and et is total evapotranspiration 2 3 5 carbon emissions per unit water consumption carbon emissions per unit water consumption wuece was calculated as follows hu et al 2017 5 wuece ce et where wuece are the carbon emissions per unit water consumption for the entire winter wheat growing season ce is the co2 c cumulative emission and et is the amount of evapotranspiration 2 3 6 carbon emission efficiency the carbon emission efficiency cee was calculated as follows hu et al 2016 6 cee y ce where y is the grain yield and ce is the co2 c cumulative emission 2 4 statistical analysis dps statistical analysis system and microsoft excel 2016 were used for data processing and statistical analysis analysis of variance was used to evaluate treatments effects anova was performed at a significance level of α 0 05 to determine differences among treatment means when significance was observed the least significant difference lsd post hoc test was used to conduct multiple comparisons 3 results and discussion 3 1 co2 c cumulative emissions total co2 c emissions in the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons ranged from 326 1 to 381 7 and from 304 7 to 355 5 g c m2 under nt respectively on the other hand the corresponding co2 c emissions under ct ranged from 375 4 to 436 8 and from 352 5 to 400 5 g c m2 fig 2 the difference in total co2 c emissions between the two growing seasons may be due to the differences in the precipitation period and rainfall in each year total co2 c emission under nt was 6 6 higher in 2016 than in 2017 concomitantly precipitation during the growing season was 34 greater in 2016 than the following year fig 1 furthermore the largest concentration of rainfall in 2016 coincided with the period when summer maize soil respiration peaked greater rainfall in 2016 likely resulted in increased root and microbial activities which in turn might have caused an increase in soil respiration rate eventually leading to an increase in total co2 c emissions that year wang et al 2016 li et al 2018 irrigation affects soil co2 production and emission kallenbach et al 2010 in both growing seasons co2 c emissions were 4 lower in the 30 mm treatment than those in the 70 mm treatments and about 15 0 lower than those in the 110 mm treatment this is because pre sowing irrigation directly affects soil water content and under seasonal heat and drought conditions soil respiration rate is positively related to soil moisture peng et al 2015 this in turn may increase soil carbon emissions correspondingly with increasing irrigation level when the impact of irrigation treatment on soil moisture disappeared different pre sowing irrigation levels affected the growth of summer maize differentially thus the greater the irrigation level the better the growth of summer maize li et al 2004 and the more developed was the maize root system overall soil respiration includes a 41 7 41 9 contribution from plant roots li et al 2018 which may lead to an increase in soil co2 emissions with increasing irrigation 3 2 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration increased with increasing pre sowing irrigation treatment further compared with ct nt showed overall lower evapotranspiration thus the same ranking was observed for evapotranspiration in both growing seasons namely c110 n110 c70 n70 c30 n30 fig 3 the evapotranspiration under the 110 mm treatment were 6 9 and 11 0 higher than those under the 70 mm and the 30 mm treatments while the evapotranspiration under nt was 3 4 and 2 3 lower than that under ct respectively two main reasons account for lower evapotranspiration under nt 1 nt can increase the gap in soil particles thus facilitating soil moisture storage jemai et al 2013 and 2 straw cover can improve soil moisture preservation gozubuyuk et al 2014 consistently busari et al 2013 useing a stable isotope technique showed that summer maize evapotranspiration was higher under ct than under nt 3 3 yield compositions and grain yield in both growing seasons kernel number per row ear number 1000 kernel weight and grain yield were significantly influenced by pre sowing irrigation irrespective of tillage table 1 in 2016 kernel number per row was 6 2 higher in the 70 than in the 30 mm treatment no significant difference in kernel number per row was observed between the 70 and 110 mm treatments however in 2017 pre sowing irrigation had no significant effect on the kernel number per row in 2016 the ear number in the 110 mm treatment was 4 3 higher than that in the 30 mm treatment however in 2017 the ear number in the 70 mm treatment was greater than in the 110 or the 30 mm treatment in both the growing seasons tillage had no significant effect on ear number in both growing seasons 1000 kernel weight in the 110 and 70 mm treatments was 4 4 and 2 7 higher than that in the 30 mm treatment grain yield was significantly influenced by both pre sowing irrigation and tillage method in both growing seasons grain yield under 110 mm pre sowing irrigation treatment was significantly higher 22 8 than under the 30 or the 70 mm 4 0 pre sowing irrigation treatments these findings are similar to those reported by yan et al 2017 who showed that high soil moisture before sowing resulted in increased number of ears grain number 1000 kernel weight and total yield of summer maize additionally grain yield under nt was 9 4 higher than that under ct in years the main reason explaining these results is that compared to ct nt reduces soil disturbance al kaisi and yin 2005 this improves soil structure soil permeability and saturated hydraulic conductivity arshad et al 1999 which in turn promotes crop growth and yield ct is performed on the top 0 30 cm surface soil soil extrusion by continuous ct causes the soil layer below the top 30 cm to become increasingly compact and a hardpan develops with limited soil porosity low permeability and low soil water storage capacity thereby leading to low wue crop growth and yield zheng et al 2015 3 4 wue cee and wuece the results described herein showed that in 2016 wue under the 70 mm irrigation treatment was significantly higher than under the 30 or the 110 mm treatments by 3 5 and 15 2 respectively in 2017 no significant difference in wue was noted between the 70 and the 110 mm treatments however in both cases the difference was significant compared to wue under the 30 mm irrigation treatment in both growing seasons wue under nt was 15 1 and 9 8 higher than that under ct respectively table 2 therefore the combined pre sowing irrigation with 70 mm and nt treatment significantly improved wue of summer maize however farmers cannot afford to aim for low carbon emissions and low water consumption at the expense of yield losses as this goes against the goals of intensive and efficient farming hu et al 2016 previous studies have used carbon emission efficiency cee calculated as energy yield divided by soil co2 emission the term explains the concern that higher energy yield may result in greater carbon emissions and carbon emissions per unit water consumption wuece the magnitude of soil co2 emission associated with per unit evapotranspiration and calculated as soil co2 emission divided by evapotranspiration to coordinate grain production carbon emissions and water consumption hu et al 2017 yin et al 2017 the results of such studies show that no tillage and intercropping can improve cee and reduce wuece in this study in both growing seasons cee was higher under the 70 mm irrigation treatment than under the 30 or the 110 mm treatment by 13 8 and 7 7 respectively cee was 27 6 higher under nt than under ct therefore a reasonable pre sowing irrigation level in combination with nt significantly increased cee in both growing seasons wuece was significantly lower 13 3 under nt than under ct further wuece showed no significant difference between the 70 and 30 mm treatments but it was 3 0 5 0 lower than under the 110 mm irrigation treatment in either case table 2 thus n70 can effectively limit water consumption allotting more to crop growth while reducing carbon emissions thus realizing a more efficient water use soc sequestration is one of the main agricultural strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions increase food security and improve agricultural sustainability appropriate farmland management practice such as nt and crop residue addition can increase soc accumulation however further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of pre sowing irrigations on carbon emissions and crop water use 4 conclusion compared with conventional tillage no tillage reduced soil co2 emissions while improving water use efficiency and yield of summer maize further in the two years over which this study was conducted water use efficiency and carbon emission efficiency were highest whereas carbon emissions per unit water consumption were lowest under the 70 mm irrigation treatment therefore a combination of no tillage and a 70 mm pre sowing irrigation may be an effective crop management strategy to enhance soil organic carbon storage and improve water use efficiency of summer

10933,no tillage nt and appropriate irrigation before sowing can increase grain yield and water use efficiency wue of summer maize however their combined effect on crop wue and co2 emissions is not clear here our objective was to document the combined effects of nt and pre summer maize sowing irrigation on utilization of water applied and carbon emission activity during crop production field experiments were carried out in the north china plain ncp in 2016 and 2017 to test nt and conventional tillage ct only performed during the winter wheat planting season and three irrigation treatments termed pre summer maize sowing irrigation 30 70 and 110 mm during the summer maize growing seasons the results showed that compared with ct nt significantly reduced carbon cumulative emissions co2 c and water consumption and it increased grain yield by 11 3 and 7 4 in 2016 and 2017 respectively no significant difference was found for wue between the 70 mm and 110 mm pre sowing irrigation treatments but it was significantly higher in either case than wue under the 30 mm pre sowing irrigation treatment further wue and carbon emission efficiency cee were highest under the 70 and the 110 mm irrigation treatment in both years whereas carbon emissions per unit water consumption wuece were the lowest under the 70 mm irrigation treatment these results indicated that a combination of nt with 70 mm pre sowing irrigation can improve the regulation of soil carbon emissions and water consumption by summer maize in the ncp keywords conventional tillage evapotranspiration grain yield carbon emission pre sowing irrigation straw mulching 1 introduction summer maize is one of the most important crops in china where the planted area accounts for 30 of the total grain planting area in the north china plain ncp and the yield amounts to 50 of total grain yield obtained in the ncp zhang et al 2013 however water shortage is a primary factor limiting agricultural development in the ncp furthermore global climate change and concomitant irregular fluctuations during the rainy season in recent years have threated early growth of summer maize with drought stress consequently affecting the high and stable grain yield ma et al 2012 showed that soil moisture level before sowing had a significant influence on the rate of maize seedling emergence and subsequent growth therefore appropriate pre sowing irrigation is performed in the ncp to ensure high and stable summer maize grain yield nevertheless in addition to the shortage of water resources china also faces drastically increasing global co2 emissions and the resulting climate warming may lead to further significant increase in co2 emissions chun et al 2017 the soil can be a source of or a sink for atmospheric greenhouse gases depending on land use and soil management rastogi et al 2002 reduction of potential agricultural co2 emissions can account for over 20 of the total natural potential 90 of which is accounted for by soil carbon sequestration netz et al 2007 therefore it is necessary to use appropriate pre sowing irrigation in summer maize production to maintain early summer maize growth and thus ensure crop system stability or increase yield yan et al 2017 similarly soil carbon emission and crop water consumption must also to taken into account in short reducing soil carbon emissions and optimal irrigation level before planting are important for the future development of summer maize in ncp no tillage nt is a type of conservation tillage advocated worldwide as a sustainable management strategy to enhance soil health and crop growth while preserving the environment busari et al 2015 compared with conventional tillage ct under nt soil is less damaged ndezugalde et al 2009 water and labor saving is promoted and fuel equipment and production costs are substantially reduced derpsch et al 2010 ren et al 2018 reported that nt effectively reduced soil carbon emissions and increased crop water use efficiency wue in winter wheat in the ncp therefore nt soil management is very important for sustainable agriculture in the ncp soil carbon sequestration is considered an effective alternative to offset the increase of global atmospheric co2 concentration smith 2016 studies have shown that approximately 1500 2000 pg of carbon is stored in the soil as organic carbon additionally farmland is an ecosystem with strong carbon sequestration potential that can be very effective in reducing atmospheric co2 concentration deng et al 2016 indeed soil organic carbon soc plays a basic role in terrestrial ecosystem productivity and soil fertility lal 2010 soil tillage can alter soc decomposition by increasing soil disturbance and soil and crop residue contact thus allowing microbes to rapidly decompose crop residues whereby soc is reduced while concomitantly soil co2 emissions tend to increase al kaisi and yin 2005 in contrast under nt soil disturbance is minimized and straw cover is used although reports are controversial in this regard for example olson et al 2005 showed that nt could increase soc and reduce carbon emissions however du et al 2017 reported that nt did not contribute much to soc fixation therefore accurate measurement of soil carbon sequestration potential in terms of co2 flux in nt agroecosystems is of great significance saving water and reducing greenhouse gas co2 n2o etc emissions are important goals for sustainable agricultural development in the past many studies aimed at improving water carbon and nitrogen use efficiency as well as carbon and nitrogen fixation with respect to the interaction of carbon and nitrogen fixation in the soil gai et al 2018 showed that soil organic carbon plays an important role in soil nitrogen accumulation further xiao et al 2019 have devised a new cropping system that reduces water and fertilizer input increases nitrogen and water use efficiency and reduces greenhouse gas emissions in response to frequent spring drought and nitrogen overuse they reduced basal nitrogen rate to improve maize seedling growth water and nitrogen use efficiencies under drought stress by optimizing root morphology and distribution wang et al 2019 pre sowing irrigation is widely used in ncp as a water management technology to cope with drought caused by climate change li et al 2004 reported that soil moisture content before planting summer maize could affect the moisture content of each soil layer and water consumption at different depths in the soil profile yan et al 2017 showed that a combination of pre sowing irrigation and straw mulching significantly affected summer maize yield and wue in the ncp the relationship between crop water consumption and soil carbon emissions is a complex one under field conditions wue is an important factor affecting carbon absorption and water consumption through a coupling effect of carbon absorption and evapotranspiration keenan et al 2013 in order to objectively evaluate the water use status of the soil system hu et al 2016 used carbon emissions per unit water consumption wuece to coordinate grain yield carbon emissions and water consumption rutkowska et al 2018 showed that nt significantly affected soil carbon emission efficiency cee of summer maize ren et al 2018 indicated that nt increased wue cee and wuece but reduced winter wheat grain yield in summer maize production there is little information on comprehensive factors for assessing crop water and carbon use efficiencies therefore in this study we combined three key wue related factors grain yield evapotranspiration and carbon emission we hypothesized that under nt conditions evapotranspiration of summer maize would decrease and wue would increase under the premise of carbon sequestration thus promoting the development of sustainable agriculture therefore in this study our objective was to determine the following 1 the impact of nt on soil carbon emissions and water consumption 2 the impact of different irrigation amounts on summer maize yield under nt conditions 3 the impact of tillage and pre sowing irrigation on cee wue and wuece our rationale is to provide a sound basis for the establishment of an optimal management strategy that allows a substantial reduction of carbon emissions while significantly saving water without a negative effect on yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in 2016 and 2017 at the agricultural experiment station of shandong agricultural university in the ncp the site has a temperate continental semi humid monsoon climate with a mean precipitation of 453 7 mm in summer july to september which is approximately 65 1 of the annual precipitation each experimental plot was 3 0 m 3 0 m had loamy clay soil texture and was surrounded with concrete slabs to prevent lateral soil moisture flow total nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium contents in the top 0 20 cm soil layer were 108 3 16 2 and 92 6 mg kg respectively following the harvest of the winter wheat crop seeds of the summer maize variety zhengdan958 were planted manually on june 13 2016 and june 13 2017 at a density of 7 5 104 plants ha with a plant and row spacings of 22 2 cm and 60 0 cm respectively total precipitation in the 2016 and 2017 summer maize growing seasons was 495 2 and 369 6 mm fig 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design a split plot design with random zone arrangement was used treatments included two types of tillage nt and ct only performed during the winter wheat planting season combined with three pre summer maize sowing irrigation levels for total six treatments nt and ct with 30 mm pre sowing irrigation n30 and c30 with 70 mm pre sowing irrigation n70 and c70 and with 110 mm pre sowing irrigation n110 and c110 in the nt treatment the soil remained unplowed over the whole year in the ct treatment the soil was manually reversed up to a depth of 20 cm before winter wheat sowing and was not plowed before summer maize sowing straw mulching was performed in all treatments irrigation was performed on the day before sowing with water supplied via a pump outlet near the experimental site and directed to the experimental plots through plastic pipes water flow was controlled using a flow meter no irrigation was supplied during the growing seasons either years 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 co2 c cumulative emissions co2 emission flux was measured using a gxh 3052 l gas analyzer beijing li hua jun fang ltd beijing china with an air measuring chamber containing a pvc tube 12 cm high and 25 cm in diameter when co2 emissions on the soil surface were measured the air chamber was tightly covered to ensure no air leakage at the time of co2 determination the measured surface of the soil must remain intact co2 emissions were measured six times during the growing season each for 1 h between 09 00 am and 10 00 amat 2 min intervals on a sunny day co2 c cumulative emissions were calculated as follows wang et al 2013 chai et al 2014 1 f 60 h m p 8 314 273 t d c d t 2 c e σ f i 1 f i 2 t i 1 t i 12 44 24 in 1 f is the soil surface co2 flux the conversion

with time m is the mass of the gas and p is the atmospheric pressure at the time of determination in 2 ce is the total amount of soil carbon emissions f is soil respiration i 1 and i are the previous and the current sampling dates and t is the number of days after sowing 2 3 2 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration of summer maize was calculated using the following equation li et al 2010 3 e t p r d s w where et is evapotranspiration p is precipitation measured using a standard rain gauge at the weather station at the site r is surface runoff there were no major runoff events in the summer maize growth seasons owing to the cement slabs placed around each plot so we assumed surface runoff was insignificant d is the downward flux below the crop root zone deep percolation was ignored as we found negligible drainage at the site and sw is the change in soil storage water calculated as the initial soil moisture minus the soil moisture at the end of the growing season soil moisture content was measured using a cnc 503d neutron moisture meter super energy nuclear technology ltd beijing china readings were taken down to a soil depth of 160 cm at 10 cm intervals 2 3 3 grain yield to estimate grain yield 10 representative summer maize ears were harvested per plot on october 1 2016 and on september 30 2017 data recorded included the number of ears per square meter row numbers per ears kernel number per row 1000 kernel weight and total grain dry weight 2 3 4 water use efficiency water use efficiency wue was defined as follows zhou et al 2011 4 wue y et where y is grain yield and et is total evapotranspiration 2 3 5 carbon emissions per unit water consumption carbon emissions per unit water consumption wuece was calculated as follows hu et al 2017 5 wuece ce et where wuece are the carbon emissions per unit water consumption for the entire winter wheat growing season ce is the co2 c cumulative emission and et is the amount of evapotranspiration 2 3 6 carbon emission efficiency the carbon emission efficiency cee was calculated as follows hu et al 2016 6 cee y ce where y is the grain yield and ce is the co2 c cumulative emission 2 4 statistical analysis dps statistical analysis system and microsoft excel 2016 were used for data processing and statistical analysis analysis of variance was used to evaluate treatments effects anova was performed at a significance level of α 0 05 to determine differences among treatment means when significance was observed the least significant difference lsd post hoc test was used to conduct multiple comparisons 3 results and discussion 3 1 co2 c cumulative emissions total co2 c emissions in the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons ranged from 326 1 to 381 7 and from 304 7 to 355 5 g c m2 under nt respectively on the other hand the corresponding co2 c emissions under ct ranged from 375 4 to 436 8 and from 352 5 to 400 5 g c m2 fig 2 the difference in total co2 c emissions between the two growing seasons may be due to the differences in the precipitation period and rainfall in each year total co2 c emission under nt was 6 6 higher in 2016 than in 2017 concomitantly precipitation during the growing season was 34 greater in 2016 than the following year fig 1 furthermore the largest concentration of rainfall in 2016 coincided with the period when summer maize soil respiration peaked greater rainfall in 2016 likely resulted in increased root and microbial activities which in turn might have caused an increase in soil respiration rate eventually leading to an increase in total co2 c emissions that year wang et al 2016 li et al 2018 irrigation affects soil co2 production and emission kallenbach et al 2010 in both growing seasons co2 c emissions were 4 lower in the 30 mm treatment than those in the 70 mm treatments and about 15 0 lower than those in the 110 mm treatment this is because pre sowing irrigation directly affects soil water content and under seasonal heat and drought conditions soil respiration rate is positively related to soil moisture peng et al 2015 this in turn may increase soil carbon emissions correspondingly with increasing irrigation level when the impact of irrigation treatment on soil moisture disappeared different pre sowing irrigation levels affected the growth of summer maize differentially thus the greater the irrigation level the better the growth of summer maize li et al 2004 and the more developed was the maize root system overall soil respiration includes a 41 7 41 9 contribution from plant roots li et al 2018 which may lead to an increase in soil co2 emissions with increasing irrigation 3 2 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration increased with increasing pre sowing irrigation treatment further compared with ct nt showed overall lower evapotranspiration thus the same ranking was observed for evapotranspiration in both growing seasons namely c110 n110 c70 n70 c30 n30 fig 3 the evapotranspiration under the 110 mm treatment were 6 9 and 11 0 higher than those under the 70 mm and the 30 mm treatments while the evapotranspiration under nt was 3 4 and 2 3 lower than that under ct respectively two main reasons account for lower evapotranspiration under nt 1 nt can increase the gap in soil particles thus facilitating soil moisture storage jemai et al 2013 and 2 straw cover can improve soil moisture preservation gozubuyuk et al 2014 consistently busari et al 2013 useing a stable isotope technique showed that summer maize evapotranspiration was higher under ct than under nt 3 3 yield compositions and grain yield in both growing seasons kernel number per row ear number 1000 kernel weight and grain yield were significantly influenced by pre sowing irrigation irrespective of tillage table 1 in 2016 kernel number per row was 6 2 higher in the 70 than in the 30 mm treatment no significant difference in kernel number per row was observed between the 70 and 110 mm treatments however in 2017 pre sowing irrigation had no significant effect on the kernel number per row in 2016 the ear number in the 110 mm treatment was 4 3 higher than that in the 30 mm treatment however in 2017 the ear number in the 70 mm treatment was greater than in the 110 or the 30 mm treatment in both the growing seasons tillage had no significant effect on ear number in both growing seasons 1000 kernel weight in the 110 and 70 mm treatments was 4 4 and 2 7 higher than that in the 30 mm treatment grain yield was significantly influenced by both pre sowing irrigation and tillage method in both growing seasons grain yield under 110 mm pre sowing irrigation treatment was significantly higher 22 8 than under the 30 or the 70 mm 4 0 pre sowing irrigation treatments these findings are similar to those reported by yan et al 2017 who showed that high soil moisture before sowing resulted in increased number of ears grain number 1000 kernel weight and total yield of summer maize additionally grain yield under nt was 9 4 higher than that under ct in years the main reason explaining these results is that compared to ct nt reduces soil disturbance al kaisi and yin 2005 this improves soil structure soil permeability and saturated hydraulic conductivity arshad et al 1999 which in turn promotes crop growth and yield ct is performed on the top 0 30 cm surface soil soil extrusion by continuous ct causes the soil layer below the top 30 cm to become increasingly compact and a hardpan develops with limited soil porosity low permeability and low soil water storage capacity thereby leading to low wue crop growth and yield zheng et al 2015 3 4 wue cee and wuece the results described herein showed that in 2016 wue under the 70 mm irrigation treatment was significantly higher than under the 30 or the 110 mm treatments by 3 5 and 15 2 respectively in 2017 no significant difference in wue was noted between the 70 and the 110 mm treatments however in both cases the difference was significant compared to wue under the 30 mm irrigation treatment in both growing seasons wue under nt was 15 1 and 9 8 higher than that under ct respectively table 2 therefore the combined pre sowing irrigation with 70 mm and nt treatment significantly improved wue of summer maize however farmers cannot afford to aim for low carbon emissions and low water consumption at the expense of yield losses as this goes against the goals of intensive and efficient farming hu et al 2016 previous studies have used carbon emission efficiency cee calculated as energy yield divided by soil co2 emission the term explains the concern that higher energy yield may result in greater carbon emissions and carbon emissions per unit water consumption wuece the magnitude of soil co2 emission associated with per unit evapotranspiration and calculated as soil co2 emission divided by evapotranspiration to coordinate grain production carbon emissions and water consumption hu et al 2017 yin et al 2017 the results of such studies show that no tillage and intercropping can improve cee and reduce wuece in this study in both growing seasons cee was higher under the 70 mm irrigation treatment than under the 30 or the 110 mm treatment by 13 8 and 7 7 respectively cee was 27 6 higher under nt than under ct therefore a reasonable pre sowing irrigation level in combination with nt significantly increased cee in both growing seasons wuece was significantly lower 13 3 under nt than under ct further wuece showed no significant difference between the 70 and 30 mm treatments but it was 3 0 5 0 lower than under the 110 mm irrigation treatment in either case table 2 thus n70 can effectively limit water consumption allotting more to crop growth while reducing carbon emissions thus realizing a more efficient water use soc sequestration is one of the main agricultural strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions increase food security and improve agricultural sustainability appropriate farmland management practice such as nt and crop residue addition can increase soc accumulation however further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of pre sowing irrigations on carbon emissions and crop water use 4 conclusion compared with conventional tillage no tillage reduced soil co2 emissions while improving water use efficiency and yield of summer maize further in the two years over which this study was conducted water use efficiency and carbon emission efficiency were highest whereas carbon emissions per unit water consumption were lowest under the 70 mm irrigation treatment therefore a combination of no tillage and a 70 mm pre sowing irrigation may be an effective crop management strategy to enhance soil organic carbon storage and improve water use efficiency of summer

10934,subsurface membrane irrigation systems controlled by changes in the water potential in the soil plant atmosphere continuum were used to cultivate phaseolus vulgaris over a full growth cycle 64 days membrane irrigation systems used a thin polyamide film supported on either a woven hydrophilic support fo tfc treatment or a non woven hydrophobic support ro treatment water use efficiency was assessed using leaf biomass per unit irrigation water and compared to conventionally irrigated plants control additionally gas exchange and fluorescence parameters as well as stable isotopes were used to assess the plants physiological status soil water content over the growth cycle was maintained at 0 7 cm3 cm 3 under control conditions and declined from 0 6 to 0 12 cm3 cm 3 during plant growth below residual moisture content under both fo tfc and ro membrane irrigation notwithstanding this the total leaf dry matter was statistically equivalent for control plants 38 4 g and fo tfc treated plants 29 6 g and approximately 68 lower for ro treated plants the internal over external carbon concentration ci ca in the leaves and efficiency of open photosystem ii reaction centres in the light fv fm were statistically equivalent in membrane treatments and control plants similarly carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n isotope composition as well as n of green bean pods and leaves were statistically equivalent for plants grown on fo tfc and control indicating no effect on beans protein content total bean production per parcel and plant water use efficiency wue for conventional irrigation 0 24 kg at 10 2 kg m 3 wue was statistically equivalent to plants grown on fo tfc treatment 0 19 kg at 12 8 kg m 3 wue although the wue for ro treatment 11 4 kg m 3 was statistically equivalent to control the total bean production per parcel was significantly lower 0 07 kg results indicate that subsurface membrane irrigation may be a solution for improved water management without compromising yield production and quality keywords membrane technology water management phaseolus vulgaris gas exchange stable isotopes 1 introduction the expansion of irrigated agriculture is attended by an increase in land exploitation and fresh water withdrawals chen et al 2018 in general maximisation of irrigation water use efficiency will be contingent upon developing efficient water delivery systems and optimizing irrigation scheduling khan et al 2012 rockström et al 2014 zahraei et al 2017 in terms of water use drip irrigation has been promoted as the most efficient irrigation system it can achieve a water use efficiency 70 higher than flood irrigation it can accommodate cultivation of 90 more crops varieties in comparison to rain fed irrigation shamshery et al 2017 and finally it has superior performance for saline water usage in comparison to sprinkler irrigation due to continuous root zone wetting that minimizes osmotic and matric stress ayars et al 2015 uniformity along the drip lines is provided by ensuring each emitter comprising narrow apertures or as long narrow bore labyrinths zhang et al 2013 has a common resistance to water flow much greater than the resistance to flow throughout the distribution system nakayama and bucks 1981 however drip irrigation has not always performed to its full potential due to design installation operation and maintenance issues as described by lamm and camp 2007 irrigation uniformity is subjected to individual or coupled effects from poor manufacturing uniformity of emitters inadequate spatial distribution of emitters and marginal water quality that causes emitters to clog which requires careful filtration it is also important to select adequate emitter flow rate that matches the soil hydraulic conductivity which can be highly variable otherwise emitters lose the ability to control flow and this is dependent on soil properties lazarovitch et al 2006 all large scale irrigation systems are supply driven and therefore require the prediction of plant water demand and external management of irrigation scheduling irrigation schedule can be based on estimated atmospheric demand allen et al 1998 changes in available soil water content swc or direct plant signals such as stem diameter variation fernández and cuevas 2010 nadler 2004 zhang et al 2006 leaf turgor pressure martínez gimeno et al 2017 and leaf temperature monitored by infrared thermometry chen 2015 all such methods encounter sampling problems so that the estimates have a varying level of uncertainty the combination of that uncertainty with the heterogeneity of application noted above means that managing irrigation scheduling to supply just the required amount of water as efficiency would dictate is likely to result in an uneven and low yielding crop hence over irrigation appears to offer a risk reduction solution armstrong et al 2001 although at a significant cost to water use efficiency excessive water use contributes to additional pumping costs water lost to the environment as run off or deep percolation possibly contributing to environmental degradation such as salinization on the other hand inadequate watering will cause yield reductions because either the field as a whole has been undersupplied or because heterogeneity in the system leads to non uniform water application with parts of the field over or under irrigated a demand driven irrigation system might in theory overcome a number of these limitations we define demand driven as a system in which water flow to the plant is driven and controlled by the demand for water at the surface of the plant root water would have to be conveyed to the plant roots in a permeable structure that would not release water unless some driving mechanism such as a water potential gradient drew water from the structure the lowered water potential at the root surface is a way of naturally imposing a suitable water potential gradient relative to a high potential feed water so long as each plant in the field has adequate access to the structure s surface behind which water is constantly available heterogeneity of water application due to non uniformity in the manufacture or operation of the irrigation system is theoretically eliminated soil in contact with this porous surface will be wet only by infiltration under tension this will limit the extent of such infiltration and eliminate saturated flow particularly gravity assisted saturated flow berry et al 1992 quiñones bolaños et al 2005 there have been previous efforts to develop such water potential driven irrigation systems the use of forward osmosis fo membranes in water treatment specifically for agriculture has focused on the application of fertilizers as the draw solution fdfo phuntsho et al 2011 2012 the fdfo concept is based on the dilution of a fertilizer solution due to its higher osmotic potential than the feed water which would have as a final product a fertigation solution ready to be used on irrigation however major challenges yet to be overcome have prevented the system from being fully implemented such as fertilizer selection and draw solution concentration which are directly related to membrane fouling and productivity decline phuntsho et al 2014 the fdfo system has been tested for the fertigation of tomato however the final produced water presented salts in concentrations higher than the plant requirements requiring dilution with water of higher quality majeed et al 2014 additionally water supply is disconnected from the direct signalling of plant demand through their root system another claimed precision irrigation system is based on pervaporation a membrane separation process in response to a vapour pressure gradient lower on the permeate side conventionally generated by a vacuum pump or gas carrier or by difference in temperature when the feed water is at higher temperature than the permeate side brant 2014 a membrane based pervaporation system that allows reuse of wastewater generated during gas and oil production for irrigation was investigated by quiñones bolaños et al 2005 when a non porous hydrophilic structure was placed in direct contact with soil and the water transported and evaporated on the soil side expected to provide adequate soil moisture to plants results have shown that water delivery flux was mostly affected by feed pressure followed by soil water content as irrigation water was delivered most efficiently when the surrounding soil was dry enough to draw moisture from the tubing the system presents limited control on permeate condensation from the vapour phase which directly affects supply uniformity in addition to that there is a lack of information in the literature with respect to how plants interact with soil moisture in the vapour phase todman et al 2013 thus a system of continuous transport of water in the liquid phase is ideal another membrane based irrigation system has been registered by nasa as part of a project to produce food under microgravity conditions on spacecraft which includes a series of designs of porous tube based irrigation that relies on plant root water extraction dreschel et al 1994 the designs include the porous tube plant nutrient delivery system ptpnds a hydrophilic microporous material the astroculture comprised of metal membrane tubing and the plant generic bioprocessing apparatus nutrient delivery system pgba nds consisting of flat membranes used to water separate growth bag units the majority of available literature reports on the ptpnds this system consists of a ceramic microporous tube also tested for different materials and pore sizes jones and or 1998 hydrated by capillary action to control delivery of water and dissolved nutrients directly to plant root system grown aeroponically attached to the tubing dreschel et al 2003 1994 1992 scovazzo et al 2001 experiments have confirmed the hydrotropism behaviour of pea roots moving toward and around the tubing water source takahashi et al 1992 the ptpnds gives great insight on precise plant demand driven irrigation nevertheless these technologies even if effective are unlikely to become practical at field level for which irrigation products need to be produced from a minimum number of components for economically attractive manufacture and be flexible but robust to allow transport handling and installation on a kilometric scale without damage thus a technology which offers an alternative tubing material that permits selective filtration is desired to allow large scale field cultivation we propose an irrigation method which uses a selectively permeable membrane fashioned as a porous tube structure and relies on the low root water potential to draw water across the membrane from the feedstock preliminary results show that the roots of plants under these conditions develop intimate contact with polymeric membranes and are able to complete a growth cycle when exclusively irrigated by the membrane irrigation lima et al 2017 2016a b c 2015 this reduces the role of the soil as a water transport medium so the associated effects of soil hydraulic heterogeneity are suppressed also the mechanism of water movement through the membrane is quite different from the convective flow regime of drip emitters so that there are no orifices to block rather than points of water emission the entire surface of the porous structure is available for water transport to plants this paper provides a demonstration of irrigation via a selectively permeable membrane over a common bean complete growth cycle using a range of physiological and agronomic measures including gas exchange stable isotope composition and plant water use efficiency for harvested yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of selective membrane subsurface irrigation pressure driven membrane filtration processes such as reverse osmosis ro are based on the principle that water molecules selectively migrate across a semi permeable membrane when hydraulic pressure higher than the osmotic pressure of the untreated water is applied ro membranes are assumed to be non porous or to have pores of such small possibly molecular size that they are effectively non porous water migration occurs by solution in the milieu of the selective layer and diffusion through it described as the solution diffusion model zaidi et al 2015 in fo filtration a similar transport mechanism operates but the driving force is provided by the difference in water potential typically osmotic potential of the feed and permeate solutions on each side of the membrane mulder 2000 razmjou et al 2013 plants make a hydraulic connection between the water source soil water and the atmosphere which forms the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac slatyer 1967 a water potential gradient that develops along the spac is responsible for driving the water movement from positions of higher water potential to positions of lower water potential creating a preferential water movement direction from source to atmosphere passioura 1982 slatyer 1967 taiz and zeiger 2002 critically transpiration leads to a lowered water potential in the roots that normally would provide the driving force for water movement from the soil to the roots the proposed selective membrane subsurface irrigation system uses this natural low root water potential of plants to draw water across a semi permeable membrane from feed water circulating in the irrigation tube theoretically plants would draw water across the membrane to meet their water requirements in both quantity and time meaning that water transport across membranes is continuously responsive to the water loss via evapotranspiration in addition theory predicts that the membrane may be able to provide a measure of separation of water supplied to the plants from salts e g nacl present in the feedstock allowing safe field irrigation with low quality water as salts are prevented from accessing plant roots and soil 2 2 membrane irrigation setup in each treatment a bilaterally symmetric perspex component supported a membrane on each face and provided uniform distribution of feedstock water across the inner surface selective layer of the membrane the membrane was clamped to this component with a double o ring seal to prevent soil water leaks and root intrusion each face exposed 196 cm2 of membrane to direct contact with soil and roots each perspex irrigation unit was installed inside a planter pot w 750 h 230 l 270 and connected to a dedicated pump iwaki md 30rz 220 motor 1 16 hp and water reservoir for a closed loop cross flow water movement from which plants were able to draw water fig 1 local potable water 0 3 ds m was commonly used for all treatment membrane irrigation systems were periodically inspected for any leaks adequate water tank level and flow rate which was set to 1 l min 1 by regulating the flow control valve aperture to the point where 1 l min 1 was reading on the individual rotameters installed after the valves fig 1 water flow was maintained continuously during the experiment duration resulting in a total estimated energy consumption of 79 4 kw h per pump 2 3 plant growth conditions common bean phaseolus vulgaris l was cultivated in the glasshouse for 64 days from sowing to harvest on surface hand watering control and membrane based subsurface irrigation using a previously tested standard soil potting mix prepared from coco peat river sand organic mix and a mix of fertilizers having a water content of 0 5 cm3 cm 3 lima et al 2017 control swc was initially brought to field capacity by saturation followed by 24 h drainage prior to sowing followed by periodic hand watering to replenish the soil water content back to field capacity by allowing some drainage to occur soil water subtraction by evapotranspiration was determined using the water balance method from the difference between input from irrigation water and output from drainage a previous experiment determined that bean plants used in average 0 1 0 3 l day 1 it was determined during a previous experiment that bean plants used in average 0 1 0 3 l day 1 under similar conditions lima et al 2017 which was used to initially guide the control watering regime later increased to 0 5 l day 1 during vegetative growth phase to maintain some drainage as an indication of soil water replenishment to field capacity the membrane based irrigation commenced 7 days prior to sowing to allow soil to hydrate before placing the membrane systems in the soil they were individually tested for leaks presence of leaks was also checked throughout the experiment from the planter pot drain pipe a total of nine experimental units were used to test two types of semi permeable membrane fo tfc fo8040 from csm toray korea and ro bw30 from dow usa and the hand watered control treatment with three replicates of each 2 4 soil and plant measurements swc was monitored throughout the experiment using a portable thetaprobe device delta t devices ltd england the relationship between the swc and matric potential was determined according to the filter paper method de almeida et al 2015 and fitted to the van genuchten model using the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 accuracy of thetaprobe readings given as volumetric water content was verified against gravimetric swc of known soil volumes resulting in a regression curve used to adjust daily measurements r2 0 94 temperature relative humidity incident solar radiation data were logged hourly air vapour pressure deficit δe was calculated according to fao 56 allen et al 1998 daily water movement across the membranes was regularly logged on a 10 min interval using odyssey capacitance water level loggers dataflow systems ltd nz calibrated to show the water level in each reservoir total water usage for control plants was monitored and adjusted based on a water balance method lamm et al 2007 comparison between control and membrane irrigation provided a reference on biomass accumulation and yield of plants accessing water available in the soil in comparison to plants that needed to overcome membrane resistance to access water plant response to irrigation treatments was evaluated by measuring germination plant height measured to the tip of the main stem and fresh and dry mass of leaves stem and pods at harvest additionally analysis of nitrogen δ15n and carbon δ13c isotopic composition of leaves and pods was measured using a delta v isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled to confloiv and flashht peripherals thermo fisher scientific bremen germany measurements of carbon assimilation rate a stomatal conductance gs the ratio of internal to external concentration of carbon in leaves ci ca and quantum efficiency of open photosystem ii reaction centres as a measure of water stress on the photosystem fv fm were taken on fully expanded leaves 41 days after sowing using a li 6400 xt photosynthesis system li cor usa photosynthetically active radiation inside the chamber was kept constant throughout measurements at 1007 6 4 1 μmol m 2 s 1 and air temperature within the leaf chamber remained at 26 2 c three successive measurements were taken throughout the afternoon starting at 12 pm 3 pm and 5 pm with three replicates each leaf stomatal density was measured by counting number of stomata on scanning electron microscopy sem images divided by the leaf area determined using the software image j zhao et al 2015 2 5 statistical analysis one way anova was used to identify significant differences between treatments means of seed germination indices and plant growth variables were separated and compared by the tukey test at a probability of 5 using the sisvar software ferreira 2011 3 results 3 1 soil hydration and germination success swc differed between treatments at the beginning of the experiment but membrane treatments became similar at harvest fig 2 a for the initial swc the control treatment averaged in 0 74 cm3 cm 3 fig 2b statistically equal to fo tfc 0 62 cm3 cm 3 and superior to ro 0 53 cm3 cm 3 fig 2b with respect to membrane treatments fo tfc swc at day 7 was statistically equal to ro fig 2b no significant difference was observed between treatments for germination success with results equal to 73 62 and 58 for control fo tfc and ro treatment respectively table 1 however lower performance of ro wetting was revealed in a significant increase in emergence time 9 3 days in comparison to both control 8 days and fo tfc 7 6 days which were statistically equivalent to each other table 1 after 19 days of membrane irrigation corresponding to 12 days after sowing and when seedling emergence had ceased swc for membrane treatments started to decline continuously fig 2a this demonstrates that soil water moisture is utilized by seedlings during the establishment phase before roots develop directly on membrane surface which created a thick barrier between membrane and soil and is understood to limit soil hydration the swc for membrane treatments reached an average of 0 12 cm3 cm 3 at the end of 63 days after sowing fig 2c which according to the soil water retention characteristic curve fitting using the van genutchen model using the retc software falls below the soil residual water content 0 22 cm3 cm 3 3 2 plant growth seedling height over the duration of the experiment duration increased until day 50 after sowing after which stem elongation plateaued and statistical equality was found among treatments fig 3 a linear regression was used to determine stem elongation rate for the first 15 days corresponding to seedling establishment and for the period from 20 to 50 days after sowing during the seedling establishment phase 15 days the fo tfc stem elongation rate was observed to be 0 57 cm d 1 statistically equal to the ro 0 42 cm day 1 but higher than the control 0 24 cm day 1 table 1 as a result the fo tfc reached an average height of 8 1 cm statistically different to both ro 5 1 cm and control 3 7 cm by 37 and 54 respectively after establishment a similar trend for stem elongation was observed with the fo tfc 1 15 cm day 1 remaining higher than both control 0 94 cm day 1 and ro 0 6 cm day 1 table 1 although plant height was similar between the control and ro plants were more vigorous in the control compared to ro fig 3b considering the total ro leaf biomass accumulation 12 1 g was significantly lower than the control 38 4 g table 1 3 3 stomatal density since stomatal numbers can affect the rate of co2 uptake and water loss sem images were used to investigate whether the membrane irrigation had any effect on leaf abaxial stomatal density lower leaf surface fig 4 no statistically significant effect of membrane type on leaf stomatal density was observed between treatments with an average equal to 184 pores mm 2 for both control and fo tfc and 175 pores mm 2 for ro table 1 3 4 leaf gas exchange and fluorescence a statistically significant difference between treatments was observed for carbon assimilation a and stomatal conductance gs at peak water demand 12 pm with the control presenting the highest values followed by fo tfc and ro fig 5 a and b control a and gs for the 12 pm interval were equal to 16 2 μmol m 2 s 1 and 0 16 mol m 2 s 1 respectively control a was higher than both fo tfc and ro by a factor of 1 2 and 2 5 while control gs was superior to fo tfc and ro by a factor of 1 5 and 3 2 respectively membrane treatments and control showed the same trend for e as for a and gs however were statistically equivalent due to large variation of e between plants fig 5c leaf internal over external carbon concentration ci ca fig 5d and quantum efficiency of open photosystem ii psii reaction centres in the light fv fm fig 5e showed no effect of irrigation treatment in addition to the short term gas exchange measurements stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of leaves and pods δ13c and δ15n as well as n content n were measured as an integrative measure of physiological performance of the beans in the different treatments fig 6 δ13c in leaves was significantly different between control and ro treatment with the fo tfc being statistically equivalent to both control and membrane fig 6a control leaves were characterised as the most negative 28 3 followed by the fo tfc 27 9 and ro membrane 26 4 no significant differences were observed between control and membrane treatments for δ13c in pods fig 6a δ15n in pods and leaves fig 6b and for percentage of nitrogen in pods and leaves fig 6c 3 5 plant material analysis a summary of plant growth parameters and water usage is shown on table 1 total leaf dry mass ldm total bean production and total water consumption responded significantly to irrigation treatments average ldm for control fo tfc and ro were equal to 38 4 29 6 and 12 1 g respectively with the ro being significantly lower than the control however when total ldm was normalized by the number of germinated plants there was no significant difference for ldm per plant between treatments with results for control fo tfc and ro equal to 2 7 2 4 and 1 1 g plant 1 respectively pod production per plant was accessed by dividing the total fresh weight of pods by the number of germinated plants with no significant difference found between control 0 017 kg plant 1 and fo tfc 0 015 kg plant 1 however control was significantly higher than ro 0 006 kg plant 1 table 1 a significant difference was also observed on total bean production per treatment table 1 with results from control and fo tfc equal to 0 24 and 0 19 kg respectively which were significantly higher than ro 0 07 kg by a factor of 3 and 2 5 efficiency of water usage wue was evaluated as total pod production divided by the volume of water used by plants over their entire life cycle irmak et al 2011 results for wue did not present statistically significant differences between treatments table 1 4 discussion 4 1 soil water content prior to germination swc for the first 7 days was considered a balance between infiltration from the membranes and evaporation from the bare soil surface on day 7 swc for ro was significantly lower than for fo tfc this suggests superior infiltration across the fo tfc membrane for similar conditions of environmental evaporative demand initial control swc was found higher than both fo tfc and ro by 19 and 40 respectively this is most likely due to the slower infiltration under tension from membranes in comparison to control initially set at field capacity possible practical solutions to improve initial soil hydration when using the membrane irrigation are allowing longer wetting periods or further studies on membrane design to increase the water flow rate despite of no effect of initial swc being observed on final germination percentage table 1 a positive correlation was observed between swc at sowing and the percentage of seeds that germinated on day 7 after sowing r2 of 0 74 a positive correlation was also found between total leaf dry mass accumulation and total pod production r2 of 0 92 demonstrating the importance of adequate swc for germination which improves total leaf mass and final yield white et al 1994 the lower soil moisture content at sowing time for the ro fig 2b was reflected in longer germination time in comparison to fo tfc and control swc during the germination phase has been reported to affect both germination rate and time as water transport to germinate seeds is affected evans and etherington 1990 marginal soil water contents 1 4 1 4 mpa have been observed to slightly delay the time wheat germination by a maximum of 2 days until onset of favourable conditions when compared to optimal moisture conditions 0 5 1 14 mpa in contrast soil conditions considered dry delayed germination by 10 days wuest and lutcher 2013 considering that adequate soil moisture content for germination is important as germination percentage can result in a reduction of final leaf area and yield table 1 it is crucial to select a membrane that is capable of initiating and maintaining adequate soil moisture content during the germination phase after 19 days of membrane irrigation correspondent to 12 days after sowing swc for membrane treatments started to decline continuously fig 2a coincidently seedling emergence was no longer observed to increase past day 13 after sowing intense development of roots directly on the membrane surface which creates a thick barrier between membrane and soil is believed to have limited soil hydration in a previous experiment where seedlings were grown for 15 days after sowing roots were observed to completely cover the membrane area of 113 cm2 exposed to them resulting in a final gravimetric soil water content as low as 4 lima et al 2015 after 64 days of membrane irrigation roots showed a dense development directly on the membrane surface which considerably limited the contact between soil and membrane surface a similar root matting development has been reported around a microporous ceramic irrigation tube surface area berry et al 1992 the soil as an isolated system from the water source would have limited hydration and constant water loss would occur through evaporation as a result final swc for membrane treatments fig 2c were found to be below the soil permanent wilting point and the soil residual water content as determined through the soil water retention characteristic curve the zone of residual saturation is described as when the remaining water present in the soil is held within soil pores only by adsorptive forces and no longer by capillary forces sillers et al 2001 soil water movement at that point is present mainly as vapour and film flow strongly adhered to soil particles surface with a removal energy demand reaching values of 1000 mpa vanapalli et al 1998 most plants are only able to take up water at or above the permanent wilting point of around 1 5 mpa shaxson and barber 2003 thus sustainable plant growth at those soil conditions would be unviable unless plants had access to water from sources other than the soil water in the present study maintenance of bean plant vitality even at very low soil water content was attributed to the development of their root system directly on the membrane surface as a successful strategy to absorb water in contrast soil from control treatments which received favourable irrigation remained at relatively constant soil water content 4 2 stomatal density gas exchange and fluorescence the rate of carbon fixation via photosynthesis and ultimately yield production is dependent on various factors including photosynthetic capacity stomatal conductance and number of stomata changes in stomatal density has been indicated as a plant adaptive reaction to regulate water use efficiency under conditions of water stress gray 2007 limin et al 2007 pirasteh anosheh et al 2016 after two weeks of mild 70 swc and severe 50 swc drought stress broad beans vicia faba l increased stomatal density between 20 and 30 in comparison to control 80 swc gan et al 2010 no changes in stomatal density of beans was detected in the current study which suggests that although the swc for membrane treatments decreased bellow the residual water content during plant growth plants were able to sustain adequate water flow through their roots in close contact to membrane surface without negatively affecting their differentiation of stomatal precursor cells and stomata formation although any water stress the plant may be experiencing in response to evaporative demand might be exacerbated by the additional resistance from the membrane to the spac water flow path this was likely to be below levels reported to result in adjustments to stomatal density leaf gas exchange was measured to investigate whether plants would show a short term response to membrane irrigation including different membrane types when exposed to diurnally changing evaporative demand stomatal conductance for instance can respond quickly within minutes to water stress and directly affect co2 uptake and transpiration arve et al 2011 urban et al 2017 under maximum evaporative demand around 12 pm 24 c 39 rh significantly higher values for a and gs were observed for the control followed by fo tfc and ro fig 5a and b this illustrates an apparent effect of the introduction of the additional resistance of the membrane to the spac water flow pathway according to urban et al 2017 stomatal conductance is one of the main adaptations to reduce water loss and balance plant water status representing the major resistance to water flow in the spac the larger reduction in stomatal conductance for the ro membrane implies a larger resistance to water flow compared to the fo tfc membrane comparing flow data for the different membranes confirms a lower ro water permeability which is in agreement with the soil hydration data fig 2b values for pure water permeability for the fo tfc and the ro membrane are 8 9 and 4 0 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 respectively which is equivalent to a permeability rate of 0 89 and 0 4 cm h for each unit of hydraulic pressure bar applied kim et al 2017 liu et al 2011 plants are naturally susceptible to water stress at mid day even when well watered if high environmental evaporative demand induces transpiration rates higher than root water uptake or when root water absorption is limited by the hydraulic conductivity of media in which they are growing dixon and johnson 1993 at periods of high evaporative demand the insertion of an additional membrane resistance in series to other resistances along the spac might further affect plant water status which was evident in gs between control and membrane treatments interestingly the ro presented an increasing conductance at 3 pm in opposition to both control and fo tfc this behaviour has been reported for plants under water stress when partial stomatal closure occurs at mid day to limit plant water loss via transpiration and improve plant rehydration allowing stomata to re open later in the afternoon until complete closure in the evening dixon and johnson 1993 reduction in gs in the membrane treatments particularly the ro suggested a limitation of water potentially resulting in stress in order to determine if the bean plants showed effects of water stress on photosynthetic capacity and damage to the photosystem we applied fluorescence measurements namely the quantum efficiency of open photosystem ii reaction centres in the light fv fm fluorescence measurements have been largely used as an indicative of plant response to biotic and abiotic factors murchie and lawson 2013 as the psii is the easiest part of the photosynthetic apparatus to be damaged by environmental stress zhou et al 2017 and results in reduced photosynthetic capacity de c bastos et al 2017 light absorption by chlorophyll molecules is competitively used either to drive photosynthesis photochemical quenching or re emitted as heat non photochemical quenching or light fluorescence murchie and lawson 2013 fv is the variable fluorescence correspondent to the total variation from a light adapted minimum fo to a maximum fluorescence fm as a response to imposed controlled light stimulus fv fm fo bermúdez cardona et al 2015 the higher the stress faced by plants the higher is the observed fo as reactions centres are closed and energy dissipated as fluorescence resulting in a reduction of fv fm for example fv fm was negatively affected in water stressed wheat cotton and soybean plants possibly related to down regulation of the psii system resulting in reduced co2 assimilation isoda 2005 lu and zhang 1998 despite reductions in a fv fm was similar among treatments suggesting that the photosystems in the bean plants were undamaged and reduction of a was mainly caused by a reduction in gs as a result of plants overall water status 4 3 stable isotope signatures and n content gas exchange measurements revealed short term limitation of assimilation and stomatal conductance in the membrane treatments but only at peak evaporative demand however ro plants opened their stomata in the afternoon to compensate stomatal closure at mid day carbon isotope signatures δ13c have the advantage of determining plant physiological performance over the long term with high δ13c reflecting high efficiency of plant water usage often as a result of stomatal closure and has shown to respond linearly to precipitation and soil water content limin et al 2007 values of δ13c in leaves varied within the expected range for c3 plants 20 to 37 o fig 6a farquhar and richards 1984 kohn 2010 the least negative δ13c value was found for the ro treatment which reflects some significant limitation on water availability for ro treatments fig 6a as an enrichment in 13c is expected for plants grown under water limited conditions resulting in stomatal closure in contrast to well watered ones ma et al 2012 this confirms the stronger stomatal limitation for the ro as determined by the gas exchange results where the ro presented a stomatal conductance and transpiration rate lower than both control and fo tfc fig 5a and b carbon δ13c of the fo tfc treatment was statistically equivalent to the control suggesting similar photosynthetic activity and stomatal conductance integrated over the entire growing period water shortage additionally affects the availability of n gonzalez dugo et al 2010 he and dijkstra 2014 moreover it is possible that low soil water content in the membrane treatments throughout the growing period may have caused an n limitation for the bean plants δ15n signatures and n of both leaves and pods were used as indicators for plant n uptake during the growth cycle n for control and membrane treatments was within the reported expected range of 3 5 and both n and δ15n were similar among all treatments which suggests that n uptake was not impaired or limited and protein content of pods was not affected by membrane irrigation in comparison to the control treatment pate 1999 4 4 plant water usage and yield the efficiency of crop water usage was calculated as total leaf dry mass ldm accumulated by plant total water usage limin et al 2007 leaf gas exchange discussed in the previous section has a direct impact on the efficiency of water usage at the leaf level directly affected by gs ming et al 2010 these principles assist in the understanding of the effect of membrane treatments on the biomass accumulation and water use efficiency the reduction of total leaf dry mass accumulation for both ro and fo tfc irrigation in comparison to the control is seen as an expected response to the water availability through membranes at a cost of additional resistance in the natural spac water pathway in order to facilitate comparison to conventional green bean yield results and demonstrate the competitiveness of results obtained from membrane irrigation experimental yield results were normalized by a factor of 2 42 corresponding to experimental 97 plants m 2 over usual 40 plants m 2 green bean planting density fao 2015 the fo tfc membrane treatment was able to produce a total yield statistically equal to the control treatment 3 8 and 4 8 ton ha 1 respectively which were both superior to ro 1 5 ton ha 1 the fo tfc yield was lower than in a previous experiment equal to 5 3 ton ha 1 probably due to a germination 12 lower which was previously equal to 75 lima et al 2017 showing that a higher productivity is possible for the fo tfc however the ro final calculated yield was equivalent to previous results equal to 1 6 ton ha 1 efficiency of plant water usage wue was evaluated by means of efficiency of crop water utilization for harvested yield table 1 no statistically significant difference in the wue was observed between treatments no statistical difference was also found between treatment linear models that correlate yield production and water usage meaning that the lower yield observed for the ro and fo in comparison to the control resulted from the lower water flow into plants observed across the membranes this opens up the opportunity for further research on improving the contact between roots and membrane surface as a way to achieve higher water fluxes in respect to water application efficiency ae conventionally defined as the ratio of evapotranspiration by the sum of all water losses including evapotranspiration deep percolation and runoff bali et al 2016 water delivered through the membrane system was directly taken up by plant in response to transpiration which confers to the system maximum ae as percolation and run off are nearly inexistent as roots are in close contact to membrane surface restricting its flow pathways in previous studies membrane treatments showed a reduction of 40 on final soil salinity in comparison to uncontrolled salt passage for membrane treatments the limited passage of salts into soil resulted in an increase of feed water salinity of 37 over 15 days lima et al 2015 as with inland desalination systems farmers need to take into account the management of brine retained inside the irrigation system however as the enrichment of salts in water for the membrane irrigation is much less than in conventional membrane filtration such as reverse osmosis sustainable reuse of brine could potentially be attained several community researches have successfully reused the concentrated water for raising tilapia fish and production of spirulina in tanks evaporation pans for mineral production and growing sunflower in pots for oil production or ornamentation sánchez et al 2015 de souza et al 2015 5 conclusions the capacity of the selective membrane based subsurface irrigation system to meet the water demand of a common bean cultivar during a complete growth cycle has been demonstrated it was observed that the use of the fo tfc membrane was able to produce equivalent bean yield per plant in comparison to the control 0 015 and 0 017 kg plant 1 respectively these results show competitiveness for the membrane irrigation technology when the appropriate membrane is used the results illustrated that the germination phase is more affected by membrane irrigation than the vegetative growth phase where the fo tfc membrane presented a germination percentage nearly 10 lower than the control due to lower initial soil hydration an increase of water flow rate or longer soil hydration prior to germination could possibly be considered to improve germination success analysis of leaf gas exchange revealed that both ro and fo tfc imposed some limitation to carbon assimilation and stomatal conductance in comparison to the control at time of peak evaporative demand this result was expected to some degree as the membrane resistance is added in series to other resistances present in the spac water pathway however most importantly analysis of c and n isotope composition and nitrogen content of leaves and pods revealed that they were unaffected by the fo tfc membrane irrigation in comparison to the control this demonstrates that despite potential short term water limitation at peak evaporative demand crop c assimilation and n uptake throughout the growing cycle was unchanged for this membrane in conclusion this study indicates that the membrane based irrigation system is a possible solution to improve irrigation water management by maximizing the water use efficiency without compromising yield production and

10934,subsurface membrane irrigation systems controlled by changes in the water potential in the soil plant atmosphere continuum were used to cultivate phaseolus vulgaris over a full growth cycle 64 days membrane irrigation systems used a thin polyamide film supported on either a woven hydrophilic support fo tfc treatment or a non woven hydrophobic support ro treatment water use efficiency was assessed using leaf biomass per unit irrigation water and compared to conventionally irrigated plants control additionally gas exchange and fluorescence parameters as well as stable isotopes were used to assess the plants physiological status soil water content over the growth cycle was maintained at 0 7 cm3 cm 3 under control conditions and declined from 0 6 to 0 12 cm3 cm 3 during plant growth below residual moisture content under both fo tfc and ro membrane irrigation notwithstanding this the total leaf dry matter was statistically equivalent for control plants 38 4 g and fo tfc treated plants 29 6 g and approximately 68 lower for ro treated plants the internal over external carbon concentration ci ca in the leaves and efficiency of open photosystem ii reaction centres in the light fv fm were statistically equivalent in membrane treatments and control plants similarly carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n isotope composition as well as n of green bean pods and leaves were statistically equivalent for plants grown on fo tfc and control indicating no effect on beans protein content total bean production per parcel and plant water use efficiency wue for conventional irrigation 0 24 kg at 10 2 kg m 3 wue was statistically equivalent to plants grown on fo tfc treatment 0 19 kg at 12 8 kg m 3 wue although the wue for ro treatment 11 4 kg m 3 was statistically equivalent to control the total bean production per parcel was significantly lower 0 07 kg results indicate that subsurface membrane irrigation may be a solution for improved water management without compromising yield production and quality keywords membrane technology water management phaseolus vulgaris gas exchange stable isotopes 1 introduction the expansion of irrigated agriculture is attended by an increase in land exploitation and fresh water withdrawals chen et al 2018 in general maximisation of irrigation water use efficiency will be contingent upon developing efficient water delivery systems and optimizing irrigation scheduling khan et al 2012 rockström et al 2014 zahraei et al 2017 in terms of water use drip irrigation has been promoted as the most efficient irrigation system it can achieve a water use efficiency 70 higher than flood irrigation it can accommodate cultivation of 90 more crops varieties in comparison to rain fed irrigation shamshery et al 2017 and finally it has superior performance for saline water usage in comparison to sprinkler irrigation due to continuous root zone wetting that minimizes osmotic and matric stress ayars et al 2015 uniformity along the drip lines is provided by ensuring each emitter comprising narrow apertures or as long narrow bore labyrinths zhang et al 2013 has a common resistance to water flow much greater than the resistance to flow throughout the distribution system nakayama and bucks 1981 however drip irrigation has not always performed to its full potential due to design installation operation and maintenance issues as described by lamm and camp 2007 irrigation uniformity is subjected to individual or coupled effects from poor manufacturing uniformity of emitters inadequate spatial distribution of emitters and marginal water quality that causes emitters to clog which requires careful filtration it is also important to select adequate emitter flow rate that matches the soil hydraulic conductivity which can be highly variable otherwise emitters lose the ability to control flow and this is dependent on soil properties lazarovitch et al 2006 all large scale irrigation systems are supply driven and therefore require the prediction of plant water demand and external management of irrigation scheduling irrigation schedule can be based on estimated atmospheric demand allen et al 1998 changes in available soil water content swc or direct plant signals such as stem diameter variation fernández and cuevas 2010 nadler 2004 zhang et al 2006 leaf turgor pressure martínez gimeno et al 2017 and leaf temperature monitored by infrared thermometry chen 2015 all such methods encounter sampling problems so that the estimates have a varying level of uncertainty the combination of that uncertainty with the heterogeneity of application noted above means that managing irrigation scheduling to supply just the required amount of water as efficiency would dictate is likely to result in an uneven and low yielding crop hence over irrigation appears to offer a risk reduction solution armstrong et al 2001 although at a significant cost to water use efficiency excessive water use contributes to additional pumping costs water lost to the environment as run off or deep percolation possibly contributing to environmental degradation such as salinization on the other hand inadequate watering will cause yield reductions because either the field as a whole has been undersupplied or because heterogeneity in the system leads to non uniform water application with parts of the field over or under irrigated a demand driven irrigation system might in theory overcome a number of these limitations we define demand driven as a system in which water flow to the plant is driven and controlled by the demand for water at the surface of the plant root water would have to be conveyed to the plant roots in a permeable structure that would not release water unless some driving mechanism such as a water potential gradient drew water from the structure the lowered water potential at the root surface is a way of naturally imposing a suitable water potential gradient relative to a high potential feed water so long as each plant in the field has adequate access to the structure s surface behind which water is constantly available heterogeneity of water application due to non uniformity in the manufacture or operation of the irrigation system is theoretically eliminated soil in contact with this porous surface will be wet only by infiltration under tension this will limit the extent of such infiltration and eliminate saturated flow particularly gravity assisted saturated flow berry et al 1992 quiñones bolaños et al 2005 there have been previous efforts to develop such water potential driven irrigation systems the use of forward osmosis fo membranes in water treatment specifically for agriculture has focused on the application of fertilizers as the draw solution fdfo phuntsho et al 2011 2012 the fdfo concept is based on the dilution of a fertilizer solution due to its higher osmotic potential than the feed water which would have as a final product a fertigation solution ready to be used on irrigation however major challenges yet to be overcome have prevented the system from being fully implemented such as fertilizer selection and draw solution concentration which are directly related to membrane fouling and productivity decline phuntsho et al 2014 the fdfo system has been tested for the fertigation of tomato however the final produced water presented salts in concentrations higher than the plant requirements requiring dilution with water of higher quality majeed et al 2014 additionally water supply is disconnected from the direct signalling of plant demand through their root system another claimed precision irrigation system is based on pervaporation a membrane separation process in response to a vapour pressure gradient lower on the permeate side conventionally generated by a vacuum pump or gas carrier or by difference in temperature when the feed water is at higher temperature than the permeate side brant 2014 a membrane based pervaporation system that allows reuse of wastewater generated during gas and oil production for irrigation was investigated by quiñones bolaños et al 2005 when a non porous hydrophilic structure was placed in direct contact with soil and the water transported and evaporated on the soil side expected to provide adequate soil moisture to plants results have shown that water delivery flux was mostly affected by feed pressure followed by soil water content as irrigation water was delivered most efficiently when the surrounding soil was dry enough to draw moisture from the tubing the system presents limited control on permeate condensation from the vapour phase which directly affects supply uniformity in addition to that there is a lack of information in the literature with respect to how plants interact with soil moisture in the vapour phase todman et al 2013 thus a system of continuous transport of water in the liquid phase is ideal another membrane based irrigation system has been registered by nasa as part of a project to produce food under microgravity conditions on spacecraft which includes a series of designs of porous tube based irrigation that relies on plant root water extraction dreschel et al 1994 the designs include the porous tube plant nutrient delivery system ptpnds a hydrophilic microporous material the astroculture comprised of metal membrane tubing and the plant generic bioprocessing apparatus nutrient delivery system pgba nds consisting of flat membranes used to water separate growth bag units the majority of available literature reports on the ptpnds this system consists of a ceramic microporous tube also tested for different materials and pore sizes jones and or 1998 hydrated by capillary action to control delivery of water and dissolved nutrients directly to plant root system grown aeroponically attached to the tubing dreschel et al 2003 1994 1992 scovazzo et al 2001 experiments have confirmed the hydrotropism behaviour of pea roots moving toward and around the tubing water source takahashi et al 1992 the ptpnds gives great insight on precise plant demand driven irrigation nevertheless these technologies even if effective are unlikely to become practical at field level for which irrigation products need to be produced from a minimum number of components for economically attractive manufacture and be flexible but robust to allow transport handling and installation on a kilometric scale without damage thus a technology which offers an alternative tubing material that permits selective filtration is desired to allow large scale field cultivation we propose an irrigation method which uses a selectively permeable membrane fashioned as a porous tube structure and relies on the low root water potential to draw water across the membrane from the feedstock preliminary results show that the roots of plants under these conditions develop intimate contact with polymeric membranes and are able to complete a growth cycle when exclusively irrigated by the membrane irrigation lima et al 2017 2016a b c 2015 this reduces the role of the soil as a water transport medium so the associated effects of soil hydraulic heterogeneity are suppressed also the mechanism of water movement through the membrane is quite different from the convective flow regime of drip emitters so that there are no orifices to block rather than points of water emission the entire surface of the porous structure is available for water transport to plants this paper provides a demonstration of irrigation via a selectively permeable membrane over a common bean complete growth cycle using a range of physiological and agronomic measures including gas exchange stable isotope composition and plant water use efficiency for harvested yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of selective membrane subsurface irrigation pressure driven membrane filtration processes such as reverse osmosis ro are based on the principle that water molecules selectively migrate across a semi permeable membrane when hydraulic pressure higher than the osmotic pressure of the untreated water is applied ro membranes are assumed to be non porous or to have pores of such small possibly molecular size that they are effectively non porous water migration occurs by solution in the milieu of the selective layer and diffusion through it described as the solution diffusion model zaidi et al 2015 in fo filtration a similar transport mechanism operates but the driving force is provided by the difference in water potential typically osmotic potential of the feed and permeate solutions on each side of the membrane mulder 2000 razmjou et al 2013 plants make a hydraulic connection between the water source soil water and the atmosphere which forms the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac slatyer 1967 a water potential gradient that develops along the spac is responsible for driving the water movement from positions of higher water potential to positions of lower water potential creating a preferential water movement direction from source to atmosphere passioura 1982 slatyer 1967 taiz and zeiger 2002 critically transpiration leads to a lowered water potential in the roots that normally would provide the driving force for water movement from the soil to the roots the proposed selective membrane subsurface irrigation system uses this natural low root water potential of plants to draw water across a semi permeable membrane from feed water circulating in the irrigation tube theoretically plants would draw water across the membrane to meet their water requirements in both quantity and time meaning that water transport across membranes is continuously responsive to the water loss via evapotranspiration in addition theory predicts that the membrane may be able to provide a measure of separation of water supplied to the plants from salts e g nacl present in the feedstock allowing safe field irrigation with low quality water as salts are prevented from accessing plant roots and soil 2 2 membrane irrigation setup in each treatment a bilaterally symmetric perspex component supported a membrane on each face and provided uniform distribution of feedstock water across the inner surface selective layer of the membrane the membrane was clamped to this component with a double o ring seal to prevent soil water leaks and root intrusion each face exposed 196 cm2 of membrane to direct contact with soil and roots each perspex irrigation unit was installed inside a planter pot w 750 h 230 l 270 and connected to a dedicated pump iwaki md 30rz 220 motor 1 16 hp and water reservoir for a closed loop cross flow water movement from which plants were able to draw water fig 1 local potable water 0 3 ds m was commonly used for all treatment membrane irrigation systems were periodically inspected for any leaks adequate water tank level and flow rate which was set to 1 l min 1 by regulating the flow control valve aperture to the point where 1 l min 1 was reading on the individual rotameters installed after the valves fig 1 water flow was maintained continuously during the experiment duration resulting in a total estimated energy consumption of 79 4 kw h per pump 2 3 plant growth conditions common bean phaseolus vulgaris l was cultivated in the glasshouse for 64 days from sowing to harvest on surface hand watering control and membrane based subsurface irrigation using a previously tested standard soil potting mix prepared from coco peat river sand organic mix and a mix of fertilizers having a water content of 0 5 cm3 cm 3 lima et al 2017 control swc was initially brought to field capacity by saturation followed by 24 h drainage prior to sowing followed by periodic hand watering to replenish the soil water content back to field capacity by allowing some drainage to occur soil water subtraction by evapotranspiration was determined using the water balance method from the difference between input from irrigation water and output from drainage a previous experiment determined that bean plants used in average 0 1 0 3 l day 1 it was determined during a previous experiment that bean plants used in average 0 1 0 3 l day 1 under similar conditions lima et al 2017 which was used to initially guide the control watering regime later increased to 0 5 l day 1 during vegetative growth phase to maintain some drainage as an indication of soil water replenishment to field capacity the membrane based irrigation commenced 7 days prior to sowing to allow soil to hydrate before placing the membrane systems in the soil they were individually tested for leaks presence of leaks was also checked throughout the experiment from the planter pot drain pipe a total of nine experimental units were used to test two types of semi permeable membrane fo tfc fo8040 from csm toray korea and ro bw30 from dow usa and the hand watered control treatment with three replicates of each 2 4 soil and plant measurements swc was monitored throughout the experiment using a portable thetaprobe device delta t devices ltd england the relationship between the swc and matric potential was determined according to the filter paper method de almeida et al 2015 and fitted to the van genuchten model using the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 accuracy of thetaprobe readings given as volumetric water content was verified against gravimetric swc of known soil volumes resulting in a regression curve used to adjust daily measurements r2 0 94 temperature relative humidity incident solar radiation data were logged hourly air vapour pressure deficit δe was calculated according to fao 56 allen et al 1998 daily water movement across the membranes was regularly logged on a 10 min interval using odyssey capacitance water level loggers dataflow systems ltd nz calibrated to show the water level in each reservoir total water usage for control plants was monitored and adjusted based on a water balance method lamm et al 2007 comparison between control and membrane irrigation provided a reference on biomass accumulation and yield of plants accessing water available in the soil in comparison to plants that needed to overcome membrane resistance to access water plant response to irrigation treatments was evaluated by measuring germination plant height measured to the tip of the main stem and fresh and dry mass of leaves stem and pods at harvest additionally analysis of nitrogen δ15n and carbon δ13c isotopic composition of leaves and pods was measured using a delta v isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled to confloiv and flashht peripherals thermo fisher scientific bremen germany measurements of carbon assimilation rate a stomatal conductance gs the ratio of internal to external concentration of carbon in leaves ci ca and quantum efficiency of open photosystem ii reaction centres as a measure of water stress on the photosystem fv fm were taken on fully expanded leaves 41 days after sowing using a li 6400 xt photosynthesis system li cor usa photosynthetically active radiation inside the chamber was kept constant throughout measurements at 1007 6 4 1 μmol m 2 s 1 and air temperature within the leaf chamber remained at 26 2 c three successive measurements were taken throughout the afternoon starting at 12 pm 3 pm and 5 pm with three replicates each leaf stomatal density was measured by counting number of stomata on scanning electron microscopy sem images divided by the leaf area determined using the software image j zhao et al 2015 2 5 statistical analysis one way anova was used to identify significant differences between treatments means of seed germination indices and plant growth variables were separated and compared by the tukey test at a probability of 5 using the sisvar software ferreira 2011 3 results 3 1 soil hydration and germination success swc differed between treatments at the beginning of the experiment but membrane treatments became similar at harvest fig 2 a for the initial swc the control treatment averaged in 0 74 cm3 cm 3 fig 2b statistically equal to fo tfc 0 62 cm3 cm 3 and superior to ro 0 53 cm3 cm 3 fig 2b with respect to membrane treatments fo tfc swc at day 7 was statistically equal to ro fig 2b no significant difference was observed between treatments for germination success with results equal to 73 62 and 58 for control fo tfc and ro treatment respectively table 1 however lower performance of ro wetting was revealed in a significant increase in emergence time 9 3 days in comparison to both control 8 days and fo tfc 7 6 days which were statistically equivalent to each other table 1 after 19 days of membrane irrigation corresponding to 12 days after sowing and when seedling emergence had ceased swc for membrane treatments started to decline continuously fig 2a this demonstrates that soil water moisture is utilized by seedlings during the establishment phase before roots develop directly on membrane surface which created a thick barrier between membrane and soil and is understood to limit soil hydration the swc for membrane treatments reached an average of 0 12 cm3 cm 3 at the end of 63 days after sowing fig 2c which according to the soil water retention characteristic curve fitting using the van genutchen model using the retc software falls below the soil residual water content 0 22 cm3 cm 3 3 2 plant growth seedling height over the duration of the experiment duration increased until day 50 after sowing after which stem elongation plateaued and statistical equality was found among treatments fig 3 a linear regression was used to determine stem elongation rate for the first 15 days corresponding to seedling establishment and for the period from 20 to 50 days after sowing during the seedling establishment phase 15 days the fo tfc stem elongation rate was observed to be 0 57 cm d 1 statistically equal to the ro 0 42 cm day 1 but higher than the control 0 24 cm day 1 table 1 as a result the fo tfc reached an average height of 8 1 cm statistically different to both ro 5 1 cm and control 3 7 cm by 37 and 54 respectively after establishment a similar trend for stem elongation was observed with the fo tfc 1 15 cm day 1 remaining higher than both control 0 94 cm day 1 and ro 0 6 cm day 1 table 1 although plant height was similar between the control and ro plants were more vigorous in the control compared to ro fig 3b considering the total ro leaf biomass accumulation 12 1 g was significantly lower than the control 38 4 g table 1 3 3 stomatal density since stomatal numbers can affect the rate of co2 uptake and water loss sem images were used to investigate whether the membrane irrigation had any effect on leaf abaxial stomatal density lower leaf surface fig 4 no statistically significant effect of membrane type on leaf stomatal density was observed between treatments with an average equal to 184 pores mm 2 for both control and fo tfc and 175 pores mm 2 for ro table 1 3 4 leaf gas exchange and fluorescence a statistically significant difference between treatments was observed for carbon assimilation a and stomatal conductance gs at peak water demand 12 pm with the control presenting the highest values followed by fo tfc and ro fig 5 a and b control a and gs for the 12 pm interval were equal to 16 2 μmol m 2 s 1 and 0 16 mol m 2 s 1 respectively control a was higher than both fo tfc and ro by a factor of 1 2 and 2 5 while control gs was superior to fo tfc and ro by a factor of 1 5 and 3 2 respectively membrane treatments and control showed the same trend for e as for a and gs however were statistically equivalent due to large variation of e between plants fig 5c leaf internal over external carbon concentration ci ca fig 5d and quantum efficiency of open photosystem ii psii reaction centres in the light fv fm fig 5e showed no effect of irrigation treatment in addition to the short term gas exchange measurements stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of leaves and pods δ13c and δ15n as well as n content n were measured as an integrative measure of physiological performance of the beans in the different treatments fig 6 δ13c in leaves was significantly different between control and ro treatment with the fo tfc being statistically equivalent to both control and membrane fig 6a control leaves were characterised as the most negative 28 3 followed by the fo tfc 27 9 and ro membrane 26 4 no significant differences were observed between control and membrane treatments for δ13c in pods fig 6a δ15n in pods and leaves fig 6b and for percentage of nitrogen in pods and leaves fig 6c 3 5 plant material analysis a summary of plant growth parameters and water usage is shown on table 1 total leaf dry mass ldm total bean production and total water consumption responded significantly to irrigation treatments average ldm for control fo tfc and ro were equal to 38 4 29 6 and 12 1 g respectively with the ro being significantly lower than the control however when total ldm was normalized by the number of germinated plants there was no significant difference for ldm per plant between treatments with results for control fo tfc and ro equal to 2 7 2 4 and 1 1 g plant 1 respectively pod production per plant was accessed by dividing the total fresh weight of pods by the number of germinated plants with no significant difference found between control 0 017 kg plant 1 and fo tfc 0 015 kg plant 1 however control was significantly higher than ro 0 006 kg plant 1 table 1 a significant difference was also observed on total bean production per treatment table 1 with results from control and fo tfc equal to 0 24 and 0 19 kg respectively which were significantly higher than ro 0 07 kg by a factor of 3 and 2 5 efficiency of water usage wue was evaluated as total pod production divided by the volume of water used by plants over their entire life cycle irmak et al 2011 results for wue did not present statistically significant differences between treatments table 1 4 discussion 4 1 soil water content prior to germination swc for the first 7 days was considered a balance between infiltration from the membranes and evaporation from the bare soil surface on day 7 swc for ro was significantly lower than for fo tfc this suggests superior infiltration across the fo tfc membrane for similar conditions of environmental evaporative demand initial control swc was found higher than both fo tfc and ro by 19 and 40 respectively this is most likely due to the slower infiltration under tension from membranes in comparison to control initially set at field capacity possible practical solutions to improve initial soil hydration when using the membrane irrigation are allowing longer wetting periods or further studies on membrane design to increase the water flow rate despite of no effect of initial swc being observed on final germination percentage table 1 a positive correlation was observed between swc at sowing and the percentage of seeds that germinated on day 7 after sowing r2 of 0 74 a positive correlation was also found between total leaf dry mass accumulation and total pod production r2 of 0 92 demonstrating the importance of adequate swc for germination which improves total leaf mass and final yield white et al 1994 the lower soil moisture content at sowing time for the ro fig 2b was reflected in longer germination time in comparison to fo tfc and control swc during the germination phase has been reported to affect both germination rate and time as water transport to germinate seeds is affected evans and etherington 1990 marginal soil water contents 1 4 1 4 mpa have been observed to slightly delay the time wheat germination by a maximum of 2 days until onset of favourable conditions when compared to optimal moisture conditions 0 5 1 14 mpa in contrast soil conditions considered dry delayed germination by 10 days wuest and lutcher 2013 considering that adequate soil moisture content for germination is important as germination percentage can result in a reduction of final leaf area and yield table 1 it is crucial to select a membrane that is capable of initiating and maintaining adequate soil moisture content during the germination phase after 19 days of membrane irrigation correspondent to 12 days after sowing swc for membrane treatments started to decline continuously fig 2a coincidently seedling emergence was no longer observed to increase past day 13 after sowing intense development of roots directly on the membrane surface which creates a thick barrier between membrane and soil is believed to have limited soil hydration in a previous experiment where seedlings were grown for 15 days after sowing roots were observed to completely cover the membrane area of 113 cm2 exposed to them resulting in a final gravimetric soil water content as low as 4 lima et al 2015 after 64 days of membrane irrigation roots showed a dense development directly on the membrane surface which considerably limited the contact between soil and membrane surface a similar root matting development has been reported around a microporous ceramic irrigation tube surface area berry et al 1992 the soil as an isolated system from the water source would have limited hydration and constant water loss would occur through evaporation as a result final swc for membrane treatments fig 2c were found to be below the soil permanent wilting point and the soil residual water content as determined through the soil water retention characteristic curve the zone of residual saturation is described as when the remaining water present in the soil is held within soil pores only by adsorptive forces and no longer by capillary forces sillers et al 2001 soil water movement at that point is present mainly as vapour and film flow strongly adhered to soil particles surface with a removal energy demand reaching values of 1000 mpa vanapalli et al 1998 most plants are only able to take up water at or above the permanent wilting point of around 1 5 mpa shaxson and barber 2003 thus sustainable plant growth at those soil conditions would be unviable unless plants had access to water from sources other than the soil water in the present study maintenance of bean plant vitality even at very low soil water content was attributed to the development of their root system directly on the membrane surface as a successful strategy to absorb water in contrast soil from control treatments which received favourable irrigation remained at relatively constant soil water content 4 2 stomatal density gas exchange and fluorescence the rate of carbon fixation via photosynthesis and ultimately yield production is dependent on various factors including photosynthetic capacity stomatal conductance and number of stomata changes in stomatal density has been indicated as a plant adaptive reaction to regulate water use efficiency under conditions of water stress gray 2007 limin et al 2007 pirasteh anosheh et al 2016 after two weeks of mild 70 swc and severe 50 swc drought stress broad beans vicia faba l increased stomatal density between 20 and 30 in comparison to control 80 swc gan et al 2010 no changes in stomatal density of beans was detected in the current study which suggests that although the swc for membrane treatments decreased bellow the residual water content during plant growth plants were able to sustain adequate water flow through their roots in close contact to membrane surface without negatively affecting their differentiation of stomatal precursor cells and stomata formation although any water stress the plant may be experiencing in response to evaporative demand might be exacerbated by the additional resistance from the membrane to the spac water flow path this was likely to be below levels reported to result in adjustments to stomatal density leaf gas exchange was measured to investigate whether plants would show a short term response to membrane irrigation including different membrane types when exposed to diurnally changing evaporative demand stomatal conductance for instance can respond quickly within minutes to water stress and directly affect co2 uptake and transpiration arve et al 2011 urban et al 2017 under maximum evaporative demand around 12 pm 24 c 39 rh significantly higher values for a and gs were observed for the control followed by fo tfc and ro fig 5a and b this illustrates an apparent effect of the introduction of the additional resistance of the membrane to the spac water flow pathway according to urban et al 2017 stomatal conductance is one of the main adaptations to reduce water loss and balance plant water status representing the major resistance to water flow in the spac the larger reduction in stomatal conductance for the ro membrane implies a larger resistance to water flow compared to the fo tfc membrane comparing flow data for the different membranes confirms a lower ro water permeability which is in agreement with the soil hydration data fig 2b values for pure water permeability for the fo tfc and the ro membrane are 8 9 and 4 0 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 respectively which is equivalent to a permeability rate of 0 89 and 0 4 cm h for each unit of hydraulic pressure bar applied kim et al 2017 liu et al 2011 plants are naturally susceptible to water stress at mid day even when well watered if high environmental evaporative demand induces transpiration rates higher than root water uptake or when root water absorption is limited by the hydraulic conductivity of media in which they are growing dixon and johnson 1993 at periods of high evaporative demand the insertion of an additional membrane resistance in series to other resistances along the spac might further affect plant water status which was evident in gs between control and membrane treatments interestingly the ro presented an increasing conductance at 3 pm in opposition to both control and fo tfc this behaviour has been reported for plants under water stress when partial stomatal closure occurs at mid day to limit plant water loss via transpiration and improve plant rehydration allowing stomata to re open later in the afternoon until complete closure in the evening dixon and johnson 1993 reduction in gs in the membrane treatments particularly the ro suggested a limitation of water potentially resulting in stress in order to determine if the bean plants showed effects of water stress on photosynthetic capacity and damage to the photosystem we applied fluorescence measurements namely the quantum efficiency of open photosystem ii reaction centres in the light fv fm fluorescence measurements have been largely used as an indicative of plant response to biotic and abiotic factors murchie and lawson 2013 as the psii is the easiest part of the photosynthetic apparatus to be damaged by environmental stress zhou et al 2017 and results in reduced photosynthetic capacity de c bastos et al 2017 light absorption by chlorophyll molecules is competitively used either to drive photosynthesis photochemical quenching or re emitted as heat non photochemical quenching or light fluorescence murchie and lawson 2013 fv is the variable fluorescence correspondent to the total variation from a light adapted minimum fo to a maximum fluorescence fm as a response to imposed controlled light stimulus fv fm fo bermúdez cardona et al 2015 the higher the stress faced by plants the higher is the observed fo as reactions centres are closed and energy dissipated as fluorescence resulting in a reduction of fv fm for example fv fm was negatively affected in water stressed wheat cotton and soybean plants possibly related to down regulation of the psii system resulting in reduced co2 assimilation isoda 2005 lu and zhang 1998 despite reductions in a fv fm was similar among treatments suggesting that the photosystems in the bean plants were undamaged and reduction of a was mainly caused by a reduction in gs as a result of plants overall water status 4 3 stable isotope signatures and n content gas exchange measurements revealed short term limitation of assimilation and stomatal conductance in the membrane treatments but only at peak evaporative demand however ro plants opened their stomata in the afternoon to compensate stomatal closure at mid day carbon isotope signatures δ13c have the advantage of determining plant physiological performance over the long term with high δ13c reflecting high efficiency of plant water usage often as a result of stomatal closure and has shown to respond linearly to precipitation and soil water content limin et al 2007 values of δ13c in leaves varied within the expected range for c3 plants 20 to 37 o fig 6a farquhar and richards 1984 kohn 2010 the least negative δ13c value was found for the ro treatment which reflects some significant limitation on water availability for ro treatments fig 6a as an enrichment in 13c is expected for plants grown under water limited conditions resulting in stomatal closure in contrast to well watered ones ma et al 2012 this confirms the stronger stomatal limitation for the ro as determined by the gas exchange results where the ro presented a stomatal conductance and transpiration rate lower than both control and fo tfc fig 5a and b carbon δ13c of the fo tfc treatment was statistically equivalent to the control suggesting similar photosynthetic activity and stomatal conductance integrated over the entire growing period water shortage additionally affects the availability of n gonzalez dugo et al 2010 he and dijkstra 2014 moreover it is possible that low soil water content in the membrane treatments throughout the growing period may have caused an n limitation for the bean plants δ15n signatures and n of both leaves and pods were used as indicators for plant n uptake during the growth cycle n for control and membrane treatments was within the reported expected range of 3 5 and both n and δ15n were similar among all treatments which suggests that n uptake was not impaired or limited and protein content of pods was not affected by membrane irrigation in comparison to the control treatment pate 1999 4 4 plant water usage and yield the efficiency of crop water usage was calculated as total leaf dry mass ldm accumulated by plant total water usage limin et al 2007 leaf gas exchange discussed in the previous section has a direct impact on the efficiency of water usage at the leaf level directly affected by gs ming et al 2010 these principles assist in the understanding of the effect of membrane treatments on the biomass accumulation and water use efficiency the reduction of total leaf dry mass accumulation for both ro and fo tfc irrigation in comparison to the control is seen as an expected response to the water availability through membranes at a cost of additional resistance in the natural spac water pathway in order to facilitate comparison to conventional green bean yield results and demonstrate the competitiveness of results obtained from membrane irrigation experimental yield results were normalized by a factor of 2 42 corresponding to experimental 97 plants m 2 over usual 40 plants m 2 green bean planting density fao 2015 the fo tfc membrane treatment was able to produce a total yield statistically equal to the control treatment 3 8 and 4 8 ton ha 1 respectively which were both superior to ro 1 5 ton ha 1 the fo tfc yield was lower than in a previous experiment equal to 5 3 ton ha 1 probably due to a germination 12 lower which was previously equal to 75 lima et al 2017 showing that a higher productivity is possible for the fo tfc however the ro final calculated yield was equivalent to previous results equal to 1 6 ton ha 1 efficiency of plant water usage wue was evaluated by means of efficiency of crop water utilization for harvested yield table 1 no statistically significant difference in the wue was observed between treatments no statistical difference was also found between treatment linear models that correlate yield production and water usage meaning that the lower yield observed for the ro and fo in comparison to the control resulted from the lower water flow into plants observed across the membranes this opens up the opportunity for further research on improving the contact between roots and membrane surface as a way to achieve higher water fluxes in respect to water application efficiency ae conventionally defined as the ratio of evapotranspiration by the sum of all water losses including evapotranspiration deep percolation and runoff bali et al 2016 water delivered through the membrane system was directly taken up by plant in response to transpiration which confers to the system maximum ae as percolation and run off are nearly inexistent as roots are in close contact to membrane surface restricting its flow pathways in previous studies membrane treatments showed a reduction of 40 on final soil salinity in comparison to uncontrolled salt passage for membrane treatments the limited passage of salts into soil resulted in an increase of feed water salinity of 37 over 15 days lima et al 2015 as with inland desalination systems farmers need to take into account the management of brine retained inside the irrigation system however as the enrichment of salts in water for the membrane irrigation is much less than in conventional membrane filtration such as reverse osmosis sustainable reuse of brine could potentially be attained several community researches have successfully reused the concentrated water for raising tilapia fish and production of spirulina in tanks evaporation pans for mineral production and growing sunflower in pots for oil production or ornamentation sánchez et al 2015 de souza et al 2015 5 conclusions the capacity of the selective membrane based subsurface irrigation system to meet the water demand of a common bean cultivar during a complete growth cycle has been demonstrated it was observed that the use of the fo tfc membrane was able to produce equivalent bean yield per plant in comparison to the control 0 015 and 0 017 kg plant 1 respectively these results show competitiveness for the membrane irrigation technology when the appropriate membrane is used the results illustrated that the germination phase is more affected by membrane irrigation than the vegetative growth phase where the fo tfc membrane presented a germination percentage nearly 10 lower than the control due to lower initial soil hydration an increase of water flow rate or longer soil hydration prior to germination could possibly be considered to improve germination success analysis of leaf gas exchange revealed that both ro and fo tfc imposed some limitation to carbon assimilation and stomatal conductance in comparison to the control at time of peak evaporative demand this result was expected to some degree as the membrane resistance is added in series to other resistances present in the spac water pathway however most importantly analysis of c and n isotope composition and nitrogen content of leaves and pods revealed that they were unaffected by the fo tfc membrane irrigation in comparison to the control this demonstrates that despite potential short term water limitation at peak evaporative demand crop c assimilation and n uptake throughout the growing cycle was unchanged for this membrane in conclusion this study indicates that the membrane based irrigation system is a possible solution to improve irrigation water management by maximizing the water use efficiency without compromising yield production and
