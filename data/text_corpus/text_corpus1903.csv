pressure state response psr model to evaluate the water energy food wef system security and clarify the main factors affecting wef development system state and social response in addition the interval type 2 fuzzy sets and analytic hierarchy process are incorporated to address uncertainty in the importance weights of quantitative indicators scenario design technique for order preference by

security in the nine provinces of the yellow river basin from 2006 to 2019 results show that the wef system security in each province has been improved in 2006 2019 under different scenarios in detail the pressure of wef system is decreasing in gansu ningxia and shanxi province which is due to the decrease in waste water emissions per person and energy consumption per unit of gdp the state of wef system in various provinces has also been improved year by year the response of wef system is increasing in all provinces except shanxi there is obvious spatial temporal heterogeneity in different provinces but the regional gaps are narrowing these findings cannot only reflect the multi element relationship from both human activities and environmental changes but also deal with uncertain in wef assessment system the obtained results can provide scientific basis for decision makers to formulate relevant policies and measures keywords water energy food system interval type 2 fuzzy sets pressure state response model multi criteria decision making yellow river basin 1 introduction 1 1 importance with population growth and socio economic development the demands for water energy and food are increasing which are challenging resource security and sustainability all over the world according to reports by international energy agency 2017 the global energy demands would increase by 30 based on current needs by 2040 whilst the launch of launch of launch of united nations world water development report 2019 predicted more than five billion people would face water shortage by 2050 moreover global report on food crises 2021 showed that 155 million people around the world were in food crisis in 2020 in future the covid 19 pandemic is likely to cause more children to become emaciated tsfsnw 2020 these issues make the water energy food wef system into a dilemma and challenge its security and robustness in addition water energy and food are interdependent in which problems in one field may damage the fragile balance among these three components and cause serious issues in other fields heard et al 2017 therefore evaluating the security of wef system is desired for promoting high quality socioeconomic development as well as the coordinated development of water energy and food 1 2 literature review numerous studies have worked on characterizing the relationships among wef system through various methods for example kajenthira et al 2015 adopted the virtual water theory to evaluate food production situation in the water scarce countries within the context of internationalization vandone et al 2018 used market multi factor models to analyze the impact of agricultural and energy price trends on the price of water supply industry purwanto et al 2019 constructed a causal model for analyzing the impact of water energy and food sectors on the wef system security mahjabin et al 2020 used a network analysis approach to quantitatively estimate the virtual water contained in food and energy in the united states and evaluate their interdependence of the wef system some studies have also been conducted to reveal the interaction mechanism of wef system based on the system dynamics model sdm hussien et al 2017 sušnik et al 2021 some superiorities have been found in identifying the wef relationship through some deterministic approaches while these methods have difficulties in tackling uncertainties derived from observation errors and inaccurate subjective experiences pressure state response psr model a conceptual model reflecting the relationship between human activities and environmental changes has been increasingly adopted to evaluate the wef system it can well describe the interaction mechanism of wef system between human society and natural environment corresponding to pressure state response in three criterion layers yuan and lo 2020 however the real world wef system often involves complex uncertainties in terms of data collection index selection and weight determianation for instance water resources consumption and agricultural production may fluctuate with natural conditions and regulation policies and the weight of each index is mainly determined based on humans subjective experiences cai et al 2011 hoolohan et al 2019 therefore some uncertainty theories have been developed to handle interval random ambiguous and multi objective information in the wef system xu et al 2017 emre and rakesh 2018 ma et al 2021 yan et al 2021 zhang and li 2021 huang et al 2022 for instance xu et al 2017 incorporated fuzzy gradient chance constrained programming and two stage stochastic programming approaches to tackle the interactions between economic targets and the associated environmental penalties attributed to water allocation schemes yan et al 2020 developed a stochastic multi objective nonlinear programming model for balancing the conflicting objectives of net economic benefit and irrigation water use efficiency zhang and li 2021 incorporated interval programming and credibility constrained programming methods to deal with uncertainties in water quality management issues yan et al 2021 used a cloud based dual objective nonlinear programming model to optimize the irrigated water resources allocation under composite uncertainties among these methods random variables can be conveyed through probability distributions while a large number of samples must be obtained initially gholizadeh et al 2020 interval values can capture the boundaried of the uncertain parameters while they can hardly offset the possibility of an event zuo et al 2021 moreover these studies mainly tackle system parameters existing in the wef system which neglect the ambiguity of the importance degrees in the wef system indices generally determined by decision makers although fuzzy sets are often used in coupling system evaluation they may not be able to handle membership functions also expressed as fuzzy sets kuo and liang 2012 deveci et al 2021 in comparison the interval type 2 fuzzy sets containing positive and negative ideal solutions and relative evaluation matrices can capture uncertainty information better than traditional fuzzy sets deveci et al 2020 1 3 contribution this paper aims to evaluate the wef system security by integrating type 2 fuzzy sets and psr model into one framework the proposed type 2 fuzzy psr model takes superiorities in a addressing ambiguous importance degrees that presented as dual uncertainties and b reflecting the relationship of water energy and food from the perspectives of human activities and environmental changes technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis a method that can make full use of the original data to reflect the relative advantages and disadvantages of each evaluation object has been widely used in resource and environment evaluation lin et al 2021 sedghiyan et al 2021 combinative distance based asssessment codas a method that can measure the overall performances of the alternatives by the euclidean and taxicab distance from the native ideal solutions has also been considered for selecting the best option among the alternative scenarios ibrahim et al 2018 ren 2018 the topsis and codas approaches will be integrated into the type 2 fuzzy psr model to deal with the subjectivity of the data and describe the comprehensive impact of multiple impact indicators harsh and dipankar 2020 nurşah and cengiz 2021 qian and liang 2021 the developed model will be applied for evaluating the security of provincial scale wef system in the yellow river basin findings cannot only provide in depth analysis for balancing the coordinated development among water energy and food but also provide scientific basis for the ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 details the evaluation system and methods including the indicator system for wef system security by the psr model the interval type 2 fuzzy sets the topsis method and the codas method section 3 describes the application and data sources of this study section 4 analyzes the spatial temporal evolution of the subsystem in wef system and discusses the wef system security under different scenarios section 5 shows the main conclusions and future work 2 methodology 2 1 psr model water energy and food form a wef system with mutual influences and restrictions their relationships are more complex as population grow urbanization accelerates and climate change intensifies the wef system faces various pressures which change the state of resource utilization thereby motivate humans to respond and manage the wef system the psr model emphasizes the relationship between resource environmental pressures and resource environmental degradation it has superiority in revealing the changes and dynamic mechanisms of the developmental things under the combined action of multiple factors hu et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 therefore the psr model is selected to build the evaluation index of wef system security as detailed in table 1 before calculating the weight and evaluation the original value of each evaluation index is normalized there are two types of indicators positive indicators and negative indicators the positive index means that wef system security increases with the increasing index value the normalization formula of the positive index is presented as follows 1 y ij x ij x ij min x ij max x ij min the negative index normalization formula is 2 y ij x ij max x ij x ij max x ij min where x ij is the jth sample value of the ith index y ij is the normalized value of x ij x ij max and x ij min are the maximum and minimum values of the ith index respectively 2 2 interval type 2 fuzzy set type 2 fuzzy set is an extension of classical fuzzy sets to capture uncertainty in the grade of membership which can better reflect language ambiguity and give the membership function more freedom erkan and muhammet 2021 pan et al 2021 in the real world wef system parameters may be affected by a series of factors e g inaccurate statistical data and subjective experience leading to dual uncertainties in some parameters such as the importance weight consequently the interval type 2 fuzzy set is adopted to address the dual uncertainties in the weight determination the correlation expression and calculation rule of the interval type 2 fuzzy set are shown in fig 1 1 a simpler type 2 fuzzy set is characterized by two primary membership functions i e upper membership function umf and lower membership function lmf and each element of these functions is a fuzzy set in 0 1 chen and lee 2010 the umf and lmf of an interval type 2 fuzzy set are type 1 membership functions respectively then the reference points and heights of the interval type 2 fuzzy set included in umf and lmf can be used to characterize the interval type 2 fuzzy set lu et al 2021 if the umf and lmf of an interval type 2 fuzzy set are all trapezoids it is called a trapezoidal interval type 2 fuzzy set fig 1 shows a trapezoidal interval type 2 fuzzy set the formula of interval type 2 fuzzy set is expressed by eq 3 3 a i a i u a i l a i 1 u a i 2 u a i 3 u a i 4 u h 1 a i 2 u h 2 a i 3 u a i 1 l a i 2 l a i 3 l a i 4 l h 1 a i 2 l h 2

common multi attribute decision making method that determines the attribute weight based on the comparison language according to the subjective intention of decision makers du and gao 2020 in this study the interval type 2 fuzzy set is introduced to reflect the comparison language of decision makers a comparison matrix consisting of interval type 2 fuzzy sets will be formulated and the weights of indicators can be calculated by the ahp model the calculation steps are as follows 1 the evaluation problems are analyzed and a comparative language table based on interval type 2 fuzzy set is constructed as shown in table 2 2 according to the actual situation the decision maker would use comparative language variables to compare the importance of each indicator in pairs and construct a comparison matrix based on the interval type 2 fuzzy sets in table 2 the results are as follows 11 c c 11 c 12 c 1 n c 21 c 22 c 2 n c n 1 c n 2 c n n where c ij is the importance of index i compared to index j 12 c ij 1 c ji 3 in order to avoid significant errors resulting from subjective comparison it is necessary to carry out consistency test for the comparison matrix moreover a de fuzzified matrix will be generated to facilitate the consistency test with the calculation formula shown as follows 13 d t r a t a i 1 8 a i 4 u h 1 a i 2 u a i 2 u h 1 a i 3 u a i 3 u a i 1 u a i 4 l h 1 a i 2 l a i 2 l h 1 a i 3 l a i 3 l a i 1 l the test formula is as follows 14 ci λ max n 1 15 cr ci ri where λ max is the maximum eigenvalue of contrast matrix c ri is a consistency indicator and can be obtained by looking up a table cr is the consistency ratio in which the comparison matrix passes the consistency test if the cr 0 1 parvin et al 2019 4 based on the interval type 2 fuzzy set algorithm the interval type 2 fuzzy geometric average value of each index is calculated and the subjective weight of each index is obtained through normalization the calculation formula is as follows 16 r i c i 1 c i 2 c in n 17 w i r i r 1 r 2 r i where r i is the interval type 2 fuzzy geometric mean of index i w i is the interval type 2 fuzzy weight of index i 2 4 topsis method the topsis method is a classic multi attribute decision evaluation method with simple calculation and clear results which has been widely used in multi field evaluation research zyoud et al 2016 its logic is to calculate the euclidean distance between the evaluation object and the optimal scheme as well as the distance between the evaluation object and the worst scheme the closeness between the evaluation object and the optimal scheme could be adopted as the evaluation basis for the overall ranking evaluation the topsis calculation steps are described as follows 1 the standardized values of different indices are used to construct the decision matrix y 18 y y 11 y 12 y 1 j y 21 y 22 y 2 j y i 1 y i 2 y i j 2 the evaluation matrix z is generated based on the decision matrix and the weight matrix with interval type 2 fuzzy sets 19 z z 11 z 12 z 1 j z 21 z 22 z 2 j z i 1 z i 2 z i j 20 z ij w i y ij 3 rank formula is used to deblur the evaluation matrix z the positive and negative ideal solutions of each index are obtained 21 z j max rank z 1 j rank z 2 j rank z ij 22 z j min rank z 1 j rank z 2 j rank z ij 4 the euclidean distances between each evaluation object and the positive and negative ideal solutions are calculated 23 e i j 1 m rank z ij z j 2 24 e i j 1 m rank z ij z j 2 5 the relative closeness of each evaluation object are generated as follows 25 c c i e i e i e i if the relative closeness c c i is 1 then the scheme is the best 2 5 codas method the codas method takes the euclidean distance and manhattan distance of alternatives from the negative ideal as the evaluation basis then a subjective coefficient is introduced to compare the scores of the evaluation objects and finally all the scores are added to rank the alternatives keshavarz et al 2016 ibrahim et al 2018 the calculation steps are as follows 1 the manhattan distance t j of alternatives from the negative ideal solution is calculated as 26 t j j 1 m rank z ij z j 2 the pairwise evaluation schemes are compared to obtain the score values and the comparison matrix r is constructed 27 r h ik n n 28 h ik e i e k γ e i e k t i t k 29 γ x 1 x δ 0 x δ 3 the total score of each scheme are calculated 30 h i k 1 n h ik the scheme with the highest h i is the best choice among the schemes 3 application 3 1 statement of problems the yellow river basin is located in central and northern parts of china with a total drainage area of 795 000 km2 accounting for 8 3 of the national area the total length of the main stream is 5464 km which is the second longest river in china the yellow river flows through qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong provinces yuan et al 2021 the yellow river basin is an important area of agricultural economic development in china which is known as energy basin and agricultural basin feng et al 2021 however the sustainable development of the wef system in the yellow river basin is challenged due to the limitation of geographical conditions water resources unblanced energy and food distribution intensified human activities water shortage and water pollution problems 3 2 data collection the most data of the nine provinces in the yellow river basin from 2006 to 2019 are collected from water resources bulletin of each province cwrb 2020 various statistical yearbooks csy 2020 the official website of the national bureau of statistics http data stats gov cn and chinese economic and social big data research platform https data cnki net in the process of data collection some data are missing and cannot be collected linear interpolation method and correlation coefficient method are used to fill in the missing data 3 3 formulation of wef system evaluation index the purpose of this study is to use the combination of type 2 fuzzy sets and psr model to establish an evaluation index system to assess the wef system as shown in fig 2 the main contents of this research are to a establish an evaluation index system for wef system security b use type 2 fuzzy sets and analytic hierarchy process to determine the index weight c combining topsis and codas methods to analyze the wef system security in the yellow river basin besides six scenarios are considered for addressing the different decision makers preferences as detailed in table 3 the importance of each subsystem is compared and the results are described as equally important ei slightly important si and obviously important oi for example in scenario 1 i e s1 the relative importance of pressure state and response subsystem is oi si and ei indicating that decision makers consider the pressure of wef system as an important factor affecting the security of wef system 4 results analysis the sensitivity parameter δ is a subjective parameter in the codas method which is set according to the subjective intention of decision makers different δ levels represent different attitudes of decision makers and may lead to the different ranking results as shown in fig 3 the results show the ranking of pressure in wef system that the δ level increases from 0 01 to 0 08 in gansu qinghai and sichuan province in this study the δ 0 01 and 0 06 are used to analyze the wef system security in the nine provinces in the yellow river basin 4 1 evaluation of the subsystem 4 1 1 evaluation of pressure in wef system the pressure of wef system in the nine provinces from 2006 to 2019 are showed in fig 4 the low score in fig 4 indicates that the pressure of wef system is high and needs to be improved the results show that the trend of pressure rises in qinghai and sichuan province the increasing trend in qinghai province may mainly be attributed to the large waste water discharge and high energy consumption per unit gdp in sichuan province the pressure of wef system increased because the annual natural population growth rate and water consumption per capita increased the pressure of wef system reached its peak in 2017 as the natural population growth rate and waste water discharge per capita respectively reached the peak of 4 23 and 324 08 t person in 2017 in 2010 2019 the pressure of wef system in ningxia decreased since ningxia took measures to effectively control the waste water discharge per capita and energy consumption per unit gdp dswprstf 2019 in the midstream of the yellow river basin the pressure of wef system in shanxi province has fluctuated in the past few years in 2017 the energy consumption per unit gdp of shanxi province dropped from 1 682 tons to 1 277 tons ssy 2018 which alleviated the pressure of wef system in shanxi province the pressure of wef system in inner mongolia and shaanxi province showed a rising trend year by year in shaanxi province energy consumption per unit gdp and waste water discharge per capita increased steadily and reached their corresponding peak in 2019 in inner mongolia the pressure of wef system increased slightly from 2015 to 2017 which was attributed to the increase of inundated area and chemical fertilizer utilization in the downstream of the yellow river basin the pressure of wef system in henan and shandong province showed a consistent rising trend from 2006 to 2015 then an downward trend from 2015 to 2017 the pressure of wef system in the two provinces showed an obvious upward trend from 2006 to 2015 due to the increasing waste water discharge per capita in the two provinces fu et al 2020 in 2015 2017 the pressure of wef system in both provinces showed an downward trend due to the implementation of the strictest water resource management system waste water discharge per capita and water consumption per capita were controlled which improved the ecological environment in both provinces 4 1 2 evaluation of state in wef system fig 5 presents the state of wef system in the nine provinces from 2006 to 2019 in which a high score from codas or topsis would correspond to a good condition of the wef system state the state of wef system in four upstream provinces had been improved from 2006 to 2019 however in 2015 and 2016 the state of wef system in gansu province was reduced because the water resources per capita dropped sharply from 766 99 m3 to 635 03 m3 fan et al 2019 the state of wef system in qinghai province increased greatly in 2006 which was related to the significant decrease of water consumption in industrial sectors the state of wef system in sichuan province increased greatly from 2006 to 2008 due to the adjustment of industrial structure and the significant decrease of water consumption in industries the state of wef system in ningxia had been rising steadily with the substantial increase in primary energy output and power generation the state of wef system in ningxia increased greatly in 2010 2011 the reason was that the primary energy output had increased from 49 12 million tons to 58 59 million tons in 2011 and the increase in power generation had nearly doubled in the midstream of the yellow river basin the state of wef system in inner mongolia shaanxi and shanxi province all showed an increasing trend the state of wef system in shanxi province showed a downward trend from 2015 to 2016 due to the increase of industrial water consumption and the drop of total power in agricultural machinery the state of wef system in inner mongolia experienced a large increase from 2009 to 2013 mainly because of the transformation of industrial structure the industrial water consumption decreased from 52 74 m3 in 2008 to 29 77 m3 in 2013 shang et al 2019 the state of wef system in henan and shandong provinces showed a rising trend this was a result of the high agricultural mechanization degree and the increasing grain yield per unit area 4 1 3 evaluation of response in wef system the response of wef system of the nine provinces in the yellow river basin from 2006 to 2019 are shown in fig 6 the province with high scores of codas and topsis would indicate effective responding mechanism from human and society the response of wef system in the four upstream provinces showed an upward trend indicating that the local departments had achieved remarkable results in the management of the wef system the response of wef system in qinghai gansu and sichuan provinces all showed a rising trend year by year because of the large amount of water resources more attention to the utilization of water resources and large proportion of hydropower the response of wef system in ningxia increased in from 2011 to 2012 since effective measures were taken by local departments to improve the utilization of water resources it was suggested that all regions increased the recycling utilization of water resources and adopted water saving and water collecting measures to promote the sustainable utilization of water resources the response of wef system in inner mongolia shaanxi and shanxi provinces were all at the top among the nine provinces in the yellow river basin the response of wef system in inner mongolia and shaanxi provinces both showed an upward trend year by year this was because that relevant local departments had taken measures to increase investment in the energy industry and promote high quality development of the region the response of wef system in shanxi province showed a trend of increasing firstly reached the peak in 2016 and then presented an decreasing trend the declining of response in 2017 was attributed to the sharp drop in investment in the energy industry ssy 2018 the response of wef system in henan and shandong provinces showed an upward trend indicating that the departments had made contributions to improving the ecological environment and energy efficiency the response of wef system decreased in henan province from 2018 to 2019 probabily due to the increasing of water resource utilization rate from 69 04 to 141 04 the response of wef system in shandong province showed an increasing trend because the relevant measures taken by local departments the reclaimed water rate and investment in energy industry were at the top of the yellow river basin therefore increasing the utilization rate of water resources and improving the optimal allocation of energy were conducive to enhancing the response of wef system and promoting high quality development 4 2 scenario analysis of wef system security the comparison of wef system security in nine provinces based on the two evaluation methods and six scenarios are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 in scenario 1 and scenario 2 the pressure of wef system was an important factor for the wef system security in these two scenarios the wef system security in gansu and sichuan provinces was at the forefront this was because that the two provinces both located in the upstream of the yellow river basin with sufficient water energy and less pollution and the waste water discharge per capita was less than other provinces in the basin in these two scenarios it was suggested that decision makers would focus on the security of local wef system reducing waste water discharge adjusting industrial structure and relieving the pressure of regional wef system scenario 3 and 6 took the response of wef system as the most important factor and the security of wef system in shandong province and inner mongolia was in the forefront in these two scenarios the security of wef system of these two scenarios was higher than that of scenario 4 and scenario 5 therefore it was suggested that local departments improved their decision making ability and optimized the scheduling of water resources 5 conclusions in this study an evaluation index system of wef system security based on psr model in the yellow river basin was constructed the interval type 2 fuzzy sets and analytic hierarchy process were integrated to determine the weight of each index for the six different weight distribution scenarios were constructed the topsis and codas methods were used to evaluate the wef system security in the yellow river basin from 2006 to 2019 results revealed that the pollution control industrial structure and agricultural automation process become the main factors affecting the wef system security the pressure of wef system in four upstream provinces is low but the state of wef system and the response of wef system are not as good as the midstream and downstream of the basin the pressure in the downstream of the yellow river basin is greater than that in the upstream and midstream because of its geographical location and insufficient water resources therefore coordinating the relationship between water resources energy and food industries is the key direction to promote the high quality development of the region this study not only conducted a comparison of the wef system security in the nine provinces of the yellow river basin but also analyzed the comparison of wef subsystem in various regions in order to provide scientific basis for ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin although the wef evaluation index system based on psr model could reflect the interactive mechanism among water energy and food the mechanism is more complex in real world because of human effect and natural disasters in addition the evaluation framework lacks indexes that can reflect the flow of physical and embodied wef resources between regions therefore multi regional input output analysis and system dynamics model will be adopted in the selection of evaluation indexes in future studies giulia et al 2022 tian et al 2022 moreover this study only considers three types of indicators water energy and food more indicators in the evaluation system of this study need to be increased sa d et al 2018 boscow et al 2021 in the context of major strategic decisions to achieve the dual carbon goal indicators such as carbon sinks and carbon emissions can be added to subsequent studies to discuss their impact on the wef system security of the yellow river basin and improve the applicability of the research moncef and mohammad 2021 wei et al 2022 declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work was supported by the caas key

food are increasing which are challenging resource security and sustainability all over the world according to reports by international energy agency 2017 the global energy demands would increase by 30 based on current needs by 2040 whilst the launch of launch of launch of united nations world water development report 2019 predicted more than five billion people would face water shortage by 2050 moreover global report on food crises 2021 showed that 155 million people around the world were in food crisis in 2020 in future the covid 19 pandemic is likely to cause more children to become emaciated tsfsnw 2020 these issues make the water energy food wef system into a dilemma and challenge its security and robustness in addition water energy and food are interdependent in which problems in one field may damage the fragile balance among these three components and cause serious issues in other fields heard et al 2017 therefore evaluating the security of wef system is desired for promoting high quality socioeconomic development as well as the coordinated development of water energy and food 1 2 literature review numerous studies have worked on characterizing the relationships among wef system through various methods for example kajenthira et al 2015 adopted the virtual water theory to evaluate food production situation in the water scarce countries within the context of internationalization vandone et al 2018 used market multi factor models to analyze the impact of agricultural and energy price trends on the price of water supply industry purwanto et al 2019 constructed a causal model for analyzing the impact of water energy and food sectors on the wef system security mahjabin et al 2020 used a network analysis approach to quantitatively estimate the virtual water contained in food and energy in the united states and evaluate their interdependence of the wef system some studies have also been conducted to reveal the interaction mechanism of wef system based on the system dynamics model sdm hussien et al 2017 sušnik et al 2021 some superiorities have been found in identifying the wef relationship through some deterministic approaches while these methods have difficulties in tackling uncertainties derived from observation errors and inaccurate subjective experiences pressure state response psr model a conceptual model reflecting the relationship between human activities and environmental changes has been increasingly adopted to evaluate the wef system it can well describe the interaction mechanism of wef system between human society and natural environment corresponding to pressure state response in three criterion layers yuan and lo 2020 however the real world wef system often involves complex uncertainties in terms of data collection index selection and weight determianation for instance water resources consumption and agricultural production may fluctuate with natural conditions and regulation policies and the weight of each index is mainly determined based on humans subjective experiences cai et al 2011 hoolohan et al 2019 therefore some uncertainty theories have been developed to handle interval random ambiguous and multi objective information in the wef system xu et al 2017 emre and rakesh 2018 ma et al 2021 yan et al 2021 zhang and li 2021 huang et al 2022 for instance xu et al 2017 incorporated fuzzy gradient chance constrained programming and two stage stochastic programming approaches to tackle the interactions between economic targets and the associated environmental penalties attributed to water allocation schemes yan et al 2020 developed a stochastic multi objective nonlinear programming model for balancing the conflicting objectives of net economic benefit and irrigation water use efficiency zhang and li 2021 incorporated interval programming and credibility constrained programming methods to deal with uncertainties in water quality management issues yan et al 2021 used a cloud based dual objective nonlinear programming model to optimize the irrigated water resources allocation under composite uncertainties among these methods random variables can be conveyed through probability distributions while a large number of samples must be obtained initially gholizadeh et al 2020 interval values can capture the boundaried of the uncertain parameters while they can hardly offset the possibility of an event zuo et al 2021 moreover these studies mainly tackle system parameters existing in the wef system which neglect the ambiguity of the importance degrees in the wef system indices generally determined by decision makers although fuzzy sets are often used in coupling system evaluation they may not be able to handle membership functions also expressed as fuzzy sets kuo and liang 2012 deveci et al 2021 in comparison the interval type 2 fuzzy sets containing positive and negative ideal solutions and relative evaluation matrices can capture uncertainty information better than traditional fuzzy sets deveci et al 2020 1 3 contribution this paper aims to evaluate the wef system security by integrating type 2 fuzzy sets and psr model into one framework the proposed type 2 fuzzy psr model takes superiorities in a addressing ambiguous importance degrees that presented as dual uncertainties and b reflecting the relationship of water energy and food from the perspectives of human activities and environmental changes technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis a method that can make full use of the original data to reflect the relative advantages and disadvantages of each evaluation object has been widely used in resource and environment evaluation lin et al 2021 sedghiyan et al 2021 combinative distance based asssessment codas a method that can measure the overall performances of the alternatives by the euclidean and taxicab distance from the native ideal solutions has also been considered for selecting the best option among the alternative scenarios ibrahim et al 2018 ren 2018 the topsis and codas approaches will be integrated into the type 2 fuzzy psr model to deal with the subjectivity of the data and describe the comprehensive impact of multiple impact indicators harsh and dipankar 2020 nurşah and cengiz 2021 qian and liang 2021 the developed model will be applied for evaluating the security of provincial scale wef system in the yellow river basin findings cannot only provide in depth analysis for balancing the coordinated development among water energy and food but also provide scientific basis for the ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 details the evaluation system and methods including the indicator system for wef system security by the psr model the interval type 2 fuzzy sets the topsis method and the codas method section 3 describes the application and data sources of this study section 4 analyzes the spatial temporal evolution of the subsystem in wef system and discusses the wef system security under different scenarios section 5 shows the main conclusions and future work 2 methodology 2 1 psr model water energy and food form a wef system with mutual influences and restrictions their relationships are more complex as population grow urbanization accelerates and climate change intensifies the wef system faces various pressures which change the state of resource utilization thereby motivate humans to respond and manage the wef system the psr model emphasizes the relationship between resource environmental pressures and resource environmental degradation it has superiority in revealing the changes and dynamic mechanisms of the developmental things under the combined action of multiple factors hu et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 therefore the psr model is selected to build the evaluation index of wef system security as detailed in table 1 before calculating the weight and evaluation the original value of each evaluation index is normalized there are two types of indicators positive indicators and negative indicators the positive index means that wef system security increases with the increasing index value the normalization formula of the positive index is presented as follows 1 y ij x ij x ij min x ij max x ij min the negative index normalization formula is 2 y ij x ij max x ij x ij max x ij min where x ij is the jth sample value of the ith index y ij is the normalized value of x ij x ij max and x ij min are the maximum and minimum values of the ith index respectively 2 2 interval type 2 fuzzy set type 2 fuzzy set is an extension of classical fuzzy sets to capture uncertainty in the grade of membership which can better reflect language ambiguity and give the membership function more freedom erkan and muhammet 2021 pan et al 2021 in the real world wef system parameters may be affected by a series of factors e g inaccurate statistical data and subjective experience leading to dual uncertainties in some parameters such as the importance weight consequently the interval type 2 fuzzy set is adopted to address the dual uncertainties in the weight determination the correlation expression and calculation rule of the interval type 2 fuzzy set are shown in fig 1 1 a simpler type 2 fuzzy set is characterized by two primary membership functions i e upper membership function umf and lower membership function lmf and each element of these functions is a fuzzy set in 0 1 chen and lee 2010 the umf and lmf of an interval type 2 fuzzy set are type 1 membership functions respectively then the reference points and heights of the interval type 2 fuzzy set included in umf and lmf can be used to characterize the interval type 2 fuzzy set lu et al 2021 if the umf and lmf of an interval type 2 fuzzy set are all trapezoids it is called a trapezoidal interval type 2 fuzzy set fig 1 shows a trapezoidal interval

common multi attribute decision making method that determines the attribute weight based on the comparison language according to the subjective intention of decision makers du and gao 2020 in this study the interval type 2 fuzzy set is introduced to reflect the comparison language of decision makers a comparison matrix consisting of interval type 2 fuzzy sets will be formulated and the weights of indicators can be calculated by the ahp model the calculation steps are as follows 1 the evaluation problems are analyzed and a comparative language table based on interval type 2 fuzzy set is constructed as shown in table 2 2 according to the actual situation the decision maker would use comparative language variables to compare the importance of each indicator in pairs and construct a comparison matrix based on the interval type 2 fuzzy sets in table 2 the results are as follows 11 c c 11 c 12 c 1 n c 21 c 22 c 2 n c n 1 c n 2 c n n where c ij is the importance of index i compared to index j 12 c ij 1 c ji 3 in order to avoid significant errors resulting from subjective comparison it is necessary to carry out consistency test for the comparison matrix moreover a de fuzzified matrix will be generated to facilitate the consistency test with the calculation formula shown as follows 13 d t r a t a i 1 8 a i 4 u h 1 a i 2 u a i 2 u h 1 a i 3 u a i 3 u a i 1 u a i 4 l h 1 a i 2 l a i 2 l h 1 a i 3 l a i 3 l a i 1 l the test formula is as follows 14 ci λ max n 1 15 cr ci ri where λ max is the maximum eigenvalue of contrast matrix c ri is a consistency indicator and can be obtained by looking up a table cr is the consistency ratio in which the comparison matrix passes the consistency test if the cr 0 1 parvin et al 2019 4 based on the interval type 2 fuzzy set algorithm the interval type 2 fuzzy geometric average value of each index is calculated and the subjective weight of each index is obtained through normalization the calculation formula is as follows 16 r i c i 1 c i 2 c in n 17 w i r i r 1 r 2 r i where r i is the interval type 2 fuzzy geometric mean of index i w i is the interval type 2 fuzzy weight of index i 2 4 topsis method the topsis method is a classic multi attribute decision evaluation method with simple calculation and clear results which has been widely used in multi field evaluation research zyoud et al 2016 its logic is to calculate the euclidean distance between the evaluation object and the optimal scheme as well as the distance between the evaluation object and the worst scheme the closeness between the evaluation object and the optimal scheme could be adopted as the evaluation basis for the overall ranking evaluation the topsis calculation steps are described as follows 1 the standardized values of different indices are used to construct the decision matrix y 18 y y 11 y 12 y 1 j y 21 y 22 y 2 j y i 1 y i 2 y i j 2 the evaluation matrix z is generated based on the decision matrix and the weight matrix with interval type 2 fuzzy sets 19 z z 11 z 12 z 1 j z 21 z 22 z 2 j z i 1 z i 2 z i j 20 z ij w i y ij 3 rank formula is used to deblur the evaluation matrix z the positive and negative ideal solutions of each index are obtained 21 z j max rank z 1 j rank z 2 j rank z ij 22 z j min rank z 1 j rank z 2 j rank z ij 4 the euclidean distances between each evaluation object and the positive and negative ideal solutions are calculated 23 e i j 1 m rank z ij z j 2 24 e i j 1 m rank z ij z j 2 5 the relative closeness of each evaluation object are generated as follows 25 c c i e i e i e i if the relative closeness c c i is 1 then the scheme is the best 2 5 codas method the codas method takes the euclidean distance and manhattan distance of alternatives from the negative ideal as the evaluation basis then a subjective coefficient is introduced to compare the scores of the evaluation objects and finally all the scores are added to rank the alternatives keshavarz et al 2016 ibrahim et al 2018 the calculation steps are as follows 1 the manhattan distance t j of alternatives from the negative ideal solution is calculated as 26 t j j 1 m rank z ij z j 2 the pairwise evaluation schemes are compared to obtain the score values and the comparison matrix r is constructed 27 r h ik n n 28 h ik e i e k γ e i e k t i t k 29 γ x 1 x δ 0 x δ 3 the total score of each scheme are calculated 30 h i k 1 n h ik the scheme with the highest h i is the best choice among the schemes 3 application 3 1 statement of problems the yellow river basin is located in central and northern parts of china with a total drainage area of 795 000 km2 accounting for 8 3 of the national area the total length of the main stream is 5464 km which is the second longest river in china the yellow river flows through qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong provinces yuan et al 2021 the yellow river basin is an important area of agricultural economic development in china which is known as energy basin and agricultural basin feng et al 2021 however the sustainable development of the wef system in the yellow river basin is challenged due to the limitation of geographical conditions water resources unblanced energy and food distribution intensified human activities water shortage and water pollution problems 3 2 data collection the most data of the nine provinces in the yellow river basin from 2006 to 2019 are collected from water resources bulletin of each province cwrb 2020 various statistical yearbooks csy 2020 the official website of the national bureau of statistics http data stats gov cn and chinese economic and social big data research platform https data cnki net in the process of data collection some data are missing and cannot be collected linear interpolation method and correlation coefficient method are used to fill in the missing data 3 3 formulation of wef system evaluation index the purpose of this study is to use the combination of type 2 fuzzy sets and psr model to establish an evaluation index system to assess the wef system as shown in fig 2 the main contents of this research are to a establish an evaluation index system for wef system security b use type 2 fuzzy sets and analytic hierarchy process to determine the index weight c combining topsis and codas methods to analyze the wef system security in the yellow river basin besides six scenarios are considered for addressing the different decision makers preferences as detailed in table 3 the importance of each subsystem is compared and the results are described as equally important ei slightly important si and obviously important oi for example in scenario 1 i e s1 the relative importance of pressure state and response subsystem is oi si and ei indicating that decision makers consider the pressure of wef system as an important factor affecting the security of wef system 4 results analysis the sensitivity parameter δ is a subjective parameter in the codas method which is set according to the subjective intention of decision makers different δ levels represent different attitudes of decision makers and may lead to the different ranking results as shown in fig 3 the results show the ranking of pressure in wef system that the δ level increases from 0 01 to 0 08 in gansu qinghai and sichuan province in this study the δ 0 01 and 0 06 are used to analyze the wef system security in the nine provinces in the yellow river basin 4 1 evaluation of the subsystem 4 1 1 evaluation of pressure in wef system the pressure of wef system in the nine provinces from 2006 to 2019 are showed in fig 4 the low score in fig 4 indicates that the pressure of wef system is high and needs to be improved the results show that the trend of pressure rises in qinghai and sichuan province the increasing trend in qinghai province may mainly be attributed to the large waste water discharge and high energy consumption per unit gdp in sichuan province the pressure of wef system increased because the annual natural population growth rate and water consumption per capita increased the pressure of wef system reached its peak in 2017 as the natural population growth rate and waste water discharge per capita respectively reached the peak of 4 23 and 324 08 t person in 2017 in 2010 2019 the pressure of wef system in ningxia decreased since ningxia took measures to effectively control the waste water discharge per capita and energy consumption per unit gdp dswprstf 2019 in the midstream of the yellow river basin the pressure of wef system in shanxi province has fluctuated in the past few years in 2017 the energy consumption per unit gdp of shanxi province dropped from 1 682 tons to 1 277 tons ssy 2018 which alleviated the pressure of wef system in shanxi province the pressure of wef system in inner mongolia and shaanxi province showed a rising trend year by year in shaanxi province energy consumption per unit gdp and waste water discharge per capita increased steadily and reached their corresponding peak in 2019 in inner mongolia the pressure of wef system increased slightly from 2015 to 2017 which was attributed to the increase of inundated area and chemical fertilizer utilization in the downstream of the yellow river basin the pressure of wef system in henan and shandong province showed a consistent rising trend from 2006 to 2015 then an downward trend from 2015 to 2017 the pressure of wef system in the two provinces showed an obvious upward trend from 2006 to 2015 due to the increasing waste water discharge per capita in the two provinces fu et al 2020 in 2015 2017 the pressure of wef system in both provinces showed an downward trend due to the implementation of the strictest water resource management system waste water discharge per capita and water consumption per capita were controlled which improved the ecological environment in both provinces 4 1 2 evaluation of state in wef system fig 5 presents the state of wef system in the nine provinces from 2006 to 2019 in which a high score from codas or topsis would correspond to a good condition of the wef system state the state of wef system in four upstream provinces had been improved from 2006 to 2019 however in 2015 and 2016 the state of wef system in gansu province was reduced because the water resources per capita dropped sharply from 766 99 m3 to 635 03 m3 fan et al 2019 the state of wef system in qinghai province increased greatly in 2006 which was related to the significant decrease of water consumption in industrial sectors the state of wef system in sichuan province increased greatly from 2006 to 2008 due to the adjustment of industrial structure and the significant decrease of water consumption in industries the state of wef system in ningxia had been rising steadily with the substantial increase in primary energy output and power generation the state of wef system in ningxia increased greatly in 2010 2011 the reason was that the primary energy output had increased from 49 12 million tons to 58 59 million tons in 2011 and the increase in power generation had nearly doubled in the midstream of the yellow river basin the state of wef system in inner mongolia shaanxi and shanxi province all showed an increasing trend the state of wef system in shanxi province showed a downward trend from 2015 to 2016 due to the increase of industrial water consumption and the drop of total power in agricultural machinery the state of wef system in inner mongolia experienced a large increase from 2009 to 2013 mainly because of the transformation of industrial structure the industrial water consumption decreased from 52 74 m3 in 2008 to 29 77 m3 in 2013 shang et al 2019 the state of wef system in henan and shandong provinces showed a rising trend this was a result of the high agricultural mechanization degree and the increasing grain yield per unit area 4 1 3 evaluation of response in wef system the response of wef system of the nine provinces in the yellow river basin from 2006 to 2019 are shown in fig 6 the province with high scores of codas and topsis would indicate effective responding mechanism from human and society the response of wef system in the four upstream provinces showed an upward trend indicating that the local departments had achieved remarkable results in the management of the wef system the response of wef system in qinghai gansu and sichuan provinces all showed a rising trend year by year because of the large amount of water resources more attention to the utilization of water resources and large proportion of hydropower the response of wef system in ningxia increased in from 2011 to 2012 since effective measures were taken by local departments to improve the utilization of water resources it was suggested that all regions increased the recycling utilization of water resources and adopted water saving and water collecting measures to promote the sustainable utilization of water resources the response of wef system in inner mongolia shaanxi and shanxi provinces were all at the top among the nine provinces in the yellow river basin the response of wef system in inner mongolia and shaanxi provinces both showed an upward trend year by year this was because that relevant local departments had taken measures to increase investment in the energy industry and promote high quality development of the region the response of wef system in shanxi province showed a trend of increasing firstly reached the peak in 2016 and then presented an decreasing trend the declining of response in 2017 was attributed to the sharp drop in investment in the energy industry ssy 2018 the response of wef system in henan and shandong provinces showed an upward trend indicating that the departments had made contributions to improving the ecological environment and energy efficiency the response of wef system decreased in henan province from 2018 to 2019 probabily due to the increasing of water resource utilization rate from 69 04 to 141 04 the response of wef system in shandong province showed an increasing trend because the relevant measures taken by local departments the reclaimed water rate and investment in energy industry were at the top of the yellow river basin therefore increasing the utilization rate of water resources and improving the optimal allocation of energy were conducive to enhancing the response of wef system and promoting high quality development 4 2 scenario analysis of wef system security the comparison of wef system security in nine provinces based on the two evaluation methods and six scenarios are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 in scenario 1 and scenario 2 the pressure of wef system was an important factor for the wef system security in these two scenarios the wef system security in gansu and sichuan provinces was at the forefront this was because that the two provinces both located in the upstream of the yellow river basin with sufficient water energy and less pollution and the waste water discharge per capita was less than other provinces in the basin in these two scenarios it was suggested that decision makers would focus on the security of local wef system reducing waste water discharge adjusting industrial structure and relieving the pressure of regional wef system scenario 3 and 6 took the response of wef system as the most important factor and the security of wef system in shandong province and inner mongolia was in the forefront in these two scenarios the security of wef system of these two scenarios was higher than that of scenario 4 and scenario 5 therefore it was suggested that local departments improved their decision making ability and optimized the scheduling of water resources 5 conclusions in this study an evaluation index system of wef system security based on psr model in the yellow river basin was constructed the interval type 2 fuzzy sets and analytic hierarchy process were integrated to determine the weight of each index for the six different weight distribution scenarios were constructed the topsis and codas methods were used to evaluate the wef system security in the yellow river basin from 2006 to 2019 results revealed that the pollution control industrial structure and agricultural automation process become the main factors affecting the wef system security the pressure of wef system in four upstream provinces is low but the state of wef system and the response of wef system are not as good as the midstream and downstream of the basin the pressure in the downstream of the yellow river basin is greater than that in the upstream and midstream because of its geographical location and insufficient water resources therefore coordinating the relationship between water resources energy and food industries is the key direction to promote the high quality development of the region this study not only conducted a comparison of the wef system security in the nine provinces of the yellow river basin but also analyzed the comparison of wef subsystem in various regions in order to provide scientific basis for ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin although the wef evaluation index system based on psr model could reflect the interactive mechanism among water energy and food the mechanism is more complex in real world because of human effect and natural disasters in addition the evaluation framework lacks indexes that can reflect the flow of physical and embodied wef resources between regions therefore multi regional input output analysis and system dynamics model will be adopted in the selection of evaluation indexes in future studies giulia et al 2022 tian et al 2022 moreover this study only considers three types of indicators water energy and food more indicators in the evaluation system of this study need to be increased sa d et al 2018 boscow et al 2021 in the context of major strategic decisions to achieve the dual carbon goal indicators such as carbon sinks and carbon emissions can be added to subsequent studies to discuss their impact on the wef system security of the yellow river basin and improve the applicability of the research moncef and mohammad 2021 wei et al 2022 declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work was supported by the caas key

9516,unconfined aquifers are often directly impacted by high irrigation demands therefore accurate recharge estimates are crucial for sustainable groundwater management it is important over time to re examine the existing hydrologic understanding of aquifers taking into account developments in knowledge and changing climate conditions the last in depth study into the assiniboine delta aquifer located in manitoba canada that gave a recharge estimate was conducted in the 1980s render 1988 this work re examined the assiniboine delta aquifer employing new methods and data to estimate recharge rates twelve one dimensional models were created in the software hydrus 1d to model the soil water fluxes in the unsaturated zone to analyze the historic recharge from 1996 to 2019 remote weather station data measured hydraulic conductivity soil texture distribution soil moisture content and soil temperature data were used to initialize and run the models inverse calibration used the measured moisture contents to calibrate the models which resulted in root mean square error in the calibration and validation periods averaging 0 034 and 0 051 m3 m3 respectively above the 0 025 m3 m3 sensor measurement error rough estimates of soil texture distribution across the aquifer was determined to assist in the final recharge estimate the historical regional recharge average was estimated to be 68 mm year double the previous estimate for the aquifer render 1988 modelled periods were limited to less than a year due to limitations in the general hydrus 1d software model code under frozen soil conditions which the assiniboine delta aquifer experiences during the winter months assumptions on initial soil moisture contents snowpack heights and model start dates were best estimated for historical years results show these estimates can have significant impacts on the resulting recharge suggested future work includes implementing the hydrus 1d freeze thaw code to allow for model spin up and multi year simulations to enhance the reliability of model results keywords groundwater recharge hydrus 1d rosetta numerical modeling inverse calibration 1 introduction groundwater is a vital but often overlooked natural resource accounting for 30 of the world s total freshwater the majority of the world s freshwater is locked up in glaciers and icecaps making groundwater the source for 99 of the freshwater that is accessible for human consumption rivera 2014 the remaining 1 of accessible freshwater is surface water a source that is significantly less spatially and temporally available döll 2009 groundwater is estimated to have the highest extraction rate of all raw materials on earth at 982 km3 extracted annually margat and van der gun 2013 however the current rate is unsustainable as it is being extracted faster than what replenishes naturally causing groundwater levels to decline famiglietti 2014 these declining levels are causing alarm in the scientific community due to the looming water scarcity crisis on top of the extraction rates another cause for concern is the effects of global warming and its ability to exacerbate current problems for future generations work done by kundzewicz et al 2007 shows that future climate change projections indicate that the negative impacts on freshwater systems such as increased variability in precipitation will outweigh any benefits scanlon et al 2005 suggest that the reduction in reliability of surface water sources due to climate change will result in further reliance on groundwater sources a study conducted by döll 2009 analyzing potential future climate scenarios and their effect on recharge suggests that a 10 decrease in renewable groundwater resources could be observed by 2050 on over one fifth of the world landmass shallow and unconfined aquifers whose water levels are influenced immediately by local climate conditions will take greater influence from climate change effects apaydin 2010 changnon et al 1988 increasing global temperatures will cause increased evapotranspiration resulting in less soil moisture available to recharge aquifers berg et al 2016 shallow aquifers additionally are often at greater risk for overuse and falling water levels due to the ease at which their supplies are accessible predominantly for agricultural irrigation purposes papadopoulos et al 2021 the irrigation sector is the largest groundwater consumer accounting for 70 of its use worldwide margat and van der gun 2013 to prevent groundwater depletion from occurring the practice of sustainable groundwater management is employed sustainable groundwater management involves implementing strategies and practices to manage groundwater use ensuring quality and quantity are protected indefinitely bruce et al 2009 quantity is measured in terms of groundwater storage the difference between the amount of water recharged and discharged from an aquifer over a given period therefore accurate recharge rates are crucial for sustainable groundwater management in conjunction with information on both natural and man made discharge rates methods commonly employed to determine recharge rates include isotope tracer qian et al 2014 túri et al 2019 water table fluctuation wang et al 2014 healy and cook 2002 and numerical modelling assefa and woodbury 2013 holländer et al 2016 ordens et al 2014 singh et al 2019 unsaturated zone modelling provides estimates of recharge based on drainage below the root zone assuming any water passing the root zone will continue to flow vertically down and reach the water table scanlon et al 2002 calibration is a necessary step in modelling when parameter values are not known directly when calibration is utilized applying a model to meteorological and soil conditions that differ from the calibration period may not provide accurate results seibert 2003 to help overcome this issue using a calibration period that is both wet and dry is the ideal scenario to ensure subsequent model periods perform well moeck et al 2018 even with initial estimates parameters change in time and situation and require calibration to the conditions wallach et al 2013 model spin up is another modelling technique performed in hydrologic modelling scenarios the process allows conditions e g soil moisture content to reach an equilibrium state between simulated fluxes and inputted forcing data cosgrove et al 2003 seck et al 2015 once the equilibrium state is reached the final spin up conditions are used as initial conditions for the subsequent modelling period to ensure responses to forcing data are realistic and accurate assefa and woodbury 2013 used the physically based model code hydrus 1d with the soil hydraulic parameter derivation code rosetta to provide reliable groundwater recharge estimations in the unsaturated zone holländer et al 2016 expanded on this to show how data from a low cost remote sensor weather station combined with data on soil moisture and soil temperature can provide robust recharge estimates using both hydrus 1d and rosetta codes rosetta was developed using soil samples from the usa and europe meaning soil parameter estimations may not be highly accurate for canadian soils and parameter calibration is a necessary step in the modelling process holländer et al 2016 this work aims to create models that accurately predict recharge using remote sensor weather station soil moisture and soil temperature data in the assiniboine delta aquifer ada previous work by holländer et al 2016 was performed in southern abbotsford british columbia canada which experiences different climate conditions compared to the study area for this work annual precipitation in southern abbotsford measures 1507 mm year 1984 2013 holländer et al 2016 three times that of this study area additionally southern abbotsford winters are milder with daily average air temperatures of 3 5 c and 5 0 c in january and february 1981 2010 compared to daily average air temperatures of 15 3 c and 11 8 c for the same months and years in the ada environment and climate change canada 2020a the different climate conditions required significantly different approaches to model setup and initialization due to frozen soils in winter months another differentiation from the work done by holländer et al 2016 is the presence of groundwater at study sites as this work results in both recharge and discharge these variations will test the ability of the methods to perform well under differing climatic and groundwater conditions once created the models will further be run through with historical weather data environment and climate change canada 2020b to predict historical recharge rates from 1996 to 2019 render 1988 estimated recharge in the ada from spring 1983 to spring 1986 the estimate was made with the assumptions of no overland flow and changes in soil moisture approach zero annually changes in groundwater storage were determined from observation well records and surface runoff due to groundwater was estimated from discharge measurements at the upper pine creek the final recharge estimate was 34 mm annually the manitoba water stewardship 2005 estimated that in the ada 85 of precipitation is lost due to evapotranspiration 5 is lost through surface waterways or used for water supply and the remaining 10 recharges the aquifer it is important over time to re examine the existing hydrologic understanding of aquifers advancements in knowledge and information available on aquifers and the surrounding land as well as changing climate conditions can have significant impacts on how we examine aquifers and the resulting conclusions drawn this research will re examine the assiniboine delta aquifer to determine an alternate recharge estimate using new data and employing methods not previously used on the aquifer 2 methodology 2 1 research area the assiniboine delta aquifer is located in southern manitoba s prairie region canada it covers approximately 3885 km2 is unconfined and is characterized by predominantly sandy soils render 1988 the ada water supply is of critical importance due to high irrigation demands for manitoban agricultural purposes particularly potato farming manitoba water stewardship 2005 as of april 2021 the ada has a sustainable yield of 134 7 106 m3 year but allows an allocation limit of 64 7 106 m3 year the amount of water license allocated within the region totals 50 0 106 m3 year leaving only 14 7 106 m3 year available from four out of 13 sub basins within the ada wiseman personal communication april 2021 the manitoba agriculture weather program mawp was established in 2005 to create a network of stations across manitoba to provide real time information on weather data and soil conditions in manitoba s predominantly agricultural regions ojo and manaigre 2021 the network includes 12 stations in and around the ada used in this research labelled as 1 12 fig 1 the climate in the region is characterized as dfb by the köppen geiger classification for cold climate fully humid with warm summers kottek et al 2006 temperatures vary throughout the year the coldest are observed in january with a monthly average of 15 3 c and the warmest are observed in july with a monthly average of 19 5 c the frost free period averages 120 days annually with the last spring frost observed may 20th and the first fall frost september 18th annual average precipitation totals 530 mm with 413 mm of rain and 117 cm of snow equal to 117 mm of precipitation in snow water equivalents 1981 2010 environment and climate change canada 2020a 2 2 data the mawp provided for each site soil textural weather soil moisture and soil temperature data the soil textural data provided was the percentage of sand silt and clay within samples taken at four 10 cm depths in the soil profile the weather data included daily average maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity wind speed radiation and precipitation the soil moisture and soil temperature data were provided daily from sensors placed at 5 20 50 and 100 cm in the soil profile table 1 outlines the observation information for all measured data the daily weather and soil data provided were available from the years 2017 2019 each model was calibrated to one year s data and validated to data from a second year the calibration year used 2019 data because it provided the most consistent data from all four sensors across all sites in 2019 the data was only available up to november 1st however there is often little recharge past that point in time due to the ground beginning to freeze the validation year used 2018 data with some exceptions leading to 2017 data being used a full account of validation data used and reasoning as well as availability of sensor at different depths per site can be found in appendix a weather data was obtained from environment and climate change canada eccc 2020b to determine historical recharge trends including average maximum and minimum air temperatures precipitation wind speed and relative humidity only two eccc sites in proximity to the study area recorded the data required for hydrus 1d and could be used for historical purposes the two sites are positioned in the same location on the map fig 1 as sites 6 and 7 of those two the eccc site in closest proximity to each study site was applied regression analysis was used to estimate missing information between the two sites air temperature wind speed and relative humidity had a positive correlation with r2 values of 0 99 0 83 and 0 91 respectively precipitation had low correlation with an r2 value of 0 48 regression was not used and missing precipitation data was assumed to be zero to allow for conservative recharge estimates at sites 8 12 groundwater level data was provided by the province of manitoba groundwater management 2020 2021 to account for missing groundwater levels regression analysis was performed with groundwater level data from a second well that observed similar groundwater level patterns initial snowpack heights were obtained from eccc 2020b and based on the climate class of the area a snow density of 0 26 g cm3 was applied to obtain snow water equivalents sturm et al 2010 the ml3 theta probe soil moisture sensors used are not reliable below 0 c due to ice being present the sensors rely on the dielectric permittivity of its surrounding to output accurate moisture content readings ice has a permittivity of 3 jiang and wu 2004 opposed to 81 for water archer and wang 1990 the difference in permittivity observed causes the sensors to output incorrect moisture content readings when ice is present additionally the general hydrus 1d model code used does not perform well under frozen conditions while implementing the snow hydrology component zhao et al 2016 therefore each yearly simulation ran beginning in spring as the soil thaws and ending in late fall early winter as the soil freezes for calibration and validation years this date could be identified by observing the days when soil temperatures rose above or below 0 c for historical years these days were determined by comparing cumulative average daily air temperatures to soil temperatures of 0 c at the study sites for all years that data was available a three day average air temperature above 1 75 c best estimated soil temperature rising above 0 c a three day average air temperature below 13 0 c best estimated soil temperature falling below 0 c 2 3 measured and predicted soil hydraulic parameters undisturbed soil samples were taken at sites to determine saturated hydraulic conductivity three sites 1 6 and 11 had been sampled and tested for saturated hydraulic conductivity previously for another project permission was given for those values to be used in this research at all other sites four samples were collected corresponding to the four model depths table 2 however due to site conditions and equipment availability only three samples were collected at sites 2 7 and 10 and only two samples at site 12 at the sites where only three samples could be collected the fourth layer was assigned the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the closest sampled layer for site 12 the two layers with missing samples were assigned the average value of the two sampled layers depending on soil sample permeability either constant head permeability tests were carried out according to astm d2434 19 astm 2006 or falling head permeability tests were carried out according to astm d5084 16a astm 2016 final values were taken as the average of multiple tests on average 6 tests were performed per sample the maximum standard deviation observed was 13 and the average standard deviation across all samples taken directly for this project was 4 for all hydraulic conductivity measurements the values ranged from a minimum of 1 3 cm day recorded at site 12 to a maximum of 1143 cm day recorded at site 1 this agrees with what render 1988 noted that the hydraulic conductivities are highest near the shilo area location of site 1 the average saturated hydraulic conductivity of all samples was 89 cm day pedotransfer functions are a means to take standard soil data and predict complex soil properties which would otherwise be time consuming and costly to determine rosetta is a pedotransfer function that estimates van genuchten mualem water retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity given various inputs of textural class bulk density and or water retention depending on what data is available the newest version rosetta3 was used in this research to estimate mean values of initial water retention parameters residual soil water content θr saturated soil water content θs inverse of the air entry value α and pore size distribution index n as well as accompanying standard deviations zhang and schaap 2017 the input data used was the soil textural class data provided by the mawp 2 4 unsaturated zone modelling 2 4 1 model equations hydrus 1d implements one dimensional flow through the unsaturated zone governed by a modified version of the richards equation that considers the movement of water in only the liquid phase šimůnek et al 2018 the movement of water through the vapour phase plays an important role in arid and semiarid climates due to the dry soil kosmas et al 2001 since the research area is characterized as a fully humid climate the vapour phase was ignored the hydraulic model employed was the van genuchten mualem soil water retention curve model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the presence of snow was accounted for by hydrus 1d s snow hydrology function šimůnek et al 2018 when the air temperature is below 2 c precipitation is in the form of snow when the air temperature is above 2 c precipitation is in the form of liquid rain in between 2 c and 2 c there is a linear relationship between the air temperature and the form of precipitation snow that accumulates at the upper model boundary melts proportional to a snow melting constant of 0 43 cm day c and the daily temperature value a sublimation constant of 0 4 reduces potential evaporation from the snow heat transport within the model was described by the chung and horton thermal conductivity function chung and horton 1987 1 l0 q b1 b2q b3q0 5 where l0 is thermal conductivity mlt3k 1 b1 b2 and b3 are empirical parameters mlt3k 1 and q is the volumetric water content l3l 3 hydrus 1d has a built in selector to input the empirical constants depending on if the soil is represented dominantly by sand loam or clay the feddes root water uptake model was used to simulate the movement of water removed due to vegetation in the area the simulated root water uptake defined by feddes et al 1978 is as follows 2 s h α h sp where s is the volume of water removed from a volume of soil per unit time t 1 sp is the maximum potential root water uptake t 1 and α h is a dimensionless function of the soil water pressure head sites were located in a grassed area as recommended by astm d5111 standard guide for choosing locations and sampling methods to monitor atmospheric deposition at non urban locations astm 2020 therefore the pasture vegetation type was selected which inputs parameter values for pressure heads and transpiration rates in the water stress response function the penman monteith combination equation estimated potential evapotranspiration which requires the input of air temperature wind speed radiation and relative humidity allen et al 1988 hydrus 1d can either use known radiation values or calculate potential radiation the mawp data contained daily radiation values that were used for historical years radiation values were not available from the eccc data and potential radiation was used 2 4 2 soil profile initial and boundary conditions four soil profile layers were created within hydrus 1d corresponding to the four soil texture samples provided by mawp table 2 for all sites the upper boundary condition used was atmospheric bc with surface runoff which allowed the boundary to enact surface runoff should the upper soil layer become saturated for the lower boundary condition either free drainage or variable pressure head was used free drainage is a zero gradient boundary condition used when the water table is below the model domain sites using this boundary condition are categorized as having no groundwater influence variable pressure head is used when the groundwater level is within the model domain and requires the input of groundwater level data sites using this boundary condition are categorized as having groundwater influence initial conditions employed in the models included soil temperature and moisture content every 1 cm in the model domain represented by a single node during calibration and validation when soil temperature and soil moisture were recorded daily on the day the models began the temperature from the four sensors were applied to the nodes at the corresponding depths and in between temperature values were linearly interpolated for the nodes above the 5 cm node values were linearly interpolated between the average air temperature and temperature at the 5 cm sensor for soil moisture during those periods the same principle was applied with exceptions due to the timing of model initialization it is likely that ice was present in the soil and it was observed to have influence on the recorded moisture contents these instances were often identifiable by significant increases in moisture content over a short period of time a few days after the start date the steep moisture content increases were often accompanied by soil temperatures remaining around 0 c and then increasing significantly with the moisture content increase the steep moisture content slope is similar to what was observed by bittelli et al 2003 which the authors identified to be caused by the melting of ice in successively larger pores dissimilarly for bittelli et al 2003 the slopes consistently peaked at 0 c and in this work the peak was at times observed at positive soil temperatures when these inaccurate moisture content readings occurred at initialization the initial soil moisture contents in the models were estimated using best judgement to ensure that the future simulated soil moisture contents matched recorded values once soil temperature rose well above 0 c and reliable soil moisture values were recorded for the historical modelling periods no information was known on initial conditions therefore the initial temperature and soil moisture content were taken as the average of the initial values during the calibration and validation years therefore initial soil temperature and moisture content was the same for a single site across all historical years except for the soil temperature in the first 5 cm which was linearly interpolated between the average of the temperature at the 5 cm in the calibration and validation years and the mean air temperature on the day the models began each historical year to attempt to prevent missing large snow melting periods the initial snowpack height was taken as the maximum measured snow height in the 14 days prior to the model start figs 2 and 3 depict the one dimensional site profiles including the soil textural distribution of each layer represented by the sand s silt si and clay c fractions the initial soil moisture applied to the historical modelled years and the boundary conditions applied it should be noted that the fractions of sand silt and clay were rounded resulting in some layers summation of the three soil types summing to 1 0 01 2 5 soil texture distribution to assist in averaging recharge across the aquifer the soil texture distributions were determined manitoba land initiative maps from the government of manitoba 2002a 2002b 2002c 2002d 2002e 2002f 2002g 2002h 2002i 2002j 2002k 2002l provided soil codes and associated areas within a municipality maps were obtained and combined into one map in qgis qgis org 2021 aquifer boundaries were then delineated to consider only sections within the ada the soil landscapes of canada soil landscapes of canada working group 2010 map was used to assist in converting manitoba soil codes from manitoba land initiative maps to associated soil texture distribution percent sand silt and clay using the soil texture distribution a computer program for soil textural classification triangle gerakis and baer 1999 was used which utilizes the usda textural triangle to determine soil textural class of samples a total of 10 different soil textures were determined to exist within the ada and the percentage of the total area covered by each soil texture was determined the soil textures were sand 35 loamy sand 19 sandy loam 19 loam 17 silty loam 3 sandy clay loam 1 silty clay loam 1 clay loam 7 silty clay 1 and clay 1 render 1988 noted that during their investigation no overland flow was observed suggesting that the majority of water reaches the subsurface additionally the assiniboine delta aquifer management plan manitoba water stewardship 2005 notes that most precipitation both rain and snowmelt infiltrates due to the coarse soil therefore sites with groundwater influence are ignored and only recharge results from sites without groundwater influence are used for regional rates in this research while the majority of soil textures in the ada were represented by modelled sites without groundwater influence four types silty clay loam silt clay clay and clay loam were not which accounted for 8 of the total area of the ada the sites are of finer texture than all modelled sites indicating lower recharge to determine recharge over the entire ada modelled sites were categorized based on their soil textures the recharge rate for each soil texture was the average of all recharge rates of modelled sites without groundwater influence average recharge over the entire ada was taken as the summation of the products of the recharge rate per soil texture and the percentage of area covered in the ada by that soil texture fig 4 depicts the soil texture distribution across the ada each soil texture that was represented by modeled sites is represented by a distinct color the four types that were not accounted for silty clay loam silt clay clay and clay loam as well as any sections that were labelled as unclassified without distinctions of sand silt and clay textural classes are represented as na 2 6 calibration process hydrus 1d s inverse calibration method was employed using the marquardt levenberg optimization algorithm to optimize soil hydraulic parameters using observed and simulated soil moisture content marquardt 1963 šimůnek et al 2018 since the method is a local optimization method rosetta3 was used to re condition the initial estimates two error metrics mean error me and root mean square error rmse were used during the calibration process to minimize the overall error me indicates bias by an average of the difference between measured and observed and gives an indication of over or underestimation jackson et al 2019 rmse measures total error within a sample set that takes greater influence from large errors jackson et al 2019 with both error metrics a value of 0 is desirable and indicates a perfect match between measure and observed 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation as outlined in table 3 the me for both calibration and validation years across all sites showed results around 0 indicating no trend in over or under predicting me was less than 0 025 m3 m3 at 93 of all sensors in the calibration year and 74 of all sensors in the validation year rmse across all sensors averaged 0 034 m3 m3 in the calibration year and 0 051 m3 m3 in the validation year rmse in the calibration year showed 34 of sensors were less than 0 025 m3 m3 and 86 of sensors were less than 0 05 m3 m3 the rmse in the validation year showed 12 of sensors were less than 0 025 m3 m3 and 56 of sensors were less than 0 05 m3 m3 the soil moisture sensors have a measurement rmse of 0 025 m3 m3 in clayey soils ojo et al 2015 while most sites were not clayey clay sites often produce the largest errors rowlandson et al 2013 therefore a measurement error of 0 025 m3 m3 likely encompasses the maximum measurement error for all sites as mentioned only 34 of sensors in the calibration year and 12 of sensors in the validation year had rmse below 0 025 m3 m3 and within the measurement error range therefore the overall errors increased due to inaccuracies in the numerical modelling e g initial moisture contents and the assumptions made on snow height and snow density the rosetta3 standard deviations assisted in the calibration process by creating a reasonable range of parameter values to adjust within particularly helpful because of the local optimization method employed in hydrus 1d in comparing the initial soil parameter estimations to the final parameters several final values were outside of the outputted standard deviations if they gave insufficient comparative moisture contents during calibration across all sites and layers the percentage of final parameter values that fell within 1 2 3 and 4 standard deviations were 21 29 42 and 61 even though measured hydraulic conductivity values were used rather than rosetta3 estimates for comparison purposes the percentage of measured hydraulic conductivity values that fell within 1 2 3 and 4 standard deviations were 15 29 31 and 35 reasons for altering beyond standard deviations included if observed residual water contents fell below the minimum standard deviation outputted the final parameter value was the minimum observed value similarly if saturated water contents rose above the maximum standard deviation outputted from rosetta3 the final parameter value was the maximum observed value the two most common layers where altering parameters beyond standard deviations occurred were the first and fourth layers this is reasonable because the first layer measures only 15 cm below ground where the soil is exposed to freeze thaw cycles during the winter and drought periods during the summer which may alter physical properties the fourth layer applied the outputted parameters from a 10 cm sample to a 135 cm layer which may not have had similar physical properties throughout that matched the 10 cm sample the site with the worst validation error metrics was site 8 which had me of 0 07 and 0 20 m3 m3 and rmse of 0 14 and 0 21 m3 m3 at the 5 and 20 cm sensors one reason could be the installation of new sensors that occurred at this site in 2018 on september 13th 2018 at site 8 the 5 cm sensor showed a 0 18 m3 m3 increase in moisture content the 20 cm sensor showed a 0 18 m3 m3 decrease in moisture content and data became available for 50 and 100 cm sensors when none was available before there was significant rainfall coinciding with these discrepancies which may have caused the 5 cm sensor increase in moisture content but could not create the decrease at the 20 cm sensor this prompt the realization that new sensors were installed alternatively the reason could be the missing peak in moisture content when the model began at the 5 cm sensor around 0 4 0 6 m3 m3 the site is predominantly sand which generally coincides with low water contents in this study inconsistent with the 0 4 0 6 m3 m3 recorded additionally there was no data available for the 50 and 100 cm sensors to determine the conditions below in the ground one possibility is there may have been ice in the soil below the 5 and 20 cm sensors blocking the water from flowing downwards resulting in high moisture contents that the model could not predict for models with no groundwater influence recharge was defined as the summation of the water flux out the bottom boundary of the model at 200 cm depth for models with groundwater influence recharge discharge was defined as the summation of the water flux passing over the 100 cm depth therefore if over an entire model year more water travelled up above the 100 cm node that year was defined as having overall discharged the total summation of water passing over the 100 cm node similarly if over an entire model year more water travelled down below the 100 cm node that year was defined as having overall recharged the total summation of water passing over the 100 cm node the average difference between recharge discharge recorded in calibration and validation years are summarized in table 4 the difference between recharge and discharge of calibration and validation using mawp site specific data and historical data from the closest eccc weather station indicates the validity of using the eccc weather data for historical values this was also reported by holländer et al 2016 sites with no groundwater influence showed better consistency than sites with groundwater influence between the two data sets averaging 20 mm year difference as compared to 50 mm year difference sites with groundwater influence showed no trend in differences between recharge and discharge of calibration and validation using mawp site specific data and historical data from the closest eccc weather station generally for sites with no groundwater influence the pattern showed that coarser soil sites observed larger differences while finer soil sites observed smaller differences however large differences are observed e g a 140 mm year difference at site 2 during validation and possible reasons include initial moisture content estimations and initial snow water equivalent estimations sites with groundwater influence showed larger differences between the recharge estimates using mawp and eccc data e g the loam soil texture saw a 117 mm year difference in the validation year recharge and discharge rates are more prone to variations with slightly varied weather data when groundwater is present this is due to the high soil moisture content near saturation above the groundwater table so that small changes in precipitation and result in large differences in recharge therefore it is less valid to use the eccc weather data for historical values when the location is groundwater impacted 3 2 historical recharge and discharge historical rates were determined from 1996 to 2019 average historical recharge discharge rates as well as recharge to precipitation ratios are presented per soil texture and site type in table 5 seven of the 12 sites had no groundwater influence resulting in recharge only average recharge rates across sites varied from 16 to 124 mm year recharge to precipitation ratios r p ranged from 3 to 27 five of the 12 sites had groundwater influence resulting in recharge and discharge occurring standard deviation values were high for groundwater influence sites as large as 117 mm year for the sand soils due to the model capabilities several years could not run due to groundwater levels rising above ground level resulting in the model being unable to converge discharge would have occurred during these periods which would likely have resulted in higher discharge rates than presented for sites without groundwater influence recharge varied across all sites predominantly the sand site had the highest recharge rates at 124 mm year while the sandy clay loam site had the lowest at 16 mm year overall the recharge based on soil texture followed expected outcomes coarser soil sites sand loamy sand sandy loam exhibited the highest rates while finer soil sites loam sandy clay loam silty loam exhibited the lowest rates therefore sites without groundwater influence showed trends of more recharge observed at coarse soil sites compared to fine in 2008 the model code sabae hw was tested at a site in pine creek north a subbasin of the ada along with software s shaw and class for comparison purposes loukili et al 2008 the models ran from 1999 to 2003 using soil and weather data assessing the long term water budget the r p averaged 22 the study site in closest proximity to the location is site 6 which during the same 5 year period produced an average r p of 11 however site 6 was categorized as a silty loam site whereas loukili et al 2008 described the site as being a sand loamy sand site site 1 the closest site in the research area to site 6 is categorized overall as a sand site but the mawp layers categorize layers two and four as sand and one and three as loamy sand during the same 5 year period site 1 produced an average r p of 26 comparable to the 22 produced by loukili et al 2008 at sites with groundwater influence the recharge discharge rates varied the sandy loam and silty clay sites averaged discharge with the largest discharge observed at the silty clay site the sand and loam sites averaged recharge with both sites differing in recharge by only 3 mm year standard deviations for the sites were high up to 117 mm year at the sand site therefore no clear trend was observed between soil textures at sites with groundwater influence groundwater levels often rose high within the model domain at times above ground level when this occurred the water surface rose above the node that recorded recharge discharge and reported a large amount of discharge resulting in surface runoff therefore recharge discharge rates are influenced by groundwater levels more than the soil texture at sites with groundwater influence since the initial recommendation of the methods employed and determination of recharge in this research was for the unsaturated zone where groundwater levels were far below the model domain with no influence on soil water fluxes an alternate method of recharge estimation such as water table fluctuation may be more appropriate to better predict true recharge and discharge rates when groundwater is present near the ground surface while the calibration and validation years had soil moisture data to initialize the model historical years did not therefore initial moisture contents for historical years were an average of the moisture contents in the calibration and validation years likely resulting in inaccurate estimations additionally the start time of each model began during the spring snowmelt period while attempts were made to start models as the soil began to thaw based on cumulative average daily air temperature comparisons estimates may not have been always accurate and initial snow heights may have missed melting periods these initial snow water equivalent values varied from 0 to 19 5 cm across all sites from 1996 to 2019 environment and climate change canada 2020b soil moisture conditions during freeze up in the fall are indicators for what spring conditions will be the following year while annual precipitation is not a direct indication of fall soil moisture it can provide context for weather variability over the calibration validation and historical years analyzed the overall average precipitation during the 1996 2019 historical years was 400 mm year in 2017 the year the fall freeze up conditions would influence the 2018 spring moisture precipitation totaled only 260 mm year 42 below the average in 2016 the year the fall freeze up conditions would influence the 2017 spring moisture precipitation totaled 512 mm year 25 above average since validation years changed between 2017 and 2018 depending on site data availability initial spring moisture contents varied considering the larger than average precipitation in 2016 influencing 2017 spring conditions and the smaller than average precipitation in 2017 influencing 2018 spring conditions this consideration shows that the initial moisture contents used in calibration and validation years that were averaged and applied to all historical years may be vastly different from true conditions as mentioned previously initial water content was theorized as a factor to have affected the difference between recharge outputted using mawp and eccc data site 5 s validation year was 2017 meaning the higher than average precipitation in 2016 may have been the cause for the initial moisture content being significantly larger than in the calibration year to test the effect the initial moisture content had on recharge in the validation year initial moisture content values from historical years were applied to the validation year leaving the start and end dates as the only difference between the validation and the 2017 historical model in contrast to the previously recorded 15 7 mm year recharge that was recorded when the initial moisture contents were tailored to the 2017 year the new recharge was 1 6 mm year 10 times less and a 14 1 mm year difference for reference the average yearly recharge for site 5 from 1996 to 2019 was only 1 8 mm year excluding the outlier of the validation year initial snow water equivalent values likely affected average difference results as well site 2 which saw a 140 mm year difference in recharge between the calibration and 2019 historical year had initial snow water equivalents that varied by 7 cm when the snow water equivalent value from the historical 2019 year was applied to the calibration year model that difference fell to 77 mm year then when the historical moisture content was applied to the calibration year model in addition to the adjusted snow water equivalent the difference fell to 3 6 mm year the 3 6 mm year difference compared to the previous 140 mm year gives a strong indication of the influence initial water contents and snow water equivalents have on recharge the calculation for depth to groundwater used the ground elevation at the well site not the study site which could produce discrepancies in results due to possible elevation changes between the sites the ground elevation of the groundwater site is within a 10 cm accuracy however at sites 8 10 and 12 using the recorded elevation caused the 100 cm sensor to become submerged within the model and outputting the moisture contents at the maximum saturated water content value when the observed moisture contents showed variations this inconsistency resulted in the need to alter the elevation beyond the 10 cm margin to allow the model to output variations in moisture contents matching the observed during mid season when groundwater levels are relatively consistent and only minimal days of data were missing interpolation was used to fill in gaps however during peak runoff season in the spring or when a large number of days was missing regression analysis was used regression was performed to best estimate missing groundwater level data however there were at times improbable jumps in the groundwater levels when the data source switched between the initial and regression groundwater sites due to the limitations of the general hydrus 1d model code modelling periods spanning the entire 12 months could not be performed due to the frozen conditions observed from november to march of most years hydrus 1d has a freeze thaw code available to model the transport of heat and water through frozen soils which has been successfully used in other work zhao et al 2016 while the code was considered for this work its instability restricted its use the work done by assefa and woodbury 2013 utilized both the general hydrus 1d and freeze thaw code however soil temperatures in the study area did not drop below 0 c and therefore the freeze thaw capabilities were not employed resulting in both the general hydrus 1d and freeze thaw codes producing the same results models limited to less than a one year modelling period restricted the possibility for model spin ups to occur this limitation is what brought on the issues of initial moisture contents and snow water equivalents having large effects on resulting recharge assefa and woodbury 2013 used a 21 year spin up period work by holländer et al 2016 had no spin up but instead initial conditions were estimated using field capacity this initialization technique was acceptable due to the site s local climate in abbotsford british columbia canada however the ada experiences an accumulation of snow during the winter months and the resulting recharge during the spring snowmelt means the field capacity method is not sufficient for initialization if the freeze thaw code can be employed for these models it would improve model validity opening the possibility to multi year modelling and spin ups and take away the negative impacts of moisture content initialization and estimations of start dates which affect initial snow water equivalents 3 3 regional recharge estimate if it is assumed the non modelled soil textures accounting for 8 of total ada area produce the same recharge rates as the finest soil texture modelled sandy clay loam at 16 mm year the average rate of the entire ada considering area covered by each soil texture is 69 mm year if it is assumed the non modelled soil textures produce 0 mm year of recharge the average rate of the entire ada is 68 mm year therefore the 8 of area unaccounted for has a negligible effect on the regional recharge results additionally the average r p of the ada is 14 regardless of whether the 8 missing model results take on the ratio of the sandy clay loam soil texture 1 or assumes 0 taking the conservative average rate of 68 mm year the final recharge rate determined is double render s 1988 estimate of 34 mm year note that render s study was carried out during a distinct drought period in the early 1980s while this study used a longer period from 1996 to 2019 the r p of 14 is larger than the 10 reported by the manitoba water stewardship 2005 the high rates are due to the large portion of the ada that is sandy soil the sand and loamy sand soil textures account for over 50 of the total area in the ada and contribute over 75 of the total annual recharge determined 4 conclusion and recommendations the purpose of this research was to re examine our hydrologic understanding of the assiniboine delta aquifer and create a new estimate for the aquifers recharge rate hydrus 1d was used to model the sites and the rosetta3 pedotransfer function to estimate initial water retention parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity was determined through undisturbed field sample collections and constant head and falling head permeability tests final error metrics showed a positive correlation between observed and simulated moisture contents root mean square error across all sensors averaged 0 034 m3 m3 in the calibration year and 0 051 m3 m3 in the validation year however root mean square error measured over the sensor measurement error indicating additional sources of error recharge across the aquifer was estimated to be 68 mm year the estimate is double what had been previously determined for the aquifer this finding opens the possibility for increasing the limits on water licensing available in the aquifer as mentioned only four of the 13 subbasins in the assiniboine delta aquifer have additional water available for licensing in a highly agricultural region increasing licensing limits can aid local farmers however as mentioned climate change is likely to alter future recharge rates and make the current estimate unreliable a variety of recommendations are suggested to improve on errors and expand on the research performed implementation of the hydrus 1d freeze thaw code is strongly suggested to allow for model spin up and multi year simulations that would enhance the reliability of initial moisture contents snow water equivalents and model start dates that were determined to significantly impact recharge using an alternate method to determine recharge such as isotope tracer or water table fluctuation can verify the results particularly water table fluctuation is recommended due to groundwater influence at several sites performing additional model runs under different climate change scenarios can provide more reliable future

9516,unconfined aquifers are often directly impacted by high irrigation demands therefore accurate recharge estimates are crucial for sustainable groundwater management it is important over time to re examine the existing hydrologic understanding of aquifers taking into account developments in knowledge and changing climate conditions the last in depth study into the assiniboine delta aquifer located in manitoba canada that gave a recharge estimate was conducted in the 1980s render 1988 this work re examined the assiniboine delta aquifer employing new methods and data to estimate recharge rates twelve one dimensional models were created in the software hydrus 1d to model the soil water fluxes in the unsaturated zone to analyze the historic recharge from 1996 to 2019 remote weather station data measured hydraulic conductivity soil texture distribution soil moisture content and soil temperature data were used to initialize and run the models inverse calibration used the measured moisture contents to calibrate the models which resulted in root mean square error in the calibration and validation periods averaging 0 034 and 0 051 m3 m3 respectively above the 0 025 m3 m3 sensor measurement error rough estimates of soil texture distribution across the aquifer was determined to assist in the final recharge estimate the historical regional recharge average was estimated to be 68 mm year double the previous estimate for the aquifer render 1988 modelled periods were limited to less than a year due to limitations in the general hydrus 1d software model code under frozen soil conditions which the assiniboine delta aquifer experiences during the winter months assumptions on initial soil moisture contents snowpack heights and model start dates were best estimated for historical years results show these estimates can have significant impacts on the resulting recharge suggested future work includes implementing the hydrus 1d freeze thaw code to allow for model spin up and multi year simulations to enhance the reliability of model results keywords groundwater recharge hydrus 1d rosetta numerical modeling inverse calibration 1 introduction groundwater is a vital but often overlooked natural resource accounting for 30 of the world s total freshwater the majority of the world s freshwater is locked up in glaciers and icecaps making groundwater the source for 99 of the freshwater that is accessible for human consumption rivera 2014 the remaining 1 of accessible freshwater is surface water a source that is significantly less spatially and temporally available döll 2009 groundwater is estimated to have the highest extraction rate of all raw materials on earth at 982 km3 extracted annually margat and van der gun 2013 however the current rate is unsustainable as it is being extracted faster than what replenishes naturally causing groundwater levels to decline famiglietti 2014 these declining levels are causing alarm in the scientific community due to the looming water scarcity crisis on top of the extraction rates another cause for concern is the effects of global warming and its ability to exacerbate current problems for future generations work done by kundzewicz et al 2007 shows that future climate change projections indicate that the negative impacts on freshwater systems such as increased variability in precipitation will outweigh any benefits scanlon et al 2005 suggest that the reduction in reliability of surface water sources due to climate change will result in further reliance on groundwater sources a study conducted by döll 2009 analyzing potential future climate scenarios and their effect on recharge suggests that a 10 decrease in renewable groundwater resources could be observed by 2050 on over one fifth of the world landmass shallow and unconfined aquifers whose water levels are influenced immediately by local climate conditions will take greater influence from climate change effects apaydin 2010 changnon et al 1988 increasing global temperatures will cause increased evapotranspiration resulting in less soil moisture available to recharge aquifers berg et al 2016 shallow aquifers additionally are often at greater risk for overuse and falling water levels due to the ease at which their supplies are accessible predominantly for agricultural irrigation purposes papadopoulos et al 2021 the irrigation sector is the largest groundwater consumer accounting for 70 of its use worldwide margat and van der gun 2013 to prevent groundwater depletion from occurring the practice of sustainable groundwater management is employed sustainable groundwater management involves implementing strategies and practices to manage groundwater use ensuring quality and quantity are protected indefinitely bruce et al 2009 quantity is measured in terms of groundwater storage the difference between the amount of water recharged and discharged from an aquifer over a given period therefore accurate recharge rates are crucial for sustainable groundwater management in conjunction with information on both natural and man made discharge rates methods commonly employed to determine recharge rates include isotope tracer qian et al 2014 túri et al 2019 water table fluctuation wang et al 2014 healy and cook 2002 and numerical modelling assefa and woodbury 2013 holländer et al 2016 ordens et al 2014 singh et al 2019 unsaturated zone modelling provides estimates of recharge based on drainage below the root zone assuming any water passing the root zone will continue to flow vertically down and reach the water table scanlon et al 2002 calibration is a necessary step in modelling when parameter values are not known directly when calibration is utilized applying a model to meteorological and soil conditions that differ from the calibration period may not provide accurate results seibert 2003 to help overcome this issue using a calibration period that is both wet and dry is the ideal scenario to ensure subsequent model periods perform well moeck et al 2018 even with initial estimates parameters change in time and situation and require calibration to the conditions wallach et al 2013 model spin up is another modelling technique performed in hydrologic modelling scenarios the process allows conditions e g soil moisture content to reach an equilibrium state between simulated fluxes and inputted forcing data cosgrove et al 2003 seck et al 2015 once the equilibrium state is reached the final spin up conditions are used as initial conditions for the subsequent modelling period to ensure responses to forcing data are realistic and accurate assefa and woodbury 2013 used the physically based model code hydrus 1d with the soil hydraulic parameter derivation code rosetta to provide reliable groundwater recharge estimations in the unsaturated zone holländer et al 2016 expanded on this to show how data from a low cost remote sensor weather station combined with data on soil moisture and soil temperature can provide robust recharge estimates using both hydrus 1d and rosetta codes rosetta was developed using soil samples from the usa and europe meaning soil parameter estimations may not be highly accurate for canadian soils and parameter calibration is a necessary step in the modelling process holländer et al 2016 this work aims to create models that accurately predict recharge using remote sensor weather station soil moisture and soil temperature data in the assiniboine delta aquifer ada previous work by holländer et al 2016 was performed in southern abbotsford british columbia canada which experiences different climate conditions compared to the study area for this work annual precipitation in southern abbotsford measures 1507 mm year 1984 2013 holländer et al 2016 three times that of this study area additionally southern abbotsford winters are milder with daily average air temperatures of 3 5 c and 5 0 c in january and february 1981 2010 compared to daily average air temperatures of 15 3 c and 11 8 c for the same months and years in the ada environment and climate change canada 2020a the different climate conditions required significantly different approaches to model setup and initialization due to frozen soils in winter months another differentiation from the work done by holländer et al 2016 is the presence of groundwater at study sites as this work results in both recharge and discharge these variations will test the ability of the methods to perform well under differing climatic and groundwater conditions once created the models will further be run through with historical weather data environment and climate change canada 2020b to predict historical recharge rates from 1996 to 2019 render 1988 estimated recharge in the ada from spring 1983 to spring 1986 the estimate was made with the assumptions of no overland flow and changes in soil moisture approach zero annually changes in groundwater storage were determined from observation well records and surface runoff due to groundwater was estimated from discharge measurements at the upper pine creek the final recharge estimate was 34 mm annually the manitoba water stewardship 2005 estimated that in the ada 85 of precipitation is lost due to evapotranspiration 5 is lost through surface waterways or used for water supply and the remaining 10 recharges the aquifer it is important over time to re examine the existing hydrologic understanding of aquifers advancements in knowledge and information available on aquifers and the surrounding land as well as changing climate conditions can have significant impacts on how we examine aquifers and the resulting conclusions drawn this research will re examine the assiniboine delta aquifer to determine an alternate recharge estimate using new data and employing methods not previously used on the aquifer 2 methodology 2 1 research area the assiniboine delta aquifer is located in southern manitoba s prairie region canada it covers approximately 3885 km2 is unconfined and is characterized by predominantly sandy soils render 1988 the ada water supply is of critical importance due to high irrigation demands for manitoban agricultural purposes particularly potato farming manitoba water stewardship 2005 as of april 2021 the ada has a sustainable yield of 134 7 106 m3 year but allows an allocation limit of 64 7 106 m3 year the amount of water license allocated within the region totals 50 0 106 m3 year leaving only 14 7 106 m3 year available from four out of 13 sub basins within the ada wiseman personal communication april 2021 the manitoba agriculture weather program mawp was established in 2005 to create a network of stations across manitoba to provide real time information on weather data and soil conditions in manitoba s predominantly agricultural regions ojo and manaigre 2021 the network includes 12 stations in and around the ada used in this research labelled as 1 12 fig 1 the climate in the region is characterized as dfb by the köppen geiger classification for cold climate fully humid with warm summers kottek et al 2006 temperatures vary throughout the year the coldest are observed in january with a monthly average of 15 3 c and the warmest are observed in july with a monthly average of 19 5 c the frost free period averages 120 days annually with the last spring frost observed may 20th and the first fall frost september 18th annual average precipitation totals 530 mm with 413 mm of rain and 117 cm of snow equal to 117 mm of precipitation in snow water equivalents 1981 2010 environment and climate change canada 2020a 2 2 data the mawp provided for each site soil textural weather soil moisture and soil temperature data the soil textural data provided was the percentage of sand silt and clay within samples taken at four 10 cm depths in the soil profile the weather data included daily average maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity wind speed radiation and precipitation the soil moisture and soil temperature data were provided daily from sensors placed at 5 20 50 and 100 cm in the soil profile table 1 outlines the observation information for all measured data the daily weather and soil data provided were available from the years 2017 2019 each model was calibrated to one year s data and validated to data from a second year the calibration year used 2019 data because it provided the most consistent data from all four sensors across all sites in 2019 the data was only available up to november 1st however there is often little recharge past that point in time due to the ground beginning to freeze the validation year used 2018 data with some exceptions leading to 2017 data being used a full account of validation data used and reasoning as well as availability of sensor at different depths per site can be found in appendix a weather data was obtained from environment and climate change canada eccc 2020b to determine historical recharge trends including average maximum and minimum air temperatures precipitation wind speed and relative humidity only two eccc sites in proximity to the study area recorded the data required for hydrus 1d and could be used for historical purposes the two sites are positioned in the same location on the map fig 1 as sites 6 and 7 of those two the eccc site in closest proximity to each study site was applied regression analysis was used to estimate missing information between the two sites air temperature wind speed and relative humidity had a positive correlation with r2 values of 0 99 0 83 and 0 91 respectively precipitation had low correlation with an r2 value of 0 48 regression was not used and missing precipitation data was assumed to be zero to allow for conservative recharge estimates at sites 8 12 groundwater level data was provided by the province of manitoba groundwater management 2020 2021 to account for missing groundwater levels regression analysis was performed with groundwater level data from a second well that observed similar groundwater level patterns initial snowpack heights were obtained from eccc 2020b and based on the climate class of the area a snow density of 0 26 g cm3 was applied to obtain snow water equivalents sturm et al 2010 the ml3 theta probe soil moisture sensors used are not reliable below 0 c due to ice being present the sensors rely on the dielectric permittivity of its surrounding to output accurate moisture content readings ice has a permittivity of 3 jiang and wu 2004 opposed to 81 for water archer and wang 1990 the difference in permittivity observed causes the sensors to output incorrect moisture content readings when ice is present additionally the general hydrus 1d model code used does not perform well under frozen conditions while implementing the snow hydrology component zhao et al 2016 therefore each yearly simulation ran beginning in spring as the soil thaws and ending in late fall early winter as the soil freezes for calibration and validation years this date could be identified by observing the days when soil temperatures rose above or below 0 c for historical years these days were determined by comparing cumulative average daily air temperatures to soil temperatures of 0 c at the study sites for all years that data was available a three day average air temperature above 1 75 c best estimated soil temperature rising above 0 c a three day average air temperature below 13 0 c best estimated soil temperature falling below 0 c 2 3 measured and predicted soil hydraulic parameters undisturbed soil samples were taken at sites to determine saturated hydraulic conductivity three sites 1 6 and 11 had been sampled and tested for saturated hydraulic conductivity previously for another project permission was given for those values to be used in this research at all other sites four samples were collected corresponding to the four model depths table 2 however due to site conditions and equipment availability only three samples were collected at sites 2 7 and 10 and only two samples at site 12 at the sites where only three samples could be collected the fourth layer was assigned the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the closest sampled layer for site 12 the two layers with missing samples were assigned the average value of the two sampled layers depending on soil sample permeability either constant head permeability tests were carried out according to astm d2434 19 astm 2006 or falling head permeability tests were carried out according to astm d5084 16a astm 2016 final values were taken as the average of multiple tests on average 6 tests were performed per sample the maximum standard deviation observed was 13 and the average standard deviation across all samples taken directly for this project was 4 for all hydraulic conductivity measurements the values ranged from a minimum of 1 3 cm day recorded at site 12 to a maximum of 1143 cm day recorded at site 1 this agrees with what render 1988 noted that the hydraulic conductivities are highest near the shilo area location of site 1 the average saturated hydraulic conductivity of all samples was 89 cm day pedotransfer functions are a means to take standard soil data and predict complex soil properties which would otherwise be time consuming and costly to determine rosetta is a pedotransfer function that estimates van genuchten mualem water retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity given various inputs of textural class bulk density and or water retention depending on what data is available the newest version rosetta3 was used in this research to estimate mean values of initial water retention parameters residual soil water content θr saturated soil water content θs inverse of the air entry value α and pore size distribution index n as well as accompanying standard deviations zhang and schaap 2017 the input data used was the soil textural class data provided by the mawp 2 4 unsaturated zone modelling 2 4 1 model equations hydrus 1d implements one dimensional flow through the unsaturated zone governed by a modified version of the richards equation that considers the movement of water in only the liquid phase šimůnek et al 2018 the movement of water through the vapour phase plays an important role in arid and semiarid climates due to the dry soil kosmas et al 2001 since the research area is characterized as a fully humid climate the vapour phase was ignored the hydraulic model employed was the van genuchten mualem soil water retention curve model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the presence of snow was accounted for by hydrus 1d s snow hydrology function šimůnek et al 2018 when the air temperature is below 2 c precipitation is in the form of snow when the air temperature is above 2 c precipitation is in the form of liquid rain in between 2 c and 2 c there is a linear relationship between the air temperature and the form of precipitation snow that accumulates at the upper model boundary melts proportional to a snow melting constant of 0 43 cm day c and the daily temperature value a sublimation constant of 0 4 reduces potential evaporation from the snow heat transport within the model was described by the chung and horton thermal conductivity function chung and horton 1987 1 l0 q b1 b2q b3q0 5 where l0 is thermal conductivity mlt3k 1 b1 b2 and b3 are empirical parameters mlt3k 1 and q is the volumetric water content l3l 3 hydrus 1d has a built in selector to input the empirical constants depending on if the soil is represented dominantly by sand loam or clay the feddes root water uptake model was used to simulate the movement of water removed due to vegetation in the area the simulated root water uptake defined by feddes et al 1978 is as follows 2 s h α h sp where s is the volume of water removed from a volume of soil per unit time t 1 sp is the maximum potential root water uptake t 1 and α h is a dimensionless function of the soil water pressure head sites were located in a grassed area as recommended by astm d5111 standard guide for choosing locations and sampling methods to monitor atmospheric deposition at non urban locations astm 2020 therefore the pasture vegetation type was selected which inputs parameter values for pressure heads and transpiration rates in the water stress response function the penman monteith combination equation estimated potential evapotranspiration which requires the input of air temperature wind speed radiation and relative humidity allen et al 1988 hydrus 1d can either use known radiation values or calculate potential radiation the mawp data contained daily radiation values that were used for historical years radiation values were not available from the eccc data and potential radiation was used 2 4 2 soil profile initial and boundary conditions four soil profile layers were created within hydrus 1d corresponding to the four soil texture samples provided by mawp table 2 for all sites the upper boundary condition used was atmospheric bc with surface runoff which allowed the boundary to enact surface runoff should the upper soil layer become saturated for the lower boundary condition either free drainage or variable pressure head was used free drainage is a zero gradient boundary condition used when the water table is below the model domain sites using this boundary condition are categorized as having no groundwater influence variable pressure head is used when the groundwater level is within the model domain and requires the input of groundwater level data sites using this boundary condition are categorized as having groundwater influence initial conditions employed in the models included soil temperature and moisture content every 1 cm in the model domain represented by a single node during calibration and validation when soil temperature and soil moisture were recorded daily on the day the models began the temperature from the four sensors were applied to the nodes at the corresponding depths and in between temperature values were linearly interpolated for the nodes above the 5 cm node values were linearly interpolated between the average air temperature and temperature at the 5 cm sensor for soil moisture during those periods the same principle was applied with exceptions due to the timing of model initialization it is likely that ice was present in the soil and it was observed to have influence on the recorded moisture contents these instances were often identifiable by significant increases in moisture content over a short period of time a few days after the start date the steep moisture content increases were often accompanied by soil temperatures remaining around 0 c and then increasing significantly with the moisture content increase the steep moisture content slope is similar to what was observed by bittelli et al 2003 which the authors identified to be caused by the melting of ice in successively larger pores dissimilarly for bittelli et al 2003 the slopes consistently peaked at 0 c and in this work the peak was at times observed at positive soil temperatures when these inaccurate moisture content readings occurred at initialization the initial soil moisture contents in the models were estimated using best judgement to ensure that the future simulated soil moisture contents matched recorded values once soil temperature rose well above 0 c and reliable soil moisture values were recorded for the historical modelling periods no information was known on initial conditions therefore the initial temperature and soil moisture content were taken as the average of the initial values during the calibration and validation years therefore initial soil temperature and moisture content was the same for a single site across all historical years except for the soil temperature in the first 5 cm which was linearly interpolated between the average of the temperature at the 5 cm in the calibration and validation years and the mean air temperature on the day the models began each historical year to attempt to prevent missing large snow melting periods the initial snowpack height was taken as the maximum measured snow height in the 14 days prior to the model start figs 2 and 3 depict the one dimensional site profiles including the soil textural distribution of each layer represented by the sand s silt si and clay c fractions the initial soil moisture applied to the historical modelled years and the boundary conditions applied it should be noted that the fractions of sand silt and clay were rounded resulting in some layers summation of the three soil types summing to 1 0 01 2 5 soil texture distribution to assist in averaging recharge across the aquifer the soil texture distributions were determined manitoba land initiative maps from the government of manitoba 2002a 2002b 2002c 2002d 2002e 2002f 2002g 2002h 2002i 2002j 2002k 2002l provided soil codes and associated areas within a municipality maps were obtained and combined into one map in qgis qgis org 2021 aquifer boundaries were then delineated to consider only sections within the ada the soil landscapes of canada soil landscapes of canada working group 2010 map was used to assist in converting manitoba soil codes from manitoba land initiative maps to associated soil texture distribution percent sand silt and clay using the soil texture distribution a computer program for soil textural classification triangle gerakis and baer 1999 was used which utilizes the usda textural triangle to determine soil textural class of samples a total of 10 different soil textures were determined to exist within the ada and the percentage of the total area covered by each soil texture was determined the soil textures were sand 35 loamy sand 19 sandy loam 19 loam 17 silty loam 3 sandy clay loam 1 silty clay loam 1 clay loam 7 silty clay 1 and clay 1 render 1988 noted that during their investigation no overland flow was observed suggesting that the majority of water reaches the subsurface additionally the assiniboine delta aquifer management plan manitoba water stewardship 2005 notes that most precipitation both rain and snowmelt infiltrates due to the coarse soil therefore sites with groundwater influence are ignored and only recharge results from sites without groundwater influence are used for regional rates in this research while the majority of soil textures in the ada were represented by modelled sites without groundwater influence four types silty clay loam silt clay clay and clay loam were not which accounted for 8 of the total area of the ada the sites are of finer texture than all modelled sites indicating lower recharge to determine recharge over the entire ada modelled sites were categorized based on their soil textures the recharge rate for each soil texture was the average of all recharge rates of modelled sites without groundwater influence average recharge over the entire ada was taken as the summation of the products of the recharge rate per soil texture and the percentage of area covered in the ada by that soil texture fig 4 depicts the soil texture distribution across the ada each soil texture that was represented by modeled sites is represented by a distinct color the four types that were not accounted for silty clay loam silt clay clay and clay loam as well as any sections that were labelled as unclassified without distinctions of sand silt and clay textural classes are represented as na 2 6 calibration process hydrus 1d s inverse calibration method was employed using the marquardt levenberg optimization algorithm to optimize soil hydraulic parameters using observed and simulated soil moisture content marquardt 1963 šimůnek et al 2018 since the method is a local optimization method rosetta3 was used to re condition the initial estimates two error metrics mean error me and root mean square error rmse were used during the calibration process to minimize the overall error me indicates bias by an average of the difference between measured and observed and gives an indication of over or underestimation jackson et al 2019 rmse measures total error within a sample set that takes greater influence from large errors jackson et al 2019 with both error metrics a value of 0 is desirable and indicates a perfect match between measure and observed 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation as outlined in table 3 the me for both calibration and validation years across all sites showed results around 0 indicating no trend in over or under predicting me was less than 0 025 m3 m3 at 93 of all sensors in the calibration year and 74 of all sensors in the validation year rmse across all sensors averaged 0 034 m3 m3 in the calibration year and 0 051 m3 m3 in the validation year rmse in the calibration year showed 34 of sensors were less than 0 025 m3 m3 and 86 of sensors were less than 0 05 m3 m3 the rmse in the validation year showed 12 of sensors were less than 0 025 m3 m3 and 56 of sensors were less than 0 05 m3 m3 the soil moisture sensors have a measurement rmse of 0 025 m3 m3 in clayey soils ojo et al 2015 while most sites were not clayey clay sites often produce the largest errors rowlandson et al 2013 therefore a measurement error of 0 025 m3 m3 likely encompasses the maximum measurement error for all sites as mentioned only 34 of sensors in the calibration year and 12 of sensors in the validation year had rmse below 0 025 m3 m3 and within the measurement error range therefore the overall errors increased due to inaccuracies in the numerical modelling e g initial moisture contents and the assumptions made on snow height and snow density the rosetta3 standard deviations assisted in the calibration process by creating a reasonable range of parameter values to adjust within particularly helpful because of the local optimization method employed in hydrus 1d in comparing the initial soil parameter estimations to the final parameters several final values were outside of the outputted standard deviations if they gave insufficient comparative moisture contents during calibration across all sites and layers the percentage of final parameter values that fell within 1 2 3 and 4 standard deviations were 21 29 42 and 61 even though measured hydraulic conductivity values were used rather than rosetta3 estimates for comparison purposes the percentage of measured hydraulic conductivity values that fell within 1 2 3 and 4 standard deviations were 15 29 31 and 35 reasons for altering beyond standard deviations included if observed residual water contents fell below the minimum standard deviation outputted the final parameter value was the minimum observed value similarly if saturated water contents rose above the maximum standard deviation outputted from rosetta3 the final parameter value was the maximum observed value the two most common layers where altering parameters beyond standard deviations occurred were the first and fourth layers this is reasonable because the first layer measures only 15 cm below ground where the soil is exposed to freeze thaw cycles during the winter and drought periods during the summer which may alter physical properties the fourth layer applied the outputted parameters from a 10 cm sample to a 135 cm layer which may not have had similar physical properties throughout that matched the 10 cm sample the site with the worst validation error metrics was site 8 which had me of 0 07 and 0 20 m3 m3 and rmse of 0 14 and 0 21 m3 m3 at the 5 and 20 cm sensors one reason could be the installation of new sensors that occurred at this site in 2018 on september 13th 2018 at site 8 the 5 cm sensor showed a 0 18 m3 m3 increase in moisture content the 20 cm sensor showed a 0 18 m3 m3 decrease in moisture content and data became available for 50 and 100 cm sensors when none was available before there was significant rainfall coinciding with these discrepancies which may have caused the 5 cm sensor increase in moisture content but could not create the decrease at the 20 cm sensor this prompt the realization that new sensors were installed alternatively the reason could be the missing peak in moisture content when the model began at the 5 cm sensor around 0 4 0 6 m3 m3 the site is predominantly sand which generally coincides with low water contents in this study inconsistent with the 0 4 0 6 m3 m3 recorded additionally there was no data available for the 50 and 100 cm sensors to determine the conditions below in the ground one possibility is there may have been ice in the soil below the 5 and 20 cm sensors blocking the water from flowing downwards resulting in high moisture contents that the model could not predict for models with no groundwater influence recharge was defined as the summation of the water flux out the bottom boundary of the model at 200 cm depth for models with groundwater influence recharge discharge was defined as the summation of the water flux passing over the 100 cm depth therefore if over an entire model year more water travelled up above the 100 cm node that year was defined as having overall discharged the total summation of water passing over the 100 cm node similarly if over an entire model year more water travelled down below the 100 cm node that year was defined as having overall recharged the total summation of water passing over the 100 cm node the average difference between recharge discharge recorded in calibration and validation years are summarized in table 4 the difference between recharge and discharge of calibration and validation using mawp site specific data and historical data from the closest eccc weather station indicates the validity of using the eccc weather data for historical values this was also reported by holländer et al 2016 sites with no groundwater influence showed better consistency than sites with groundwater influence between the two data sets averaging 20 mm year difference as compared to 50 mm year difference sites with groundwater influence showed no trend in differences between recharge and discharge of calibration and validation using mawp site specific data and historical data from the closest eccc weather station generally for sites with no groundwater influence the pattern showed that coarser soil sites observed larger differences while finer soil sites observed smaller differences however large differences are observed e g a 140 mm year difference at site 2 during validation and possible reasons include initial moisture content estimations and initial snow water equivalent estimations sites with groundwater influence showed larger differences between the recharge estimates using mawp and eccc data e g the loam soil texture saw a 117 mm year difference in the validation year recharge and discharge rates are more prone to variations with slightly varied weather data when groundwater is present this is due to the high soil moisture content near saturation above the groundwater table so that small changes in precipitation and result in large differences in recharge therefore it is less valid to use the eccc weather data for historical values when the location is groundwater impacted 3 2 historical recharge and discharge historical rates were determined from 1996 to 2019 average historical recharge discharge rates as well as recharge to precipitation ratios are presented per soil texture and site type in table 5 seven of the 12 sites had no groundwater influence resulting in recharge only average recharge rates across sites varied from 16 to 124 mm year recharge to precipitation ratios r p ranged from 3 to 27 five of the 12 sites had groundwater influence resulting in recharge and discharge occurring standard deviation values were high for groundwater influence sites as large as 117 mm year for the sand soils due to the model capabilities several years could not run due to groundwater levels rising above ground level resulting in the model being unable to converge discharge would have occurred during these periods which would likely have resulted in higher discharge rates than presented for sites without groundwater influence recharge varied across all sites predominantly the sand site had the highest recharge rates at 124 mm year while the sandy clay loam site had the lowest at 16 mm year overall the recharge based on soil texture followed expected outcomes coarser soil sites sand loamy sand sandy loam exhibited the highest rates while finer soil sites loam sandy clay loam silty loam exhibited the lowest rates therefore sites without groundwater influence showed trends of more recharge observed at coarse soil sites compared to fine in 2008 the model code sabae hw was tested at a site in pine creek north a subbasin of the ada along with software s shaw and class for comparison purposes loukili et al 2008 the models ran from 1999 to 2003 using soil and weather data assessing the long term water budget the r p averaged 22 the study site in closest proximity to the location is site 6 which during the same 5 year period produced an average r p of 11 however site 6 was categorized as a silty loam site whereas loukili et al 2008 described the site as being a sand loamy sand site site 1 the closest site in the research area to site 6 is categorized overall as a sand site but the mawp layers categorize layers two and four as sand and one and three as loamy sand during the same 5 year period site 1 produced an average r p of 26 comparable to the 22 produced by loukili et al 2008 at sites with groundwater influence the recharge discharge rates varied the sandy loam and silty clay sites averaged discharge with the largest discharge observed at the silty clay site the sand and loam sites averaged recharge with both sites differing in recharge by only 3 mm year standard deviations for the sites were high up to 117 mm year at the sand site therefore no clear trend was observed between soil textures at sites with groundwater influence groundwater levels often rose high within the model domain at times above ground level when this occurred the water surface rose above the node that recorded recharge discharge and reported a large amount of discharge resulting in surface runoff therefore recharge discharge rates are influenced by groundwater levels more than the soil texture at sites with groundwater influence since the initial recommendation of the methods employed and determination of recharge in this research was for the unsaturated zone where groundwater levels were far below the model domain with no influence on soil water fluxes an alternate method of recharge estimation such as water table fluctuation may be more appropriate to better predict true recharge and discharge rates when groundwater is present near the ground surface while the calibration and validation years had soil moisture data to initialize the model historical years did not therefore initial moisture contents for historical years were an average of the moisture contents in the calibration and validation years likely resulting in inaccurate estimations additionally the start time of each model began during the spring snowmelt period while attempts were made to start models as the soil began to thaw based on cumulative average daily air temperature comparisons estimates may not have been always accurate and initial snow heights may have missed melting periods these initial snow water equivalent values varied from 0 to 19 5 cm across all sites from 1996 to 2019 environment and climate change canada 2020b soil moisture conditions during freeze up in the fall are indicators for what spring conditions will be the following year while annual precipitation is not a direct indication of fall soil moisture it can provide context for weather variability over the calibration validation and historical years analyzed the overall average precipitation during the 1996 2019 historical years was 400 mm year in 2017 the year the fall freeze up conditions would influence the 2018 spring moisture precipitation totaled only 260 mm year 42 below the average in 2016 the year the fall freeze up conditions would influence the 2017 spring moisture precipitation totaled 512 mm year 25 above average since validation years changed between 2017 and 2018 depending on site data availability initial spring moisture contents varied considering the larger than average precipitation in 2016 influencing 2017 spring conditions and the smaller than average precipitation in 2017 influencing 2018 spring conditions this consideration shows that the initial moisture contents used in calibration and validation years that were averaged and applied to all historical years may be vastly different from true conditions as mentioned previously initial water content was theorized as a factor to have affected the difference between recharge outputted using mawp and eccc data site 5 s validation year was 2017 meaning the higher than average precipitation in 2016 may have been the cause for the initial moisture content being significantly larger than in the calibration year to test the effect the initial moisture content had on recharge in the validation year initial moisture content values from historical years were applied to the validation year leaving the start and end dates as the only difference between the validation and the 2017 historical model in contrast to the previously recorded 15 7 mm year recharge that was recorded when the initial moisture contents were tailored to the 2017 year the new recharge was 1 6 mm year 10 times less and a 14 1 mm year difference for reference the average yearly recharge for site 5 from 1996 to 2019 was only 1 8 mm year excluding the outlier of the validation year initial snow water equivalent values likely affected average difference results as well site 2 which saw a 140 mm year difference in recharge between the calibration and 2019 historical year had initial snow water equivalents that varied by 7 cm when the snow water equivalent value from the historical 2019 year was applied to the calibration year model that difference fell to 77 mm year then when the historical moisture content was applied to the calibration year model in addition to the adjusted snow water equivalent the difference fell to 3 6 mm year the 3 6 mm year difference compared to the previous 140 mm year gives a strong indication of the influence initial water contents and snow water equivalents have on recharge the calculation for depth to groundwater used the ground elevation at the well site not the study site which could produce discrepancies in results due to possible elevation changes between the sites the ground elevation of the groundwater site is within a 10 cm accuracy however at sites 8 10 and 12 using the recorded elevation caused the 100 cm sensor to become submerged within the model and outputting the moisture contents at the maximum saturated water content value when the observed moisture contents showed variations this inconsistency resulted in the need to alter the elevation beyond the 10 cm margin to allow the model to output variations in moisture contents matching the observed during mid season when groundwater levels are relatively consistent and only minimal days of data were missing interpolation was used to fill in gaps however during peak runoff season in the spring or when a large number of days was missing regression analysis was used regression was performed to best estimate missing groundwater level data however there were at times improbable jumps in the groundwater levels when the data source switched between the initial and regression groundwater sites due to the limitations of the general hydrus 1d model code modelling periods spanning the entire 12 months could not be performed due to the frozen conditions observed from november to march of most years hydrus 1d has a freeze thaw code available to model the transport of heat and water through frozen soils which has been successfully used in other work zhao et al 2016 while the code was considered for this work its instability restricted its use the work done by assefa and woodbury 2013 utilized both the general hydrus 1d and freeze thaw code however soil temperatures in the study area did not drop below 0 c and therefore the freeze thaw capabilities were not employed resulting in both the general hydrus 1d and freeze thaw codes producing the same results models limited to less than a one year modelling period restricted the possibility for model spin ups to occur this limitation is what brought on the issues of initial moisture contents and snow water equivalents having large effects on resulting recharge assefa and woodbury 2013 used a 21 year spin up period work by holländer et al 2016 had no spin up but instead initial conditions were estimated using field capacity this initialization technique was acceptable due to the site s local climate in abbotsford british columbia canada however the ada experiences an accumulation of snow during the winter months and the resulting recharge during the spring snowmelt means the field capacity method is not sufficient for initialization if the freeze thaw code can be employed for these models it would improve model validity opening the possibility to multi year modelling and spin ups and take away the negative impacts of moisture content initialization and estimations of start dates which affect initial snow water equivalents 3 3 regional recharge estimate if it is assumed the non modelled soil textures accounting for 8 of total ada area produce the same recharge rates as the finest soil texture modelled sandy clay loam at 16 mm year the average rate of the entire ada considering area covered by each soil texture is 69 mm year if it is assumed the non modelled soil textures produce 0 mm year of recharge the average rate of the entire ada is 68 mm year therefore the 8 of area unaccounted for has a negligible effect on the regional recharge results additionally the average r p of the ada is 14 regardless of whether the 8 missing model results take on the ratio of the sandy clay loam soil texture 1 or assumes 0 taking the conservative average rate of 68 mm year the final recharge rate determined is double render s 1988 estimate of 34 mm year note that render s study was carried out during a distinct drought period in the early 1980s while this study used a longer period from 1996 to 2019 the r p of 14 is larger than the 10 reported by the manitoba water stewardship 2005 the high rates are due to the large portion of the ada that is sandy soil the sand and loamy sand soil textures account for over 50 of the total area in the ada and contribute over 75 of the total annual recharge determined 4 conclusion and recommendations the purpose of this research was to re examine our hydrologic understanding of the assiniboine delta aquifer and create a new estimate for the aquifers recharge rate hydrus 1d was used to model the sites and the rosetta3 pedotransfer function to estimate initial water retention parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity was determined through undisturbed field sample collections and constant head and falling head permeability tests final error metrics showed a positive correlation between observed and simulated moisture contents root mean square error across all sensors averaged 0 034 m3 m3 in the calibration year and 0 051 m3 m3 in the validation year however root mean square error measured over the sensor measurement error indicating additional sources of error recharge across the aquifer was estimated to be 68 mm year the estimate is double what had been previously determined for the aquifer this finding opens the possibility for increasing the limits on water licensing available in the aquifer as mentioned only four of the 13 subbasins in the assiniboine delta aquifer have additional water available for licensing in a highly agricultural region increasing licensing limits can aid local farmers however as mentioned climate change is likely to alter future recharge rates and make the current estimate unreliable a variety of recommendations are suggested to improve on errors and expand on the research performed implementation of the hydrus 1d freeze thaw code is strongly suggested to allow for model spin up and multi year simulations that would enhance the reliability of initial moisture contents snow water equivalents and model start dates that were determined to significantly impact recharge using an alternate method to determine recharge such as isotope tracer or water table fluctuation can verify the results particularly water table fluctuation is recommended due to groundwater influence at several sites performing additional model runs under different climate change scenarios can provide more reliable future

9517,concerns over water contamination have prompted a review of the hazards posed by waterborne contaminants the use of wastewater irrigated wheat grains and the rate of water irrigation to the crops is a crucial aspect that includes comprehensive approach covering both human and environmental health although water usage enormously depends on spatial factor such as geographic location but long term consumption of grains grown in contaminated soil may surpass permissible intake of essential elements therefore this study was conducted in randomly selected districts of punjab pakistan to assess the zinc zn content in water soil and in various parts of cereal crop wheat triticum aestivum l during two consecutive growing seasons the present study estimated significant concentration of zn range between 0 83 µg l to 0 93 µg l in various water regimes which was minimum in groundwater therefore highest zn concentration in iww irrigated soil was recorded during the second cropping season with value of 42 33 mg kg however pli and baf were estimated less than 1 the zn concentration in roots shoot and grain was ranging in decreasing range of 30 70 35 99 mg kg 23 96 25 53 mg kg and 3 32 7 49 mg kg respectively from current study we can conclude that usage of wastewater in specific proportion to freshwater did not cause any harmful effects and therefore it s safe to reduce chemical fertilizer cost however further investigations are recommended to revealed physiological and molecular aspects keywords bioaccumulation heavy metal health risk load index pollution zinc

in plants shukla et al 2021 the healthy lives of the people consuming the plants and vegetables cultivated in contaminated land are at risk the food affected by heavy metals is primary marker of a violation of safety of food and superiority the food affected due to heavy metals has harmful influence on health of humans it may reduce several vital elements presents in body of human which leads to different health hazards like decrease in immunological defense capacity a high occurrence of upper gastrointestinal cancer disability associated to malnutrition and prenatal development retardation and reduced psychological capacities arora et al 2008 heavy metal becomes poisonous when its concentration surpasses a certain threshold otherwise it is harmless to plants and animals in plants and animal cells some elements called like cu mn ni zn co and mn klaus j 2010 micronutrients or trace elements have important functions zinc plays significant role in human body metabolism cellular functioning and homeostasis thereby considered as multipurpose essential element to protect against stress in organisms chasapis et al 2020 if the zn content exceeds the allowable limits it may become poisonous to animals and also to plants otherwise it is an essential mineral the permissible limit for zn in water according to who criteria is 5 mg l however in plants the suggested range of zinc is 50 mg kg shah et al 2011 zinc controls the activity of enzymes such as cu zn superoxide dismutase metallo proteinase and carbonic anhydrase it also regulates the expression of various genes mishra et al 2014 this study was intended to investigate the toxicity level of zn in soil water and plant uptake with possible human health risk assessment specifically we have chosen wheat as main cereal crop and being cultivated around punjab province we assessed possible contamination risk and health hazards to human beings by evaluating bioaccumulation translocation and bioconcentration factors with plant uptake we demonstrated that how different wastewater regimes could be used for agriculture irrigation purposes to minimise summed up cost of chemical fertilizers used in agriculture

fluctuated as 0 05 0 11 in diverse types of samples table 13 except for watan the maximum tf for zn was identified for 5 varieties watered through industrial water for cropping years 1 and 2 in both years the lowest was seen for ground water applied it was also observed for ground water applied varieties sehar 2006 and galaxy 2013 3 9 bio concentration factor zn values of bcf varied as 0 08 0 18 table 14 highest bioconcentration factor of zn found in whole cultivated by work water in the 1st time and 2 apart from watan and the lower value were suggested in all five varieties grown in ground water for 2nd year 3 10 enrichment factor statistics revealed the ef of zn in various wheat varieties was varying to some extent by the supply of water irrigation enrichment factor of zn fluctuated as 0 03 0 08 table 15 greater concentration of ef for zn was noticed in varieties faislabad 2008 and punjab 2011 crop through industrial water in two different years the lowest enrichment factor for zn were investigated in diversity punjab 2011 with ground water and also identified in sehar 2006 faislabad 2008 galaxy and watan 2013 cultivated via ground water in 2nd year 3 11 daily intake of metal data discovered the dim for zn was not too much affected by water application resources and year daily intake for zn varied from 0 01 to 0 03 table 16 the minimum daily intake for zn was noticed in all the five varieties applied through ground water in 1st year and maximum was studied in every grown by mess and industrialized water in two years 3 12 health risk index the maximum health risk index of zn observed in varieties faislabad 2008 watan and punjab 2011 cropped via ground water in 1st year and of whole types cultivated by ground water in 2nd year and lesser were noticed in whole mixture applied by way of ground water in 2nd year and also for values of faisalabad and watan in 1st year the hri for zn via ingestion of wheat grains range from 0 05 to 0 11 table 17 4 discussion 4 1 water all types of water samples used for application of wheat in 2 crop year comprising the elevated concentration of zn as compared to the value 1 59 µg l investigated via chaoua et al 2018 in samples of wastewater the zn contents in complete samples of water were observed maximum from result of khan et al 2017a 2017b gave minor zn concentration 7 23 1 25 µg l in gw and mww whole specimens showed the higher zn range than safer limit 2 µg l suggested by who fao 2007 and usepa 2010 mostly zn enters the water resources through artificial pathways which include the by products of coal fired power stations burning of waste material and steel production zinc is the main component of most of the fertilizers and may every into the ground water reservoir zn is applied in the industrialization of brass as a protective covering for steel and products of iron in rubber and paint manufacture in tyres in the form of zinc oxide and in makeup nhmrc 2004 the excessive use of fertilizers and the manufacturing of other zinc containing products increase the zn level in ground water reservoir due to the ever growing which might be the possible reason of higher zn concentration in water 4 2 soil in present work the value of zn in different forms of samples of soil was established less from the findings 129 08 134 61 mg kg of xiao rui et al 2016 in current research zn contents were found lower in various soil samples than range 620 640 mg kg of zn concentration in soils applied with sewage water as suggested by nadia and roshdy 2018 khan et al 2017a 2017b evaluated minimum zn concentrations 1 09 1 55 mg kg of sample of soil cultivated with canal and wastewater zinc value in top soil varieties was checked inferior than the highest allowable limits 300 600 200 mg kg reported by usepa 2010 application with industrial and sewage water resulted the concentration of trace minerals in farming clay soils more however food crops which grown up in sludge water applied soil continuously remove the metals of trace minerals in deeper layer of soil is the main reason of low heavy metal concentration than the maximum permissible limit 44 19 mg kg singh et al 2010 manzeke et al 2019 4 3 root range of zn 39 51 mg kg in roots given by yu et al 2019 was in the series of present result zinc values for every form of root sample were found lesser from those 68 28 mg kg chaoua et al 2018 described elevated application 47 mg kg of zn in roots as compared to present research amount of zn in all samples were studied higher than those 10 32 mg kg given by asdeo 2014 it has been identified that domestic sewage and storm water run off are the main resource of various metals especially cu pb and zn icon 2001 4 4 shoot kobaissi et al 2014 reported zn amount 25 2 mg kg in shoot specimens flourished by canal water while similar to present study while the zn content 29 mg kg were investigated higher for sample which grown in manure water xiao rui et al 2016 and asdeo 2014 suggested the lower zn value 14 45 mg kg for stem lower zn contents 8 24 mg kg were observed by aydin et al 2015 in shoot samples applied with wastewater heavy metals like zn copper and cd mainly moved through business discharge which then combined with the acid rain and this industrial discharge is used for application process this might be cause of greater contents of these nutrients in diverse plant parts schindler et al 1980 steinnes 1990 zia et al 2020 4 5 grains zinc was observed for lower range in all samples as compared to the values 65 3 47 5 mg kg respectively resulted by rattan et al 2005 in grains zinc standards for all of specimens was found upper than those values 1 71 2 17 mg kg recommended by khan et al 2017a 2017b in cereals of canal and waste water because of permanent practice of sludge water for irrigating agronomical crops the soil gets heavily build up with heavy metals like zn cr hg cu etc which are then uptaken by the plants at large quantity even if their concentration is lower in the irrigating water rattan et al 2002 zinc concentrations were falling contained by the acceptable range 99 4 mg kg as given by fao who 2001 zn percentage relocate from loamy soil to different parts of the wheat were in following order soil to root root shoot shoot grain 4 6 pollution load index concentration 1 03 1 14 of pli for zinc given by ahmad et al 2014 1 3 was established superior in contrast to current research while bibi et al 2014 reported lower values at two different sites 0 14 0 13 all treatments gave the pli 1 the reported lower value of zn might be due to the fact that wastewater was not applied in water purpose meant for an elongated period it is expected that after 50 100 years of wastewater irrigation certain heavy metal contents in soil would revery the current thresholds for environmental concern smith et al 1997 4 7 bio accumulation factor alrawiq et al 2014 0 29 0 19 and alghobar and suresha 2016 0 45 0 29 investigated the lower baf for zn in ground and sewage water specimens respectively as compared to recent work whole samples in current work revealed baf less than 1 this revealed that zn was not stored in the shoot but only absorbed by plant several features such as physiological anatomical and biological factors are occupied in division and accrual for trace metals in upper flora constituents salt et al 1995 4 8 translocation factor the higher tf was reported by asdeo 2014 0 23 and wang et al 2015 0 21 rattan et al 2005 also investigated higher tf 22 6 18 3 in sludge and ground water samples respectively as compared to current investigation specimens showed the tf of zn less than 1 that explained less mobility of zn plant age part of plant also affects the buildup of heavy minerals liu et al 2007 4 9 bio concentration factor khan et al 2017a 2017b presented top bcf 1 57 1 40 for zn in earth and manure water samples in contrast from above experiment range for bcf for zn 0 46 0 50 in different varieties of wheat reported by jamali et al 2009 was found higher xiao rui et al 2016 also suggested the higher 0 28 bcf for zn plant species mainly determined the zn mobility within the plants and it also depended upon the nutrition status it has been observed that zn is mostly found in high quantity in roots and leaves kabata pendias and mukherjee 2007 4 10 enrichment factor higher ef 2 42 was studied by singh et al 2010a 2010b as compared from current effort ahmad et al 2017 investigated higher ef 2 24 3 34 for ground and wastewater applied samples many soil parameters vary greatly in various types of soils which affect the phyto availability of zn soil zn contents were significantly influenced by the factors such as agricultural practices smith 1971 4 11 daily intake of metal concentration of dim for zn given by khan et al 2018 in canal and wastewater types 0 009 0 01 mg kg day respectively was found just similar to present study daily intake value 0 11 mg kg day for zn explained by wang et al 2015 was found higher all the samples had the daily intake value for zn lower from daily permissible range 60 mg kg reviewed by fao who 2007 4 12 health risk index all the above mentioned samples gave the higher zn range of hri as compared to value 0 005 of singh et al 2010a 2010b khan et al 2018 recorded maximum hri 3 04 3 65 for zn in two types of water samples value of health risk index 0 08 for zn investigated by ahmad et al 2017 in ground water sample was found within the range of our study while the value 0 14 given for wastewater applied sample was established upper from new study health risk index of all specimens were noticed below 1 it suggested that there was no zn toxicity by the consumption of these grains 4 13 conclusion recommendations we assessed concentration of zn in different wheat genotypes and in there soil under different waste and freshwater regimes thereby hri pli and baf were 1 and under safe limit suggesting no public or individual health risk due to zn contamination with wheat grain consumption however in root and shoot the concentration was higher than usual with possible threats to consume as fodder crop nevertheless processed wastewater could enhance crop yield and reduces chemical fertilizer cost however further investigations are hereby recommended to reveal physiological mechanisms behind

9517,concerns over water contamination have prompted a review of the hazards posed by waterborne contaminants the use of wastewater irrigated wheat grains and the rate of water irrigation to the crops is a crucial aspect that includes comprehensive approach covering both human and environmental health although water usage enormously depends on spatial factor such as geographic location but long term consumption of grains grown in contaminated soil may surpass permissible intake of essential elements therefore this study was conducted in randomly selected districts of punjab pakistan to assess the zinc zn content in water soil and in various parts of cereal crop wheat triticum aestivum l during two consecutive growing seasons the present study estimated significant concentration of zn range between 0 83 µg l to 0 93 µg l in various water regimes which was minimum in groundwater therefore highest zn concentration in iww irrigated soil was recorded during the second cropping season with value of 42 33 mg kg however pli and baf were estimated less than 1 the zn concentration in roots shoot and grain was ranging in decreasing range of 30 70 35 99 mg kg 23 96 25 53 mg kg and 3 32 7 49 mg kg respectively from current study we can conclude that usage of wastewater in specific proportion to freshwater did not cause any harmful effects and therefore it s safe to reduce chemical fertilizer cost however further investigations are recommended to revealed physiological and molecular aspects keywords bioaccumulation heavy metal health risk load index pollution zinc element 1 introduction because of the rapid expansion of urban and industrial areas the twentieth century has produced a considerable amount of wastewater containing harmful compounds wastewater follows the same way as irrigation water and it is used because of organic stuff and nutrient contents on the other hand sewage water contains poisonous material in excess ping et al 2011 in irrigation wastewater poses two major risks first it degrades the soil s beneficial features and second poisonous compounds are conveyed to the crops as a result food safety regulations are jeopardised khan et al 2018 various research concludes that collection of heavy toxic metals in plants could pose a health hazard to humans chauhan and chauhan 2014 alghobar and suresha 2017 to determine level of health many health indices such as d dim tf and hri are utilized by heavy metals chaoua et al 2018 some trace metals like zinc cadmium lead and copper are mostly found as pollutants in plants shukla et al 2021 the healthy lives of the people consuming the plants and vegetables cultivated in contaminated land are at risk the food affected by heavy metals is primary marker of a violation of safety of food and superiority the food affected due to heavy metals has harmful influence on health of humans it may reduce several vital elements presents in body of human which leads to different health hazards like decrease in immunological defense capacity a high occurrence of upper gastrointestinal cancer disability associated to malnutrition and prenatal development retardation and reduced psychological capacities arora et al 2008 heavy metal becomes poisonous when its concentration surpasses a certain threshold otherwise it is harmless to plants and animals in plants and animal cells some elements called like cu mn ni zn co and mn klaus j 2010 micronutrients or trace elements have important functions zinc plays significant role in human body metabolism cellular functioning and homeostasis thereby considered as multipurpose essential element to protect against stress in organisms chasapis et al 2020 if the zn content exceeds the allowable limits it may become poisonous to animals and also to plants otherwise it is an essential mineral the permissible limit for zn in water according to who criteria is 5 mg l however in plants the suggested range of zinc is 50 mg kg shah et al 2011 zinc controls the activity of enzymes such as cu zn superoxide dismutase metallo proteinase and carbonic anhydrase it also regulates the expression of various genes mishra et al 2014 this study was intended to investigate the toxicity level of zn in soil water and plant uptake with possible human health risk assessment specifically we have chosen wheat as main cereal crop and being cultivated around punjab province we assessed possible contamination risk and health hazards to human beings by evaluating bioaccumulation translocation and bioconcentration factors with plant uptake we demonstrated that how different wastewater regimes could be used for agriculture irrigation purposes to minimise summed up cost of chemical fertilizers used in agriculture sector in near future to the best of our knowledge this is first ever local regional based study in pakistan which constrained health risk and offered solution to biofertilizer use in agriculture sector 2 material and methods 2 1 study area seven districts faisalabad chiniot kasur sargodha gujranwala bhakkar and gujrat of punjab pakistan were selected for research wheat grains shoots roots water and soil being sampled from sewage ground and industrialized water applied field s wheat of various kinds in each district all the composite samples from selected districts were combined into one composite replicate and four samples were replicated these four samples one from each type of water resource were combined to generate a composite sample all of the sampling was completed over the course of two growth seasons 2017 2018 2 2 sampling methodology the randomized complete block design was used for sampling rcbd one variable in rcbd is always dependent on another variable continuously one quantity interacts among other crop year with different collection locations demonstrating the rcbd in present work samples of soil root shoot and grains were obtained by every plot in every region for every assortment for all form of water supply and combined into one composite sample all of the composite samples from the seven districts were combined into a single replication for every cultivar four replicates of soils grains shoot root samples were prepared for every one resource of water during the harvest season samples were taken water samples from every district s resource were gathered and combined into a single merged trial samples of whole districts were combined into a single replication for every sort of water resource four duplicates were created 2 3

that domestic sewage and storm water run off are the main resource of various metals especially cu pb and zn icon 2001 4 4 shoot kobaissi et al 2014 reported zn amount 25 2 mg kg in shoot specimens flourished by canal water while similar to present study while the zn content 29 mg kg were investigated higher for sample which grown in manure water xiao rui et al 2016 and asdeo 2014 suggested the lower zn value 14 45 mg kg for stem lower zn contents 8 24 mg kg were observed by aydin et al 2015 in shoot samples applied with wastewater heavy metals like zn copper and cd mainly moved through business discharge which then combined with the acid rain and this industrial discharge is used for application process this might be cause of greater contents of these nutrients in diverse plant parts schindler et al 1980 steinnes 1990 zia et al 2020 4 5 grains zinc was observed for lower range in all samples as compared to the values 65 3 47 5 mg kg respectively resulted by rattan et al 2005 in grains zinc standards for all of specimens was found upper than those values 1 71 2 17 mg kg recommended by khan et al 2017a 2017b in cereals of canal and waste water because of permanent practice of sludge water for irrigating agronomical crops the soil gets heavily build up with heavy metals like zn cr hg cu etc which are then uptaken by the plants at large quantity even if their concentration is lower in the irrigating water rattan et al 2002 zinc concentrations were falling contained by the acceptable range 99 4 mg kg as given by fao who 2001 zn percentage relocate from loamy soil to different parts of the wheat were in following order soil to root root shoot shoot grain 4 6 pollution load index concentration 1 03 1 14 of pli for zinc given by ahmad et al 2014 1 3 was established superior in contrast to current research while bibi et al 2014 reported lower values at two different sites 0 14 0 13 all treatments gave the pli 1 the reported lower value of zn might be due to the fact that wastewater was not applied in water purpose meant for an elongated period it is expected that after 50 100 years of wastewater irrigation certain heavy metal contents in soil would revery the current thresholds for environmental concern smith et al 1997 4 7 bio accumulation factor alrawiq et al 2014 0 29 0 19 and alghobar and suresha 2016 0 45 0 29 investigated the lower baf for zn in ground and sewage water specimens respectively as compared to recent work whole samples in current work revealed baf less than 1 this revealed that zn was not stored in the shoot but only absorbed by plant several features such as physiological anatomical and biological factors are occupied in division and accrual for trace metals in upper flora constituents salt et al 1995 4 8 translocation factor the higher tf was reported by asdeo 2014 0 23 and wang et al 2015 0 21 rattan et al 2005 also investigated higher tf 22 6 18 3 in sludge and ground water samples respectively as compared to current investigation specimens showed the tf of zn less than 1 that explained less mobility of zn plant age part of plant also affects the buildup of heavy minerals liu et al 2007 4 9 bio concentration factor khan et al 2017a 2017b presented top bcf 1 57 1 40 for zn in earth and manure water samples in contrast from above experiment range for bcf for zn 0 46 0 50 in different varieties of wheat reported by jamali et al 2009 was found higher xiao rui et al 2016 also suggested the higher 0 28 bcf for zn plant species mainly determined the zn mobility within the plants and it also depended upon the nutrition status it has been observed that zn is mostly found in high quantity in roots and leaves kabata pendias and mukherjee 2007 4 10 enrichment factor higher ef 2 42 was studied by singh et al 2010a 2010b as compared from current effort ahmad et al 2017 investigated higher ef 2 24 3 34 for ground and wastewater applied samples many soil parameters vary greatly in various types of soils which affect the phyto availability of zn soil zn contents were significantly influenced by the factors such as agricultural practices smith 1971 4 11 daily intake of metal concentration of dim for zn given by khan et al 2018 in canal and wastewater types 0 009 0 01 mg kg day respectively was found just similar to present study daily intake value 0 11 mg kg day for zn explained by wang et al 2015 was found higher all the samples had the daily intake value for zn lower from daily permissible range 60 mg kg reviewed by fao who 2007 4 12 health risk index all the above mentioned samples gave the higher zn range of hri as compared to value 0 005 of singh et al 2010a 2010b khan et al 2018 recorded maximum hri 3 04 3 65 for zn in two types of water samples value of health risk index 0 08 for zn investigated by ahmad et al 2017 in ground water sample was found within the range of our study while the value 0 14 given for wastewater applied sample was established upper from new study health risk index of all specimens were noticed below 1 it suggested that there was no zn toxicity by the consumption of these grains 4 13 conclusion recommendations we assessed concentration of zn in different wheat genotypes and in there soil under different waste and freshwater regimes thereby hri pli and baf were 1 and under safe limit suggesting no public or individual health risk due to zn contamination with wheat grain consumption however in root and shoot the concentration was higher than usual with possible threats to consume as fodder crop nevertheless processed wastewater could enhance crop yield and reduces chemical fertilizer cost however further investigations are hereby recommended to reveal physiological mechanisms behind

9518,there is lack of research data and knowledge that can be transferable to producers their advisors and managers in terms of dynamic relationships of soybean glycine max l merr yield crop evapotranspiration etc crop water productivity cwp with respect to irrigation water applied seeding rate and irrigation vs etc relationships these dynamics were investigated relative to five seeding rates 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 under full irrigation treatment fit limited irrigation 75 fit and 50 fit and rainfed rainfed treatment had the highest soil water depletion followed by 50 fit 75 fit and fit no clear trend of soil water depletion was observed due to seeding rates in 75 fit and fit highest yield was observed with 308 750 seeds ha 1 seeding rate yield plateaued at 4 3 tons ha 1 and no further yield increase was observed with increasing seeding rate beyond 308 750 seeds ha 1 while etc differed significantly p 0 05 due to irrigation treatments and seeding rates etc was affected more by the irrigation levels than the seeding rates etc ranged from 460 mm for rainfed treatment to 489 mm for fit under the lowest seeding rate 247 000 seeds ha 1 in 2014 and from 308 mm for rainfed under highest seeding rate 432 250 seeds ha 1 to 395 mm for fit under 308 750 seeds ha 1 in 2015 etc exhibited a linear response to irrigation and yield irrigation vs etc slopes indicate that for every 25 4 mm increase in irrigation application etc can increase between 5 8 mm and 17 3 mm depending on the seeding rates the highest weekly etc of 62 mm in 2014 and 44 mm in 2015 was recorded for the same seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 iwp was highest 0 96 kg m 3 for 247 000 seeds ha 1 under 75 fit in both seasons the highest cwp of 0 93 kg m 3 was obtained with the 308 750 seeds ha 1 in both 75 fit and fit in 2014 while the highest cwp of 1 25 kg m 3 was measured for fit under 432 250 seeds ha 1 in 2015 further long term research is suggested to investigate the potential differences in physiological and phenological parameters growth etc water productivity yield and yield response factors under different seeding rates for different soybean varieties under different irrigation levels and methods keywords planting density soil water content water productivity subsurface drip irrigation limited irrigation water stress 1 introduction the rising demand and competition for world s increasingly scarce water supplies is evident and has become one of the major challenges in ensuring global food security it is projected that agriculture will need to produce 60 more food globally and 100 more in developing countries by 2050 alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 from same or lesser land area to feed the increasing population which is expected to exceed 8 billion by 2025 therefore it is paramount to find ways to increase the production and its efficiency in a sustainable manner from limited resources through development of improved crop production technologies and effective management of water in agriculture although increases in crop production have resulted from improved hybrids varieties that are tolerant to drought weed management better fertilizers etc timely irrigation management along with proper crop and soil management practices especially in areas with limited water supplies and substantial variability in rainfall distributions and amounts remains one of the most critical factors affecting yields according to the usda nass 2019 there were 22 62 million ha of irrigated land area in the u s in 2018 increasing irrigated land area to meet growing population s food and fiber needs requires efficient methods of water distribution and use in the field research has shown that subsurface drip irrigation sdi results in high yielding crops and substantial reductions in withdrawal of irrigation water and reduced surface soil evaporation if the system is properly designed installed operated and maintained irmak et al 2014 therefore proper implementation of irrigation management strategies and technologies that can result in significant reduction in irrigation water withdrawals increase in irrigation water use efficiency and energy savings need to be implemented in large scale production fields to achieve aforementioned improvements in crop water productivity cwp irmak et al 2012 soybean glycine max l merrill is one of the vital grain crops for humans and accounts for almost 60 of the world s oilseed production with u s being the second largest soybean producer after brazil soystats 2019 in the u s soybean is grown primarily in central and eastern parts and most of the production is concentrated in the midwestern region in many parts of the world including u s and midwestern states there has been a growing concern about the long term sustainability of irrigated agriculture due to groundwater depletion as well as water quality issues scanlon et al 2012 in view of growing constraints on water and limited land availability the need to maximize the yield per unit of water has been gaining significant attention thus it is imperative to develop local and current water yield relationships to understand the response of soybean under limited water conditions including under different seeding rates so that the information data and knowledge can be developed and transferred to the producers to help them in their management practices to enhance productivity water stress is one of the major yield limiting factors in soybean production in many parts of the world and the soybean productivity response to different levels of water stress under different seeding rates and irrigation levels are not well understood in the absence of weed and disease pressure nutrient deficiency and other stresses the amount of yield reduction due to water stress depends on the phenological stage duration and intensity of water shortage climate soil and crop management and other factors some studies have examined the susceptibility of soybean to water stress during various development stages i e vegetative flowering pod formation and seed filling earlier pioneering work by hiler et al 1974 doss et al 1974 sionit and kramer 1977 ashley and ethridge 1978 and reicosky and heatherly 1990 found that the vegetative stages are less sensitive to water stress than the reproductive growth stages and some reproductive growth stages may be more vulnerable than others in contrast griffin et al 1985 found that higher yields resulted from full season irrigation and any stress prior to flowering was detrimental there were mixed notions about the effect of water stress and irrigation scheduling on yield as well cases of similar yields for full irrigation and irrigation initiated at flowering ashley and ethridge 1978 higher yields for irrigation during vegetative growth or at bloom stage than pod fill stage elmore et al 1988 and higher yields with irrigation from mid pod elongation to seed enlargement kadhem et al 1985 have been reported another study by kron et al 2008 indicated that water stress during v4 stage increases the tolerance of plant towards water shortage in later stages when subjected to water stress during flower formation shorter flowering periods were observed sionit and kramer 1977 korte et al 1983 while water stress during seed filling stage accelerate senescence and shorten the seed filling period that cause yield reduction by reducing seed size and seed number souza et al 1996 these effects cannot be halted by eliminating the stress after a short period and can have greater negative effects on yield and seed size than the continuously stressed plants brevedan and egli 2003 usually water stressed plants achieved earlier maturity while higher plant heights increased lodging increased yields and cooler canopies were observed in plants receiving full irrigation during the entire season in general the ability of soybean plant to compensate for water stress decreases and potential degree of yield reduction increases as the plant growth stage progress from r1 i e beginning bloom through r5 i e seed enlargement the most current research suggests that delaying irrigation until r3 stage and practicing full irrigation thereafter can result in similar or greater productivity in soybean grown on silt loam soils irmak et al 2014 they reported higher yield for treatments in which irrigations were delayed until r3 than the fully irrigated control treatment there is a need for more detailed and site specific research to determine the right amount of irrigation water to be applied to obtain optimum yields for making the most optimum use of irrigation water for local climatic and management conditions that can result in invaluable data information and knowledge transfer especially there is a significant knowledge gap in terms of yield etc and water productivity response to full and limited irrigation under different seeding rates accurate quantification of crop water use crop evapotranspiration etc is also required to obtain optimum yields as well as for effective management of within season water resources and it is a vital component of overall efforts in enhancing crop productivity and production efficiency soybean seasonal etc may vary substantially from one place to another and even in the same region over different growing seasons due to changes in weather conditions for instance payero et al 2005 reported etc value of 585 mm during 2004 in a semi arid climate and irmak et al 2013 reported seasonal etc values of 535 mm and 514 mm during 2007 and 2008 growing seasons respectively for subsurface drip irrigated sdi soybean in a transition zone between sub humid and semi arid climates kanemasu et al 1976 reported soybean seasonal etc of 651 mm during 1974 growing season in kansas usa hattendorf et al 1988 reported soybean seasonal etc values of 591 mm and 491 mm for manhattan and tribune in kansas respectively seasonal crop water use amounts for soybean were reported between 450 and 700 mm by doorenbos and kassam 1979 another major factor in soybean production is the seeding rate required for optimum yields because seed cost has become a significant input cost accounting for about 36 4 of total operating costs soystats 2019 the optimum plant population for soybean varies for different varieties and environments hanway and harvey 1967 increasing seeding rate may result in an increase in yields to a point until asymptotic yield is reached diminishing return and thereafter no yield increase is observed with increasing plant population because of increased plant competition for light water nutrients etc historically higher seeding rates have been recommended to suppress weeds however today with advances in planters effective weed management and improved accuracy of seed placement ensure good stand establishment and higher plant populations may not be necessary in many cases soybean plant can compensate for different plant populations and adjust growth and development by producing branches and more pods per plant at low plant population carpenter and board 1997 and fewer branches and pods per plant at high plant population high plant population results in quicker canopy closure resulting in greater light interception lower weed competition taller plants and smaller stalks but it leads to increased competition for water and nutrients may promote lodging and adds to seed costs weber et al 1966 in low plant population each plant can have higher leaf area captures more sunlight and can have shorter height with large stalks and lower pod set while producing competitive yields thus any reduction in seeding rate without affecting yield can enhance profitability aforementioned studies did not quantify how yield and productivity may vary with different soybean seeding rates under different irrigation levels including limited irrigation while limited irrigation strategy may result in some yield penalty and the magnitude of this yield penalty can depend on numerous environmental and management factors limited irrigation can increase cwp especially in water limiting areas where practicing full irrigation management may not be possible due to moratoriums and other restrictions in these cases it is imperative that the yield cwp and etc response to different seeding rates be determined to provide information data and strategies to producers to aid them to make better informed decisions in such conditions it is also evident that water and yield relationships vary substantially with locations climate and soil and water management there is a knowledge gap in soybean etc yield iwp and cwp response to different seeding rates the specific objectives of this research were to i quantify and evaluate etc seed yield iwp and cwp and ii investigate the relationships between irrigation vs etc under five different soybean seeding rates and four irrigation levels under sdi 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site and experimental design field experiments were conducted in the irmak research laboratory irl at the university of nebraska lincoln unl south central agricultural laboratory scal located at latitude 40 34 n and longitude 98 08 w and at an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level near clay center nebraska during 2014 and 2015 growing seasons the research site is located in the transition zone between sub humid and semi arid climate zones with the mean annual precipitation of 731 mm mean annual temperature of 10 3 c and mean annual snowfall of 381 mm the timing and magnitude of precipitation vary significantly not only year to year but also within the growing season requiring supplemental irrigation the research site has hastings silt loam soil which is well drained upland soil fine montmorillonitic mesic udic argiustoll having a 0 5 slope with particle size distribution of 15 sand 62 5 silt 20 clay and 2 5 organic matter content in the topsoil irmak 2010 the soil has field capacity of 0 34 m3 m 3 permanent wilting point of 0 14 m3 m 3 saturation point of 0 51 m3 m 3 and the effective root depth of soybean during mid season is 0 90 1 20 m irmak 2010 the experimental field was 4 45 ha and was irrigated using a sub surface drip irrigation sdi system that was installed in 2005 by senior author s irmak the use of sdi system results in minimum surface soil evaporation due to no surface soil wetting because of irrigation the 1 52 m spaced sdi laterals were centered between every other pair of ridge tilled rows at a depth of approximately 0 40 m below the soil surface the emitter spacing on the sdi laterals was 0 45 m with the pressure compensated emitters that had a 1 0 lt hr discharge rate netafim usa fresno california usa the timing and amount of water applied in this sdi field was scheduled using soil water content data as measured using a neutron attenuation method the field was maintained as a ridge till during both growing seasons the experimental design was a completely randomized block design with three replications fig 1 each replication plot was 122 m long and 6 1 m wide i e 8 plant rows with a 0 76 m row spacing and north south planting direction each treatment consisting of a combination of seeding rate and irrigation level was randomly assigned to the plots and replications throughout the research field five different soybean seeding rates were deployed 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 and four irrigation treatments that consisted full irrigation treatment fit 75 fit 50 fit and non irrigated rainfed treatment were evaluated thus each seeding rate was subjected to each irrigation treatment resulting in a total of 20 treatments in the experiment during both seasons there was adequate soil moisture early in the season for planting and crop germination due to dormant season snowmelt and or rainfall and the soil water is usually at the field capacity at the research site 2 2 agronomic management practices the soybean cultivar pioneer 92y83 with a relative maturity of 2 8 was planted on may 28 2014 emerged on june 6 2014 and was harvested on october 2 2014 the same cultivar was planted on may 13 2015 and plants emerged on may 26 2015 unfortunately the plants were damaged by heavy rainstorm on june 3 2015 therefore field was replanted on june 9 plants emerged on june 15 and harvested on october 2 2015 in both years the planting depth was 0 03 0 04 m with north south planting direction agronomic management information including planting emergence harvesting weed control and amount and date of fertilizer applications for both growing seasons are presented in table 1 irrigation applications were managed based on fit such that irrigation timings and amounts were practiced for maintaining soil water between about 45 and 90 of total available water to prevent water stress and accommodate soil water storage capacity for potential precipitation the soil moisture data were collected on a weekly basis at soil depths of 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 0 90 1 20 and 1 20 1 50 m from the surface using a neutron probe soil moisture meter model 4302 troxler electronics laboratories inc n c to determine irrigation timings and amounts the neutron probe access tubes were installed in two replications of each treatment total of 40 tubes the tubes were installed on the plant row in the middle of the two healthy plants as there was enough moisture in the soil profile early in the growing season for growth and germination of plants no irrigation was applied at the beginning of the season for plant germination irrigation did not commence until soybean pod stage r3 which is characterized by presence of 4 5 mm long pods at one of the four uppermost main stem nodes that have a fully developed leaf at this stage soybean is considered to be very sensitive to water stress moreover in deep silt loam soils if soil is near field capacity at planting it is suggested that soybean can sustain on stored soil water until pod development stage without much impact on yield specht et al 1989 which can heavily depend on soil management and climatic conditions and can vary between the locations regions total irrigation application amounts in 2014 were 0 20 3 30 5 and 40 6 mm for rainfed 50 fit 75 fit and fit treatments respectively in 2015 total amount of irrigation water applied was 0 51 76 and 102 mm under rainfed 50 fit 75 fit and fit treatments respectively the amounts differed considerably between the two years because 2014 growing season was much wetter than 2015 season 2 3 seasonal crop evapotranspiration etc a general soil water balance approach was used to calculate weekly and seasonal etc as 1 etc p i u r d δsws where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm u is upward soil moisture flux mm assumed zero because the groundwater depth is approximately 33 m below the surface irmak 2010 r is run off mm d is deep percolation from the crop root zone mm and δsws change in soil water storage in the soil profile mm from the beginning to the end of the growing season therefore the equation to calculate seasonal etc is reduced to 2 etc p i r d δsws when solving the soil water balance equation for etc r d and δsws were determined for each treatment individually rather than calculation field average values precipitation data were obtained from weather station located at the research site which was part of high plains regional climate center hprcc weather network http www hprcc unl edu irrigation amounts were the actual irrigation depths applied to each treatment the surface run off from each treatment was calculated using the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs curve number method usda nrcs 1985 based on the experimental site s hydrologic soil group land use treatment and hydrologic condition the curve numbers were estimated as 59 8 78 and 89 1 for dry normal and wet conditions respectively deep percolation was calculated using a daily water balance computer program written in microsoft visual basic bryant et al 1992 payero et al 2009 djaman and irmak 2012 inputs to the program include weather variables such as daily air temperature incoming shortwave radiation relative humidity wind speed rainfall irrigation dates and amounts information initial water content in the soil profile at crop emergence and crop and site specific information such as planting date crop maturity date soil parameters and maximum rooting depth irmak 2015a 2015b 2 4 iwp cwp and statistical analysis besides applying right amount of irrigation water at the right time it is also necessary to ensure how efficiently this water is delivered to the crops and its effect on crop growth and yield productivity performance this performance can be quantified by different performance indices one of which is the irrigation water productivity iwp which is defined as the ratio of difference between irrigated and rainfed crop yield to applied depth of irrigation water iwp is an important indicator to assess irrigation and crop yield relationships as inadequate irrigation application can result in crop water stress yield reduction as well as waste of water and energy resources soybean yield was determined by harvesting each plot and adjusting the weight of threshed seed to standard seed moisture content of 13 the final yield was expressed in ton ha 1 to distinguish the role of irrigation efficiency in terms of physical irrigation water delivery to the production field and its distribution within the field which generally refers to it as irrigation efficiency from crop water productivity irrigation water productivity iwp was calculated as the ratio of differences between irrigated and rainfed yield over the amount of applied irrigation as 3 iwp y i y r i i where iwp is expressed as kg m 3 y is seed yield g m 2 and i i is applied irrigation water mm and subscript i represents the irrigation level and subscript r representing the treatment with no seasonal irrigation rainfed additionally cwp fernández et al 2020 was computed as the ratio of grain yield to etc 4 cwp y etc where cwp is expressed as kg m 3 y is grain yield g m 2 and etc is in mm physically cwp is governed solely by transpiration since it is difficult to partition transpiration and evaporation from the soil surface practically evapotranspiration is used in defining cwp at the field level higher cwp leads to either same production from less water resources or increased production from similar water resources fernández et al 2020 provided a novel overview of the use of water use efficiency and cwp they addressed the rational use of the cwp approach for the irrigator to improve both biophysical and economic water productivity at the field scale they stated that the term efficiency accounts for a dimensionless ratio of the total amount of water used to the total amount of water applied the term productivity refers to the ratio between the product produced vs the input used this is aligned with the concept of cwp term introduced by molden 1997 which has been gaining acceptance in the scientific literature fernández et al 2020 thus cwp instead of crop water use efficiency is used in this research following fernández et al 2020 the proc glimmix procedure of sas version 9 3 sas institute inc cary nc was used for data analyses for both growing seasons treatments seeding rates irrigation amounts and years were considered as fixed effects while replications were considered as random effect in the statistical analyses due to significant year by treatment interaction data of both years were presented separately when the anova indicated treatment effects were significant means were separated at α 0 05 and fisher s protected least significant differences lsd test was conducted in addition to anova coefficient of determination r2 and standard deviation were used to evaluate the performance and differences among treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather trends during 2014 and 2015 growing seasons weather data were obtained from an automated weather station located at the research site average daily and monthly patterns of some of the main climatic variables precipitation mean air temperature relative humidity incoming shortwave radiation vapor pressure deficit and wind speed during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons are presented in figs 2 and 3 and table 2 as compared to long term average the total precipitation from june to september was 23 and 6 higher than long term averages during 2014 and 2015 respectively the seasonal total precipitation may 1 to october 31 was 525 mm in 2014 and 533 mm in 2015 with a long term 1983 2013 average of 495 mm at the research site however cumulative precipitation from planting to harvest during 2014 was much greater than 2015 growing season the 2014 growing season was comparatively wetter than 2015 growing season total seasonal precipitation from planting to harvest was 447 mm in 2014 and 211 mm in 2015 in 2014 june and august were the wettest months with total above normal precipitation of 167 mm and 173 mm which accounts for 37 2 and 38 7 of the total rainfall received in 2014 respectively the highest rainfall event of 44 mm that occurred on 74 dap marked the end of irrigation applications about 40 of the total precipitation in 2015 was received early in the june high precipitation of 85 mm in june and 55 mm in july was received in 2015 and lesser rainfall later in the water intensive stages therefore more irrigation events were scheduled in 2015 8 irrigation events during low rainfall period from august 4 to september 12 corresponding to r3 5 to r6 5 56 dap to 95 dap soybean growth stages as compared with 2014 growing season 4 irrigation events in july and august coinciding with r3 and r4 62 dap to 72 dap growth stages the average air temperature tavg for june july august and september major portion of the growing season was 5 5 higher and vapor pressure deficit vpd was 11 1 higher in 2015 than in 2014 growing season while the incoming shortwave radiation rs wind speed at 2 m height u2 average relative humidity rh and precipitation were 9 7 8 9 1 9 and 51 greater in 2014 than in 2015 the 2015 growing season june september with mean temperature of 22 c was warmer by 1 2 c than 2014 20 8 c the highest maximum air temperature tmax and lowest wind speeds was observed during july and august during both growing seasons average rh of 76 9 in 2014 was slightly higher than in 2015 75 5 the highest rh occurred in august reproductive stages during both growing seasons the highest rs occurred in june and july during both growing seasons as well as in long term trend maximum average value of vpd was measured in july 0 99 kpa which decreased in the later months however in 2015 vpd was highest in september 1 07 kpa and slightly lower in july 0 98 kpa resulting in high evaporative demands in major water intensive stages overall higher u2 precipitation and rs were observed in 2014 growing season but higher tavg and vpd during 2015 had an impact on soybean growth and development in terms of growing season length and yield warmer temperatures and higher evaporative demands in 2015 resulted in slightly earlier physiological maturity of soybean and shorter growing season length in 2015 115 days than in 2014 127 days 3 2 seasonal soil water balance variables the seasonal soil water balance variables are summarized in table 8 the total seasonal irrigation amount applied in 2015 102 mm applied to fit was greater by 60 than in 2014 41 mm applied to fit growing season due to 53 lesser precipitation in 2015 211 mm than in 2014 447 mm some of the high precipitation events over the growing season resulted in surface run off and deep percolation in all the treatments during both growing seasons in 2014 the total run off was estimated at about 9 mm in irrigated treatments and negligible 0 50 mm in the rainfed treatments because of the high rainfall event of 44 mm that occurred 73 dap while irrigation had already been commenced 62 dap in 2015 a negligible amount 2 mm of run off was determined early in the growing season before commencement of irrigation during 2014 season 23 mm of water was lost to deep percolation from all treatments due to heavy rainfall events occurring at the emergence time during june in 2015 approximately 34 mm of dp from almost all treatments in the early season and the maximum dp of about 43 mm was determined in fit with lowest seeding rate the same or very similar run off and deep percolation values reported in table 8 for different seeding rates are a combination of artifact of nrcs curve number method as well as minimal differences in rainfall received and initial soil water conditions between the treatments total soil water stored in the soil profile and weekly change in the soil moisture as measured by neutron attenuation gauge for all treatments during both seasons are presented in figs 4 and 5 the highest soil moisture depletion occurred in the rainfed treatments and the least in the fit in mostly all the seeding rates in both years there were similar trends in soil water change in respective treatments between the growing seasons there was a relatively uniformly distributed soil water between the soil layers in the soil profile due to pre planting rainfall hence the total available soil water was highest early in the growing season decreased gradually and coincided with management allowable depletion mad on august 8 2014 thereafter total available water remained above the mad throughout the growing season in most treatments except in 247 000 seeds ha 1 with 50 fit the small differences in root zone soil moisture content due to irrigation treatments were observed starting in august the second soil layer 0 30 0 60 m exhibited maximum water content in all treatments for most of the growing season this is due to presence of drip lines at 0 40 m below the soil surface for delivering irrigation water due to large amount of rainfall in 2014 60 lesser irrigation water was required as compared with 2015 growing season the least soil water depletion occurred in the 0 90 1 20 m and 1 20 1 50 m soil layers in 2014 overall when averaged over all seeding rates soil water depletion starting from the first soil moisture measurements until the end of growing season was highest in rainfed treatment 61 mm reducing gradually in 50 fit 55 mm 75 fit 43 mm and the lowest in fit 42 mm however when averaged over irrigation amounts the differences for water depletion among different seeding rates had a narrow range varying from 54 mm for 247 000 seeds ha 1 to 47 mm for 370 500 seeds ha 1 indicating no clear trend in soil water due to seeding rates in 2015 growing season the soil water content at the beginning of the growing season when first soil moisture reading was taken in all treatments and all soil layers was mostly similar indicating a uniform start of the experiment in terms of soil water the soil moisture started declining in all treatments after mid july when soybean plants were at r1 stage which marks the onset of most water intensive stages in soybean growth cycle similar to 2014 greater soil water was available in the early growing season in 2015 and decreased with the progression of the soybean growth cycle however total available soil water was depleted beyond the mad resulting in stress in some of the seeding rates treatments the maximum depletion of soil water occurred in seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 while the minimum depletion was observed in 175 000 seeds ha 1 compared to 2014 more soil water depletion occurred in 2015 therefore the response of treatments to increasing irrigation amounts was observed to be stronger in 2015 under rainfed conditions water content at the end of the growing season in second soil layer 0 30 0 60 m declined from almost 100 mm for the lowest seeding rate to 88 mm for the highest seeding rate this is most likely due to interplant competition among soybean plants in higher seeding rates for water and nutrients which caused water stress water extraction in the later growth stages also occurred from deeper soil layers up to 1 20 m while water content in the deepest soil layer of 1 50 m remained nearly constant for all treatments the greatest soil water depletion occurred in the top 0 0 30 m soil layer in all treatments because of surface evaporation plant root water uptake as well as due to no surface wetting occurring due to subsurface source of irrigation moreover as the seeding rate increased the water extraction took place from deeper layers as well in most of the treatments because of soybean root penetration deep into the soil in water stress conditions overall in 2015 when total soil water depletion in the plant root zone was averaged for different seeding rates rainfed treatment had the highest depletion of 130 mm followed by 50 fit with 114 mm 75 fit with 94 mm and lowest in fit with 58 mm when averaged over irrigation treatments the highest water depletion was observed in seeding rate of 308 500 seeds ha 1 with 114 mm and lowest in 432 250 seeds ha 1 with 83 mm water depleted similar to 2014 no clear trend of water depletion was observed due to seeding rates 3 3 impact of seasonal irrigation amounts on grain yield the statistical analyses of grain yields measured for all five seeding rates 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 for all irrigation levels in both seasons 2014 and 2015 growing seasons are presented in tables 3 5 the relationships between grain yield and applied irrigation for individual seeding rates as well as pooled data for all treatments are presented in fig 6 soybean yield varied from 4 42 to 4 77 tons ha 1 for rainfed treatments and from 4 31 to 4 87 tons ha 1 for irrigated treatments in 2014 in 2015 yields varied from 3 47 to 3 85 tons ha 1 under rainfed treatment and from 3 97 to 4 70 tons ha 1 under irrigated treatments in 2014 the grain yields ranged from 4 31 tons ha 1 to 4 87 tons ha 1 statistically the seeding rates and irrigation treatments did not have significant p 0 05 impact on grain yield numerically under rainfed conditions highest yield of 4 8 tons ha 1 was obtained for lowest population of 185 250 seeds ha 1 which was 7 4 3 0 5 7 and 7 2 greater than higher seeding rates of 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 respectively highest seeding rates of 432 250 seeds ha 1 had the second lowest grain yield of 4 43 tons ha 1 under rainfed conditions after 4 42 tons ha 1 yield measured in 247 000 seeds ha 1 this may be attributed to the fact that the interplant competition among higher seeding rate plots for water and nutrients may had an impact on soybean yield similar trend was observed in 50 fit in which highest yield of 4 85 tons ha 1 was obtained with the lowest seeding rate of 185 250 seeds ha 1 which was 9 2 6 2 6 5 and 8 4 greater than seeding rates of 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 respectively in both 75 fit and fit highest yield was observed for seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 which was 10 9 1 9 10 6 and 5 4 higher in 75 fit and 7 6 2 7 10 5 and 5 2 in fit than seeding rates of 185 000 247 000 l 370 000 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 respectively in general the maximum seed yield of 4 87 tons ha 1 was measured for seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 under fit however the range of variation in yield was small in 2014 due to high precipitation in 2015 statistically significant p 0 05 differences in yields were observed for irrigation treatments however no significant yield differences occurred for different seeding rates or two way interaction seeding rate x irrigation seed yield increased with irrigation and varied from 3 47 tons ha 1 for the rainfed treatment to 4 70 tons ha 1 for the fit treatment under rainfed conditions seed yield ranged from 3 47 tons ha 1 to 3 85 tons ha 1 highest yield of 3 85 tons ha 1 was recorded for 247 000 seeds ha 1 and lowest yield of 3 47 tons ha 1 was obtained with 308 750 seeds ha 1 treatment for 50 fit the seed yield ranged from 3 97 tons ha 1 to 4 32 tons ha 1 also similar yields with slight variation of 4 3 tons ha 1 for 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 and 4 tons ha 1 for 185 250 and 247 000 seeds ha 1 was recorded this suggests that yield plateau was obtained at 4 3 tons ha 1 and no further yield increase was observed with increase in seeding rates beyond 308 750 seeds ha 1 which supports duncan s 1986 postulate that seed yields continue to increase with increase in planting density to a limit that is above that needed to intercept all the light for 75 fit seed yield ranged from 4 2 to 4 42 tons ha 1 with the highest yield being for 308 750 seeds ha 1 and lowest yield of 4 2 tons ha 1 for 370 500 seeds ha 1 under fit seed yield ranged from 4 17 to 4 70 tons ha 1 with lowest yield 4 2 tons ha 1 for 185 250 seeds ha 1 and highest yield for 308 750 4 65 tons ha 1 and 432 250 4 7 tons ha 1 seeds ha 1 overall seed yield averaged across five seeding rates was highest for fit 4 44 tons ha 1 which is 17 6 6 and 2 6 higher than rainfed 50 fit and 75 fit therefore it is likely that the supplementary irrigation water applied at appropriate intervals was able to prevent crop water stress resulting in higher yields with increase in irrigation amounts in drier year of 2015 the seed yield and irrigation amounts relationships were explained with quadratic model for all seeding rates in both seasons the pooled data for all seeding rates in 2014 showed that yield response to irrigation was very weak r2 0 02 this may be due to availability of adequate water in the beginning of the season and above normal rainfall in august when soybean was in pod elongation and seed filling stage which are at the most water intensive and sensitive stages however individual seeding rates exhibited stronger correlations except for the lowest seeding rate of 185 250 seeds ha 1 r2 0 44 in general seed yield showed decreasing trend with irrigation for seeding rates of 185 250 seeds ha 1 and 370 500 seeds ha 1 and increasing trend for seeding rates of 247 000 308 750 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 in 2014 growing season overall irrigation had little impact on seed yield in 2014 however in 2015 increasing trend was observed for seed yield with increase in irrigation amounts for all seeding rates each 25 4 mm increase in irrigation increased the yield by 0 313 0 126 0 433 0 261 and 0 262 ton ha 1 beyond the intercept for seeding rates of 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 respectively in 2015 irmak et al 2014 reported similar results as they also obtained quadratic relationship between seed yield and seasonal irrigation amounts for the same research location they also reported a weak correlation for wetter year 2008 r2 0 21 and stronger correlation for dry year 2007 r2 0 82 they reported seed yield increase of 0 323 tons ha 1 with each incremental increase of 25 4 mm of irrigation for seeding density of 388 000 seeds ha 1 while we obtained higher yield increase of 0 433 tons ha 1 for seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 soybean yield increased with irrigation amounts from 3 7 tons ha 1 for rainfed treatment to 4 44 tons ha 1 for fully irrigated treatments when averaged over all seeding rates in 2015 while there was no appreciable yield difference due to irrigation treatments in 2014 in general seeding rates did not have significant impact on grain yield there was no significant interaction between seeding rates and irrigation treatments in both growing seasons harvest plant populations for maximum yields were reported to be as low as 157 300 plants ha 1 to 211 800 plants ha 1 for 76 cm row spacing bruin and pedersen 2008 highest seeding rate of 790 737 seeds ha 1 had lower yield relative to the lowest seeding rate of 395 368 seeds ha 1 for determinate cultivars ablett et al 1991 optimum yields have been reported for plant stands as low as 70 000 seeds ha 1 egli 1988 or as high as 388 000 oplinger and philbrook 1992 seeds ha 1 other studies indicated final plant populations from 250 000 to 350 000 seeds ha 1 are sufficient to obtain maximum yields elmore 1998 3 4 irrigation water productivity iwp iwp in 2015 ranged from 0 08 kg m 3 under 50 fit for seeding rate of 432 250 seeds ha 1 to 0 96 kg m 3 under 75 fit for seeding rate of 247 000 seeds ha 1 in 2014 and from 0 22 kg m 3 under 50 fit for seeding rate of 247 000 seeds ha 1 to 1 48 kg m 3 under 75 fit for seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 in 2015 higher iwp values in 2015 as compared with those obtained in 2014 resulted from higher precipitation in 2014 which was approximately 53 more than in 2015 growing season interestingly iwp was lower in fit than other irrigation treatments for most of the seeding rates in 2015 for example in lowest seeding rate of 185 250 seeds ha 1 iwp was recorded as 0 76 kg m 3 and 0 93 kg m 3 under 50 fit and 75 fit respectively as compared with 0 54 kg m 3 in fit highest iwp of 1 48 kg m 3 occurred in seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 under 50 fit due to wet conditions in 2014 rainfed treatments had slightly higher yield than the irrigation treatments therefore iwp was not calculated for some treatments table 3 irmak et al 2014 obtained higher iwp values in dry 2007 0 515 1 035 kg m 3 growing season than in 2008 0 051 0 292 kg m 3 and the highest iwp 1 035 kg m 3 value was obtained for delay irrigation until r3 irrigation treatment the overall range of iwp under 50 fit was as low as 0 22 kg m 3 and as high as 1 48 kg m 3 under 75 fit it ranged from 0 57 kg m 3 to 1 14 kg m 3 and under fit it ranged from 0 38 kg m 3 to 1 05 kg m 3 in 2015 these findings are between values for iwp ranging from 0 48 to 1 02 for irrigation started at flowering as reported by garcia et al 2010 in georgia differences can be attributed to difference in cultivar maturity group amount and method of irrigation water application climate management conditions and other factors garcia et al 2010 reported that when full season irrigation was applied to soybean crop in a humid region iwp varied from 0 55 kg m 3 for maturity group mg v to 1 14 kg m 3 for mg vi and when irrigation started at flowering iwp varied from 0 48 kg m 3 for mg v to 1 02 kg m 3 for mg vi under lateral move irrigation system in general iwp increases with increase in yield and decreases with increase in amount of irrigation water applied depending on the weather conditions this can be validated by the results presented by irmak et al 2014 who observed linear increase in iwp with increase in yield especially in dry year r2 0 62 3 5 treatment effects on seasonal etc the total amount of irrigation water applied to fit 75 fit and 50 fit was 41 31 and 21 mm in 2014 and 102 76 and 51 mm in 2015 respectively all irrigation applications were commenced at r3 stage of soybean which marks the onset of water intensive stages in soybean growth cycle due to tendency of unexpected rainfall events early in the season the irrigation applications scheduled before r3 stage could be rendered ineffective the 2014 growing season was wet for most of the periods except a small dry period from 50 dap to 72 dap when no rainfall event occurred the r3 stage started during this dry period i e 61 dap therefore four irrigation events were scheduled starting from 62 dap until 72 dap statistically there were significant differences in seasonal etc between both 2014 and 2015 years p 0 05 as presented in table 6 therefore data for seasonal etc were analyzed separately for each year and presented in table 7 no significant differences were observed for the seeding rate x irrigation amount seeding rate x year seeding rate x irrigation amount x year interactions in 2014 similar seasonal etc was observed in rainfed 50 fit and 75 fit while the seasonal etc was significantly higher than rainfed under 75 fit but was similar to 50 fit the range of seasonal etc was very narrow in 2014 growing season thus most of the treatments did not experience water stress throughout the growing season as evident in fig 4 resulting in narrow seasonal etc range and similar yields during 2014 growing season doss and thurlow 1974 reported that soybean yields are influenced more by irrigation and variety than by row width and seeding rate the three seeding rates 107 600 215 300 and 322 900 plants ha 1 did not have any significant effect at p 0 05 in their study in 2015 seasonal etc amounts were similar for rainfed 50 fit and 75 fit while they were significantly different from fit p 0 05 the lowest seasonal etc amount occurred in rainfed due to water stress and reduced transpiration rates the highest seasonal etc occurred under 75 fit which may be due to differences in seeding rates seasonal etc amounts for all treatments during 2014 and 2015 growing seasons are presented in table 8 in 2014 the lowest and highest seasonal etc values were 460 mm for rainfed treatment and 489 mm for fit respectively under the same seeding rate of 247 000 seeds ha 1 however in 2015 etc values ranged from 308 mm for rainfed treatment under highest seeding rate of 432 250 seeds ha 1 to 395 mm for fit under 308 750 seeds ha 1 the narrow range of etc 29 mm was observed in 2014 while the seasonal etc values were higher for all treatments than in 2015 higher etc values in 2014 were due to longer growing season i e 127 days as compared with 115 days in 2015 higher magnitudes of precipitation solar radiation and wind speed as well as earlier planting date however the range of etc values was wider i e 87 mm in 2015 as compared with 2014 growing season the average etc for all treatments was 472 mm in 2014 and 348 mm in 2015 growing season when averaged over all irrigation treatments including rainfed etc values were 469 478 469 472 and 472 mm in 2014 and 349 344 364 354 and 320 mm in 2015 for the for seeding rates of 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 respectively in 2014 the minimum etc values were greater in fit t4 by 2 7 t5 2 7 t10 and 2 5 t3 and maximum etc values were greater in fit t8 by 3 t1 1 t6 and 1 9 t7 than in rainfed 50 fit and 75 fit respectively the range of etc was 461 474 mm in 185 250 seeds ha 1 460 489 mm in 247 000 seeds ha 1 460 476 mm in 308 750 seeds ha 1 462 485 mm in 370 500 seeds ha 1 and 463 485 mm in 432 250 seeds ha 1 the observed etc trend was not similar between the two growing seasons seasonal etc may vary widely due to differences in weather conditions and the total water available to the crop payero et al 2005 reported etc amounts in the range of 261 541 mm in 2002 262 498 mm in 2003 and 388 506 mm in 2004 irmak et al 2014 reported higher etc in the range of 452 601 mm during 2007 and 473 579 mm in 2008 3 6 irrigation vs seasonal etc the relationship between total irrigation amounts and seasonal etc for each seeding rate as well as pooled data for each year are presented in fig 7 a linear response of seasonal etc to increasing irrigation amounts is generally explained by a linear function irmak et al 2014 the pooled data for 2014 and 2015 growing seasons indicate weak linear relationships with r2 0 25 in 2014 and r2 0 42 in 2015 due to differences in seeding rates some of the individual seeding rates exhibited stronger response to irrigation which vary depending on the amount of water in soil profile during early planting and the amount of water extracted from the soil profile throughout the growing season in 2014 there was a more uniform temporal distribution of rainfall and the treatments did not experience any water stress as the available water was never below the mad except in 247 000 seeds ha 1 fig 4 interestingly due to higher water stress the seeding rate of 247 000 seeds ha 1 showed a good linear response to increasing irrigation amounts with r2 0 84 the response of etc to seasonal irrigation amounts was similar to the trend in total water available in the root zone lesser the total available water or more the depletion in the root zone stronger is the response of etc to seasonal irrigation the slopes of regression line between seasonal etc and irrigation of 0 14 0 68 0 23 0 34 and 0 40 mm were measured for seeding rates of 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 with positive intercepts of 472 463 464 464 and 463 mm respectively the negative slope was observed in lowest seeding rate because of higher etc in the rainfed treatment the slope values excluding the negative slope indicate that for every 25 4 mm increase in irrigation application the etc can increase in the range of 5 8 17 3 mm depending on the seeding rates in 2015 growing season the response of etc to seasonal irrigation amounts was stronger than that observed in 2014 which varied among seeding rates the stronger response could be attributed to the fact that 2015 was drier than 2014 and had higher vapor pressure deficits the strongest linear response r2 0 82 to increasing irrigation was observed in seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 and the weakest response was in the highest seeding rate of 432 250 seeds ha 1 r2 0 32 the slopes of linear regression lines indicated that with every 25 4 mm increase in irrigation application the etc increased in the range of 6 1 17 3 mm which is similar to the range in 2014 growing season irmak et al 2014 reported that every 25 4 mm increase in irrigation increased etc by 25 6 mm when averaged for 2007 and 2008 growing seasons at the same site which is higher than that obtained in this research this could be attributed to varying weather conditions like changes in vpd air temperature and the length of growing season moreover variation in seeding rates can affect evaporation from the soil surface due to varying canopy shading areas 3 7 grain yield vs seasonal etc the response of grain yield to seasonal etc for the irrigation and rainfed treatments for each seeding rate are presented in fig 8 the relationship between grain yield and etc is usually explained by a linear function payero et al 2005 djaman and irmak 2012 and the slope of grain yield production function indicates the amount of grain yield produced per unit of water used in 2014 etc range was 460 474 mm in the rainfed treatments for all seeding rates the lowest etc 460 mm was recorded for highest seeding rate of 247 000 seeds ha 1 having a yield of 4 44 tons ha 1 while the highest etc 474 mm was measured for the lowest seeding rate of 185 250 seeds ha 1 having a yield of 4 80 tons ha 1 in the fit the etc range was measured between 473 mm and 489 mm the lowest seeding rate of 185 250 seeds ha 1 had the lowest value of etc 473 mm and yield of 4 40 tons ha 1 the highest amount of etc 489 mm was recorded for 247 000 seeds ha 1 that had a yield of 4 70 tons ha 1 however the highest grain yield of 4 90 tons ha 1 was recorded for 308 750 seeds ha 1 with etc value of 476 mm the slopes of regression line between grain yield and etc for all seeding rates were in the range of 0 003 and 0 0205 tons ha 1 indicating an increase in grain yield from 0 01 to 0 52 tons ha 1 for every 25 4 mm of etc beyond the intercept the response of grain yield and etc was very weak in all seeding rates except in 308 750 r2 0 92 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 r2 0 60 having greater slopes of 0 0205 and 0 0137 tons ha 1 respectively the pooled dataset indicates a slope of 0 005 ton ha 1 beyond the intercept that would generate yield increase of 0 13 ton ha 1 for every 25 4 mm of etc in 2015 growing season the range of etc was between 308 and 332 mm in rainfed treatments for all seeding rates the minimum etc amount of 308 mm was recorded for the highest seeding rate 432 250 seeds ha 1 with yield of 3 72 tons ha 1 and maximum etc of 332 mm was observed in 308 750 seeds ha 1 having yield of 3 49 tons ha 1 the maximum etc of 332 389 and 395 having yield of 3 49 4 45 and 4 68 tons ha 1 were observed under rainfed 75 fit and fit respectively for seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 the slope of pooled grain yield vs etc data indicates a weak linear relationship r2 0 47 however the individual responses of seeding rates were stronger than the pooled data with r2 of 0 84 0 57 0 65 0 62 and 0 65 for 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 respectively the slopes of 0 016 0 0008 0 013 0 012 and 0 017 tons ha 1 for 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 respectively indicate yield increase of 0 41 0 02 0 33 0 30 and 0 43 tons ha 1 respectively beyond the intercept for every 25 4 mm increase in etc the highest slope was recorded for 432 250 seeds ha 1 and the lowest slope for 247 000 seeds ha 1 the slope of pooled data indicate that yield would increase by 0 25 tons ha 1 with every 25 4 mm increase etc the lower r2 for pooled data indicates differences in seeding rates similarly linear response of grain yield to etc was reported by payero et al 2005 irmak et al 2014 reported that seed yield exhibited linear relationship with seasonal etc with slopes of 0 0007 and 0 0045 tons ha 1 generating an increase of 0 114 ton ha 1 beyond the intercept in 2007 but only 0 02 ton ha 1 in the wetter year in 2008 this is similar to the trend observed in our research although we obtained slightly higher slopes in yield vs etc relationships the weaker response in 2014 can be attributed to the fact that large amount of soil water at planting time and the above normal rainfall in the growing season contributed to obtaining rainfed yields similar to irrigated treatments therefore the role of irrigation in increasing crop etc was small 3 8 crop water productivity cwp the cwp ranged from 0 82 to 0 95 kg m 3 in 2014 and from 0 95 to 1 25 kg m 3 in 2015 due to differences in weather conditions significant differences p 0 05 were observed in cwp between 2014 and 2015 growing seasons table 9 in 2014 no significant differences were observed in cwp between treatments table 10 however in 2015 there were significant differences due to irrigation treatments only the rainfed treatment with overall cwp of 1 02 kg m 3 was significantly lower than fit with cwp of 1 13 kg m 3 during both years the cwp averaged over all seeding rates were lowest for rainfed treatment and increased with increase in irrigation amounts in 2014 rainfed treatment had cwp in the range of 0 87 0 9 kg m 3 where lowest cwp was measured for 432 250 seeds ha 1 and the highest was measured for 308 750 seeds ha 1 cwp had the same range of 0 82 0 93 kg m 3 for 75 fit and fit and the highest value of 0 93 kg m 3 was observed for 308 750 seeds ha 1 in both irrigation treatments the seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 had the highest cwp among all treatments except in 50 fit in which 185 250 seeds ha 1 had higher cwp than 308 750 seeds ha 1 during 2015 cwp of 0 95 1 11 kg m 3 was measured for rainfed treatment and 1 07 1 25 kg m 3 for fit the highest values of cwp in different irrigation treatments did not occur for the same population as was the case in 2014 except 50 fit cwp was highest for 247 000 308 750 432 250 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 for rainfed 50 fit 75 fit and fit payero et al 2005 reported smaller soybean cwp values in a semi arid region in the range of 0 27 0 44 kg m 3 under sdi and 0 23 0 60 and 0 59 0 74 kg m 3 in 2003 and 2004 under solid set sprinkler irrigation system irmak et al 2014 reported slightly higher cwp than payero et al 2005 which ranged from 0 77 to 0 89 and 0 85 1 02 kg m 3 in 2007 and 2008 respectively the results obtained in our research are similar to that reported by irmak et al 2014 and were higher for some treatments due to difference in seeding rates the reasons for high cwp values are higher yields attainable at the research site the large precipitation amounts during the season and higher water holding capacity and organic matter content of soils irmak and sharma 2015 reported that the statewide average 78 counties for a 24 year period from 1986 to 2009 irrigated cwp for soybean as 0 64 kg m 3 the wide variability in cwp can be ascribed to several factors such as climate characteristics irrigation water management soil and nutrient management differences in variety cultivar hybrid response etc for example payero et al 2005 reported soybean cwp values in a semi arid area to be in the range of 2 7 4 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2002 under sdi 2 3 6 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2003 and 5 9 7 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2004 under solid set sprinkler irrigation higher cwp values were reported by irmak et al 2014 who measured cwp range of 7 71 8 94 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 8 5 10 22 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2007 and 2008 respectively the higher cwp values were obtained due to higher yields attainable at the research site and due to large amount of precipitation resulting in high productivity with reduced irrigation amounts and etc emphasizing the significant benefits of capturing any potential rainfall in the crop root zone and utilizing it toward meeting etc demand and yield productivity enhancements in cwp can also be achieved by adopting practices like increasing the harvest index improving drought and salinity tolerance adjusting planting dates and tillage to reduce evaporation and increase infiltration kijne et al 2003 practicing deficit or limited irrigation when feasible advantageous or necessary reducing soil evaporation losses practicing effective irrigation management cultivating drought tolerant varieties hybrids cwp can be increased significantly if irrigation is reduced i e through practicing limited or deficit irrigation strategies when feasible and water deficit is induced or other yield increasing management practices strategies are deployed i e effective weed management fertilizer management soil management disease management etc however there is a trade off between increasing cwp and yield reduction when deficit or limited irrigation is practiced increase in cwp due to reduction in irrigation amount in turn reduction in etc often results in reduction in grain yield which may not be preferred in many cases in terms of meeting food and fiber demand of growing population such increase in cwp can also be achieved through genetic improvements which can enhance the ratio of photosynthesis to transpiration and dry matter yield accumulation 4 summary and conclusions the field study was conducted during 2014 and 2015 growing seasons to evaluate the impact of five soybean seeding rates 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 under four irrigation strategies 50 fit 75 fit and fit and rainfed treatment on yield etc iwp cwp and irrigation vs etc relationships under sdi statistically no significant yield differences were observed due to seeding rates in both growing seasons while significant yield differences occurred due to irrigation regimes in drier year in 2015 irrigation treatments resulted in significantly greater yield than maximum rainfed yield of 3 85 tons ha 1 in 2015 in contrast to 2014 in which high rainfed yield of 4 77 tons ha 1 was not significantly different from irrigation treatments similar yields of 4 3 tons ha 1 for 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 and 4 tons ha 1 for 185 250 and 247 000 seeds ha 1 was recorded this suggests that yield plateau was obtained at 4 3 tons ha 1 and no further yield increase was observed with increase in seeding rates beyond 308 750 seeds ha 1 irrigation treatments had an impact on soil water status in the root zone in general soil water depletion increased with increase in seeding rates and was minimal beyond 1 20 m soil depth the seasonal etc when averaged for seeding rates was lowest in rainfed treatments than in irrigated treatments however seasonal etc was not always highest for the fit due to differences in seeding rates seasonal etc exhibited a linear response to irrigation amounts and seed yield during both growing seasons the slope values excluding the negative slope indicated that for every 25 4 mm increase in irrigation application the etc would increase in the range of 5 8 17 3 mm in 2014 and 6 1 17 3 mm in 2015 depending on the seeding rates the slopes of regression line between grain yield and etc for all seeding rates were in the range of 0 0003 and 0 0205 tons ha 1 in 2014 and 0 0008 0 017 tons ha 1 in 2015 indicating an increase in grain yield from 0 01 to 0 52 tons ha 1 in 2014 and 0 02 0 43 tons ha 1 in 2015 for every 25 4 mm of etc beyond the intercept in both years the cwp averaged over all seeding rates was lowest for rainfed treatment and increased with increase in irrigation amounts relationships were developed for seasonal etc vs yield and seasonal etc vs irrigation amounts which indicated a linear response for both growing seasons statistically the seasonal etc amounts and cwp differed only due to difference in irrigation treatments in 2015 while no significant variation was observed in 2014

evapotranspiration etc crop water productivity cwp with respect to irrigation water applied seeding rate and irrigation vs etc relationships these dynamics were investigated relative to five seeding rates 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 under full irrigation treatment fit limited irrigation 75 fit and 50 fit and rainfed rainfed treatment had the highest soil water depletion followed by 50 fit 75 fit and fit no clear trend of soil water depletion was observed due to seeding rates in 75 fit and fit highest yield was observed with 308 750 seeds ha 1 seeding rate yield plateaued at 4 3 tons ha 1 and no further yield increase was observed with increasing seeding rate beyond 308 750 seeds ha 1 while etc differed significantly p 0 05 due to irrigation treatments and seeding rates etc was affected more by the irrigation levels than the seeding rates etc ranged from 460 mm for rainfed treatment to 489 mm for fit under the lowest seeding rate 247 000 seeds ha 1 in 2014 and from 308 mm for rainfed under highest seeding rate 432 250 seeds ha 1 to 395 mm for fit under 308 750 seeds ha 1 in 2015 etc exhibited a linear response to irrigation and yield irrigation vs etc slopes indicate that for every 25 4 mm increase in irrigation application etc can increase between 5 8 mm and 17 3 mm depending on the seeding rates the highest weekly etc of 62 mm in 2014 and 44 mm in 2015 was recorded for the same seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 iwp was highest 0 96 kg m 3 for 247 000 seeds ha 1 under 75 fit in both seasons the highest cwp of 0 93 kg m 3 was obtained with the 308 750 seeds ha 1 in both 75 fit and fit in 2014 while the highest cwp of 1 25 kg m 3 was measured for fit under 432 250 seeds ha 1 in 2015 further long term research is suggested to investigate the potential differences in physiological and phenological parameters growth etc water productivity yield and yield response factors under different seeding rates for different soybean varieties under different irrigation levels and methods keywords planting density soil water content water productivity subsurface drip irrigation limited irrigation water stress 1 introduction the rising demand and competition for world s increasingly scarce water supplies is evident and has become one of the major challenges in ensuring global food security it is projected that agriculture will need to produce 60 more food globally and 100 more in developing countries by 2050 alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 from same or lesser land area to feed the increasing population which is expected to exceed 8 billion by 2025 therefore it is paramount to find ways to increase the production and its efficiency in a sustainable manner from limited resources through development of improved crop production technologies and effective management of water in agriculture although increases in crop production have resulted from improved hybrids varieties that are tolerant to drought weed management better fertilizers etc timely irrigation management along with proper crop and soil management practices especially in areas with limited water supplies and substantial variability in rainfall distributions and amounts remains one of the most critical factors affecting yields according to the usda nass 2019 there were 22 62 million ha of irrigated land area in the u s in 2018 increasing irrigated land area to meet growing population s food and fiber needs requires efficient methods of water distribution and use in the field research has shown that subsurface drip irrigation sdi results in high yielding crops and substantial reductions in withdrawal of irrigation water and reduced surface soil evaporation if the system is properly designed installed operated and maintained irmak et al 2014 therefore proper implementation of irrigation management strategies and technologies that can result in significant reduction in irrigation water withdrawals increase in irrigation water use efficiency and energy savings need to be implemented in large scale production fields to achieve aforementioned improvements in crop water productivity cwp irmak et al 2012 soybean glycine max l merrill is one of the vital grain crops for humans and accounts for almost 60 of the world s oilseed production with u s being the second largest soybean producer after brazil soystats 2019 in the u s soybean is grown primarily in central and eastern parts and most of the production is concentrated in the midwestern region in many parts of the world including u s and midwestern states there has been a growing concern about the long term sustainability of irrigated agriculture due to groundwater depletion as well as water quality issues scanlon et al 2012 in view of growing constraints on water and limited land availability the need to maximize the yield per unit of water has been gaining significant attention thus it is imperative to develop local and current water yield relationships to understand the response of soybean under limited water conditions including under different seeding rates so that the information data and knowledge can be developed and transferred to the producers to help them in their management practices to enhance productivity water stress is one of the major yield limiting factors in soybean production in many parts of the world and the soybean productivity response to different levels of water stress under different seeding rates and irrigation levels are not well understood in the absence of weed and disease pressure nutrient deficiency and other stresses the amount of yield reduction due to water stress depends on the phenological stage duration and intensity of water shortage climate soil and crop management and other factors some studies have examined the susceptibility of soybean to water stress during various development stages i e vegetative flowering pod formation and seed filling earlier pioneering work by hiler et al 1974 doss et al 1974 sionit and kramer 1977 ashley and ethridge 1978 and reicosky and heatherly 1990 found that the vegetative stages are less sensitive to water stress than the reproductive growth stages and some reproductive growth stages may be more vulnerable than others in contrast griffin et al 1985 found that higher yields resulted from full season irrigation and any stress prior to flowering was detrimental there were mixed notions about the effect of water stress and irrigation scheduling on yield as well cases of similar yields for full irrigation and irrigation initiated at flowering ashley and ethridge 1978 higher yields for irrigation during vegetative growth or at bloom stage than pod fill stage elmore et al 1988 and higher yields with irrigation from mid pod elongation to seed enlargement kadhem et al 1985 have been reported another study by kron et al 2008 indicated that water stress during v4 stage increases the tolerance of plant towards water shortage in later stages when subjected to water stress during flower formation shorter flowering periods were observed sionit and kramer 1977 korte et al 1983 while water stress during seed filling stage accelerate senescence and shorten the seed filling period that cause yield reduction by reducing seed size and seed number souza et al 1996 these effects cannot be halted by eliminating the stress after a short period and can have greater negative effects on yield and seed size than the continuously stressed plants brevedan and egli 2003 usually water stressed plants achieved earlier maturity while higher plant heights increased lodging increased yields and cooler canopies were observed in plants receiving full irrigation during the entire season in general the ability of soybean plant to compensate for water stress decreases and potential degree of yield reduction increases as the plant growth stage progress from r1 i e beginning bloom through r5 i e seed enlargement the most current research suggests that delaying irrigation until r3 stage and practicing full irrigation thereafter can result in similar or greater productivity in soybean grown on silt loam soils irmak et al 2014 they reported higher yield for treatments in which irrigations were delayed until r3 than the fully irrigated control treatment there is a need for more detailed and site specific research to determine the right amount of irrigation water to be applied to obtain optimum yields for making the most optimum use of irrigation water for local climatic and management conditions that can result in invaluable data information and knowledge transfer especially there is a significant knowledge gap in terms of yield etc and water productivity response to full and limited irrigation under different seeding rates accurate quantification of crop water use crop evapotranspiration etc is also required to obtain optimum yields as well as for effective management of within season water resources and it is a vital component of overall efforts in enhancing crop productivity and production efficiency soybean seasonal etc may vary substantially from one place to another and even in the same region over different growing seasons due to changes in weather conditions for instance payero et al 2005 reported etc value of 585 mm during 2004 in a semi arid climate and irmak et al 2013 reported seasonal etc values of 535 mm and 514 mm during 2007 and 2008 growing seasons respectively for subsurface drip irrigated sdi soybean in a transition zone between sub humid and semi arid climates kanemasu et al 1976 reported soybean seasonal etc of 651 mm during 1974 growing season in kansas usa hattendorf et al 1988 reported soybean seasonal etc values of 591 mm and 491 mm for manhattan and tribune in kansas respectively seasonal crop water use amounts for soybean were reported between 450 and 700 mm by doorenbos and kassam 1979 another major factor in soybean production is the seeding rate required for optimum yields because seed cost has become a significant input cost accounting for about 36 4 of total operating costs soystats 2019 the optimum plant population for soybean varies for different varieties and environments hanway and harvey 1967 increasing seeding rate may result in an increase in yields to a point until asymptotic yield is reached diminishing return and thereafter no yield increase is observed with increasing plant population because of increased plant competition for light water nutrients etc historically higher seeding rates have been recommended to suppress weeds however today with advances in planters effective weed management and improved accuracy of seed placement ensure good stand establishment and higher plant populations may not be necessary in many cases soybean plant can compensate for different plant populations and adjust growth and development by producing branches and more pods per plant at low plant population carpenter and board 1997 and fewer branches and pods per plant at high plant population high plant population results in quicker canopy closure resulting in greater light interception lower weed competition taller plants and smaller stalks but it leads to increased competition for water and nutrients may promote lodging and adds to seed costs weber et al 1966 in low plant population each plant can have higher leaf area captures more sunlight and can have shorter height with large stalks and lower pod set while producing competitive yields thus any reduction in seeding rate without affecting yield can enhance profitability aforementioned studies did not quantify how yield and productivity may vary with different soybean seeding rates under different irrigation levels including limited irrigation while limited irrigation strategy may result in some yield penalty and the magnitude of this yield penalty can depend on numerous environmental and management factors limited irrigation can increase cwp especially in water limiting areas where practicing full irrigation management may not be possible due to moratoriums and other restrictions in these cases it is imperative that the yield cwp and etc response to different seeding rates be determined to provide information data and strategies to producers to aid them to make better informed decisions in such conditions it is also evident that water and yield relationships vary substantially with locations climate and soil and water management there is a knowledge gap in soybean etc yield iwp and cwp response to different seeding rates the specific objectives of this research were to i quantify and evaluate etc seed yield iwp and cwp and ii investigate the relationships between irrigation vs etc under five different soybean seeding rates and four irrigation levels under sdi 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site and experimental design field experiments were conducted in the irmak research laboratory irl at the university of nebraska lincoln unl south central agricultural laboratory scal located at latitude 40 34 n and longitude 98 08 w and at an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level near clay center nebraska during 2014 and 2015 growing seasons the research site is located in the transition zone between sub humid and semi arid climate zones with the mean annual precipitation of 731 mm mean annual temperature of 10 3 c and mean annual snowfall of 381 mm the timing and magnitude of precipitation vary significantly not only year to year but also within the growing season requiring supplemental irrigation the research site has hastings silt loam soil which is well drained upland soil fine montmorillonitic mesic udic argiustoll having a 0 5 slope with particle size distribution of 15 sand 62 5 silt 20 clay and 2 5 organic matter content in the topsoil irmak 2010 the soil has field capacity of 0 34 m3 m 3 permanent wilting point of 0 14 m3 m 3 saturation point of 0 51 m3 m 3 and the effective root depth of soybean during mid season is 0 90 1 20 m irmak 2010 the experimental field was 4 45 ha and was irrigated using a sub surface drip irrigation sdi system that was installed in 2005 by senior author s irmak the use of sdi system results in minimum surface soil evaporation due to no surface soil wetting because of irrigation the 1 52 m spaced sdi laterals were centered between every other pair of ridge tilled rows at a depth of approximately 0 40 m below the soil surface the emitter spacing on the sdi laterals was 0 45 m with the pressure compensated emitters that had a 1 0 lt hr discharge rate netafim usa fresno california usa the timing and amount of water applied in this sdi field was scheduled using soil water content data as measured using a neutron attenuation method the field was maintained as a ridge till during both growing seasons the experimental design was a completely randomized block design with three replications fig 1 each replication plot was 122 m long and 6 1 m wide i e 8 plant rows with a 0 76 m row spacing and north south planting direction each treatment consisting of a combination of seeding rate and irrigation level was randomly assigned to the plots and replications throughout the research field five different soybean seeding rates were deployed 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 and four irrigation treatments that consisted full irrigation treatment fit 75 fit 50 fit and non irrigated rainfed treatment were evaluated thus each seeding rate was subjected to each irrigation treatment resulting in a total of 20 treatments in the experiment during both seasons there was adequate soil moisture early in the season for planting and crop germination due to dormant season snowmelt and or rainfall and the soil water is usually at the field capacity at the research site 2 2 agronomic management practices the soybean cultivar pioneer 92y83 with a relative maturity of 2 8 was planted on may 28 2014 emerged on june 6 2014 and was harvested on october 2 2014 the same cultivar was planted on may 13 2015 and plants emerged on may 26 2015 unfortunately the plants were damaged by heavy rainstorm on june 3 2015 therefore field was replanted on june 9 plants emerged on june 15 and harvested on october 2 2015 in both years the planting depth was 0 03 0 04 m with north south planting direction agronomic management information including planting emergence harvesting weed control and amount and date of fertilizer applications for both growing seasons are presented in table 1 irrigation applications were managed based on fit such that irrigation timings and amounts were practiced for maintaining soil water between about 45 and 90 of total available water to prevent water stress and accommodate soil water storage capacity for potential precipitation the soil moisture data were collected on a weekly basis at soil depths of 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 0 90 1 20 and 1 20 1 50 m from the surface using a neutron probe soil moisture meter model 4302 troxler electronics laboratories inc n c to determine irrigation timings and amounts the neutron probe access tubes were installed in two replications of each treatment total of 40 tubes the tubes were installed on the plant row in the middle of the two healthy plants as there was enough moisture in the soil profile early in the growing season for growth and germination of plants no irrigation was applied at the beginning of the season for plant germination irrigation did not commence until soybean pod stage r3 which is characterized by presence of 4 5 mm long pods at one of the four uppermost main stem nodes that have a fully developed leaf at this stage soybean is considered to be very sensitive to water stress moreover in deep silt loam soils if soil is near field capacity at planting it is suggested that soybean can sustain on stored soil water until pod development stage without much impact on yield specht et al 1989 which can heavily depend on soil management and climatic conditions and can vary between the locations regions total irrigation application amounts in 2014 were 0 20 3 30 5 and 40 6 mm for rainfed 50 fit 75 fit and fit treatments respectively in 2015 total amount of irrigation water applied was 0 51 76 and 102 mm under rainfed 50 fit 75 fit and fit treatments respectively the amounts differed considerably between the two years because 2014 growing season was much wetter than 2015 season 2 3 seasonal crop evapotranspiration etc a general soil water balance approach was used to calculate weekly and seasonal etc as 1 etc p i u r d δsws where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm u is upward soil moisture flux mm assumed zero because the groundwater depth is approximately 33 m below the surface irmak 2010 r is run off mm d is deep percolation from the crop root zone mm and δsws change in soil water storage in the soil profile mm from the beginning to the end of the growing season therefore the equation to calculate seasonal etc is reduced to 2 etc p i r d δsws when solving the soil water balance equation for etc r d and δsws were determined for each treatment individually rather than calculation field average values precipitation data were obtained from weather station located at the research site which was part of high plains regional climate center hprcc weather network http www hprcc unl edu irrigation amounts were the actual irrigation depths applied to each treatment the surface run off from each treatment was calculated using the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs curve number method usda nrcs 1985 based on the experimental site s hydrologic soil group land use treatment and hydrologic condition the curve numbers were estimated as 59 8 78 and 89 1 for dry normal and wet conditions respectively deep percolation was calculated using a daily water balance computer program written in microsoft visual basic bryant et al 1992 payero et al 2009 djaman and irmak 2012 inputs to the program include weather variables such as daily air temperature incoming shortwave radiation relative humidity wind speed rainfall irrigation dates and amounts information initial water content in the soil profile at crop emergence and crop and site specific information such as planting date crop maturity date soil parameters and maximum rooting depth irmak 2015a 2015b 2 4 iwp cwp and statistical analysis besides applying right amount of irrigation water at the right time it is also necessary to ensure how efficiently this water is delivered to the crops and its effect on crop growth and yield productivity performance this performance can be quantified by different performance indices one of which is the irrigation water productivity iwp which is defined as the ratio of difference between irrigated and rainfed crop yield to applied depth of irrigation water iwp is an important indicator to assess irrigation and crop yield relationships as inadequate irrigation application can result in crop water stress yield reduction as well as waste of water and energy resources soybean yield was determined by harvesting each plot and adjusting the weight of threshed seed to standard seed moisture content of 13 the final yield was expressed in ton ha 1 to distinguish the role of irrigation efficiency in terms of physical irrigation water delivery to the production field and its distribution within the field which generally refers to it as irrigation efficiency from crop water productivity irrigation water productivity iwp was calculated as the ratio of differences between irrigated and rainfed yield over the amount of applied irrigation as 3 iwp y i y r i i where iwp is expressed as kg m 3 y is seed yield g m 2 and i i is applied irrigation water mm and subscript i represents the irrigation level and subscript r representing the treatment with no seasonal irrigation rainfed additionally cwp fernández et al 2020 was computed as the ratio of grain yield to etc 4 cwp y etc where cwp is expressed as kg m 3 y is grain yield g m 2 and etc is in mm physically cwp is governed solely by transpiration since it is difficult to partition transpiration and evaporation from the soil surface practically evapotranspiration is used in defining cwp at the field level higher cwp leads to either same production from less water resources or increased production from similar water resources fernández et al 2020 provided a novel overview of the use of water use efficiency and cwp they addressed the rational use of the cwp approach for the irrigator to improve both biophysical and economic water productivity at the field scale they stated that the term efficiency accounts for a dimensionless ratio of the total amount of water used to the total amount of water applied the term productivity refers to the ratio between the product produced vs the input used this is aligned with the concept of cwp term introduced by molden 1997 which has been gaining acceptance in the scientific literature fernández et al 2020 thus cwp instead of crop water use efficiency is used in this research following fernández et al 2020 the proc glimmix procedure of sas version 9 3 sas institute inc cary nc was used for data analyses for both growing seasons treatments seeding rates irrigation amounts and years were considered as fixed effects while replications were considered as random effect in the statistical analyses due to significant year by treatment interaction data of both years were presented separately when the anova indicated treatment effects were significant means were separated at α 0 05 and fisher s protected least significant differences lsd test was conducted in addition to anova coefficient of determination r2 and standard deviation were used to evaluate the performance and differences among treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather trends during 2014 and 2015 growing seasons weather data were obtained from an automated weather station located at the research site average daily and monthly patterns of some of the main climatic variables precipitation mean air temperature relative humidity incoming shortwave radiation vapor pressure deficit and wind speed during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons are presented in figs 2 and 3 and table 2 as compared to long term average the total precipitation from june to september was 23 and 6 higher than long term averages during 2014 and 2015 respectively the seasonal total precipitation may 1 to october 31 was 525 mm in 2014 and 533 mm in 2015 with a long term 1983 2013 average of 495 mm at the research site however cumulative precipitation from planting to harvest during 2014 was much greater than 2015 growing season the 2014 growing season was comparatively wetter than 2015 growing season total seasonal precipitation from planting to harvest was 447 mm in 2014 and 211 mm in 2015 in 2014 june and august were the wettest months with total above normal precipitation of 167 mm and 173 mm which accounts for 37 2 and 38 7 of the total rainfall received in 2014 respectively the highest rainfall event of 44 mm that occurred on 74 dap marked the end of irrigation applications about 40 of the total precipitation in 2015 was received early in the june high precipitation of 85 mm in june and 55 mm in july was received in 2015 and lesser rainfall later in the water intensive stages therefore more irrigation events were scheduled in 2015 8 irrigation events during low rainfall period from august 4 to september 12 corresponding to r3 5 to r6 5 56 dap to 95 dap soybean growth stages as compared with 2014 growing season 4 irrigation events in july and august coinciding with r3 and r4 62 dap to 72 dap growth stages the average air temperature tavg for june july august and september major portion of the growing season was 5 5 higher and vapor pressure deficit vpd was 11 1 higher in 2015 than in 2014 growing season while the incoming shortwave radiation rs wind speed at 2 m height u2 average relative humidity rh and precipitation were 9 7 8 9 1 9 and 51 greater in 2014 than in 2015 the 2015 growing season june september with mean temperature of 22 c was warmer by 1 2 c than 2014 20 8 c the highest maximum air temperature tmax and lowest wind speeds was observed during july and august during both growing seasons average rh of 76 9 in 2014 was slightly higher than in 2015 75 5 the highest rh occurred in august reproductive stages during both growing seasons the highest rs occurred in june and july during both growing seasons as well as in long term trend maximum average value of vpd was measured in july 0 99 kpa which decreased in the later months however in 2015 vpd was highest in september 1 07 kpa and slightly lower in july 0 98 kpa resulting in high evaporative demands in major water intensive stages overall higher u2 precipitation and rs were observed in 2014 growing season but higher tavg and vpd during 2015 had an impact on soybean growth and development in terms of growing season length and yield warmer temperatures and higher evaporative demands in 2015 resulted in slightly earlier physiological maturity of soybean and shorter growing season length in 2015 115 days than in 2014 127 days 3 2 seasonal soil water balance variables the seasonal soil water balance variables are summarized in table 8 the total seasonal irrigation amount applied in 2015 102 mm applied to fit was greater by 60 than in 2014 41 mm applied to fit growing season due to 53 lesser precipitation in 2015 211 mm than in 2014 447 mm some of the high precipitation events over the growing season resulted in surface run off and deep percolation in all the treatments during both growing seasons in 2014 the total run off was estimated at about 9 mm in irrigated treatments and negligible 0 50 mm in the rainfed treatments because of the high rainfall event of 44 mm that occurred 73 dap while irrigation had already been commenced 62 dap in 2015 a negligible amount 2 mm of run off was determined early in the growing season before commencement of irrigation during 2014 season 23 mm of water was lost to deep percolation from all treatments due to heavy rainfall events occurring at the emergence time during june in 2015 approximately 34 mm of dp from almost all treatments in the early season and the maximum dp of about 43 mm was determined in fit with lowest seeding rate the same or very similar run off and deep percolation values reported in table 8 for different seeding rates are a combination of artifact of nrcs curve number method as well as minimal differences in rainfall received and initial soil water conditions between the treatments total soil water stored in the soil profile and weekly change in the soil moisture as measured by neutron attenuation gauge for all treatments during both seasons are presented in figs 4 and 5 the highest soil moisture depletion occurred in the rainfed treatments and the least in the fit in mostly all the seeding rates in both years there were similar trends in soil water change in respective treatments between the growing seasons there was a relatively uniformly distributed soil water between the soil layers in the soil profile due to pre planting rainfall hence the total available soil water was highest early in the growing season decreased gradually and coincided with management allowable depletion mad on august 8 2014 thereafter total available water remained above the mad throughout the growing season in most treatments except in 247 000 seeds ha 1 with 50 fit the small differences in root zone soil moisture content due to irrigation treatments were observed starting in august the second soil layer 0 30 0 60 m exhibited maximum water content in all treatments for most of the growing season this is due to presence of drip lines at 0 40 m below the soil surface for delivering irrigation water due to large amount of rainfall in 2014 60 lesser irrigation water was required as compared with 2015 growing season the least soil water depletion occurred in the 0 90 1 20 m and 1 20 1 50 m soil layers in 2014 overall when averaged over all seeding rates soil water depletion starting from the first soil moisture measurements until the end of growing season was highest in rainfed treatment 61 mm reducing gradually in 50 fit 55 mm 75 fit 43 mm and the lowest in fit 42 mm however when averaged over irrigation amounts the differences for water depletion among different seeding rates had a narrow range varying from 54 mm for 247 000 seeds ha 1 to 47 mm for 370 500 seeds ha 1 indicating no clear trend in soil water due to seeding rates in 2015 growing season the soil water content at the beginning of the growing season when first soil moisture reading was taken in all treatments and all soil layers was mostly similar indicating a uniform start of the experiment in terms of soil water the soil moisture started declining in all treatments after mid july when soybean plants were at r1 stage which marks the onset of most water intensive stages in soybean growth cycle similar to 2014 greater soil water was available in the early growing season in 2015 and decreased with the progression of the soybean growth cycle however total available soil water was depleted beyond the mad resulting in stress in some of the seeding rates treatments the maximum depletion of soil water occurred in seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 while the minimum depletion was observed in 175 000 seeds ha 1 compared to 2014 more soil water depletion occurred in 2015 therefore the response of treatments to increasing irrigation amounts was observed to be stronger in 2015 under rainfed conditions water content at the end of the growing season in second soil layer 0 30 0 60 m declined from almost 100 mm for the lowest seeding rate to 88 mm for the highest seeding rate this is most likely due to interplant competition among soybean plants in higher seeding rates for water and nutrients which caused water stress water extraction in the later growth stages also occurred from deeper soil layers up to 1 20 m while water content in the deepest soil layer of 1 50 m remained nearly constant for all treatments the greatest soil water depletion occurred in the top 0 0 30 m soil layer in all treatments because of surface evaporation plant root water uptake as well as due to no surface wetting occurring due to subsurface source of irrigation moreover as the seeding rate increased the water extraction took place from deeper layers as well in most of the treatments because of soybean root penetration deep into the soil in water stress conditions overall in 2015 when total soil water depletion in the plant root zone was averaged for different seeding rates rainfed treatment had the highest depletion of 130 mm followed by 50 fit with 114 mm 75 fit with 94 mm and lowest in fit with 58 mm when averaged over irrigation treatments the highest water depletion was observed in seeding rate of 308 500 seeds ha 1 with 114 mm and lowest in 432 250 seeds ha 1 with 83 mm water depleted similar to 2014 no clear trend of water depletion was observed due to seeding rates 3 3 impact of seasonal irrigation amounts on grain yield the statistical analyses of grain yields measured for all five seeding rates 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 for all irrigation levels in both seasons 2014 and 2015 growing seasons are presented in tables 3 5 the relationships between grain yield and applied irrigation for individual seeding rates as well as pooled data for all treatments are presented in fig 6 soybean yield varied from 4 42 to 4 77 tons ha 1 for rainfed treatments and from 4 31 to 4 87 tons ha 1 for irrigated treatments in 2014 in 2015 yields varied from 3 47 to 3 85 tons ha 1 under rainfed treatment and from 3 97 to 4 70 tons ha 1 under irrigated treatments in 2014 the grain yields ranged from 4 31 tons ha 1 to 4 87 tons ha 1 statistically the seeding rates and irrigation treatments did not have significant p 0 05 impact on grain yield numerically under rainfed conditions highest yield of 4 8 tons ha 1 was obtained for lowest population of 185 250 seeds ha 1 which was 7 4 3 0 5 7 and 7 2 greater than higher seeding rates of 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 respectively highest seeding rates of 432 250 seeds ha 1 had the second lowest grain yield of 4 43 tons ha 1 under rainfed conditions after 4 42 tons ha 1 yield measured in 247 000 seeds ha 1 this may be attributed to the fact that the interplant competition among higher seeding rate plots for water and nutrients may had an impact on soybean yield similar trend was observed in 50 fit in which highest yield of 4 85 tons ha 1 was obtained with the lowest seeding rate of 185 250 seeds ha 1 which was 9 2 6 2 6 5 and 8 4 greater than seeding rates of 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 respectively in both 75 fit and fit highest yield was observed for seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 which was 10 9 1 9 10 6 and 5 4 higher in 75 fit and 7 6 2 7 10 5 and 5 2 in fit than seeding rates of 185 000 247 000 l 370 000 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 respectively in general the maximum seed yield of 4 87 tons ha 1 was measured for seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 under fit however the range of variation in yield was small in 2014 due to high precipitation in 2015 statistically significant p 0 05 differences in yields were observed for irrigation treatments however no significant yield differences occurred for different seeding rates or two way interaction seeding rate x irrigation seed yield increased with irrigation and varied from 3 47 tons ha 1 for the rainfed treatment to 4 70 tons ha 1 for the fit treatment under rainfed conditions seed yield ranged from 3 47 tons ha 1 to 3 85 tons ha 1 highest yield of 3 85 tons ha 1 was recorded for 247 000 seeds ha 1 and lowest yield of 3 47 tons ha 1 was obtained with 308 750 seeds ha 1 treatment for 50 fit the seed yield ranged from 3 97 tons ha 1 to 4 32 tons ha 1 also similar yields with slight variation of 4 3 tons ha 1 for 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 and 4 tons ha 1 for 185 250 and 247 000 seeds ha 1 was recorded this suggests that yield plateau was obtained at 4 3 tons ha 1 and no further yield increase was observed with increase in seeding rates beyond 308 750 seeds ha 1 which supports duncan s 1986 postulate that seed yields continue to increase with increase in planting density to a limit that is above that needed to intercept all the light for 75 fit seed yield ranged from 4 2 to 4 42 tons ha 1 with the highest yield being for 308 750 seeds ha 1 and lowest yield of 4 2 tons ha 1 for 370 500 seeds ha 1 under fit seed yield ranged from 4 17 to 4 70 tons ha 1 with lowest yield 4 2 tons ha 1 for 185 250 seeds ha 1 and highest yield for 308 750 4 65 tons ha 1 and 432 250 4 7 tons ha 1 seeds ha 1 overall seed yield averaged across five seeding rates was highest for fit 4 44 tons ha 1 which is 17 6 6 and 2 6 higher than rainfed 50 fit and 75 fit therefore it is likely that the supplementary irrigation water applied at appropriate intervals was able to prevent crop water stress resulting in higher yields with increase in irrigation amounts in drier year of 2015 the seed yield and irrigation amounts relationships were explained with quadratic model for all seeding rates in both seasons the pooled data for all seeding rates in 2014 showed that yield response to irrigation was very weak r2 0 02 this may be due to availability of adequate water in the beginning of the season and above normal rainfall in august when soybean was in pod elongation and seed filling stage which are at the most water intensive and sensitive stages however individual seeding rates exhibited stronger correlations except for the lowest seeding rate of 185 250 seeds ha 1 r2 0 44 in general seed yield showed decreasing trend with irrigation for seeding rates of 185 250 seeds ha 1 and 370 500 seeds ha 1 and increasing trend for seeding rates of 247 000 308 750 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 in 2014 growing season overall irrigation had little impact on seed yield in 2014 however in 2015 increasing trend was observed for seed yield with increase in irrigation amounts for all seeding rates each 25 4 mm increase in irrigation increased the yield by 0 313 0 126 0 433 0 261 and 0 262 ton ha 1 beyond the intercept for seeding rates of 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 respectively in 2015 irmak et al 2014 reported similar results as they also obtained quadratic relationship between seed yield and seasonal irrigation amounts for the same research location they also reported a weak correlation for wetter year 2008 r2 0 21 and stronger correlation for dry year 2007 r2 0 82 they reported seed yield increase of 0 323 tons ha 1 with each incremental increase of 25 4 mm of irrigation for seeding density of 388 000 seeds ha 1 while we obtained higher yield increase of 0 433 tons ha 1 for seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 soybean yield increased with irrigation amounts from 3 7 tons ha 1 for rainfed treatment to 4 44 tons ha 1 for fully irrigated treatments when averaged over all seeding rates in 2015 while there was no appreciable yield difference due to irrigation treatments in 2014 in general seeding rates did not have significant impact on grain yield there was no significant interaction between seeding rates and irrigation treatments in both growing seasons harvest plant populations for maximum yields were reported to be as low as 157 300 plants ha 1 to 211 800 plants ha 1 for 76 cm row spacing bruin and pedersen 2008 highest seeding rate of 790 737 seeds ha 1 had lower yield relative to the lowest seeding rate of 395 368 seeds ha 1 for determinate cultivars ablett et al 1991 optimum yields have been reported for plant stands as low as 70 000 seeds ha 1 egli 1988 or as high as 388 000 oplinger and philbrook 1992 seeds ha 1 other studies indicated final plant populations from 250 000 to 350 000 seeds ha 1 are sufficient to obtain maximum yields elmore 1998 3 4 irrigation water productivity iwp iwp in 2015 ranged from 0 08 kg m 3 under 50 fit for seeding rate of 432 250 seeds ha 1 to 0 96 kg m 3 under 75 fit for seeding rate of 247 000 seeds ha 1 in 2014 and from 0 22 kg m 3 under 50 fit for seeding rate of 247 000 seeds ha 1 to 1 48 kg m 3 under 75 fit for seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 in 2015 higher iwp values in 2015 as compared with those obtained in 2014 resulted from higher precipitation in 2014 which was approximately 53 more than in 2015 growing season interestingly iwp was lower in fit than other irrigation treatments for most of the seeding rates in 2015 for example in lowest seeding rate of 185 250 seeds ha 1 iwp was recorded as 0 76 kg m 3 and 0 93 kg m 3 under 50 fit and 75 fit respectively as compared with 0 54 kg m 3 in fit highest iwp of 1 48 kg m 3 occurred in seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 under 50 fit due to wet conditions in 2014 rainfed treatments had slightly higher yield than the irrigation treatments therefore iwp was not calculated for some treatments table 3 irmak et al 2014 obtained higher iwp values in dry 2007 0 515 1 035 kg m 3 growing season than in 2008 0 051 0 292 kg m 3 and the highest iwp 1 035 kg m 3 value was obtained for delay irrigation until r3 irrigation treatment the overall range of iwp under 50 fit was as low as 0 22 kg m 3 and as high as 1 48 kg m 3 under 75 fit it ranged from 0 57 kg m 3 to 1 14 kg m 3 and under fit it ranged from 0 38 kg m 3 to 1 05 kg m 3 in 2015 these findings are between values for iwp ranging from 0 48 to 1 02 for irrigation started at flowering as reported by garcia et al 2010 in georgia differences can be attributed to difference in cultivar maturity group amount and method of irrigation water application climate management conditions and other factors garcia et al 2010 reported that when full season irrigation was applied to soybean crop in a humid region iwp varied from 0 55 kg m 3 for maturity group mg v to 1 14 kg m 3 for mg vi and when irrigation started at flowering iwp varied from 0 48 kg m 3 for mg v to 1 02 kg m 3 for mg vi under lateral move irrigation system in general iwp increases with increase in yield and decreases with increase in amount of irrigation water applied depending on the weather conditions this can be validated by the results presented by irmak et al 2014 who observed linear increase in iwp with increase in yield especially in dry year r2 0 62 3 5 treatment effects on seasonal etc the total amount of irrigation water applied to fit 75 fit and 50 fit was 41 31 and 21 mm in 2014 and 102 76 and 51 mm in 2015 respectively all irrigation applications were commenced at r3 stage of soybean which marks the onset of water intensive stages in soybean growth cycle due to tendency of unexpected rainfall events early in the season the irrigation applications scheduled before r3 stage could be rendered ineffective the 2014 growing season was wet for most of the periods except a small dry period from 50 dap to 72 dap when no rainfall event occurred the r3 stage started during this dry period i e 61 dap therefore four irrigation events were scheduled starting from 62 dap until 72 dap statistically there were significant differences in seasonal etc between both 2014 and 2015 years p 0 05 as presented in table 6 therefore data for seasonal etc were analyzed separately for each year and presented in table 7 no significant differences were observed for the seeding rate x irrigation amount seeding rate x year seeding rate x irrigation amount x year interactions in 2014 similar seasonal etc was observed in rainfed 50 fit and 75 fit while the seasonal etc was significantly higher than rainfed under 75 fit but was similar to 50 fit the range of seasonal etc was very narrow in 2014 growing season thus most of the treatments did not experience water stress throughout the growing season as evident in fig 4 resulting in narrow seasonal etc range and similar yields during 2014 growing season doss and thurlow 1974 reported that soybean yields are influenced more by irrigation and variety than by row width and seeding rate the three seeding rates 107 600 215 300 and 322 900 plants ha 1 did not have any significant effect at p 0 05 in their study in 2015 seasonal etc amounts were similar for rainfed 50 fit and 75 fit while they were significantly different from fit p 0 05 the lowest seasonal etc amount occurred in rainfed due to water stress and reduced transpiration rates the highest seasonal etc occurred under 75 fit which may be due to differences in seeding rates seasonal etc amounts for all treatments during 2014 and 2015 growing seasons are presented in table 8 in 2014 the lowest and highest seasonal etc values were 460 mm for rainfed treatment and 489 mm for fit respectively under the same seeding rate of 247 000 seeds ha 1 however in 2015 etc values ranged from 308 mm for rainfed treatment under highest seeding rate of 432 250 seeds ha 1 to 395 mm for fit under 308 750 seeds ha 1 the narrow range of etc 29 mm was observed in 2014 while the seasonal etc values were higher for all treatments than in 2015 higher etc values in 2014 were due to longer growing season i e 127 days as compared with 115 days in 2015 higher magnitudes of precipitation solar radiation and wind speed as well as earlier planting date however the range of etc values was wider i e 87 mm in 2015 as compared with 2014 growing season the average etc for all treatments was 472 mm in 2014 and 348 mm in 2015 growing season when averaged over all irrigation treatments including rainfed etc values were 469 478 469 472 and 472 mm in 2014 and 349 344 364 354 and 320 mm in 2015 for the for seeding rates of 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 respectively in 2014 the minimum etc values were greater in fit t4 by 2 7 t5 2 7 t10 and 2 5 t3 and maximum etc values were greater in fit t8 by 3 t1 1 t6 and 1 9 t7 than in rainfed 50 fit and 75 fit respectively the range of etc was 461 474 mm in 185 250 seeds ha 1 460 489 mm in 247 000 seeds ha 1 460 476 mm in 308 750 seeds ha 1 462 485 mm in 370 500 seeds ha 1 and 463 485 mm in 432 250 seeds ha 1 the observed etc trend was not similar between the two growing seasons seasonal etc may vary widely due to differences in weather conditions and the total water available to the crop payero et al 2005 reported etc amounts in the range of 261 541 mm in 2002 262 498 mm in 2003 and 388 506 mm in 2004 irmak et al 2014 reported higher etc in the range of 452 601 mm during 2007 and 473 579 mm in 2008 3 6 irrigation vs seasonal etc the relationship between total irrigation amounts and seasonal etc for each seeding rate as well as pooled data for each year are presented in fig 7 a linear response of seasonal etc to increasing irrigation amounts is generally explained by a linear function irmak et al 2014 the pooled data for 2014 and 2015 growing seasons indicate weak linear relationships with r2 0 25 in 2014 and r2 0 42 in 2015 due to differences in seeding rates some of the individual seeding rates exhibited stronger response to irrigation which vary depending on the amount of water in soil profile during early planting and the amount of water extracted from the soil profile throughout the growing season in 2014 there was a more uniform temporal distribution of rainfall and the treatments did not experience any water stress as the available water was never below the mad except in 247 000 seeds ha 1 fig 4 interestingly due to higher water stress the seeding rate of 247 000 seeds ha 1 showed a good linear response to increasing irrigation amounts with r2 0 84 the response of etc to seasonal irrigation amounts was similar to the trend in total water available in the root zone lesser the total available water or more the depletion in the root zone stronger is the response of etc to seasonal irrigation the slopes of regression line between seasonal etc and irrigation of 0 14 0 68 0 23 0 34 and 0 40 mm were measured for seeding rates of 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 with positive intercepts of 472 463 464 464 and 463 mm respectively the negative slope was observed in lowest seeding rate because of higher etc in the rainfed treatment the slope values excluding the negative slope indicate that for every 25 4 mm increase in irrigation application the etc can increase in the range of 5 8 17 3 mm depending on the seeding rates in 2015 growing season the response of etc to seasonal irrigation amounts was stronger than that observed in 2014 which varied among seeding rates the stronger response could be attributed to the fact that 2015 was drier than 2014 and had higher vapor pressure deficits the strongest linear response r2 0 82 to increasing irrigation was observed in seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 and the weakest response was in the highest seeding rate of 432 250 seeds ha 1 r2 0 32 the slopes of linear regression lines indicated that with every 25 4 mm increase in irrigation application the etc increased in the range of 6 1 17 3 mm which is similar to the range in 2014 growing season irmak et al 2014 reported that every 25 4 mm increase in irrigation increased etc by 25 6 mm when averaged for 2007 and 2008 growing seasons at the same site which is higher than that obtained in this research this could be attributed to varying weather conditions like changes in vpd air temperature and the length of growing season moreover variation in seeding rates can affect evaporation from the soil surface due to varying canopy shading areas 3 7 grain yield vs seasonal etc the response of grain yield to seasonal etc for the irrigation and rainfed treatments for each seeding rate are presented in fig 8 the relationship between grain yield and etc is usually explained by a linear function payero et al 2005 djaman and irmak 2012 and the slope of grain yield production function indicates the amount of grain yield produced per unit of water used in 2014 etc range was 460 474 mm in the rainfed treatments for all seeding rates the lowest etc 460 mm was recorded for highest seeding rate of 247 000 seeds ha 1 having a yield of 4 44 tons ha 1 while the highest etc 474 mm was measured for the lowest seeding rate of 185 250 seeds ha 1 having a yield of 4 80 tons ha 1 in the fit the etc range was measured between 473 mm and 489 mm the lowest seeding rate of 185 250 seeds ha 1 had the lowest value of etc 473 mm and yield of 4 40 tons ha 1 the highest amount of etc 489 mm was recorded for 247 000 seeds ha 1 that had a yield of 4 70 tons ha 1 however the highest grain yield of 4 90 tons ha 1 was recorded for 308 750 seeds ha 1 with etc value of 476 mm the slopes of regression line between grain yield and etc for all seeding rates were in the range of 0 003 and 0 0205 tons ha 1 indicating an increase in grain yield from 0 01 to 0 52 tons ha 1 for every 25 4 mm of etc beyond the intercept the response of grain yield and etc was very weak in all seeding rates except in 308 750 r2 0 92 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 r2 0 60 having greater slopes of 0 0205 and 0 0137 tons ha 1 respectively the pooled dataset indicates a slope of 0 005 ton ha 1 beyond the intercept that would generate yield increase of 0 13 ton ha 1 for every 25 4 mm of etc in 2015 growing season the range of etc was between 308 and 332 mm in rainfed treatments for all seeding rates the minimum etc amount of 308 mm was recorded for the highest seeding rate 432 250 seeds ha 1 with yield of 3 72 tons ha 1 and maximum etc of 332 mm was observed in 308 750 seeds ha 1 having yield of 3 49 tons ha 1 the maximum etc of 332 389 and 395 having yield of 3 49 4 45 and 4 68 tons ha 1 were observed under rainfed 75 fit and fit respectively for seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 the slope of pooled grain yield vs etc data indicates a weak linear relationship r2 0 47 however the individual responses of seeding rates were stronger than the pooled data with r2 of 0 84 0 57 0 65 0 62 and 0 65 for 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 respectively the slopes of 0 016 0 0008 0 013 0 012 and 0 017 tons ha 1 for 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 respectively indicate yield increase of 0 41 0 02 0 33 0 30 and 0 43 tons ha 1 respectively beyond the intercept for every 25 4 mm increase in etc the highest slope was recorded for 432 250 seeds ha 1 and the lowest slope for 247 000 seeds ha 1 the slope of pooled data indicate that yield would increase by 0 25 tons ha 1 with every 25 4 mm increase etc the lower r2 for pooled data indicates differences in seeding rates similarly linear response of grain yield to etc was reported by payero et al 2005 irmak et al 2014 reported that seed yield exhibited linear relationship with seasonal etc with slopes of 0 0007 and 0 0045 tons ha 1 generating an increase of 0 114 ton ha 1 beyond the intercept in 2007 but only 0 02 ton ha 1 in the wetter year in 2008 this is similar to the trend observed in our research although we obtained slightly higher slopes in yield vs etc relationships the weaker response in 2014 can be attributed to the fact that large amount of soil water at planting time and the above normal rainfall in the growing season contributed to obtaining rainfed yields similar to irrigated treatments therefore the role of irrigation in increasing crop etc was small 3 8 crop water productivity cwp the cwp ranged from 0 82 to 0 95 kg m 3 in 2014 and from 0 95 to 1 25 kg m 3 in 2015 due to differences in weather conditions significant differences p 0 05 were observed in cwp between 2014 and 2015 growing seasons table 9 in 2014 no significant differences were observed in cwp between treatments table 10 however in 2015 there were significant differences due to irrigation treatments only the rainfed treatment with overall cwp of 1 02 kg m 3 was significantly lower than fit with cwp of 1 13 kg m 3 during both years the cwp averaged over all seeding rates were lowest for rainfed treatment and increased with increase in irrigation amounts in 2014 rainfed treatment had cwp in the range of 0 87 0 9 kg m 3 where lowest cwp was measured for 432 250 seeds ha 1 and the highest was measured for 308 750 seeds ha 1 cwp had the same range of 0 82 0 93 kg m 3 for 75 fit and fit and the highest value of 0 93 kg m 3 was observed for 308 750 seeds ha 1 in both irrigation treatments the seeding rate of 308 750 seeds ha 1 had the highest cwp among all treatments except in 50 fit in which 185 250 seeds ha 1 had higher cwp than 308 750 seeds ha 1 during 2015 cwp of 0 95 1 11 kg m 3 was measured for rainfed treatment and 1 07 1 25 kg m 3 for fit the highest values of cwp in different irrigation treatments did not occur for the same population as was the case in 2014 except 50 fit cwp was highest for 247 000 308 750 432 250 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 for rainfed 50 fit 75 fit and fit payero et al 2005 reported smaller soybean cwp values in a semi arid region in the range of 0 27 0 44 kg m 3 under sdi and 0 23 0 60 and 0 59 0 74 kg m 3 in 2003 and 2004 under solid set sprinkler irrigation system irmak et al 2014 reported slightly higher cwp than payero et al 2005 which ranged from 0 77 to 0 89 and 0 85 1 02 kg m 3 in 2007 and 2008 respectively the results obtained in our research are similar to that reported by irmak et al 2014 and were higher for some treatments due to difference in seeding rates the reasons for high cwp values are higher yields attainable at the research site the large precipitation amounts during the season and higher water holding capacity and organic matter content of soils irmak and sharma 2015 reported that the statewide average 78 counties for a 24 year period from 1986 to 2009 irrigated cwp for soybean as 0 64 kg m 3 the wide variability in cwp can be ascribed to several factors such as climate characteristics irrigation water management soil and nutrient management differences in variety cultivar hybrid response etc for example payero et al 2005 reported soybean cwp values in a semi arid area to be in the range of 2 7 4 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2002 under sdi 2 3 6 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2003 and 5 9 7 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2004 under solid set sprinkler irrigation higher cwp values were reported by irmak et al 2014 who measured cwp range of 7 71 8 94 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 8 5 10 22 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2007 and 2008 respectively the higher cwp values were obtained due to higher yields attainable at the research site and due to large amount of precipitation resulting in high productivity with reduced irrigation amounts and etc emphasizing the significant benefits of capturing any potential rainfall in the crop root zone and utilizing it toward meeting etc demand and yield productivity enhancements in cwp can also be achieved by adopting practices like increasing the harvest index improving drought and salinity tolerance adjusting planting dates and tillage to reduce evaporation and increase infiltration kijne et al 2003 practicing deficit or limited irrigation when feasible advantageous or necessary reducing soil evaporation losses practicing effective irrigation management cultivating drought tolerant varieties hybrids cwp can be increased significantly if irrigation is reduced i e through practicing limited or deficit irrigation strategies when feasible and water deficit is induced or other yield increasing management practices strategies are deployed i e effective weed management fertilizer management soil management disease management etc however there is a trade off between increasing cwp and yield reduction when deficit or limited irrigation is practiced increase in cwp due to reduction in irrigation amount in turn reduction in etc often results in reduction in grain yield which may not be preferred in many cases in terms of meeting food and fiber demand of growing population such increase in cwp can also be achieved through genetic improvements which can enhance the ratio of photosynthesis to transpiration and dry matter yield accumulation 4 summary and conclusions the field study was conducted during 2014 and 2015 growing seasons to evaluate the impact of five soybean seeding rates 185 250 247 000 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 under four irrigation strategies 50 fit 75 fit and fit and rainfed treatment on yield etc iwp cwp and irrigation vs etc relationships under sdi statistically no significant yield differences were observed due to seeding rates in both growing seasons while significant yield differences occurred due to irrigation regimes in drier year in 2015 irrigation treatments resulted in significantly greater yield than maximum rainfed yield of 3 85 tons ha 1 in 2015 in contrast to 2014 in which high rainfed yield of 4 77 tons ha 1 was not significantly different from irrigation treatments similar yields of 4 3 tons ha 1 for 308 750 370 500 and 432 250 seeds ha 1 and 4 tons ha 1 for 185 250 and 247 000 seeds ha 1 was recorded this suggests that yield plateau was obtained at 4 3 tons ha 1 and no further yield increase was observed with increase in seeding rates beyond 308 750 seeds ha 1 irrigation treatments had an impact on soil water status in the root zone in general soil water depletion increased with increase in seeding rates and was minimal beyond 1 20 m soil depth the seasonal etc when averaged for seeding rates was lowest in rainfed treatments than in irrigated treatments however seasonal etc was not always highest for the fit due to differences in seeding rates seasonal etc exhibited a linear response to irrigation amounts and seed yield during both growing seasons the slope values excluding the negative slope indicated that for every 25 4 mm increase in irrigation application the etc would increase in the range of 5 8 17 3 mm in 2014 and 6 1 17 3 mm in 2015 depending on the seeding rates the slopes of regression line between grain yield and etc for all seeding rates were in the range of 0 0003 and 0 0205 tons ha 1 in 2014 and 0 0008 0 017 tons ha 1 in 2015 indicating an increase in grain yield from 0 01 to 0 52 tons ha 1 in 2014 and 0 02 0 43 tons ha 1 in 2015 for every 25 4 mm of etc beyond the intercept in both years the cwp averaged over all seeding rates was lowest for rainfed treatment and increased with increase in irrigation amounts relationships were developed for seasonal etc vs yield and seasonal etc vs irrigation amounts which indicated a linear response for both growing seasons statistically the seasonal etc amounts and cwp differed only due to difference in irrigation treatments in 2015 while no significant variation was observed in 2014

tss to calculate annual water balances water use efficiency and water quality impacts of these crops mean annual et µ 499 mm yr 1 and tile drainage µ 90 mm yr 1 were similar between crops due in part to high variability though cumulative drainage over three paired years was 326 mm for silage maize and 214 mm for alfalfa annual soil water storage was similar for alfalfa 25 44 mm yr 1 and silage maize 27 50 mm yr 1 and confidence bounds indicated water budgets were balanced inherent water use efficiency iwue was 70 greater for maize than alfalfa 30 8 versus 18 1 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 paired watersheds analysis indicated alfalfa reduced no3 n but increased drp concentrations in drainage compared to silage maize however weekly loads of no3 n and drp were reduced by 72 and 33 respectively and annual tss loads reduced by 37 with alfalfa compared to silage maize results highlight the value of alfalfa for managing on farm water flows and water quality during critical periods of the year

as the dairy industry has consolidated and farm sizes have increased producers are increasingly reliant on maize silage in place of alfalfa and other perennial forage and hay crops silage maize has

1997 toth and fox 1998 osterholz et al 2019 however less research has directly compared the water use and water balances between these crops especially at the whole field scale alfalfa and maize have contrasting growth phenology and water use patterns which may have subsequent impacts on soil water storage and subsurface drainage understanding the agroecosystem water balances water usage and water quality impacts of these two important crops is essential for sustainable water management on dairy farms in the region we initiated a production scale study at three field sites representing common forage management systems in the upper midwest across the three study fields we monitored two cropping systems 1 irrigated continuous silage maize and 2 irrigated silage maize alfalfa the systems were designed for dairy forage production received applications of liquid dairy manure in most years and were irrigated and artificially tile drained the study utilizes year round field scale measurements of precipitation crop evapotranspiration soil water storage and subsurface tile drainage along with farmer supplied irrigation rates to calculate annual water balances and water use efficiency of the forage production systems we also measured concentrations of nitrate nitrogen no3 n dissolved reactive p drp and total suspended solids tss in subsurface tile drainage and calculated exported loads of each contaminant to assess the impacts of crop management on water quality our objective was to evaluate how modern dairy forage crop manure and irrigation management influence field scale water balances water use efficiency and water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 measurement sites the study was conducted on three 65 ha fields on a privately owned dairy farm in west central minnesota research fields designated as west field east field and southeast field were managed as part of the cooperating dairy with all management decisions made by the farm operators research was conducted primarily in the east and west fields with supplementary data collected in the southeast field as described below the soils in these fields were formed in calcareous loamy glacial till and consisted primarily of a somewhat poorly drained hamerly clay loam fine loamy mixed superactive frigid aeric calciaquolls a moderately well drained aastad clay loam fine loamy mixed superactive frigid pachic argiudolls and a poorly drained parnell silty clay loam fine smectitic frigid vertic argiaquolls textural analysis of soils in each field revealed that clay content increased with depth from 38 at 0 15 cm to 40 at 60 90 cm data not shown the fields are extensively tile drained and were managed with center pivot irrigation beginning in may 2009 fig 1 water flow paths are dominated by subsurface tile drainage systems and watersheds were delineated with arcgis ver 10 1 based on maps of the tile drainage network resulting delineated watersheds had areas of 26 7 and 42 1 ha for the east and west fields respectively the drainage system in the east watershed had 18 gravel covered surface inlets while the west watershed had 24 the east watershed discharged into the subsurface drainage system of an adjacent field while the west watershed discharged directly into a nearby slough approximately 0 74 ha of the east watershed lay on the west field and 0 15 ha of the west watershed drained to the east field no drainage data were collected in the southeast field precipitation was measured in the east and west fields beginning on 4 sept 2007 using a tipping bucket gauge with a manual rain gauge

alfalfa for three years followed by two years of silage maize alfalfa silage maize 2011 2015 maize silage was harvested each year on dates ranging from 28 aug to 29 sept alfalfa was fall seeded following silage harvest and was harvested twice during the establishment year and 4 5 times per year thereafter center pivot irrigators with drop nozzles t3000 trashbuster nelson irrigation corp walla walla wa usa were installed in october 2008 and irrigation began in may 2009 and continued each year throughout the study water applied via irrigation was determined by the producer and recorded after each irrigation event liquid dairy manure was applied to the forage systems in most years in the east field liquid dairy manure was drag line injected in fall 2008 no manure was applied in 2009 and from 2010 to 2015 manure was fertigated via center pivot irrigation system during the growing season in the west and southeast fields liquid dairy manure was injected following maize silage harvest each fall for alfalfa manure was injected in the fall prior to seeding and in mature years was applied after the first harvest via subsurface deposition slurry applicator aerway ssd holland

groups of three subsamples were combined into 300 ml glass jars containing 0 6 ml concentrated h2so4 clesceri et al 1998 samples were retrieved weekly and a 20 ml aliquot was filtered to 0 2 µm and

positioned on an irrigator pivot at the center of each field providing at least 380 m of fetch in all directions the analyzer and anemometer were adjusted relative to crop height throughout each

the east and west fields late each summer from 25 aug to 10 sept by collecting 49 soil cores per field in a 113 m grid pattern fig 1 cores were collected to a depth of 90 cm using a hydraulic sampling probe with a core inner diameter of 3 8 cm subdivided into 0 5 5 15 15 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm layers weighed then dried at 37 c to determine moisture content soil moisture content was calculated volumetrically based on the gravimetric water content and the soil bulk density then converted to a water depth changes in measured soil water storage δsm were then calculated between years for comparison annual soil water storage was also calculated via difference δsc by rearranging the water budget terms in eq 2 2 6 water budgets we used the following general equation for the annual water budget 2 p i et d δ s where p is annual precipitation i is annual irrigation d is annual tile drainage et is annual evapotranspiration and δs is the annual change in water storage budgets were calculated on a water year wy basis starting 1 october the previous year and ending 30 september we assumed no deep seepage as part of the water budget calculations given the high clay content of the soils 38 40 and the artificial drainage in these fields we calculated the drainage coefficient and et coefficient as the ratio of total annual drainage or et to the total precipitation plus irrigation for a given year 2 7 experimental design statistical analyses average annual water budget components were compared for paired years using two sample t tests for field or crop further analysis of weekly observations was conducted using a paired watershed design epa 1993 splitting the dataset into two periods 1 a calibration period when silage maize was grown in both fields 2010 2012 and 2 a treatment period when the west field was rotated to alfalfa and the east remained in silage maize 2013 2015 our hypothesis was that rotating to alfalfa would reduce tile drainage flow contaminant concentrations and total loads of no3 n drp and sediment relative to continuous silage maize the relationship between fields was described by a simple linear regression between the paired weekly observations during the calibration period we examined autocorrelation plots of the normalized residuals and plots of the normalized residuals vs predicted values to detect serial correlation if present the model was then fit with temporal correlation structures using the gls function in the r package nlme pinheiro et al 2013 and results were compared using aic to determine the correlation structure that best accounted for temporal patterns in the data if the calibration relationship between fields was significant we then added data from the treatment period and fit fixed effects of period and a period x field interaction a significant p 0 05 effect of period indicated different intercepts for the calibration and treatment periods while a significant period x field interaction indicated differing slopes between periods or a response to the cropping treatment means reported in the text are back transformed to the original scale all statistical analyses described herein were conducted in program r r core team 2016 3 results 3 1 water budgets annual wy precipitation ranged from 417 mm in 2012 to 904 mm in 2010 with average annual precipitation of 629 mm yr 1 in the east field and 634 mm yr 1 in the west field table 2 table 3 table 4 for reference the 1991 2020 normal annual precipitation at the nearby wcroc station is 684 mm noaa 2021 precipitation measurements between fields were generally in close agreement differing by only 1 on average with a maximum of difference of 51 mm or 7 in 2011 irrigation began in 2009 and application rates in the west field averaged 46 mm yr 1 range of 0 130 mm yr 1 while rates in the east field were 48 mm yr 1 range of 13 116 mm yr 1 on average silage maize received 58 mm yr 1 of irrigation water and alfalfa 70 mm yr 1 although application rates for each crop varied considerably by field and year at the discretion of the producer et ranged from 463 to 618 mm yr 1 across the three study fields with mean annual et of 517 mm yr 1 in the west field 489 mm yr 1 in the east field and 465 mm yr 1 in the southeast field silage maize et reached an average annual maximum of 5 6 0 3 mm d 1 mean se fig 2 typically by 21 july 5 days though in 2012 it peaked at 7 7 mm d 1 owing to its c3 photosynthetic pathway and correspondingly lower optimum temperature alfalfa et typically peaked several weeks earlier than maize reaching a maximum of 6 5 0 2 mm d 1 by 28 june 10 days however alfalfa et also exhibited peaks 2 3 times per year just prior to each harvest with peaks occurring as early as 29 may and as late as 23 july moreover the duration of alfalfa water usage et 0 spanned 174 days yr 1 on average compared to only 106 days yr 1 for silage maize despite that for paired years 2013 2015 the mean annual et was similar between crops p 0 05 with 492 11 mm yr 1 for silage maize and 506 15 mm yr 1 for alfalfa fig 3 annual tile drainage ranged from 26 to 359 mm yr 1 and averaged 156 mm yr 1 in the east field and 151 mm yr 1 in the west field fig 4 for paired years drainage was similar between crops t 1 01 p 0 369 with 108 25 mm yr 1 for silage maize and 71 28 mm yr 1 for alfalfa across all study years mean annual drainage was 173 31 mm yr 1 for silage maize cumulative drainage over the three paired years was 326 mm for silage maize and 214 mm for alfalfa suggesting differences between the crops despite the lack of statistical power to distinguish the annual drainage coefficient drainage depth normalized by precipitation plus irrigation varied from 0 05 in the driest year 2012 to 0 46 in the wettest year 2010 for paired years the average drainage coefficient under alfalfa including the seeding year was 0 11 0 06 and 0 16 0 03 under silage maize t 2 65 p 0 035 over the entire study period the drainage coefficient for silage maize was 0 24 0 11 the annual water balance or the calculated change in soil water storage δsc ranged from 113 194 mm yr 1 whereas the measured change in soil water storage δsm ranged from 95 121 mm yr 1 on an annual basis measured and calculated soil water storage differed by as much as 164 mm with δsc generally indicating greater storage than δsm the mean annual difference between the two measures was only 7 mm in the west field and 37 mm in the east field corresponding to 0 8 and 4 5 of total water inputs respectively when averaged over years and fields the two measures indicated similar changes in soil water storage t 0 55 p 0 586 with mean δsm of 5 17 mm yr 1 and mean δsc of 22 17 mm yr 1 however neither measure differed significantly from zero i e no change in soil water storage suggesting that over time the water budgets were balanced for these two fields for the paired years of 2013 2015 δsm indicated similar water storage for alfalfa 25 44 mm yr 1 and silage maize 27 50 mm yr 1 t 0 03 p 0 975 3 2 crop inherent water use efficiency growing season iwue ranged from 0 33 to 88 4 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 fig 5 and mean daily iwue was greater for silage maize 30 8 0 4 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 than alfalfa 18 1 0 3 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 annual maximum iwue of silage maize averaged 67 3 2 0 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 and typically occurred by 20 july 2 days however during the driest year of the study silage maize iwue peaked at 88 4 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 demonstrating the high efficiency of the c4 photosynthetic pathway in contrast maximum iwue for alfalfa was typically 52 3 2 0 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 and was observed as early as 16 may and as late as 28 september 3 3 water quality paired watershed regression analysis revealed significant relationships between east and west field weekly tile flow concentrations of no3 n and drp and loads of no3 n drp and tss during the calibration period table 5 no relationship was observed for tss concentration between fields during calibration precluding further analysis for this response for all other responses treatment period data were then added and each regression model was updated with fixed effects for period and a period x field interaction for weekly flow these effects did not significantly improve model fit indicating similar slopes and intercepts between periods and no impact of alfalfa on weekly tile drainage flow rates fig 6 in contrast including terms for period and a period x field interaction improved the fitted model for no3 n concentrations both slopes and intercepts differed between sampling periods indicating a treatment effect of alfalfa based on the calibration equation the mean predicted no3 n concentration in treatment tile drainage was 43 6 mg l 1 whereas the observed mean under alfalfa was 26 1 mg l 1 a reduction of 40 by rotating from silage maize to alfalfa table 6 similarly including a period x field interaction term improved model fit for drp concentrations with significantly increased slope during treatment compared to calibration drp concentrations increased nearly fourfold during the alfalfa treatment period from a predicted mean of 0 17 mg l 1 to an observed mean of 0 66 mg l 1 fitted models for weekly no3 n and drp loads were both improved by including a period x field interaction term all slopes during the treatment period were reduced relative to the calibration period indicating reduced weekly no3 n and drp loads after converting to alfalfa fig 7 based on the calibration models predicted mean weekly loads of no3 n and drp during treatment were 5 1 and 0 06 kg ha 1 respectively however observed mean weekly loads were 1 4 and 0 04 kg ha 1 representing 72 and 33 reductions in mean weekly loads respectively after converting to alfalfa for tss loads including a period x field interaction did not improve model fit indicating similar slopes between the calibration and treatment periods and that no change in weekly tss loads was found in response to converting to alfalfa mean annual no3 n loads during the treatment period were 33 5 kg ha 1 yr 1 from silage maize and 11 1 kg ha 1 yr 1 from alfalfa a 67 reduction table 7 despite differences in weekly loads mean annual drp loads during the treatment period were similar between crops averaging 0 50 0 03 kg ha 1 yr 1 from alfalfa and 0 59 0 2 kg ha 1 yr 1 from silage maize mean annual tss loads were 66 lower from alfalfa 74 11 kg ha 1 yr 1 than from silage maize 217 40 kg ha 1 yr 1 4 discussion 4 1 water quality our findings are consistent with a number of other studies that show greater losses of nitrate p and sediment from maize than alfalfa e g berg and carter 1980 randall et al 1997 toth and fox 1998 panuska et al 2011 osterholz et al 2019 however despite water quality improvement with alfalfa nitrate and drp concentrations in drainage remained high during the treatment period due to high manure application rates both prior to and during the alfalfa phase after the establishment year alfalfa received an average of 246 kg total n ha 1 resulting in fwm nitrate concentration of 26 1 mg l 1 in drainage water alfalfa is an efficient n scavenger russelle et al 2001 but manure applications at the rates observed in this study clearly exceeded its n uptake capacity when expressed as a percentage of manure inputs n export was 4 51 from alfalfa while it was 24 5 from maize for comparison with no supplemental n randall et al 1997 found a nitrate concentration of 3 mg l 1 in subsurface drainage water from alfalfa or 37 times lower than continuous maize further improvements in water quality could be made by reducing manure application rates to alfalfa or with alternative manure application timing and methods that increase manurial n usage by the crop interestingly drp concentrations were higher from alfalfa than silage maize during the treatment period however alfalfa did receive substantially more manure p 33 kg p ha 1 yr 1 than silage maize 3 kg p ha 1 yr 1 during this period examination of weekly drainage drp concentrations in 2014 and 2015 revealed that the highest concentrations up 5 mg l 1 occurred within a week after alfalfa harvest in mid june or mid august however concentrations were also elevated 3 4 mg l 1 in december and again in march during snowmelt other studies have found higher dissolved p losses from alfalfa than maize with equivalent p applications wendt and corey 1980 panuska et al 2011 in those instances higher p leachate resulted from freezing and cell lysing of high p content alfalfa shoot residues over winter timmons et al 1970 wendt and corey 1980 our observations are consistent with these findings and highlight the potential for elevated drp concentrations when ground coverage is reduced following alfalfa harvest despite higher concentrations from alfalfa drp loads in the present study were substantially lower than silage maize because of lower drainage volumes moreover when expressed as a percentage of manure inputs export of p was 1 52 from alfalfa while it was 17 7 from maize 4 2 water balances as a cool season c3 perennial alfalfa remains physiologically active throughout a much longer portion of the growing season than c4 annuals such as maize in the upper midwest this activity coincides with heavy spring and fall rains when most of the subsurface drainage occurs in principle active water use during critical spring and fall periods should result in lower antecedent soil moisture and reduce both surface and subsurface runoff during precipitation events zehe and blöschl 2004 however we found no significant differences in tile flow between crops at least on an average annual basis this could be due in part to the high interannual variability in these measures especially for tile drainage differences in catchment size number of tile inlets and tile patterns may have contributed to differences in lateral flow and discharge between fields adding error to drainage estimates nevertheless examination of drainage patterns during paired years as in fig 3 suggests differences between the crops under similar hydrologic conditions cumulative drainage over the 3 year treatment period was 326 mm for silage maize and 214 mm for alfalfa a difference of 112 mm moreover 58 124 mm of the alfalfa drainage occurred in 2013 when the crop was being established and water use was low for maize over 70 of subsurface drainage losses an average of 78 mm yr 1 occurred during spring april to june for alfalfa c assimilation and water use extended for an additional 68 days per year compared to maize resulting in 20 mm yr 1 greater spring et and 9 mm yr 1 greater in fall this resulted in 35 lower 27 mm drainage losses for alfalfa than maize in spring this highlights the value of alfalfa for managing on farm water flows and water quality during these critical periods of the year both measured and calculated soil water storage were statistically comparable between the two crops given similar et and greater drainage from maize it was expected that soil water storage would be greater for alfalfa however cumulative measurement error in precipitation et and drainage along this substantial annual variability likely hindered our ability to detect potential differences between crops examination of the water balances for paired years in fig 3 suggests that soil water storage in fact tended to be greater for alfalfa in 2014 and 2015 when the crop was mature alfalfa is deeply rooted and can improve soil aggregate stability and water holding capacity over time angers 1992 another possible explanation is that any surplus water simply moved through the profile beyond our 90 cm soil sampling depth and eventually contributed to groundwater recharge despite the high clay content of the soils alfalfa root channels can create preferential flow pathways that increase infiltration rates to deeper soil layers guo et al 2019 this could also explain the substantial differences between measured and calculated soil water storage as the calculated balances included any water that may have percolated below our soil sampling depth 4 3 water use efficiency our estimates of iwue are comparable to those of other crops with similar photosynthetic mechanisms for example dold et al 2019 found that iwue of maize in iowa ranged from 30 7 to 32 6 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 depending on tillage management whereas we observed a seasonal average of 30 8 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 those authors found a seasonal average of 20 3 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 for c3 soybean which is comparable to our findings for the perennial c3 alfalfa of 18 1 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 these measurements demonstrate the impressive efficiency of the maize c4 photosynthetic pathway relative to c3 crops such as alfalfa average dry matter yields in the present study were 17 5 and 9 7 mg ha 1 for silage maize and alfalfa haylage respectively this corresponds to 41 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 for maize and 23 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 for alfalfa no forage quality data were collected as part of this study however utilizing standard forage quality values for each crop nasem 2021 milk production was calculated according to undersander et al 2006 2016 milk production per ton of forage was similar between alfalfa haylage 1550 kg mg 1 and maize silage 1585 kg mg 1 however due to the large difference in dm production milk yield on an area basis was nearly double for maize silage 27 729 kg ha 1 compared to alfalfa 15 035 kg ha 1 this corresponds to 56 and 30 kg milk ha 1 mm 1 of water usage respectively conversely each kilogram of milk produced with silage maize results in over 60 more no3 n and tss loading to waterways than a kilogram of milk produced with alfalfa alfalfa water use efficiency appears artificially low when expressed in terms of c or dry matter symbiotic n fixation larger proportion of root biomass and higher protein content incur a high cost in photosynthetic assimilates asseng and hsiao 2000 these additional goods and ecosystem services can add value to agricultural landscapes and dairy supply chains supporting the notion that a broader suite of outputs and yield vs ecosystem service tradeoffs should be considered when evaluating the impacts of different agricultural production practices particularly in the face of a changing climate 5 conclusions the comprehensive water budgets presented here show that despite similar annual et silage maize had greater tile drainage flow and loss of associated contaminants than alfalfa however silage maize was much more efficient in water usage nearly doubling the rate of gross co2 assimilation of alfalfa per unit of water due to both the higher intrinsic wue of c4 species and the carbon cost for n fixation in alfalfa this high water use efficiency and yield has facilitated dramatic gains in dairy productivity over the past decades however these gains have come at the expense of water quality with higher nitrate drp and sediment loads from silage maize than alfalfa this highlights the value of alfalfa for managing on farm water flows and water quality during critical periods of the year as is often the case the challenge comes in weighing these environmental benefits against the production gains that have driven the increased use of maize silage in the dairy industry key findings alfalfa and silage maize et were similar for paired years 506 mm yr 1 alfalfa 492 mm yr 1 silage maize mean annual drainage was similar for silage maize and alfalfa 109 vs 71 mm yr 1 drainage coefficient was 0 11

precipitation irrigation evapotranspiration et soil water storage subsurface tile drainage and drainage concentrations and loads of nitrate no3 n dissolved reactive p drp and total suspended solids tss to calculate annual water balances water use efficiency and water quality impacts of these crops mean annual et µ 499 mm yr 1 and tile drainage µ 90 mm yr 1 were similar between crops due in part to high variability though cumulative drainage over three paired years was 326 mm for silage maize and 214 mm for alfalfa annual soil water storage was similar for alfalfa 25 44 mm yr 1 and silage maize 27 50 mm yr 1 and confidence bounds indicated water budgets were balanced inherent water use efficiency iwue was 70 greater for maize than alfalfa 30 8 versus 18 1 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 paired watersheds analysis indicated alfalfa reduced no3 n but increased drp concentrations in drainage compared to silage maize however weekly loads of no3 n and drp were reduced by 72 and 33 respectively and annual tss loads reduced by 37 with alfalfa compared to silage maize results highlight the value of alfalfa for managing on farm water flows and water quality during critical periods of the year

as the dairy industry has consolidated and farm sizes have increased producers are increasingly reliant on maize silage in place of alfalfa and other perennial forage and hay crops silage maize has

quality impacts of these two important crops is essential for sustainable water management on dairy farms in the region we initiated a production scale study at three field sites representing common forage management systems in the upper midwest across the three study fields we monitored two cropping systems 1 irrigated continuous silage maize and 2 irrigated silage maize alfalfa the systems were designed for dairy forage production received applications of liquid dairy manure in most years and were irrigated and artificially tile drained the study utilizes year round field scale measurements of precipitation crop evapotranspiration soil water storage and subsurface tile drainage along with farmer supplied irrigation rates to calculate annual water balances and water use efficiency of the forage production systems we also measured concentrations of nitrate nitrogen no3 n dissolved reactive p drp and total suspended solids tss in subsurface tile drainage and calculated exported loads of each contaminant to assess the impacts of crop management on water quality our objective was to evaluate how modern dairy forage crop manure and irrigation management influence field scale water balances water use efficiency and water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 measurement sites the study was conducted on three 65 ha fields on a privately owned dairy farm in west central minnesota research fields designated as west field east field and southeast field were managed as part of the cooperating dairy with all management decisions made by the farm operators research was conducted primarily in the east and west fields with supplementary data collected in the southeast field as described below the soils in these fields were formed in calcareous loamy glacial till and consisted primarily of a somewhat poorly drained hamerly clay loam fine loamy mixed superactive frigid aeric calciaquolls a moderately well drained aastad clay loam fine loamy mixed superactive frigid pachic argiudolls and a poorly drained parnell silty clay loam fine smectitic frigid vertic argiaquolls textural analysis of soils in each field revealed that clay content increased with depth from 38 at 0 15 cm to 40 at 60 90 cm data not shown the fields are extensively tile drained and were managed with center pivot irrigation beginning in may 2009 fig 1 water flow paths are dominated by subsurface tile drainage systems and watersheds were delineated with arcgis ver 10 1 based on maps of the tile drainage network resulting delineated watersheds had areas of 26 7 and 42 1 ha for the east and west fields respectively the drainage system in the east watershed had 18 gravel covered surface inlets while the west watershed had 24 the east watershed discharged into the subsurface drainage system of an adjacent field while the west watershed discharged directly into a nearby slough approximately 0 74 ha of the east watershed lay on the west field and 0 15 ha of the west watershed drained to the east field no drainage data were collected in the southeast field precipitation was measured in the east and west fields beginning on 4 sept 2007 using a tipping bucket gauge with a manual rain gauge

alfalfa for three years followed by two years of silage maize alfalfa silage maize 2011 2015 maize silage was harvested each year on dates ranging from 28 aug to 29 sept alfalfa was fall seeded

after each irrigation event liquid dairy manure was applied to the forage systems in most years in the east field liquid dairy manure was drag line injected in fall 2008 no manure was applied in 2009 and from 2010 to 2015 manure was fertigated via center pivot irrigation system during the growing season in the west and southeast fields liquid dairy manure was injected following maize silage harvest each fall for alfalfa manure was injected in the fall prior to seeding and in mature years was applied after the first harvest via subsurface deposition slurry applicator aerway ssd holland

submain at the edge of the east and west fields details of the water monitoring and sampling system can be found in krueger et al 2013 feyereisen et al 2015 and gamble et al 2018 briefly for the 2007

groups of three subsamples were combined into 300 ml glass jars containing 0 6 ml concentrated h2so4 clesceri et al 1998 samples were retrieved weekly and a 20 ml aliquot was filtered to 0 2 µm and

positioned on an irrigator pivot at the center of each field providing at least 380 m of fetch in all directions the analyzer and anemometer were adjusted relative to crop height throughout each

the east and west fields late each summer from 25 aug to 10 sept by collecting 49 soil cores per field in a 113 m grid pattern fig 1 cores were collected to a depth of 90 cm using a hydraulic sampling probe with a core inner diameter of 3 8 cm subdivided into 0 5 5 15 15 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm layers weighed then dried at 37 c to determine moisture content soil moisture content was calculated volumetrically based on the gravimetric water content and the soil bulk density then converted to a water depth changes in measured soil water storage δsm were then calculated between years for comparison annual soil water storage was also calculated via difference δsc by rearranging the water budget terms in eq 2 2 6 water budgets we used the following general equation for the annual water budget 2 p i et d δ s where p is annual precipitation i is annual irrigation d is annual tile drainage et is annual evapotranspiration and δs is the annual change in water storage budgets were calculated on a water year wy basis starting 1 october the previous year and ending 30 september we assumed no deep seepage as part of the water budget calculations given the high clay content of the soils 38 40 and the artificial drainage in these fields we calculated the drainage coefficient and et coefficient as the ratio of total annual drainage or et to the total precipitation plus irrigation for a given year 2 7 experimental design statistical analyses average annual water budget components were compared for paired years using two sample t tests for field or crop further analysis of weekly observations was conducted using a paired watershed design epa 1993 splitting the dataset into two periods 1 a calibration period when silage maize was grown in both fields 2010 2012 and 2 a treatment period when the west field was rotated to alfalfa and the east remained in silage maize 2013 2015 our hypothesis was that rotating to alfalfa would reduce tile drainage flow contaminant concentrations and total loads of no3 n drp and sediment relative to continuous silage maize the relationship between fields was described by a simple linear regression between the paired weekly observations during the calibration period we examined autocorrelation plots of the normalized residuals and plots of the normalized residuals vs predicted values to detect serial correlation if present the model was then fit with temporal correlation structures using the gls function in the r package nlme pinheiro et al 2013 and results were compared using aic to determine the correlation structure that best accounted for temporal patterns in the data if the calibration relationship between fields was significant we then added data from the treatment period and fit fixed effects of period and a period x field interaction a significant p 0 05 effect of period indicated different intercepts for the calibration and treatment periods while a significant period x field interaction indicated differing slopes between periods or a response to the cropping treatment means reported in the text are back transformed to the original scale all statistical analyses described herein were conducted in program r r core team 2016 3 results 3 1 water budgets annual wy precipitation ranged from 417 mm in 2012 to 904 mm in 2010 with average annual precipitation of 629 mm yr 1 in the east field and 634 mm yr 1 in the west field table 2 table 3 table 4 for reference the 1991 2020 normal annual precipitation at the nearby wcroc station is 684 mm noaa 2021 precipitation measurements between fields were generally in close agreement differing by only 1 on average with a maximum of difference of 51 mm or 7 in 2011 irrigation began in 2009 and application rates in the west field averaged 46 mm yr 1 range of 0 130 mm yr 1 while rates in the east field were 48 mm yr 1 range of 13 116 mm yr 1 on average silage maize received 58 mm yr 1 of irrigation water and alfalfa 70 mm yr 1 although application rates for each crop varied considerably by field and year at the discretion of the producer et ranged from 463 to 618 mm yr 1 across the three study fields with mean annual et of 517 mm yr 1 in the west field 489 mm yr 1 in the east field and 465 mm yr 1 in the southeast field silage maize et reached an average annual maximum of 5 6 0 3 mm d 1 mean se fig 2 typically by 21 july 5 days though in 2012 it peaked at 7 7 mm d 1 owing to its c3 photosynthetic pathway and correspondingly lower optimum temperature alfalfa et typically peaked several weeks earlier than maize reaching a maximum of 6 5 0 2 mm d 1 by 28 june 10 days however alfalfa et also exhibited peaks 2 3 times per year just prior to each harvest with peaks occurring as early as 29 may and as late as 23 july moreover the duration of alfalfa water usage et 0 spanned 174 days yr 1 on average compared to only 106 days yr 1 for silage maize despite that for paired years 2013 2015 the mean annual et was similar between crops p 0 05 with 492 11 mm yr 1 for silage maize and 506 15 mm yr 1 for alfalfa fig 3 annual tile drainage ranged from 26 to 359 mm yr 1 and averaged 156 mm yr 1 in the east field and 151 mm yr 1 in the west field fig 4 for paired years drainage was similar between crops t 1 01 p 0 369 with 108 25 mm yr 1 for silage maize and 71 28 mm yr 1 for alfalfa across all study years mean annual drainage was 173 31 mm yr 1 for silage maize cumulative drainage over the three paired years was 326 mm for silage maize and 214 mm for alfalfa suggesting differences between the crops despite the lack of statistical power to distinguish the annual drainage coefficient drainage depth normalized by precipitation plus irrigation varied from 0 05 in the driest year 2012 to 0 46 in the wettest year 2010 for paired years the average drainage coefficient under alfalfa including the seeding year was 0 11 0 06 and 0 16 0 03 under silage maize t 2 65 p 0 035 over the entire study period the drainage coefficient for silage maize was 0 24 0 11 the annual water balance or the calculated change in soil water storage δsc ranged from 113 194 mm yr 1 whereas the measured change in soil water storage δsm ranged from 95 121 mm yr 1 on an annual basis measured and calculated soil water storage differed by as much as 164 mm with δsc generally indicating greater storage than δsm the mean annual difference between the two measures was only 7 mm in the west field and 37 mm in the east field corresponding to 0 8 and 4 5 of total water inputs respectively when averaged over years and fields the two measures indicated similar changes in soil water storage t 0 55 p 0 586 with mean δsm of 5 17 mm yr 1 and mean δsc of 22 17 mm yr 1 however neither measure differed significantly from zero i e no change in soil water storage suggesting that over time the water budgets were balanced for these two fields for the paired years of 2013 2015 δsm indicated similar water storage for alfalfa 25 44 mm yr 1 and silage maize 27 50 mm yr 1 t 0 03 p 0 975 3 2 crop inherent water use efficiency growing season iwue ranged from 0 33 to 88 4 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 fig 5 and mean daily iwue was greater for silage maize 30 8 0 4 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 than alfalfa 18 1 0 3 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 annual maximum iwue of silage maize averaged 67 3 2 0 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 and typically occurred by 20 july 2 days however during the driest year of the study silage maize iwue peaked at 88 4 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 demonstrating the high efficiency of the c4 photosynthetic pathway in contrast maximum iwue for alfalfa was typically 52 3 2 0 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 and was observed as early as 16 may and as late as 28 september 3 3 water quality paired watershed regression analysis revealed significant relationships between east and west field weekly tile flow concentrations of no3 n and drp and loads of no3 n drp and tss during the calibration period table 5 no relationship was observed for tss concentration between fields during calibration precluding further analysis for this response for all other responses treatment period data were then added and each regression model was updated with fixed effects for period and a period x field interaction for weekly flow these effects did not significantly improve model fit indicating similar slopes and intercepts between periods and no impact of alfalfa on weekly tile drainage flow rates fig 6 in contrast including terms for period and a period x field interaction improved the fitted model for no3 n concentrations both slopes and intercepts differed between sampling periods indicating a treatment effect of alfalfa based on the calibration equation the mean predicted no3 n concentration in treatment tile drainage was 43 6 mg l 1 whereas the observed mean under alfalfa was 26 1 mg l 1 a reduction of 40 by rotating from silage maize to alfalfa table 6 similarly including a period x field interaction term improved model fit for drp concentrations with significantly increased slope during treatment compared to calibration drp concentrations increased nearly fourfold during the alfalfa treatment period from a predicted mean of 0 17 mg l 1 to an observed mean of 0 66 mg l 1 fitted models for weekly no3 n and drp loads were both improved by including a period x field interaction term all slopes during the treatment period were reduced relative to the calibration period indicating reduced weekly no3 n and drp loads after converting to alfalfa fig 7 based on the calibration models predicted mean weekly loads of no3 n and drp during treatment were 5 1 and 0 06 kg ha 1 respectively however observed mean weekly loads were 1 4 and 0 04 kg ha 1 representing 72 and 33 reductions in mean weekly loads respectively after converting to alfalfa for tss loads including a period x field interaction did not improve model fit indicating similar slopes between the calibration and treatment periods and that no change in weekly tss loads was found in response to converting to alfalfa mean annual no3 n loads during the treatment period were 33 5 kg ha 1 yr 1 from silage maize and 11 1 kg ha 1 yr 1 from alfalfa a 67 reduction table 7 despite differences in weekly loads mean annual drp loads during the treatment period were similar between crops averaging 0 50 0 03 kg ha 1 yr 1 from alfalfa and 0 59 0 2 kg ha 1 yr 1 from silage maize mean annual tss loads were 66 lower from alfalfa 74 11 kg ha 1 yr 1 than from silage maize 217 40 kg ha 1 yr 1 4 discussion 4 1 water quality our findings are consistent with a number of other studies that show greater losses of nitrate p and sediment from maize than alfalfa e g berg and carter 1980 randall et al 1997 toth and fox 1998 panuska et al 2011 osterholz et al 2019 however despite water quality improvement with alfalfa nitrate and drp concentrations in drainage remained high during the treatment period due to high manure application rates both prior to and during the alfalfa phase after the establishment year alfalfa received an average of 246 kg total n ha 1 resulting in fwm nitrate concentration of 26 1 mg l 1 in drainage water alfalfa is an efficient n scavenger russelle et al 2001 but manure applications at the rates observed in this study clearly exceeded its n uptake capacity when expressed as a percentage of manure inputs n export was 4 51 from alfalfa while it was 24 5 from maize for comparison with no supplemental n randall et al 1997 found a nitrate concentration of 3 mg l 1 in subsurface drainage water from alfalfa or 37 times lower than continuous maize further improvements in water quality could be made by reducing manure application rates to alfalfa or with alternative manure application timing and methods that increase manurial n usage by the crop interestingly drp concentrations were higher from alfalfa than silage maize during the treatment period however alfalfa did receive substantially more manure p 33 kg p ha 1 yr 1 than silage maize 3 kg p ha 1 yr 1 during this period examination of weekly drainage drp concentrations in 2014 and 2015 revealed that the highest concentrations up 5 mg l 1 occurred within a week after alfalfa harvest in mid june or mid august however concentrations were also elevated 3 4 mg l 1 in december and again in march during snowmelt other studies have found higher dissolved p losses from alfalfa than maize with equivalent p applications wendt and corey 1980 panuska et al 2011 in those instances higher p leachate resulted from freezing and cell lysing of high p content alfalfa shoot residues over winter timmons et al 1970 wendt and corey 1980 our observations are consistent with these findings and highlight the potential for elevated drp concentrations when ground coverage is reduced following alfalfa harvest despite higher concentrations from alfalfa drp loads in the present study were substantially lower than silage maize because of lower drainage volumes moreover when expressed as a percentage of manure inputs export of p was 1 52 from alfalfa while it was 17 7 from maize 4 2 water balances as a cool season c3 perennial alfalfa remains physiologically active throughout a much longer portion of the growing season than c4 annuals such as maize in the upper midwest this activity coincides with heavy spring and fall rains when most of the subsurface drainage occurs in principle active water use during critical spring and fall periods should result in lower antecedent soil moisture and reduce both surface and subsurface runoff during precipitation events zehe and blöschl 2004 however we found no significant differences in tile flow between crops at least on an average annual basis this could be due in part to the high interannual variability in these measures especially for tile drainage differences in catchment size number of tile inlets and tile patterns may have contributed to differences in lateral flow and discharge between fields adding error to drainage estimates nevertheless examination of drainage patterns during paired years as in fig 3 suggests differences between the crops under similar hydrologic conditions cumulative drainage over the 3 year treatment period was 326 mm for silage maize and 214 mm for alfalfa a difference of 112 mm moreover 58 124 mm of the alfalfa drainage occurred in 2013 when the crop was being established and water use was low for maize over 70 of subsurface drainage losses an average of 78 mm yr 1 occurred during spring april to june for alfalfa c assimilation and water use extended for an additional 68 days per year compared to maize resulting in 20 mm yr 1 greater spring et and 9 mm yr 1 greater in fall this resulted in 35 lower 27 mm drainage losses for alfalfa than maize in spring this highlights the value of alfalfa for managing on farm water flows and water quality during these critical periods of the year both measured and calculated soil water storage were statistically comparable between the two crops given similar et and greater drainage from maize it was expected that soil water storage would be greater for alfalfa however cumulative measurement error in precipitation et and drainage along this substantial annual variability likely hindered our ability to detect potential differences between crops examination of the water balances for paired years in fig 3 suggests that soil water storage in fact tended to be greater for alfalfa in 2014 and 2015 when the crop was mature alfalfa is deeply rooted and can improve soil aggregate stability and water holding capacity over time angers 1992 another possible explanation is that any surplus water simply moved through the profile beyond our 90 cm soil sampling depth and eventually contributed to groundwater recharge despite the high clay content of the soils alfalfa root channels can create preferential flow pathways that increase infiltration rates to deeper soil layers guo et al 2019 this could also explain the substantial differences between measured and calculated soil water storage as the calculated balances included any water that may have percolated below our soil sampling depth 4 3 water use efficiency our estimates of iwue are comparable to those of other crops with similar photosynthetic mechanisms for example dold et al 2019 found that iwue of maize in iowa ranged from 30 7 to 32 6 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 depending on tillage management whereas we observed a seasonal average of 30 8 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 those authors found a seasonal average of 20 3 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 for c3 soybean which is comparable to our findings for the perennial c3 alfalfa of 18 1 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 these measurements demonstrate the impressive efficiency of the maize c4 photosynthetic pathway relative to c3 crops such as alfalfa average dry matter yields in the present study were 17 5 and 9 7 mg ha 1 for silage maize and alfalfa haylage respectively this corresponds to 41 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 for maize and 23 kg dm ha 1 mm 1 for alfalfa no forage quality data were collected as part of this study however utilizing standard forage quality values for each crop nasem 2021 milk production was calculated according to undersander et al 2006 2016 milk production per ton of forage was similar between alfalfa haylage 1550 kg mg 1 and maize silage 1585 kg mg 1 however due to the large difference in dm production milk yield on an area basis was nearly double for maize silage 27 729 kg ha 1 compared to alfalfa 15 035 kg ha 1 this corresponds to 56 and 30 kg milk ha 1 mm 1 of water usage respectively conversely each kilogram of milk produced with silage maize results in over 60 more no3 n and tss loading to waterways than a kilogram of milk produced with alfalfa alfalfa water use efficiency appears artificially low when expressed in terms of c or dry matter symbiotic n fixation larger proportion of root biomass and higher protein content incur a high cost in photosynthetic assimilates asseng and hsiao 2000 these additional goods and ecosystem services can add value to agricultural landscapes and dairy supply chains supporting the notion that a broader suite of outputs and yield vs ecosystem service tradeoffs should be considered when evaluating the impacts of different agricultural production practices particularly in the face of a changing climate 5 conclusions the comprehensive water budgets presented here show that despite similar annual et silage maize had greater tile drainage flow and loss of associated contaminants than alfalfa however silage maize was much more efficient in water usage nearly doubling the rate of gross co2 assimilation of alfalfa per unit of water due to both the higher intrinsic wue of c4 species and the carbon cost for n fixation in alfalfa this high water use efficiency and yield has facilitated dramatic gains in dairy productivity over the past decades however these gains have come at the expense of water quality with higher nitrate drp and sediment loads from silage maize than alfalfa this highlights the value of alfalfa for managing on farm water flows and water quality during critical periods of the year as is often the case the challenge comes in weighing these environmental benefits against the production gains that have driven the increased use of maize silage in the dairy industry key findings alfalfa and silage maize et were similar for paired years 506 mm yr 1 alfalfa 492 mm yr 1 silage maize mean annual drainage was similar for silage maize and alfalfa 109 vs 71 mm yr 1 drainage coefficient was 0 11 for alfalfa and 0 16 for silage maize calculated and measured water budgets were in close agreement within 18 mm yr 1 on average or 1 8 and were balanced over time iwue was 70 greater for maize 30 8 0 4 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 than alfalfa 18 1 0 3 g c hpa kg h2o 1 d 1 alfalfa reduced nitrate concentrations and increased drp concentrations compared to silage maize compared to silage maize alfalfa reduced weekly loads of nitrate by 72 drp by 33 and annual tss loads by 66 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
