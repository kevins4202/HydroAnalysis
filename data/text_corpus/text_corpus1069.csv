5345,this study develops a new method for selecting the most representative climate model for use in the soil and water assessment tool swat and evaluates this method in the maumee river basin downscaled temperature and precipitation data from 32 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 models were used to drive the swat our model selection approach uses a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impacts of temperature and precipitation on streamflow and to determine the optimal weights for both variables this weighting scheme is then used to rank the performance of all climate models and identify which ones are most representative of climate forcing required by the hydrological model the results of our sensitivity analysis indicate that the response of streamflow to precipitation is consistent throughout the year while the response to temperature is more complex during the warm season higher temperatures cause evapotranspiration to increase and streamflow to decrease during the cool season higher temperatures cause more snowmelt and this causes streamflow to increase based on our weighting scheme the giss e2 r was identified as the most representative climate model in the maumee river basin we then compared the performance of swat simulated streamflow using all cmip5 models the most representative climate model ranked first based on correlation and mean absolute error and second based on nash sutcliffe efficiency while the model selected using a simple average method was ranked fifth fourth and twelfth respectively based on the evaluation of other key variables such as sediment transport nitrogen and phosphorus the optimal climate model also has a higher correlation and a more representative standard deviation than the other cmip5 models the selected model also performs better than the 32 model ensemble mean based on correlation and taylor s skill score when applying this method at different time scales the responding time of streamflow to climate factors needs to be considered the model selection method that was developed in this paper can be applied by hydrological modelers to select the most representative climate models for evaluating the impacts of climate change in other watersheds around the world keywords model selection sensitivity analysis cmip5 swat 1 introduction the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle have already been observed and are projected to intensify in the future hartmann et al 2013 climate change influences the hydrological cycle through modifying the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation chou et al 2012 giorgi et al 2019 evapotranspiration montaldo and oren 2018 sheffield et al 2012 soil water storage arnell 1999 dai et al 2004 and streamflow milly et al 2005 nijssen et al 2001 understanding the response of streamflow to climate change is important because it is directly associated with water security water resource management and ecosystem health for example naz et al 2016 used the variable infiltration capacity vic model to investigate the hydrologic response to climate change in the conterminous united states they found that winter and spring streamflow in the u s are projected to increase and summer streamflow is projected to decrease wu et al 2018 used the budyko framework to quantify the contribution of climate and catchment properties on streamflow in china they found the contribution of climate i e the sum of the contributions from precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to streamflow varies from 2 4 to 3 6 yr 1 during the period of 1960 to 2008 donnelly et al 2017 tested the hydrological responses to increased temperature in europe and demonstrated that mean low and high streamflow are all projected to increase with warming temperatures datasets from general circulation models gcms have been used for driving hydrological models to investigate long term impacts of climate on the hydrological cycle koirala et al 2014 schnorbus and cannon 2014 su et al 2016 however it is challenging to determine which gcm is the most appropriate source of input data for the hydrological models because each gcm performs differently due to their unique assumptions parameters structure and spatial resolution in addition the number of gcms is continuing to increase which compounds the difficulty of selecting the most appropriate model lutz et al 2016 the accuracy of the gcms with respect to simulating the climate of the twentieth century can vary substantially between regions and it can also vary from one variable to another e g temperature precipitation for example chen and frauenfeld 2014a 2014b evaluated 20 gcms from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 in china they found that the gcm that had the highest correlation with observed temperature had the second lowest correlation with observed precipitation it is not uncommon for the performance of a gcm to vary by region and by variable chen et al 2017 evaluated 5 weighting methods that were applied to the 28 cmip5 models they found that the weighting methods had a limited impact on projected climate change while some hydrological modeling studies simulate future changes using all cmip5 models pierce et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 it is more common for studies to rely on a subset of gcms because this is more computational feasibility and reduces the reliance on biased models mendlik and gobiet 2016 since hydrological responses to climate change are based on the integrated and interacting effects of changes in precipitation temperature relative humidity and wind speed among other variables it is necessary for hydrological modelers to select the gcm that can most accurately simulate the variables that are important for determining hydrological response in the watershed of interest only a few studies have introduced objective methods for selecting the most appropriate gcms for hydrological modeling lutz et al 2016 identified three model selection methods 1 those based on the model performance in simulating the historical climate 2 those based on an ensemble of multiple models which cover a range of projections for specific climate variables and 3 those based on model independence to reduce the number of models for the first approach the challenge mentioned above varying degrees of model skill for different variables can cause difficulties in selecting the best model while in the second and third approaches the uncertainty caused by using multiple models leads to larger uncertainties in the hydrological simulations finger et al 2012 minville et al 2008 a knowledge gap exists in the current literature there are few studies that have developed objective methods for selecting the best gcm that considers the performance of the gcms for the variables that are important for determining hydrological response in the watershed of interest this study will fill this knowledge gap by developing a new method for selecting the optimal gcm that uses a weighted approach that is determined through a sensitivity analysis the performance of this model selection method will be evaluated using a case study in the maumee river basin mrb this study has two primary objectives 1 develop an objective model selection approach for identifying the optimal climate model i e the gcm that performs the best in terms of accurately simulating observed hydrological conditions in the target watershed and 2 evaluate the performance of the climate model selected using our objective approach against models selected using other methods the method that was developed and demonstrated in this paper can be benefitial for any study that relies on using gcm output to drive land surface model since gcms provide spatially continuous precipitation and temperature profiles and cover both historical and future time periods the proposed method can be applied in the following situations 1 this method can be used to select the best gcm based on historical data and then used to provide more accurate predictions of future streamflow in the watershed it provides a better approach for selecting the best gcms because it is data driven and based on the accuracy of streamflow simulations during the observed period 2 in the area without streamflow gauges this method can still be used to select the best gcm the weighting factors can comprehensively consider the responses of streamflow to precipitation and temperature these responses can be generated from either artificial or realistic experiments using the selected gcm based on our method can support hydrological simulations over the time and region without observed streamflow which is very valuable to better understand the hydrological process and make predictions in ungauged basin pub 3 this method can also be used to select a better data source beyond gcm for example it could be used to select a better reanalysis data or satellite data for a hydrological model the data and methods used in this study are presented in section 2 and this is followed by an evaluation of swat simulations driven by selected gcm in section 3 in section 4 the discussion about results and limitations are summarized last we conclude with a summary of our key findings in section 5 2 material and methods 2 1 study area we piloted this study in the maumee river basin mrb in the united states the mrb is located at the juncture of indiana ohio and michigan the mrb is dominated by row crop agriculture 70 fry et al 2011 and is characterized by relatively low slopes mean 1 15 gesch et al 2002 and poorly drained soils that are high in clay content it is the largest basin of any of the rivers that drain into the north american great lakes the drainage area of the maumee river at waterville oh is 16 394 km2 usgs 04193500 shown as red star in fig 1 the mrb is a major source of water supply for lake erie one of the five great lakes in north america the north american great lakes collectively constitute the world s largest freshwater lake system measured by surface area and are a vital facet of the north american economy supporting a range of commercial industrial and recreational activities field et al 2007 gronewold et al 2013 the great lakes have recently experienced historically low water levels and an overall downward trend in water levels in recent decades gronewold and stow 2014 lamon and stow 2010 these water level fluctuations are primarily a consequence of changes in regional precipitation and lake evaporation gronewold and stow 2014 understanding how climate change will further affect regional precipitation and evaporation and the hydrological cycle more generally is critical for developing successful adaptation strategies for the region the mrb also transports a substantial amount of nutrients and sediment into the lake due to agricultural activities in the basin this has been linked to harmful algal blooms and other environmental problems michalak et al 2013 irrigation is minimal in the mrb usda 2019 so precipitation runoff relationships in the mrb are not influenced by irrigation there are 17 meteorological stations black dots in fig 1 in the mrb and an additional 28 meteorological stations yellow dots in fig 1 in the surrounding region all of these stations are part of the u s historical climatology network ushcn and these data are available from noaa s national centers for environmental information ncei https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web the observed precipitation and temperature from all of these meteorological stations were used for driving the swat model while the 17 stations inside the basin were used for validating the downscaled cmip5 data 2 2 the swat model the swat is a watershed scale process based hydrologic model commonly applied to assess management impacts on water quantity and quality arnold et al 1998 the model represents a watershed as a series of river or reach segments each contained within a sub watershed or sub basin the model s sub watersheds are composed of a series of hydrologic response units hrus that are defined as unique combinations of soil slope and land use within a sub basin the swat model is constructed based on the soil conservation service scs curve method and incorporates functions on calculating potential evapotranspiration snow melting and water reservoir impacts neitsch et al 2009 provides detailed descriptions of these functions the model simulates a daily water and nutrient balance for each hru and flow and nutrient export are routed to each hru s respective river segment and then progressively downstream to the watershed outlet this study uses a version of the swat model that was specifically constructed in the mrb hereafter the mrb swat model kalcic et al 2016 scavia et al 2017 the mrb model was constructed using spatially continuous land use nlcd fry et al 2011 soil ssurgo and elevation 30 m ned dem gesch et al 2002 data the mrb swat model was calibrated 2010 to 2015 and validated 2005 to 2009 using daily flow and nutrient observations total phosphorus dissolved reactive phosphorus total nitrogen nitrate and suspended solids from the maumee river at waterville gauge usgs 04193500 additional information on the construction calibration and validation of the mrb model can be found in kalcic et al 2016 and scavia et al 2017 2 3 downscaled cmip5 temperature and precipitation gcms have been widely used for projecting future climate knutson et al 2013 kumar et al 2013 taylor et al 2012 and driving hydrological models koirala et al 2014 luce and holden 2009 schnorbus and cannon 2014 often downscaled gcm data are used to drive hydrological models since the downscaling processes helps minimize errors caused by local biases and the coarse spatial scale christensen et al 2008 in this study we used downscaled precipitation and temperature from the 32 cmip5 models that are listed in table 1 these data were obtained from the downscaled cmip5 climate and hydrology projections https gdo dcp ucllnl org downscaled cmip projections dcpinterface html specifically daily data from 1970 to 2015 were downscaled using localized constructed analogs loca at 1 16 spatial resolution pierce et al 2014 2 4 other environmental datasets daily soil moisture data are obtained from the european space agency programme on global monitoring of essential climate variables https esa soilmoisture cci org node 93 and daily snow cover data are derived from the daily gridded north american snow version 1 dgnas mote et al 2018 https nsidc org data g10021 both of these observed datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the swat model 2 5 selection metric the performance of each gcm varies over space time and by variables therefore we developed a method for selecting the most suitable gcm for the swat model by weighting the impacts of temperature and precipitation on streamflow in each month as shown in fig 2 the weights are based on a sensitivity analysis we used different temperature and precipitation scenarios to drive the swat model and then we evaluated the response of streamflow to these temperature and precipitation changes in each month a total of 9 scenarios were generated for both temperature and precipitation as shown in table 2 the temperature scenarios ranged from 6 4 c to 2 3 c using increments of 1 c this range was defined using the historical minimum annual temperature and the rcp8 5 future projected temperature in the mrb specifically we calculated the difference between the minimum annual temperature in the historical period 1970 2015 and the mean annual temperature for the historical period which was 2 3 c this is set as the lower limit of our sensitivity analysis the difference between the mean annual temperature in the 2080s 2070 2090 based on rcp8 5 and the historical period is 6 4 c this is set as the upper limit of our sensitivity analysis the precipitation scenarios were generated using changes that ranged from 28 to 12 similar to the temperature scenarios the upper limits is determined based on the mean annual precipitation for 2080s from rcp8 5 while the lower limit is based on the minimum annual precipitation from historical period specifically we examined 12 5 1 1 5 10 20 and 28 of the observed precipitation the sensitivity analyses are used to establish appropriate weights for selecting the optimal gcm the responses of streamflow δs to the temperature δt and precipitation δp from the sensitivity analyses were used to calculate the weighting factors for temperature wft and precipitation wfp in the ith month the equations are given in eqs 1 and 2 1 wf t i a b s r t i a b s r t i a b s r p i wf p i a b s r p i a b s r t i a b s r p i 2 r t i δ s i s t d s i δ t i s t d t i r p i δ s i s t d s i δ p i s t d p i where rt i and rp i represent the responses of streamflow to temperature and precipitation in ith month abs and std were the absolute value and standard deviation respectively we compared the downscaled cmip5 temperature and precipitation from each gcm with the observed temperature and precipitation using a two sample kolmogorov smirnov k s test based on the kolmogorov smirnov statistic we ranked the models for temperature rkt and precipitation rkp in each month and calculated the final ranking rk using the weighting factors eq 3 3 rk 1 12 i 1 12 wf t i rk t i wf f i rk f i the optimal gcm for hydrological modeling is the one with the highest ranking based on eq 3 to verify that our method for objectively selecting the optimal gcm is defensible we compared the swat simulation using the optimal gcm with the swat simulations forced by the observations and the other 31 gcms we also compared our method with the simple averaging method to demonstrate the necessity of using dynamic weighting factors the simple averaging method assumes that wft wfp 0 5 in eq 3 the correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and taylor s skill score s were used to assess the performance of the hydrological simulations krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 the equations are given in eqs 4 7 4 r i x i x y i y i x i x 2 i y i y 2 5 mae i y i x i n 6 nse 1 i y i x i 2 i x i x 2 7 s 4 1 r σ 1 σ 2 1 r 0 where x is the model simulation y is the observation σ is the ratio of standard deviation of model simulation to standard deviation of observation and r0 is the theoretical maximum correlation equals to 1 3 results 3 1 sensitivity of streamflow to temperature and precipitation the responses of streamflow to temperature and precipitation are presented in fig 3 the response of streamflow to precipitation fig 3b is consistent throughout the year more precipitation causes more streamflow in all the months however the impact of temperature on streamflow is more complicated fig 3a from march to august lower temperatures are associated with higher streamflow due to a reduction in evapotranspiration while in december and january lower temperature leads to more snow and less rainfall and so streamflow declines fig 4 shows the relationship between variations in temperature and precipitation and streamflow response which is indicated by the change of streamflow over the change of temperature and precipitation temperature has the strongest influence on streamflow in spring march and april this is likely because the soil is wet at this time of year and can provide moisture to be evaporated higher temperatures result in greater actual evapotranspiration it is also important to note that the sign of the relationship between temperature and streamflow varies by season it is positive during winter which indicates that an increase in temperature results in an increase in streamflow this occurs because temperatures are important for determining whether precipitation falls as rain or snow they also determine how much melting occurs if there is a snowpack in the watershed it is negative during spring summer and fall which indicates that an increase in temperature results in an increase in evapotranspiration and a decrease in streamflow precipitation has the strongest influence on streamflow in february and march generally changes in precipitation during the cool season are more strongly related to changes in streamflow the precipitation streamflow relationship is weaker in summer because there is more evapotranspiration and more infiltration due to drier soils compared to temperature the relationship between precipitation and streamflow is more consistent the sign remains the same and the magnitude varies less than the relationship between temperature and streamflow 3 2 model performance for precipitation and temperature the k s test was used to measure the skill of the gcm simulations with reference to the observed temperature in the mrb the k s statistic measures the difference between gcm simulated and observed cumulative distribution functions the cumulative distribution functions of all the gcms and observations in four seasons are shown in fig 5 precipitation and fig 6 temperature in spring the gcms tend to overestimate the frequency of moderate precipitation 200 mm 280 mm and underestimate the frequency of higher precipitation 300 mm in summer the gcms over estimate the amount of precipitation especially between 300 mm and 400 mm in fall the gcms tend to over estimate precipitation for the entire distribution while in winter the gcms tend to under estimate precipitation for the entire distribution the cumulative distribution functions for temperature are consistent in all four seasons the majority of the gcms slightly underestimate temperature in middle of the temperature distribution the accuracy with which each gcm can simulate precipitation and temperature varies from season to season based on the k s statistics we ranked every gcm in each season fig 7 shows the boxplots of absolute difference between precipitation based and temperature based rankings in each season if a model had an absolute difference of zero this means that both temperature and precipitation had the same rank the mean ranking difference for all the 32 gcms in spring is 11 followed by 9 in summer and fall and 8 in winter this shows that the skill of each model in simulating precipitation can differ from the skill in simulating temperature this inconsistency is more pronounced in spring in spring the mean ranking difference is larger than the median value while in the other three seasons the mean value is smaller than the median value these results demonstrate that it is necessary to evaluate the skill of gcm simulations of temperature and precipitation separately and to evaluate how model skill varies by season 3 3 model selection based on the sensitivity analysis we calculated separate weighting factors for temperature and precipitation fig 8 shows the weighting factors in each season precipitation has higher weighting factors than temperature throughout the year this indicates that precipitation has a stronger impact on streamflow than temperature however the impacts of temperature on streamflow cannot be ignored especially in spring wf 0 297 we compared our weighted averaging method with the simple averaging method in fig 9 we found substantial differences difference in ranking 5 for 10 of 32 the gcms for example the miroc esm chem is ranked as 7th best model based on our weighted averaging method while it is ranked as the 23rd model when using the simple averaging method the best model based on the weighted averaging method is the giss e2 r in the following section the performance of this model for hydrological simulation will be compared with the other gcms in the mrb 3 4 evaluation of the swat simulations the downscaled precipitation and temperature from all 32 gcms were used to drive the swat model in the mrb model outputs were evaluated by comparing with the observation driven swat simulations given the importance of the mrb for nutrient and sediment delivery to lake erie we evaluated the performance of swat simulated sediment nitrogen phosphorus and streamflow the seasonal cycle in temperature precipitation streamflow sediment nitrogen and phosphorus are shown in fig 10 inter model variations are less pronounced for temperature than precipitation models can generally capture the seasonal cycle of precipitation however model performance varies from month to month the seasonal patterns of streamflow are similar to the patterns of total sediment nitrogen and phosphorus have similar month to month variations with greater variation in winter and less variation in summer generally all the gcm driven swat simulations tend to overestimate streamflow and sediment transport throughout the year this is consistent with the findings by elshamy et al 2009 which indicates that the uncertainties among gcms can lead to disagreements among simulated streamflow this again highlights the necessity of selecting the best gcm for the hydrological model fig 11 summarized model performance for streamflow based on the correlation coefficient mae and nse the best gcm based on our weighted averaging method giss e2 r has the highest correlation 0 83 with the observation based swat streamflow this gcm also has the lowest mae 25 22 m3 s and 2nd highest nse 0 79 among all the 32 models for comparison the best model based on the simple averaging method fgoals g 2 1 is also highlighted in fig 11 blue filled dot the simulated streamflow based on fgoals g 2 1 is ranked as 5th 4th and 12th best based on the correlation coefficient mae and nse respectively this suggests that our model selection method can help to identify the optimal gcm for hydrological modeling fig 12 compares the performance of all 32 gcms for streamflow sediment nitrogen and phosphorus using taylor diagrams the azimuthal angle represents the correlation between the gcm driven and the observation driven swat outputs and the radial distance is the standard deviation of the gcm driven swat outputs normalized to the observation driven swat outputs as shown in eq 7 a high taylor skill score is jointly determined by a high correlation and a standard deviation that agrees with the observations the correlations for streamflow range from 0 60 to 0 83 giss e2 r has the highest correlation with regards to the standard deviation ratio access1 3 is the closest to the observations while the ratio of the giss e2 r is 1 08 as a result giss e2 r is ranked as the 3rd best model based on the taylor s skill score s 0 91 fig 12b shows substantial variability in the performance of model simulated sediment the correlation based on giss e2 r is 0 77 and the standard deviation ratio is 1 09 therefore giss e2 r is ranked as the 2nd best model based on the taylor skill score s 0 88 the results for nitrogen and phosphorus are similar the majority of gcms have correlations between 0 60 and 0 90 miroc 5 1 giss e2 r and bcc csm 1 1 have the highest correlation coefficients miroc 5 1 and giss e2 r simulations of nitrogen and phosphorus also have similar variations ratio 1 01 to the observations therefore based on the taylor skill score miroc 5 1 and giss e2 r are the two models that have best performance in terms of simulating nitrogen and phosphorus 3 5 applications at monthly and weekly scales the proposed method was originally designed at the monthly timescale however we also applied it at a weekly timescale and compared the results to the monthly timescale table 4 the mean weighting factor for precipitation is lower at the weekly timescale than that at the monthly timescale this indicates that the response of streamflow to precipitation is less sensitive at the weekly timescale this may be due to lagged response of streamflow in the mrb as a result of different weight factors the best model at the weekly timescale fgoals g 2 1 is not the same as the one at monthly timescale giss e2 r the correlation nse and taylor s skill score based on the fgoals g 2 1 at the weekly timescale are also lower than those based on the giss e2 r at monthly timescale these results demonstrate that this method can be applied to any timescale of interest they also show that the best model might vary depending on the time scale of interest 4 discussions and limitations 4 1 factors that influence the sensitivity of streamflow to precipitation and temperature the weighted averaging method that was developed in this study is based on the sensitivity of streamflow to precipitation and temperature our results indicate that there are substantial month to month variations in the response of streamflow to precipitation and temperature this is important because it directly affects the weights in this section we investigate how soil moisture and snow cover influence the sensitivity of streamflow to precipitation and temperature respectively fig 13 a shows the seasonal cycle of soil moisture 0 100 cm and the response of streamflow to precipitation higher antecedent 1 month earlier soil moisture corresponds to stronger response of streamflow to precipitation and the correlation r 0 73 is statistically significant at the 95 confidence level when precipitation falls on wet soils there is less infiltration and the runoff ratio is higher melting snow also affects the response of streamflow to precipitation and temperature in the mrb snowmelt is important during the winter and early spring fig 13b demonstrates the seasonal variation in snow depth from december to march of the next year our results showed that when snow depth was 0 02 m higher temperatures increased snowmelt and this increased runoff and streamflow snow depth is negatively correlated r 0 63 with temperature from december to march that is lower temperatures are associated with greater snow depth since the swat has a snowmelt module the influence of snowmelt is already incorporated in our model weighting and selection method see supplementary section for an assessment of the accuracy of the snowmelt module 4 2 comparison with multi model ensemble mean the optimal gcm that was selected by our method consistently performs better than any other gcm here we compare the performance of the optimal model to the multi model ensemble we followed the approach that wang et al 2009 used to calculate the multi model ensemble mean rather than using a simple average this approach normalizes precipitation and temperature in each model grid then averages these normalized values for all 32 models wang et al 2009 demonstrated that the simple averaging may miss extreme events because different models may not reach extreme values at the same time the swat simulations based on giss e2 r are compared with the swat simulations based on the 32 model ensemble mean and to the observed streamflow usgs 04193500 table 3 summarizes the model performance for streamflow sediment nitrogen and phosphorus the swat simulated streamflow based on the giss e2 r has a higher correlation and skill score and a similar nse with the streamflow simulation based on the multi model ensemble however the multi model ensemble has a lower mae for the simulated streamflow similar results are found for the sediment simulations the swat simulated sediment transport based on the giss e2 r has a higher correlation and skill score than the multi model ensemble but the multi model ensemble has a lower mae overall both streamflow and sediment transport are simulated more accurately by the swat in the mrb than nitrogen or phosphorus these findings agree with moriasi et al 2015 and jackson blake et al 2015 while nitrogen and phosphorus have lower correlations and skill scores than streamflow they are consistent with each other and the general pattern is consistent across all four model simulated variables the swat simulations driven by the giss e2 r have better performance with regards to the correlation nse and taylor s skill score but the multi model ensemble has a lower error this indicates that the optimal gcm does a better job of capturing the month to month variability in streamflow sediment transport and nitrogen and phosphorus while the multi model ensemble better captures the overall mean the implication of this finding is that studies that use the multi model ensemble to simulate how climate change will influence hydrological processes may underestimate variability on monthly to interannual timescales in hydrologic responses to climate change this is important because it is the variability and extremes that typically have the largest impacts on ecosystems and water resources easterling et al 2000 here we demonstrate that using the optimal gcm results in a statistically significant increase in correlation and skill scores for streamflow sediment transport nitrogen and phosphorus as compared to the multi model ensemble while using the multi model ensemble results in the lowest mae for streamflow sediment transport nitrogen and phosphorus therefore the optimal method for selecting the best gcm for hydrological modeling may vary depending on the goals of the study 4 3 limitations there are a number of limitations to this study we used downscaled cmip5 temperature and precipitation these data are spatially downscaled and bias corrected since systematic biases have been removed the model to model variations in performance may have been reduced the variations in model performance from one gcm to another would likely be even larger if the native gcm simulations were used we should also note that the ranking of gcm performance is specific to our study region and to the downscaled data that were used the goal of this paper is to develop an objective method for selecting the most suitable gcm for hydrological modeling not to provide a definitive evaluation of gcm performance the weighted averaging method proposed in this study is based on the sensitivity analyses of streamflow to precipitation and temperature we quantified the sensitivity of streamflow to variations in temperature and precipitation in each season additional factors could also be considered in future studies climate change will also influence wind speed relative humidity and other aspects of the daily weather patterns that influence evapotranspiration infiltration and runoff therefore a more comprehensive sensitivity analysis could consider how variations in all of these variables influence streamflow in the mrb our analysis also does not consider the interactions between temperature and precipitation the weighting is based on the univariate influence of each variable while holding the others constant this is not realistic and may not result in the optimal weights for each variable all of the experiments and analyses in this study were conducted at a monthly and weekly timescale this may ignore important processes for example changes in precipitation intensity may alter runoff generation the focus on weekly and monthly results does not adequately account for these effects we should also note that our analysis is based on the assumption that the gcm which most accurately simulates hydrological conditions during the observational period will also provide the most accurate future climate projections however some previous studies have noted that the gcm which is best for simulating historical hydrology may not be the best for future predictions because past performance is weakly correlated with the ability to capture future climate change signals knutti et al 2010 this is potentially a significant limitation of our approach nevertheless it is not possible to know which gcms will provide the best future predictions and so our approach follows best practices 5 conclusions this study introduced a new objective method for identifying the optimal climate model i e the gcm that performs the best in terms of accurately simulating observed hydrological conditions in the target watershed for hydrological modeling this method is developed by weighting the responses of streamflow to precipitation and temperature in each season the key findings are concluded as follows a streamflow response in the mrb is more sensitive to precipitation than temperature throughout the year however the impacts of temperature cannot be ignored especially in spring the month to month variations in streamflow response to temperature are more pronounced than streamflow response to precipitation both sign and strength of the response of streamflow to temperature change vary throughout the year b the gcm that was selected by our objective method at the monthly timescale is giss e2 r it performs well based on correlation mae nse and taylor s skill score none of the other gcms had a higher ranking with regards to all these indicators for discharge c the giss e2 r also outperforms the gcm selected using the simple averaging method and the multi model ensemble giss e2 r had higher correlation nse and taylor s skill score but it also had a higher mae than the multi model ensemble d snow cover and soil moisture are two factors that are strongly associated with hydrologic response understanding the patterns of snow cover and soil moisture are critical for interpreting the sensitivity of streamflow to precipitation and temperature the model selection method that was developed in this paper can be applied to select the most representative climate model or climate models for evaluating the impacts of

5345,this study develops a new method for selecting the most representative climate model for use in the soil and water assessment tool swat and evaluates this method in the maumee river basin downscaled temperature and precipitation data from 32 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 models were used to drive the swat our model selection approach uses a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impacts of temperature and precipitation on streamflow and to determine the optimal weights for both variables this weighting scheme is then used to rank the performance of all climate models and identify which ones are most representative of climate forcing required by the hydrological model the results of our sensitivity analysis indicate that the response of streamflow to precipitation is consistent throughout the year while the response to temperature is more complex during the warm season higher temperatures cause evapotranspiration to increase and streamflow to decrease during the cool season higher temperatures cause more snowmelt and this causes streamflow to increase based on our weighting scheme the giss e2 r was identified as the most representative climate model in the maumee river basin we then compared the performance of swat simulated streamflow using all cmip5 models the most representative climate model ranked first based on correlation and mean absolute error and second based on nash sutcliffe efficiency while the model selected using a simple average method was ranked fifth fourth and twelfth respectively based on the evaluation of other key variables such as sediment transport nitrogen and phosphorus the optimal climate model also has a higher correlation and a more representative standard deviation than the other cmip5 models the selected model also performs better than the 32 model ensemble mean based on correlation and taylor s skill score when applying this method at different time scales the responding time of streamflow to climate factors needs to be considered the model selection method that was developed in this paper can be applied by hydrological modelers to select the most representative climate models for evaluating the impacts of climate change in other watersheds around the world keywords model selection sensitivity analysis cmip5 swat 1 introduction the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle have already been observed and are projected to intensify in the future hartmann et al 2013 climate change influences the hydrological cycle through modifying the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation chou et al 2012 giorgi et al 2019 evapotranspiration montaldo and oren 2018 sheffield et al 2012 soil water storage arnell 1999 dai et al 2004 and streamflow milly et al 2005 nijssen et al 2001 understanding the response of streamflow to climate change is important because it is directly associated with water security water resource management and ecosystem health for example naz et al 2016 used the variable infiltration capacity vic model to investigate the hydrologic response to climate change in the conterminous united states they found that winter and spring streamflow in the u s are projected to increase and summer streamflow is projected to decrease wu et al 2018 used the budyko framework to quantify the contribution of climate and catchment properties on streamflow in china they found the contribution of climate i e the sum of the contributions from precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to streamflow varies from 2 4 to 3 6 yr 1 during the period of 1960 to 2008 donnelly et al 2017 tested the hydrological responses to increased temperature in europe and demonstrated that mean low and high streamflow are all projected to increase with warming temperatures datasets from general circulation models gcms have been used for driving hydrological models to investigate long term impacts of climate on the hydrological cycle koirala et al 2014 schnorbus and cannon 2014 su et al 2016 however it is challenging to determine which gcm is the most appropriate source of input data for the hydrological models because each gcm performs differently due to their unique assumptions parameters structure and spatial resolution in addition the number of gcms is continuing to increase which compounds the difficulty of selecting the most appropriate model lutz et al 2016 the accuracy of the gcms with respect to simulating the climate of the twentieth century can vary substantially between regions and it can also vary from one variable to another e g temperature precipitation for example chen and frauenfeld 2014a 2014b evaluated 20 gcms from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 in china they found that the gcm that had the highest correlation with observed temperature had the second lowest correlation with observed precipitation it is not uncommon for the performance of a gcm to vary by region and by variable chen et al 2017 evaluated 5 weighting methods that were applied to the 28 cmip5 models they found that the weighting methods had a limited impact on projected climate change while some hydrological modeling studies simulate future changes using all cmip5 models pierce et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 it is more common for studies to rely on a subset of gcms because this is more computational feasibility and reduces the reliance on biased models mendlik and gobiet 2016 since hydrological responses to climate change are based on the integrated and interacting effects of changes in precipitation temperature relative humidity and wind speed among other variables it is necessary for hydrological modelers to select the gcm that can most accurately simulate the variables that are important for determining hydrological response in the watershed of interest only a few studies have introduced objective methods for selecting the most appropriate gcms for hydrological modeling lutz et al 2016 identified three model selection methods 1 those based on the model performance in simulating the historical climate 2 those based on an ensemble of multiple models which cover a range of projections for specific climate variables and 3 those based on model independence to reduce the number of models for the first approach the challenge mentioned above varying degrees of model skill for different variables can cause difficulties in selecting the best model while in the second and third approaches the uncertainty caused by using multiple models leads to larger uncertainties in the hydrological simulations finger et al 2012 minville et al 2008 a knowledge gap exists in the current literature there are few studies that have developed objective methods for selecting the best gcm that considers the performance of the gcms for the variables that are important for determining hydrological response in the watershed of interest this study will fill this knowledge gap by developing a new method for selecting the optimal gcm that uses a weighted approach that is determined through a sensitivity analysis the performance of this model selection method will be evaluated using a case study in the maumee river basin mrb this study has two primary objectives 1 develop an objective model selection approach for identifying the optimal climate model i e the gcm that performs the best in terms of accurately simulating observed hydrological conditions in the target watershed and 2 evaluate the performance of the climate model selected using our objective approach against models selected using other methods the method that was developed and demonstrated in this paper can be benefitial for any study that relies on using gcm output to drive land surface model since gcms provide spatially continuous precipitation and temperature profiles and cover both historical and future time periods the proposed method can be applied in the following situations 1 this method can be used to select the best gcm based on historical data and then used to provide more accurate predictions of future streamflow in the watershed it provides a better approach for selecting the best gcms because it is data driven and based on the accuracy of streamflow simulations during the observed period 2 in the area without streamflow gauges this method can still be used to select the best gcm the weighting factors can comprehensively consider the responses of streamflow to precipitation and temperature these responses can be generated from either artificial or realistic experiments using the selected gcm based on our method can support hydrological simulations over the time and region without observed streamflow which is very valuable to better understand the hydrological process and make predictions in ungauged basin pub 3 this method can also be used to select a better data source beyond gcm for example it could be used to select a better reanalysis data or satellite data for a hydrological model the data and methods used in this study are presented in section 2 and this is followed by an evaluation of swat simulations driven by selected gcm in section 3 in section 4 the discussion about results and limitations are summarized last we conclude with a summary of our key findings in section 5 2 material and methods 2 1 study area we piloted this study in the maumee river basin mrb in the united states the mrb is located at the juncture of indiana ohio and michigan the mrb is dominated by row crop agriculture 70 fry et al 2011 and is characterized by relatively low slopes mean 1 15 gesch et al 2002 and poorly drained soils that are high in clay content it is the largest basin of any of the rivers that drain into the north american great lakes the drainage area of the maumee river at waterville oh is 16 394 km2 usgs 04193500 shown as red star in fig 1 the mrb is a major source of water supply for lake erie one of the five great lakes in north america the north american great lakes collectively constitute the world s largest freshwater lake system measured by surface area and are a vital facet of the north american economy supporting a range of commercial industrial and recreational activities field et al 2007 gronewold et al 2013 the great lakes have recently experienced historically low water levels and an overall downward trend in water levels in recent decades gronewold and stow 2014 lamon and stow 2010 these water level fluctuations are primarily a consequence of changes in regional precipitation and lake evaporation gronewold and stow 2014 understanding how climate change will further affect regional precipitation and evaporation and the hydrological cycle more generally is critical for developing successful adaptation strategies for the region the mrb also transports a substantial amount of nutrients and sediment into the lake due to agricultural activities in the basin this has been linked to harmful algal blooms and other environmental problems michalak et al 2013 irrigation is minimal in the mrb usda 2019 so precipitation runoff relationships in the mrb are not influenced by irrigation there are 17 meteorological stations black dots in fig 1 in the mrb and an additional 28 meteorological stations yellow dots in fig 1 in the surrounding region all of these stations are part of the u s historical climatology network ushcn and these data are available from noaa s national centers for environmental information ncei https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web the observed precipitation and temperature from all of these meteorological stations were used for driving the swat model while the 17 stations inside the basin were used for validating the downscaled cmip5 data 2 2 the swat model the swat is a watershed scale process based hydrologic model commonly applied to assess management impacts on water quantity and quality arnold et al 1998 the model represents a watershed as a series of river or reach segments each contained within a sub watershed or sub basin the model s sub watersheds are composed of a series of hydrologic response units hrus that are defined as unique combinations of soil slope and land use within a sub basin the swat model is constructed based on the soil conservation service scs curve method and incorporates functions on calculating potential evapotranspiration snow melting and water reservoir impacts neitsch et al 2009 provides detailed descriptions of these functions the model simulates a daily water and nutrient balance for each hru and flow and nutrient export are routed to each hru s respective river segment and then progressively downstream to the watershed outlet this study uses a version of the swat model that was specifically constructed in the mrb hereafter the mrb swat model kalcic et al 2016 scavia et al 2017 the mrb model was constructed using spatially continuous land use nlcd fry et al 2011 soil ssurgo and elevation 30 m ned dem gesch et al 2002 data the mrb swat model was calibrated 2010 to 2015 and validated 2005 to 2009 using daily flow and nutrient observations total phosphorus dissolved reactive phosphorus total nitrogen nitrate and suspended solids from the maumee river at waterville gauge usgs 04193500 additional information on the construction calibration and validation of the mrb model can be found in kalcic et al 2016 and scavia et al 2017 2 3 downscaled cmip5 temperature and precipitation gcms have been widely used for projecting future climate knutson et al 2013 kumar et al 2013 taylor et al 2012 and driving hydrological models koirala et al 2014 luce and holden 2009 schnorbus and cannon 2014 often downscaled gcm data are used to drive hydrological models since the downscaling processes helps minimize errors caused by local biases and the coarse spatial scale christensen et al 2008 in this study we used downscaled precipitation and temperature from the 32 cmip5 models that are listed in table 1 these data were obtained from the downscaled cmip5 climate and hydrology projections https gdo dcp ucllnl org downscaled cmip projections dcpinterface html specifically daily data from 1970 to 2015 were downscaled using localized constructed analogs loca at 1 16 spatial resolution pierce et al 2014 2 4 other environmental datasets daily soil moisture data are obtained from the european space agency programme on global monitoring of essential climate variables https esa soilmoisture cci org node 93 and daily snow cover data are derived from the daily gridded north american snow version 1 dgnas mote et al 2018 https nsidc org data g10021 both of these observed datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the swat model 2 5 selection metric the performance of each gcm varies over space time and by variables therefore we developed a method for selecting the most suitable gcm for the swat model by weighting the impacts of temperature and precipitation on streamflow in each month as shown in fig 2 the weights are based on a sensitivity analysis we used different temperature and precipitation scenarios to drive the swat model and then we evaluated the response of streamflow to these temperature and precipitation changes in each month a total of 9 scenarios were generated for both temperature and precipitation as shown in table 2 the temperature scenarios ranged from 6 4 c to 2 3 c using increments of 1 c this range was defined using the historical minimum annual temperature and the rcp8 5 future projected temperature in the mrb specifically we calculated the difference between the minimum annual temperature in the historical period 1970 2015 and the mean annual temperature for the historical period which was 2 3 c this is set as the lower limit of our sensitivity analysis the difference between the mean annual temperature in the 2080s 2070 2090 based on rcp8 5 and the historical period is 6 4 c this is set as the upper limit of our sensitivity analysis the precipitation scenarios were generated using changes that ranged from 28 to 12 similar to the temperature scenarios the upper limits is determined based on the mean annual precipitation for 2080s from rcp8 5 while the lower limit is based on the minimum annual precipitation from historical period specifically we examined 12 5 1 1 5 10 20 and 28 of the observed precipitation the sensitivity analyses are used to establish appropriate weights for selecting the optimal gcm the responses of streamflow δs to the temperature δt and precipitation δp from the sensitivity analyses were used to calculate the weighting factors for temperature wft and precipitation wfp in the ith month the equations are given in eqs 1 and 2 1 wf t i a b s r t i a b s r t i a b s r p i wf p i a b s r p i a b s r t i a b s r p i 2 r t i δ s i s t d s i δ t i s t d t i r p i δ s i s t d s i δ p i s t d p i where rt i and rp i represent the responses of streamflow to temperature and precipitation in ith month abs and std were the absolute value and standard deviation respectively we compared the downscaled cmip5 temperature and precipitation from each gcm with the observed temperature and precipitation using a two sample kolmogorov smirnov k s test based on the kolmogorov smirnov statistic we ranked the models for temperature rkt and precipitation rkp in each month and calculated the final ranking rk using the weighting factors eq 3 3 rk 1 12 i 1 12 wf t i rk t i wf f i rk f i the optimal gcm for hydrological modeling is the one with the highest ranking based on eq 3 to verify that our method for objectively selecting the optimal gcm is defensible we compared the swat simulation using the optimal gcm with the swat simulations forced by the observations and the other 31 gcms we also compared our method with the simple averaging method to demonstrate the necessity of using dynamic weighting factors the simple averaging method assumes that wft wfp 0 5 in eq 3 the correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and taylor s skill score s were used to assess the performance of the hydrological simulations krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 the equations are given in eqs 4 7 4 r i x i x y i y i x i x 2 i y i y 2 5 mae i y i x i n 6 nse 1 i y i x i 2 i x i x

maximum correlation equals to 1 3 results 3 1 sensitivity of streamflow to temperature and precipitation the responses of streamflow to temperature and precipitation are presented in fig 3 the response of streamflow to precipitation fig 3b is consistent throughout the year more precipitation causes more streamflow in all the months however the impact of temperature on streamflow is more complicated fig 3a from march to august lower temperatures are associated with higher streamflow due to a reduction in evapotranspiration while in december and january lower temperature leads to more snow and less rainfall and so streamflow declines fig 4 shows the relationship between variations in temperature and precipitation and streamflow response which is indicated by the change of streamflow over the change of temperature and precipitation temperature has the strongest influence on streamflow in spring march and april this is likely because the soil is wet at this time of year and can provide moisture to be evaporated higher temperatures result in greater actual evapotranspiration it is also important to note that the sign of the relationship between temperature and streamflow varies by season it is positive during winter which indicates that an increase in temperature results in an increase in streamflow this occurs because temperatures are important for determining whether precipitation falls as rain or snow they also determine how much melting occurs if there is a snowpack in the watershed it is negative during spring summer and fall which indicates that an increase in temperature results in an increase in evapotranspiration and a decrease in streamflow precipitation has the strongest influence on streamflow in february and march generally changes in precipitation during the cool season are more strongly related to changes in streamflow the precipitation streamflow relationship is weaker in summer because there is more evapotranspiration and more infiltration due to drier soils compared to temperature the relationship between precipitation and streamflow is more consistent the sign remains the same and the magnitude varies less than the relationship between temperature and streamflow 3 2 model performance for precipitation and temperature the k s test was used to measure the skill of the gcm simulations with reference to the observed temperature in the mrb the k s statistic measures the difference between gcm simulated and observed cumulative distribution functions the cumulative distribution functions of all the gcms and observations in four seasons are shown in fig 5 precipitation and fig 6 temperature in spring the gcms tend to overestimate the frequency of moderate precipitation 200 mm 280 mm and underestimate the frequency of higher precipitation 300 mm in summer the gcms over estimate the amount of precipitation especially between 300 mm and 400 mm in fall the gcms tend to over estimate precipitation for the entire distribution while in winter the gcms tend to under estimate precipitation for the entire distribution the cumulative distribution functions for temperature are consistent in all four seasons the majority of the gcms slightly underestimate temperature in middle of the temperature distribution the accuracy with which each gcm can simulate precipitation and temperature varies from season to season based on the k s statistics we ranked every gcm in each season fig 7 shows the boxplots of absolute difference between precipitation based and temperature based rankings in each season if a model had an absolute difference of zero this means that both temperature and precipitation had the same rank the mean ranking difference for all the 32 gcms in spring is 11 followed by 9 in summer and fall and 8 in winter this shows that the skill of each model in simulating precipitation can differ from the skill in simulating temperature this inconsistency is more pronounced in spring in spring the mean ranking difference is larger than the median value while in the other three seasons the mean value is smaller than the median value these results demonstrate that it is necessary to evaluate the skill of gcm simulations of temperature and precipitation separately and to evaluate how model skill varies by season 3 3 model selection based on the sensitivity analysis we calculated separate weighting factors for temperature and precipitation fig 8 shows the weighting factors in each season precipitation has higher weighting factors than temperature throughout the year this indicates that precipitation has a stronger impact on streamflow than temperature however the impacts of temperature on streamflow cannot be ignored especially in spring wf 0 297 we compared our weighted averaging method with the simple averaging method in fig 9 we found substantial differences difference in ranking 5 for 10 of 32 the gcms for example the miroc esm chem is ranked as 7th best model based on our weighted averaging method while it is ranked as the 23rd model when using the simple averaging method the best model based on the weighted averaging method is the giss e2 r in the following section the performance of this model for hydrological simulation will be compared with the other gcms in the mrb 3 4 evaluation of the swat simulations the downscaled precipitation and temperature from all 32 gcms were used to drive the swat model in the mrb model outputs were evaluated by comparing with the observation driven swat simulations given the importance of the mrb for nutrient and sediment delivery to lake erie we evaluated the performance of swat simulated sediment nitrogen phosphorus and streamflow the seasonal cycle in temperature precipitation streamflow sediment nitrogen and phosphorus are shown in fig 10 inter model variations are less pronounced for temperature than precipitation models can generally capture the seasonal cycle of precipitation however model performance varies from month to month the seasonal patterns of streamflow are similar to the patterns of total sediment nitrogen and phosphorus have similar month to month variations with greater variation in winter and less variation in summer generally all the gcm driven swat simulations tend to overestimate streamflow and sediment transport throughout the year this is consistent with the findings by elshamy et al 2009 which indicates that the uncertainties among gcms can lead to disagreements among simulated streamflow this again highlights the necessity of selecting the best gcm for the hydrological model fig 11 summarized model performance for streamflow based on the correlation coefficient mae and nse the best gcm based on our weighted averaging method giss e2 r has the highest correlation 0 83 with the observation based swat streamflow this gcm also has the lowest mae 25 22 m3 s and 2nd highest nse 0 79 among all the 32 models for comparison the best model based on the simple averaging method fgoals g 2 1 is also highlighted in fig 11 blue filled dot the simulated streamflow based on fgoals g 2 1 is ranked as 5th 4th and 12th best based on the correlation coefficient mae and nse respectively this suggests that our model selection method can help to identify the optimal gcm for hydrological modeling fig 12 compares the performance of all 32 gcms for streamflow sediment nitrogen and phosphorus using taylor diagrams the azimuthal angle represents the correlation between the gcm driven and the observation driven swat outputs and the radial distance is the standard deviation of the gcm driven swat outputs normalized to the observation driven swat outputs as shown in eq 7 a high taylor skill score is jointly determined by a high correlation and a standard deviation that agrees with the observations the correlations for streamflow range from 0 60 to 0 83 giss e2 r has the highest correlation with regards to the standard deviation ratio access1 3 is the closest to the observations while the ratio of the giss e2 r is 1 08 as a result giss e2 r is ranked as the 3rd best model based on the taylor s skill score s 0 91 fig 12b shows substantial variability in the performance of model simulated sediment the correlation based on giss e2 r is 0 77 and the standard deviation ratio is 1 09 therefore giss e2 r is ranked as the 2nd best model based on the taylor skill score s 0 88 the results for nitrogen and phosphorus are similar the majority of gcms have correlations between 0 60 and 0 90 miroc 5 1 giss e2 r and bcc csm 1 1 have the highest correlation coefficients miroc 5 1 and giss e2 r simulations of nitrogen and phosphorus also have similar variations ratio 1 01 to the observations therefore based on the taylor skill score miroc 5 1 and giss e2 r are the two models that have best performance in terms of simulating nitrogen and phosphorus 3 5 applications at monthly and weekly scales the proposed method was originally designed at the monthly timescale however we also applied it at a weekly timescale and compared the results to the monthly timescale table 4 the mean weighting factor for precipitation is lower at the weekly timescale than that at the monthly timescale this indicates that the response of streamflow to precipitation is less sensitive at the weekly timescale this may be due to lagged response of streamflow in the mrb as a result of different weight factors the best model at the weekly timescale fgoals g 2 1 is not the same as the one at monthly timescale giss e2 r the correlation nse and taylor s skill score based on the fgoals g 2 1 at the weekly timescale are also lower than those based on the giss e2 r at monthly timescale these results demonstrate that this method can be applied to any timescale of interest they also show that the best model might vary depending on the time scale of interest 4 discussions and limitations 4 1 factors that influence the sensitivity of streamflow to precipitation and temperature the weighted averaging method that was developed in this study is based on the sensitivity of streamflow to precipitation and temperature our results indicate that there are substantial month to month variations in the response of streamflow to precipitation and temperature this is important because it directly affects the weights in this section we investigate how soil moisture and snow cover influence the sensitivity of streamflow to precipitation and temperature respectively fig 13 a shows the seasonal cycle of soil moisture 0 100 cm and the response of streamflow to precipitation higher antecedent 1 month earlier soil moisture corresponds to stronger response of streamflow to precipitation and the correlation r 0 73 is statistically significant at the 95 confidence level when precipitation falls on wet soils there is less infiltration and the runoff ratio is higher melting snow also affects the response of streamflow to precipitation and temperature in the mrb snowmelt is important during the winter and early spring fig 13b demonstrates the seasonal variation in snow depth from december to march of the next year our results showed that when snow depth was 0 02 m higher temperatures increased snowmelt and this increased runoff and streamflow snow depth is negatively correlated r 0 63 with temperature from december to march that is lower temperatures are associated with greater snow depth since the swat has a snowmelt module the influence of snowmelt is already incorporated in our model weighting and selection method see supplementary section for an assessment of the accuracy of the snowmelt module 4 2 comparison with multi model ensemble mean the optimal gcm that was selected by our method consistently performs better than any other gcm here we compare the performance of the optimal model to the multi model ensemble we followed the approach that wang et al 2009 used to calculate the multi model ensemble mean rather than using a simple average this approach normalizes precipitation and temperature in each model grid then averages these normalized values for all 32 models wang et al 2009 demonstrated that the simple averaging may miss extreme events because different models may not reach extreme values at the same time the swat simulations based on giss e2 r are compared with the swat simulations based on the 32 model ensemble mean and to the observed streamflow usgs 04193500 table 3 summarizes the model performance for streamflow sediment nitrogen and phosphorus the swat simulated streamflow based on the giss e2 r has a higher correlation and skill score and a similar nse with the streamflow simulation based on the multi model ensemble however the multi model ensemble has a lower mae for the simulated streamflow similar results are found for the sediment simulations the swat simulated sediment transport based on the giss e2 r has a higher correlation and skill score than the multi model ensemble but the multi model ensemble has a lower mae overall both streamflow and sediment transport are simulated more accurately by the swat in the mrb than nitrogen or phosphorus these findings agree with moriasi et al 2015 and jackson blake et al 2015 while nitrogen and phosphorus have lower correlations and skill scores than streamflow they are consistent with each other and the general pattern is consistent across all four model simulated variables the swat simulations driven by the giss e2 r have better performance with regards to the correlation nse and taylor s skill score but the multi model ensemble has a lower error this indicates that the optimal gcm does a better job of capturing the month to month variability in streamflow sediment transport and nitrogen and phosphorus while the multi model ensemble better captures the overall mean the implication of this finding is that studies that use the multi model ensemble to simulate how climate change will influence hydrological processes may underestimate variability on monthly to interannual timescales in hydrologic responses to climate change this is important because it is the variability and extremes that typically have the largest impacts on ecosystems and water resources easterling et al 2000 here we demonstrate that using the optimal gcm results in a statistically significant increase in correlation and skill scores for streamflow sediment transport nitrogen and phosphorus as compared to the multi model ensemble while using the multi model ensemble results in the lowest mae for streamflow sediment transport nitrogen and phosphorus therefore the optimal method for selecting the best gcm for hydrological modeling may vary depending on the goals of the study 4 3 limitations there are a number of limitations to this study we used downscaled cmip5 temperature and precipitation these data are spatially downscaled and bias corrected since systematic biases have been removed the model to model variations in performance may have been reduced the variations in model performance from one gcm to another would likely be even larger if the native gcm simulations were used we should also note that the ranking of gcm performance is specific to our study region and to the downscaled data that were used the goal of this paper is to develop an objective method for selecting the most suitable gcm for hydrological modeling not to provide a definitive evaluation of gcm performance the weighted averaging method proposed in this study is based on the sensitivity analyses of streamflow to precipitation and temperature we quantified the sensitivity of streamflow to variations in temperature and precipitation in each season additional factors could also be considered in future studies climate change will also influence wind speed relative humidity and other aspects of the daily weather patterns that influence evapotranspiration infiltration and runoff therefore a more comprehensive sensitivity analysis could consider how variations in all of these variables influence streamflow in the mrb our analysis also does not consider the interactions between temperature and precipitation the weighting is based on the univariate influence of each variable while holding the others constant this is not realistic and may not result in the optimal weights for each variable all of the experiments and analyses in this study were conducted at a monthly and weekly timescale this may ignore important processes for example changes in precipitation intensity may alter runoff generation the focus on weekly and monthly results does not adequately account for these effects we should also note that our analysis is based on the assumption that the gcm which most accurately simulates hydrological conditions during the observational period will also provide the most accurate future climate projections however some previous studies have noted that the gcm which is best for simulating historical hydrology may not be the best for future predictions because past performance is weakly correlated with the ability to capture future climate change signals knutti et al 2010 this is potentially a significant limitation of our approach nevertheless it is not possible to know which gcms will provide the best future predictions and so our approach follows best practices 5 conclusions this study introduced a new objective method for identifying the optimal climate model i e the gcm that performs the best in terms of accurately simulating observed hydrological conditions in the target watershed for hydrological modeling this method is developed by weighting the responses of streamflow to precipitation and temperature in each season the key findings are concluded as follows a streamflow response in the mrb is more sensitive to precipitation than temperature throughout the year however the impacts of temperature cannot be ignored especially in spring the month to month variations in streamflow response to temperature are more pronounced than streamflow response to precipitation both sign and strength of the response of streamflow to temperature change vary throughout the year b the gcm that was selected by our objective method at the monthly timescale is giss e2 r it performs well based on correlation mae nse and taylor s skill score none of the other gcms had a higher ranking with regards to all these indicators for discharge c the giss e2 r also outperforms the gcm selected using the simple averaging method and the multi model ensemble giss e2 r had higher correlation nse and taylor s skill score but it also had a higher mae than the multi model ensemble d snow cover and soil moisture are two factors that are strongly associated with hydrologic response understanding the patterns of snow cover and soil moisture are critical for interpreting the sensitivity of streamflow to precipitation and temperature the model selection method that was developed in this paper can be applied to select the most representative climate model or climate models for evaluating the impacts of

5346,natural occurrence of groundwater arsenic as exists in many aquifers and threatens the health of hundreds of millions of people adsorption of as is critical to its distribution in aquifer groundwater as it can lower dissolved as concentrations and provide a source for as mobilization however little is known about as adsorption onto aquifer sediments in inland basins to fill this gap we investigated as v and as iii adsorption onto a brown sediment hosting low as groundwater and two gray sediments hosting high as groundwater sampled from an approximate flow path of the hetao basin china those three sediments had total fe contents of around 1 3 and as contents of around 9 0 μg g arsenic iii adsorption were kinetically faster than as v adsorption on the sediments the characteristics of as v and as iii adsorption both exhibited nonlinear isotherms with adsorption decreasing with increases in ph from around 7 to 9 typical ambient groundwater ph of inland basins generally as v adsorption was greater than as iii adsorption at ph 7 5 whereas the opposite was true at ph 7 5 phosphate competed more strongly with as v adsorption than as iii adsorption while hco3 competed more strongly with as iii adsorption aqueous as iii was oxidized to as v by interaction with the brown sediment mainly due to its high content of extractable mn iv oxides arsenic adsorption onto the sediments was primarily controlled by the content and crystallinity of their fe iii oxides the brown sediment showed weaker affinity for as v and as iii than the gray sediments possibly due to the better crystallinity of the fe iii oxides in the brown sediment in the two gray sediments containing fe iii oxides with similar crystallinities the as adsorption capacity was related to the content of fe iii oxides geochemical models were developed to quantitatively simulate as v and as iii adsorption onto aquifer sediments experimental data were approximated well by these models indicating that as v adsorption decreases at elevated ph and po4 concentration while as iii desorption is favored at high ph and concentrations of hco3 and po4 according to the models the extent and kinetics of as iii oxidation are controlled by the number of free oxidation sites in mn iv oxides ph and as iii concentration this study suggests that the characteristics of as adsorption are highly dependent on the mineral phases existing in the sediments which must be fully understood to quantify the reactive transport of groundwater as in aquifer systems keywords adsorption arsenic hetao basin oxidation surface complexation model 1 introduction naturally occurring high as groundwater 10 μg l has been discovered in aquifers throughout the world mainly in inland basins and river deltas

fendorf et al 2010 rodríguez lado et al 2013 therefore as remediation is highly important for which a proper understanding of the geochemical processes controlling as mobilization is a prerequisite there is a general consensus that as distributions in groundwaters are highly controlled by adsorption processes radloff et al 2011 jessen et al 2012 van geen et al 2013 under oxic conditions where as v is the dominant species the capacity for aquifer sediments to adsorb as v is the primary factor determining groundwater as levels smedley and kinniburgh 2002 in reducing aquifers once as is released into groundwater via the reductive dissolution of as bearing fe iii oxides its fate thereafter is affected by the process of as iii adsorption onto aquifer sediments nguyen et al 2014 under favorable geochemical conditions as desorption acts as a driver for as release in both oxidizing and reducing aquifers appelo et al 2002 podgorski et al 2017 postma et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the distribution coefficient k d and surface complexation model scm are the most frequently used approaches for quantifying as adsorption the distribution coefficient is determined from either in situ push pull experiments harvey et al 2002 radloff et al 2011 jessen et al 2012 van geen et al 2013 or a series of extraction procedures swartz et al 2004 van geen et al 2008 radloff et al 2011 richards et al 2019 that describes the retardation property of aquifer sediments on as transport the obtained k d values are then incorporated into as transport models to predict temporal and spatial evolutions in groundwater as van geen et al 2008 2013 radloff et al 2011 the scm has the ability to quantify as adsorption with regard to the transformation of as species and variation in the concentrations of competing anions e g oh hco3 po4 under variable geochemical conditions published scms are mostly based on databases of as adsorption onto fe iii al oxides dzombak and morel 1990 dixit and hering 2003 stachowicz et al 2006 kersten and vlasova 2009 karamalidis and dzombak 2010 clay minerals manning and goldberg 1997 micas chakraborty et al 2007 and calcite sø et al 2008 these published scms especially those based on adsorption onto hydrous ferric oxides hfo ddl model and goethite e g cd music model dixit and hering s 2003 model have been widely applied in many reactive transport models e g postma et al 2007 rotiroti et al 2015 pi et al 2018 sun et al 2018 however recent studies have concluded that as adsorption onto natural aquifer sediments has significant discrepancies to that of synthetic fe iii oxides nguyen et al 2014 although fe iii oxides are recognized as the dominant adsorbent in aquifer sediments sø et al 2018 although the langmuir model fitting technique is effective when competitors are limited and no transformation of as species occurs nguyen et al 2014 sø et al 2018 scms are applicable to multi competitor as adsorption systems previous studies have used a non electrostatic surface complexation model with a generalized composite approach gc scm to characterize as adsorption onto aquifer sediments from river deltas stollenwerk et al 2007 rathi et al 2017 and have shown that po4 is an effective competitor for both as v and as iii adsorption while increasing the ph from 6 to 8 decreases as v adsorption but has little effect on as iii adsorption onto aquifer sediments since gc scms are highly site specific davis et al 1998 2004 goldberg et al 2007 they cannot be directly adopted to describe as adsorption on sediments in inland basins to the best of our knowledge there are no gc scms describing as adsorption onto sediments in inland basins where sediment characteristics are very different from those in river deltas guo et al 2014 podgorski et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to investigate the nature of as adsorption onto sediments from inland basins and to develop relevant gc scms that can provide insight into such processes and improve our understanding of as enrichment in groundwater systems the hetao basin is a typical arid semiarid inland basin hosting high as groundwater guo et al 2014 previous studies have revealed the presence of brown aquifer sediments hosting low as groundwater near a mountainous region and gray aquifer sediments hosting high as groundwater in a flat plain within the basin jia et al 2014 guo et al 2016a gao et al 2020 therefore the hetao basin is an excellent area in which to investigate as adsorption onto aquifer sediments with different geochemical characteristics the present study was conducted in the hetao basin and aimed to 1 investigate as v and as iii adsorption onto different aquifer sediments 2 use experimental data to develop geochemical models that quantitatively describe as adsorption and can be applied to a reactive transport model and 3 evaluate the role of as adsorption in as mobilization in aquifer systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sampling of aquifer sediments aquifer sediments were collected in the northwestern part of the hetao basin china fig s1a in the hetao basin high as groundwater is widely distributed in late pleistocene fluvial lacustrine aquifers cao et al 2018 from shallow 40 m below land surface bls to deep groundwater 40 m bls jia et al 2014 guo et al 2016a an obvious redox zonation associated with increases in groundwater as concentration has been identified from the alluvial fan of the langshan mountains through the transition area to the flat plain fig s1b in aquifers near the mountains groundwater as is typically low under aerobic environments whereas mildly anoxic conditions prevail in the flat plain with high groundwater as concentrations jia et al 2014 high as groundwater in the flat plain is closely related to the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides and as desorption induced by high hco3 concentrations and alkaline phs gao et al 2020 detailed descriptions of the study area can be found elsewhere guo et al 2016a three boreholes of up to 80 m length were drilled in 2015 borehole fan 1 was located in the alluvial fan borehole tran 1 was in the transition area and borehole plain 1 was in the flat plain fig s1b brown sediments were observed in borehole fan 1 which hosted low as groundwater whereas gray sediments predominantly occurred in boreholes tran 1 and plain 1 which hosted high as groundwater the sample collection and storage procedures used in this study are described elsewhere guo et al 2016a to investigate as adsorption onto aquifer sediments along the flow path three sediments were chosen for batch adsorption experiments 1 sediment fan 1 18 a brown fine sand from 17 9 to 18 0 m bls in the alluvial fan 2 sediment tran 1 64 a steel gray fine sand from 64 1 to 64 2 m bls in the transition area and 3 sediment plain 1 78 a gray fine sand from 78 7 to 78 8 m bls in the flat plain our previous study showed that as v was the major as species 67 90 of total as in oxic suboxic brown sediments near the alluvial fan while as iii 67 81 prevailed in the gray sediments under reducing conditions in the flat plain guo et al 2016a 2 2 sediment characterization the mineral phases of the dried sediments were determined by quantitative x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis detailed procedures can be found in the supporting information sediment fe bearing mineral contents were determined by parallel dissolution experiments in an anoxic chamber coy laboratory products usa under anoxic conditions postma et al 2016 the experiments were carried out in three stages using 1 1 mmol l hcl at ph 3 to extract easily dissolved fe ii minerals 2 10 mmol l ascorbic acid at ph 3 to extract poorly crystalline fe iii oxides and easily dissolved fe ii minerals and 3 0 1 mol l ascorbic acid and 0 2 mol l ammonium oxalate at ph 3 to extract crystalline fe iii oxides poorly crystalline fe iii minerals and easily dissolved fe ii minerals because the latter dissolution stage also dissolved the fe forms present in the former stage the difference in the fe contents of the 10 mmol l ascorbic extract and the 1 mmol l hcl extract at ph 3 was related to poorly crystalline fe iii oxides while the difference in the fe contents of the 0 1 mol l ascorbic 0 2 mol l ammonium oxalate extract and the 10 mmol l ascorbic extract was related to crystalline fe iii oxides total fe iii oxide contents were determined from the difference in the fe contents of the 0 1 mol l ascorbic 0 2 mol l ammonium oxalate extract and the hcl extract at ph 3 details of the parallel dissolution procedures can be found in the supporting information the other extraction procedures were performed by adding 1 g of wet sediment around 0 85 g dry sediment to 1 20 ml solutions at ph 2 for dissolution of easily dissolved mn ii minerals and partial desorption of adsorbed mn ii referred to as sedimentary mn ii hereafter makino et al 2006 and 2 20 ml solutions with 0 1 mol l nh2oh hcl and 0 01 mol l hno3 at ph 2 for around 30 min for dissolutions of mn iv oxides and sedimentary mn ii reza et al 2010 the difference in mn contents between the nh2oh hcl hno3 extract and the ph 2 solution extract was related to the mn iv oxide contents in the sediments the extractions were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters and then analyzed for dissolved mn and as concentrations by icp ms 7500ce agilent the contents of sedimentary fes avs and cr ii reducible sulfide crs were extracted with 9 mol l hcl and 2 mol l crcl2 respectively detailed methods can be found elsewhere guo et al 2016b the contents of sedimentary inorganic sulfide were the sum of the avs and crs contents 2 3 batch adsorption experiments arsenic v and as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 sediments was investigated in a series of batch experiments to determine as adsorption isotherms and the effects of ph hco3 and po4 arsenic v adsorption onto fan 1 18 was conducted in contact with air whereas that for tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 was performed under anoxic conditions to simulate the typical geochemical conditions of the field site however as iii adsorption onto all three sediments was carried out under anoxic conditions the experiments were performed according to the study of stollenwerk et al 2007 all adsorption experiments were performed in 25 ml septum bottles containing 1 g of wet sediment around 0 85 g dry sediment and 20 ml of 20 mmol l nacl solution as a background electrolyte the moisture content and mass of dry sediment were determined from the weight lost during drying the solid liquid ratios were calculated from the mass of dry sediment and volume of liquid in the batch adsorption experiments and were 42 0 41 5 and 42 5 g l for the fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 batches respectively the ionic strength of 20 mmol l nacl was calculated as the median of over 300 samples collected in the hetao basin and was thus regarded as representative of the typical groundwater ionic strength stock solutions of as v as iii po4 and hco3 were prepared with reagent grade na2haso4 7h2o naaso2 na2hpo4 12h2o and nahco3 respectively all stock solutions used in the experiments of as iii adsorption onto the three sediments and as v adsorption onto sediments tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 were deoxygenated by purging with ultrapure n2 for 3 h 200 ml solution ph was adjusted using 1 mol l hcl and 1 mol l naoh during the experiments to examine the ph effect while in the other batch experiments the natural suspension phs were left undisturbed and measured at the end of each experiment all bottles were wrapped in aluminum foil and shaken at 180 rpm in darkness at 25 c equilibrium times for as adsorption were obtained from a series of preliminary kinetic experiments fig s2 a duration of 3 d was selected as the most appropriate time for as iii adsorption onto sediments tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 whereas a duration of 5 d was selected for as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 and as v adsorption onto all three sediments fig s2 blank experiments were also conducted to quantify as desorption in an as free electrolyte solution of 20 mmol l nacl the adsorbed as concentration was determined as the difference between the initial and final as concentrations in which the as concentration in the blank experiment was subtracted from the final as concentration during experiments as species were also measured all experiments were carried out in triplicate arsenic adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms for as v and as iii were determined by batch experiments with as concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 25 μmol l arsenic adsorption edge the effects of ph on as v and as iii adsorption were investigated using initial as concentrations of 2 μmol l and 10 μmol l and solution phs of 6 to 9 competitive adsorption by po4 the competitive effects of po4 on as v and as iii adsorption were studied using initial as concentrations of 2 μmol l 5 μmol l and 10 μmol l and po4 concentrations of 0 5 to 25 μmol l competitive adsorption by hco3 the competitive effects of hco3 on as adsorption were studied using initial as concentrations of 2 μmol l and 10 μmol l and hco3 concentrations varying from 2 to 12 mmol l time course samples were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters and stored in darkness at 4 c samples were divided into two subsamples one was preserved by addition of 6 mol l hno3 for detection of dissolved as fe mn and p by icp aes icap6300 thermo and the other was preserved with 0 25 mol l edta for detection of as species by hplc hg afs afs 9130 titan the detection limits for as iii and as v by hplc hg afs afs 9130 titan were 2 and 4 μg l respectively for competitive adsorption by hco3 another subsample was collected for the detection of dissolved hco3 via alkalinity testing mcolortest hc605827 2 4 geochemical modeling 2 4 1 modeling approach the data obtained from the batch experiments were approximated by geochemical models to quantitatively interpret the nature of as v and as iii adsorption onto the three typical sediments software phreeqc 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 was used with wateq4f dat as the database ball and nordstrom 1991 for surface complexation reactions we used a non electrostatic surface complexation model with a generalized composite approach gc scm to make a quantitative prediction of as v and as iii adsorption onto the surface of sediment because it is more suitable for the inherent physical and chemical heterogeneity of sediment assemblages davis et al 1998 rathi et al 2017 the gc scm model simplifies the complex functional groups of the mineral assemblage as generic surface sites to represent average surface properties of sediments goldberg et al 2007 all surface complexation reactions were referred to in the report by stollenwerk et al 2007 table 1 since as v and as iii should not be adsorbed onto the same surface sites of natural sediments nguyen et al 2014 the surface complexation reactions for as v and as iii adsorption onto the sediments were interpreted by different protonation and deprotonation reactions e g surf a as as v adsorption sites and surf b as as iii adsorption sites therefore six geochemical models in total models m1 m6 table 1 were developed to explain as v and as iii adsorption onto the three sediments models m1 m3 predicted as v adsorption onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 respectively while models m4 m6 simulated as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 respectively surface complexation reactions of h as po4 and hco3 onto aquifer sediments were included in the modeling matrix table 1 since there were no transformations of as species observed in the batch experiments of as v adsorption onto the three aquifer sediments and as iii adsorption onto the two gray sediments i e tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 no other geochemical reactions were considered in these five models i e models m1 m2 m3 m5 m6 table 1 however the results of as iii adsorption onto the brown sediment fan 1 18 showed transformation of as iii to as v presumably due to oxidation by mn iv oxides amirbahman et al 2006 ying et al 2012 therefore kinetic oxidation of as iii by mn iv oxides coupled with as iii and as v adsorption were considered in the modeling of as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 model m4 an oxidation site mn c was integrated into model m4 to simulate as iii oxidation in consequence three types of surface sites namely surf a for as v adsorption surf b for as iii adsorption and mn c for as iii oxidation were developed to interpret as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 table 1 2 4 2 calibration strategy to obtain the intrinsic as iii and as v surface complexation constants geochemical models were developed in phreeqc 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 and coupled with matlab software through the iphreeqc module charlton and parkhurst 2011 a genetic algorithm calibration code was linked with iphreeqc by matlab to estimate the parameters of the geochemical models including the equilibrium constant of each surface complexation reaction log k the amount of reactive surface sites m and the kinetic rate constants of as iii oxidation k ox and k m table 1 on the basis of the batch adsorption experiments the lower and upper ranges of each parameter during calibration were compiled from available literatures on these geochemical reactions with fe iii mn iv oxides and sediments dzombak and morel 1990 stollenwerk et al 2007 rathi et al 2017 table 1 during the calibration the sum of the squared weighted residuals between the experimental and modeled data was considered as the objective function and was consequently minimized manning and goldberg 1997 the root mean squared error rmse was calculated to assess the accuracy of modeling fits lin et al 2019 normalized rmse was obtained from dividing the rmse by the maximum measured concentration of corresponding datasets 3 results 3 1 sediment characterization the mineral phases of the three sediments were mainly quartz 45 59 feldspar 20 33 clay minerals 12 18 5 and calcite 2 9 4 table s1 crystalline fe minerals such as goethite hematite pyrite and siderite were below the detection limit 1 the results of parallel dissolution experiments showed that the contents of easily dissolved fe ii minerals presented an increasing trend along the flow path table 2 however a decreasing trend in contents of fe iii oxides including poorly crystalline fe iii oxides and crystalline fe iii oxides along the flow path was observed table 2 the content of fe iii oxides extracted in fan 1 18 was 123 mmol fe kg sediment among which around 82 was characterized as crystalline phases table 2 the contents of extracted fe iii oxides decreased to 81 8 mmol fe kg sediment in tran 1 64 of which the relative abundance of the crystalline phases decreased to around 60 table 2 iron iii oxides extracted in plain 1 78 were 46 5 mmol fe kg sediment with around 63 as crystalline phases table 2 the contents of fe iii oxides extracted in the hetao basin fell within the range of those measured in aquifer sediments from river deltas e g bangladesh west bengal and the red river floodplain stollenwerk et al 2007 nath et al 2009 radloff et al 2011 sø et al 2018 table s2 the contents of mn iv oxides also exhibited a decreasing trend along the flow path there were 4 0 mmol kg in fan 1 18 1 5 mmol kg in tran 1 64 and 1 0 mmol kg in plain 1 78 table 2 these values are 30 50 times lower than the contents of fe iii oxides observed the content of extracted sedimentary mn ii was negligible in fan 1 18 while its contents in tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 were equivalent to the amount of extracted mn iv oxides table 2 the content of extracted mn iv oxides in fan 1 18 was very close to that in brown sediment from bangladesh around 4 6 mmol kg stollenwerk et al 2007 but higher than those from sediments at a cape cod site which averaged 1 2 mmol kg amirbahman et al 2006 the contents of mn iv oxides in the two gray sediments table 2 were comparable to those in gray sediments from bangladesh at around 1 2 mmol kg stollenwerk et al 2007 no sedimentary inorganic sulfides were detected in fan 1 18 table 2 the content of inorganic sulfides in tran 1 64 was 2 6 mmol kg which is comparable to that in plain 1 78 at 2 0 mmol kg table 2 and identical to the median contents of sedimentary inorganic sulfides measured in 33 sediments at an 87 m depth profile in the hetao basin 2 8 mmol kg guo et al 2016b 3 2 arsenic v adsorption 3 2 1 adsorption isotherms the concentration dependent adsorption of as v onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 sediments produced nonlinear adsorption isotherms fig 1 a no transformations of as species were observed during the experiment the equilibrium phs were around 8 8 4 and 7 9 in the fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 batches respectively for the highest initial as v concentration of 25 μmol l the maximum adsorptions onto the three sediments were 0 26 0 39 and 0 34 μmol g respectively the experimental data were fitted with langmuir adsorption isotherms with the capacities of as v adsorption onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 calculated as being 0 33 0 75 and 0 59 μmol g respectively fig s3 table s2 although the brown fan 1 18 sediment had a much higher content of fe iii oxides than those of the two gray sediments table 2 the capacity of as v adsorption onto fan 1 18 was lower than those of tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 which may be due to the predominance of crystalline fe iii oxides in fan 1 18 table 2 in spite of the slightly higher equilibrium ph in the tran 1 64 batches a higher capacity of as v adsorption was observed on tran 1 64 than on plain 1 78 possibly resulting from a higher content of fe iii oxides table 2 at equilibrium phs and using 20 mmol l nacl as a background electrolyte no as desorption was detected in the blank fan 1 18 batches whereas 0 00096 μmol g 3 μg l and 0 0053 μmol g 16 9 μg l as were detected in the blanks of the tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 batches respectively the desorbed as mainly presented as as iii which is related to the desorption of natural pre adsorbed as in the sediments 3 2 2 ph effect solution ph showed an obvious impact on as v adsorption onto the three sediments especially at the initial as v concentration of 10 μmol l fig 1b in the experiments with an initial as v concentration of 10 μmol l as v adsorption onto fan 1 18 increased by around 13 as the ph increased from 6 3 to 6 8 and then decreased by around 30 as the ph increased from 6 8 to 8 6 however as the ph increased from 6 4 to 8 9 as v adsorption decreased by 24 onto tran 1 64 and 56 onto plain 1 78 3 2 3 competition with po4 phosphate appeared to be an effective competitor for as v adsorption onto the surface sites of the sediments fig 1c the competitive effect was more evident at the initial as concentration of 10 μmol l than at 5 and 2 μmol l with the initial as v concentration of 10 μmol l addition of 25 μmol l po4 decreased as v adsorption by 45 35 and 47 onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 respectively fig 1c the po4 adsorption data also produced nonlinear adsorption isotherms fig 1d competition between as v and po4 adsorption was obvious showing that a high initial as v concentration inhibited po4 adsorption onto the sediments fig 1d 3 2 4 competition with hco3 the competitive effect of hco3 on as v adsorption was almost negligible fig 1e a negligible competitive effect of hco3 on as v adsorption has also been reported for goethite stachowicz et al 2008 kanemstsu et al 2013 stolze et al 2019 and sediments from bangladesh stollenwerk et al 2007 and the red river floodplain nguyen et al 2014 this is likely related to the higher affinity for as v adsorption onto fe iii oxides than for hco3 stachowicz et al 2007 3 3 arsenic iii adsorption 3 3 1 adsorption isotherms arsenic iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 sediments produced nonlinear adsorption isotherms fig 2 a the equilibrium ph after adsorption was around 8 in the fan 1 18 batches 8 5 in the tran 1 64 batches and 7 8 in the plain 1 78 batches the equilibrium phs were much higher than those reported for sediments from the red river floodplain ph 6 3 6 4 rathi et al 2017 indicating that there is a more alkaline environment in the hetao basin with the highest initial as iii concentration of 25 μmol l the maximum adsorption was 0 3 μmol g in the fan 1 18 batches 0 406 μmol g in the tran 1 64 batches and 0 366 μmol g in the plain 1 78 batches these as iii adsorption isotherms were fitted with langmuir adsorption models fig s3 the calculated capacity of as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 0 44 μmol g was lower than those onto tran 1 64 0 8 μmol g and plain 1 78 0 71 μmol g fig s3 table s2 possibly due to the higher proportion of crystalline fe iii oxides in fan 1 18 table 2 in spite of the equilibrium ph in the tran 1 64 batches around 8 5 being slightly higher than that in the plain 1 78 batches 7 8 the capacity for as iii adsorption onto the former was higher than that onto the latter which may result from the higher content of fe iii oxides in tran 1 64 table s2 arsenic v was detected in the batches where as iii was adsorbed onto fan 1 18 fig 3 a indicating transformation of dissolved as iii to as v with initial as iii concentrations of 0 5 to 25 μmol l dissolved as iii exhibited a near linear rate of increase from 0 027 μmol l detection limit of 2 μg l to 10 7 μmol l while the dissolved as v concentration gradually increased from 0 08 μmol l to a plateau of around 2 μmol l fig 3a since no as v was detected in the blank sample the presence of as v can be attributed to oxidation of dissolved as iii rather than desorption of preadsorbed as v therefore the amount of adsorbed as in the fan 1 18 batches should be the sum of the adsorbed as iii and adsorbed as v shown in fig 2a no transformation of as species was associated with the as iii adsorption onto the two gray sediments desorbed as concentrations in the blanks of the tran 1 68 and plain 1 78 experiments were very close to those in the as v batches reported in section 3 2 1 3 3 2 ph effect there were considerable differences in the effect of ph on as iii adsorption onto the three batches especially at the higher initial as iii concentration fig 2b at the initial as iii concentration of 10 μmol l the as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 increased to the maximum at around ph 7 and decreased by 17 with a further increase in ph to around 8 6 fig 2b the as iii adsorption onto tran 1 64 showed an increase of around 9 from ph 6 7 to 7 3 and remained relatively constant from ph 7 3 to 8 2 before gradually decreasing by around 7 5 from ph 8 2 to 8 9 fig 2b this ph dependence is similar to that reported for synthesized goethite by dixit and hering 2003 showing that as iii adsorption initially increases with ph then has a broad plateau before decreasing with further increases in ph however as iii adsorption onto plain 1 78 slightly increased with the increase in ph from 6 3 to 6 5 and then decreased by around 25 from ph 6 5 to 8 9 fig 2b transformation of dissolved as iii to as v was observed within the studied ph range in the fan 1 18 batches fig 3b with initial as iii concentrations of 2 μmol l and 10 μmol l the dissolved as v concentration increased with ph fig 3b the dissolved as iii concentration exhibited decreases as the ph increased from 6 7 to 7 7 and then increased with further ph increases to 8 6 fig 3b however with a ph increase from 6 7 to 8 6 the percentage of dissolved as iii decreased from around 90 to 50 and around 90 to 70 with initial as iii concentrations of 2 μmol l and 10 μmol l respectively the amount of desorbed as in the blank sets of fan 1 18 sediment decreased from 0 0002 μmol g 0 7 μg l at ph 6 7 to below the detection limit at ph 8 2 and then increased to 0 0008 μmol g 2 6 μg l at ph 8 6 this illustrates that the desorption of preadsorbed as contributes less to the measured as v in the batches showing ph effect on as iii adsorption and that the detected as v was mainly produced from as iii oxidation 3 3 3 competition with po4 phosphate acted as an effective competitor for as iii adsorption onto the sediments fig 2c the competitive effect became more evident with a higher initial as iii concentration with an initial as iii concentration of 10 μmol l the addition of 25 μmol l po4 decreased as iii adsorption by 33 18 and 13 in the fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 sediments respectively fig 2c dissolved as v was detected in the fan 1 18 batches fig 3c therefore the competition between po4 and as was the result of the effects of po4 on as iii and as v adsorption in the blank set of fan 1 18 batches at an initial po4 concentration of 25 μmol l the amount of desorbed as was 0 002 μmol g 6 3 μg l which existed mainly as the as v species desorption of preadsorbed as v made a lesser contribution to the measured as v concentration as po4 concentrations increased from 0 5 to 25 μmol l concentrations of both dissolved as v and as iii showed increasing trends in the three batches with different initial as iii concentrations fig 3c in addition the percentages of measured as v increased from 28 to 54 from 20 to 32 and from 22 to 28 with increasing po4 concentrations in batches with initial as iii concentrations of 2 5 and 10 μmol l respectively fig 3c in the presence of as iii the adsorption of po4 also exhibited nonlinear isotherms fig 2d competition of as iii with po4 adsorption was less evident fig 2d than competition of as v with po4 adsorption fig 1d 3 3 4 competition with hco3 increasing the hco3 concentration caused visible competition with as iii adsorption under the experimental conditions fig 2e at an initial as iii concentration of 10 μmol l the addition of 12 mmol l hco3 decreased as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 by 26 19 and 33 respectively transformation of as iii was also observed in the fan 1 18 batches fig 3d dissolved as v concentrations remained relatively constant at 0 3 and 0 9 μmol l in the presence of 12 mmol l hco3 and initial as iii concentrations of 2 and 10 μmol l respectively fig 3d the relative abundance of measured as iii increased from 59 to 64 at an initial as iii concentration of 2 μmol l and from 77 to 84 at an initial as iii concentration of 10 μmol l this illustrates that as iii adsorption was apparently more influenced by hco3 competition than as v adsorption which is quite different to the fact mentioned above that po4 competed more strongly with as v than as iii 3 4 experiment based geochemical modeling 3 4 1 arsenic v adsorption three geochemical models m1 m3 were developed to decipher the nature of as v adsorption onto the three aquifer sediments table 1 for each model the reaction matrix included one type of generic surface site for as v adsorption surf a and 11 surface complexation reactions involving h as v po4 and hco3 table 1 therefore each model contained 12 parameters in the calibration system including the equilibrium constants log ka of the surface reactions and the number of reactive surface sites ma table 1 the calibrated parameters of the three models are listed in table 1 the equilibrium constants of each surface complexation reaction log ka were within the ranges of data published for as v adsorption table 1 the numbers of surface sites ma in the three models showed a decreasing trend in the order of m2 m3 m1 table 1 which is the same order as for the as v adsorption capacities table s2 the three models were able to interpret as v adsorption onto the three different sediments the model simulations accurately captured the concentration dependent as v adsorption isotherms ph effects and competition with po4 and hco3 observed in the experiments fig 1 with normalized rmse values of 5 7 3 5 and 2 8 for models m1 m2 and m3 respectively in modeling isotherm experiments m1 m2 and m3 simulated outputs provided well descriptions of the nonlinear as v adsorption with normalized rmses 5 fig 1a although simulated output was slightly underestimated at ph lower than 7 0 in model m1 the three models accurately captured the ph effects on as v adsorption with normalized rmses 5 fig 1b the peaked feature of ph dependent as v adsorption was predicted by model m1 while in models m2 and m3 as v adsorption decreased with increases in ph from 6 to 9 fig 1b the lack of competitions of hco3 with as v adsorption was precisely captured by the three models with normalized rmses 7 fig 1e the normalized rmses for modeling fits of competitions between po4 and as v 10 fig 1c and d were slightly higher than those for as v adsorption isotherms and competitions by ph and hco3 fig 1b and e 3 4 2 arsenic iii adsorption onto gray sediments two geochemical models were used to quantitatively predict as iii adsorption onto the two gray sediments m5 for tran 1 64 and m6 for plain 1 78 table 1 since no as v was detected during the experiments no redox reactions were considered in these two models another type of generic site was developed for as iii adsorption surf b table 1 ten surface complexation reactions of h as iii po4 and hco3 adsorption onto surf b were considered in the modeling matrix table 1 and therefore 11 parameters including the equilibrium constants log kb of the surface complexation reactions and the number of surface sites mb were considered in the calibration system each model was thus calibrated with the experimental results of as iii adsorption the calibrated parameters are shown in table 1 the results show that the numbers of calibrated surface sites mb in tran 1 64 m5 were higher than in plain 1 78 m6 table 1 which is in agreement with the capacities for as iii adsorption onto sediments calculated by fitting langmuir models fig s3 table s2 overall the experimental results of as iii adsorption isotherms ph effects and po4 and hco3 competition were correctly predicted by the two calibrated models fig 2 with normalized rmse values of 4 1 and 1 7 for models m5 and m6 respectively in modeling isotherm experiments fig 2a simulated outputs m5 and m6 matched the observed as iii adsorption well although the normalized rmse of model m5 was 12 the ph dependent as iii adsorption in model m5 predicted a maxima adsorption in the range of ph from 6 5 to 8 and a slightly decreasing adsorption at higher ph fig 2b while model m6 predicted a slight increase in as iii adsorption with ph increasing from 6 to 6 5 and a decrease with ph increasing from 6 5 to 9 fig 2b normalized rmses 4 the mild competitions of po4 with as iii adsorption fig 2c the negligible competitions of as iii with po4 adsorption fig 2d and the considerable competitions of hco3 with as iii adsorption fig 2e were all well simulated in these two models with normalized rmses 4 3 4 3 arsenic iii oxidation and adsorption onto brown sediment model m4 was developed to investigate as iii oxidation and adsorption onto the brown sediment sample fan 1 18 it considered as iii oxidation as iii and as v adsorption and mn ii adsorption table 1 arsenic iii oxidation was observed in the fan 1 18 batches fig 3 which was attributed to the mn iv oxides existing in the aquifer sediments eq 1 especially under oxic conditions amirbahman et al 2006 stollenwerk et al 2007 rathi et al 2017 because no transformation of as iii to as v was observed in the two experimental sets of as iii adsorption onto gray sediments the oxidation of as iii by fe iii oxides could be negligible similar to the observations in previous studies oscarson et al 1981 manning et al 1998 amirbahman et al 2006 although oxidation of as iii to as v by mn iv oxides produces mn ii eq 1 scott and morgan 1995 amirbahman et al 2006 dissolved mn ii concentrations were quite low in this study 0 1 μmol l the low dissolved mn ii concentrations were attributed to mn ii adsorption onto mn iv oxides and or other adsorbents such as fe iii oxides at high ph conditions ph 6 0 scott and morgan 1995 amirbahman et al 2006 stone and ulrich 1989 found that nearly 100 of mn ii was adsorbed at ph 6 undetectable dissolved mn ii was also reported in experiments where as iii was adsorbed onto oxidized aquifer sediments from cape cod usa amirbahman et al 2006 previous research has shown that dissolved mn ii may greatly inhibit as iii oxidation rates via adsorption onto mn iv oxides scott and morgan 1995 ehlert et al 2014 in addition to as iii oxidation by mn iv oxides the inhibition of as iii oxidation by dissolved mn ii was included in our model m4 the mechanism of inhibition is that adsorption of dissolved mn ii occupies the oxidation sites on the mn iv oxides and reduces the rate of as iii oxidation eq 2 rathi et al 2017 previous studies have also revealed that rates of as iii oxidation by mn iv oxides are higher at ph 6 than at ph 3 wu et al 2015 or ph 4 5 villalobos et al 2014 we therefore included the effect of ph on as iii oxidation in our model the kinetic rate of as iii oxidation by mn iv oxides was developed according to the literatures eq 3 tournassat et al 2002 amirbahman et al 2006 ying et al 2011 villalobos et al 2014 rathi et al 2017 1 mno2 2h h3aso3 h2o h3aso4 mn2 2 mn coh mn2 mn comn h 3 d a s i i i dt k o x a s i i i k m a s i i i a c t oh m n c o h where k ox is the oxidation rate constant l mol s as iii is the dissolved as iii concentration mol l k m is a half saturation constant for dissolved as iii mol l act oh is the activity of oh mol l and mn coh is the amount of free surface sites on the mn iv oxides mol l a relatively high content of mn iv oxides was observed in the brown sediment table 2 which could act as electron acceptors to oxidize as iii eq 1 once mn ii occupies the surface sites and produces mn comn species the number of free surface sites mn coh and the as iii oxidation rate both decrease a multi step surface reaction for as iii adsorption onto mn iv oxide containing sediments was adopted in this study fig 4 according to previous research radu et al 2008 ying et al 2012 step 1 during the reactions dissolved as iii firstly encountered the oxidation sites of mn iv oxides mn c and were oxidized to as v species on the surface with the production of mn ii which was released into solution eq 1 dissolved mn ii was then adsorbed and occupied the mn c oxidation sites on the mn iv oxides eq 2 thus decreasing the as iii oxidation rate eq 3 simultaneously the oxidized as v was quickly released from the mn c oxidation sites into the solution scott and morgan 1995 step 2 dissolved as iii was adsorbed onto surf b step 3 dissolved as v was adsorbed onto surf a this conceptual model assumes that as iii oxidation does not occur at the generic adsorption sites e g surf a surf b amirbahman et al 2006 the electron transfer between the as iii and mn iv oxides was considered to be much faster than the as iii and as v adsorption processes tournassat et al 2002 therefore as iii and as v would not accumulate much on oxidation site mn c scott and morgan 1995 since radu et al 2008 observed both as iii and as v to be negligibly adsorbed on mn iv oxides as iii and as v adsorption on the oxidation sites was not taken into account in the model m4 therefore both as iii oxidation on the oxidation sites and as iii as v adsorption onto the different adsorption sites of the sediment surfaces were considered in model m4 and were used to explain the observations of as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 figs 2a and 3 table 1 twenty seven parameters were considered in the calibration system for model m4 twelve parameters obtained in model m1 were employed in model m4 to simulate as v adsorption and related po4 and hco3 competition table 1 the other 15 parameters included 11 parameters for as iii po4 and hco3 adsorption and four parameters for as iii oxidation reactions table 1 in model m4 kinetic as iii oxidation was allowed to proceed for around 5 days corresponding to the period of observed equilibrium in the preliminary kinetic adsorption experiments fig s2 the predicted amounts of as adsorption were the sum of those of as iii and as v which closely approximated the observed amounts of as adsorption with a normalized rmse of 3 fig 2a as shown in figs 2a and 3 model m4 was capable of predicting the as adsorption isotherms ph effects and competitions with po4 and hco3 and concentrations of dissolved as iii and dissolved as v observed in the experiments modeling outputs suggested a much better simulations on dissolved as iii concentrations with the normalized rmse of 2 than on dissolved as v concentrations with the normalized rmse of 12 fig 3 in model m4 competitions of dissolved as with po4 were more apparent than those in models m5 and m6 fig 2d mainly due to partial oxidation of as iii to as v fig 3c which competed strongly with po4 adsorption fig 1d 4 discussion 4 1 differences between as v and as iii adsorption 4 1 1 inhibitation of ph and po4 on as v adsorption arsenic v adsorption appeared to be mainly inhibited by increasing ph and concentration of po4 fig 1 solution ph exhibited distinct effects on as v adsorption onto the brown and gray sediments fig 1b the ph dependent adsorption of as v onto the brown sediment resembled those reported for as v adsorption onto al oxides masue et al 2007 synthetic or natural hematite jeong et al 2007 guo et al 2007 goethite in the presence of 1 0 mmol l ca2 deng et al 2018 and soil samples cui and weng 2013 goldberg et al 2005 showing an increasing adsorption and further a decreasing adsorption along with the ph increases however the two gray sediments had similar ph dependent as v adsorption patterns to synthesized goethite stachowicz et al 2006 with as v adsorption decreased with the ph increase the as v adsorption edge onto plain 1 78 decreased much more sharply than that onto tran 1 64 fig 1b our previous study revealed that the groundwater in the transition area is mostly of ca mg cl type while groundwater in the flat plain is mainly of na cl type jia et al 2014 although our batch experiments were carried out using 20 mmol l nacl solution as a background electrolyte the two sediments experienced different groundwater environments in the field with more ca2 preadsorbed on tran 1 64 the greater amount of ca2 preadsorbed on tran 1 64 made the as v adsorption edges less affected by the solution ph masue et al 2007 preadsorbed ca2 may provide more positive charge on the sediment surface and thus be more favorable for as v adsorption relative to preadsorbed na system at high ph wilkie and hering 1996 gustafsson and bhattacharya 2007 the as v adsorption edge onto fe iii oxides decreased more obviously in the presence of na than ca2 stachowicz et al 2008 kanemstsu et al 2013 similar to our observation fig 1c and d evident competition between as v and po4 adsorption onto goethite has also been reported stollenwerk et al 2007 stachowicz et al 2008 kanemstsu et al 2013 stolze et al 2019 the strong competition between as v and po4 fig 1c and d is mainly due to the similarities in the chemical structures and reactivities of these two species zhao and guo 2014 and the interfacial charge distribution between as v δz 1 1 47 and 1 30 v u and po4 δz 1 1 46 and 1 28 v u stachowicz et al 2008 4 1 2 restrain of ph po4 and hco3 on as iii adsorption increases in ph concentrations of po4 and hco3 restrained as iii adsorption here as iii adsorption onto the brown sediment fan 1 18 was the combination of as iii oxidation and the sum of as iii and as v adsorption fig 2a decreases in as iii adsorption onto the three sediments was observed as ph increased from around 7 to 9 fig 2b which is different to the negligible effect of ph on as iii adsorption onto pleistocene brown sediments rathi et al 2017 and holocene gray sediments from the red river floodplain sø et al 2018 and oxidized holocene sediments from west bengal chakraborty et al 2014 however ph dependent as iii adsorption onto the three sediments was similar to that onto fe iii oxides dixit and hering 2003 raven et al 1998 a major discrepancy between as iii adsorption onto the three sediments and synthesized fe iii oxides was that the phs where the maximum as iii adsorption onto the three sediments occurred fig 2b were coincidentally lower than those for synthesized fe iii oxides typically from 8 5 to 9 dzombak and morel 1990 dixit and hering 2003 stachowicz et al 2006 which is possibly due to natural fe iii oxides having lower phpzc 6 5 6 8 giménez et al 2007 than synthetic ones 8 5 9 3 appelo and postma 2005 the lower phpzc for natural fe iii oxides is related to their better crystallinity caused by slower crystallization or the presence of negatively charged impurities schwertmann and fechter 1982 the strong competition of po4 with as iii adsorption onto the three sediments fig 2c is consistent with observations of nguyen et al 2014 and rathi et al 2017 for sediments from the red river floodplain however a negligible effect of po4 on as iii adsorption onto fe iii oxides was reported by stolze et al 2019 which was based on sensitivity analyses using cd music and ddl models this negligible effect might be related to the relatively low as iii concentrations used in their models 3 07 μmol l stolze et al 2019 with a low initial as iii concentration 2 μmol l the less important role of po4 in as iii adsorption was observable in this study fig 2c the negligible competition of as iii with po4 adsorption is consistent with observations of adsorption onto sediments from the red river floodplain rathi et al 2017 sø et al 2018 which might be due to po4 having a higher affinity for surface sites than as iii stachowicz et al 2008 in good agreement with previous studies bgs and dphe 2001 appelo et al 2002 harvey et al 2002 stachowicz et al 2008 stolze et al 2019 hco3 greatly promotes as iii desorption via competitive adsorption although others believe that hco3 is not a major competitor for as iii adsorption jessen et al 2012 nguyen et al 2014 sø et al 2018 therefore hco3 extraction was reported to greatly promote desorption of preadsorbed as iii in sediments relative to ultrapure water extraction anawar et al 2004 devore et al 2019 4 1 3 comparisons of as v and as iii adsorption generally as v adsorption onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 at ph 7 5 was greater than that of as iii while it was lower than that of as iii at ph 7 5 fig 5 greater as v adsorption at lower ph and higher as iii adsorption at higher ph have also been observed onto hfo and goethite manning et al 1998 raven et al 1998 goldberg 2002 dixit and hering 2003 kanemstsu et al 2013 the reason is that as v has more negative charges than as iii under high ph conditions and thus is adsorbed less with increasing ph raven et al 1998 the competitive effect of po4 was much stronger on as v adsorption than on as iii adsorption addition of 25 μmol l po4 resulted in a substantial decrease in as v adsorption onto the three sediments 35 fig 1c while as iii adsorption only decreased by 18 fig 2c a greater extent of po4 competition with as v adsorption was also observed for as v adsorption onto goethite via cd music prediction stachowicz et al 2008 stolze et al 2019 in turn as v showed a greater competitive effect on po4 adsorption fig 1d in contrast a minor effect of as iii on po4 adsorption was observed fig 2d which is in line with studies that showed little competition of as iii with po4 for the surface sites of aquifer sediments rathi et al 2017 sø et al 2018 the lesser competition between po4 and as iii can be explained by the smaller charge distribution of as iii δz 1 0 34 v u than as v δz 1 1 47 and 1 30 v u and po4 δz 1 1 46 and 1 28 v u in the 1 plane according to the cd music model stachowicz et al 2008 bicarbonate promoted as iii desorption more strongly than as v desorption via competitive adsorption figs 1e and 2e these differential effects of hco3 on as iii and as v adsorption are consistent with other studies radu et al 2005 stachowicz et al 2007 2008 kanemstsu et al 2013 stolze et al 2019 the stronger effect of hco3 on as iii adsorption was likely due to the inhibition of ternary goethite as iii fe ii complex formation by hco3 stolze et al 2019 or the much closer charge distribution of hco3 in the 1 plane δz 1 0 68 v u to as iii δz 1 0 34 v u than to as v δz 1 1 47 and 1 30 v u stachowicz et al 2008 another possible explanation is that as v adsorption is highly irreversible unlike the almost complete reversibility of as iii adsorption onto fe iii oxides and natural sediments radu et al 2005 nguyen et al 2014 radloff et al 2017 neidhardt et al 2018 the equilibrium constants for the protonation and deprotonation reactions in models m1 m3 pka 1 and pka 2 were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in models m4 m6 pkb 1 and pkb 2 table 1 this may indicate that as iii was adsorbed onto weakly reversible binding sites on the sediments rather than strongly irreversible adsorption sites for as v nguyen et al 2014 in addition the numbers of surface sites in models m4 m6 were around double those in models m1 m3 table 1 which shows good agreement with the observation that as v adsorption onto aquifer sediments had a lower capacity than that of as iii adsorption table s2 the greater numbers of surface sites for as iii adsorption than as v adsorption might be due to the fact that as iii adsorption onto fe iii oxides forms inner and outer sphere complexes while as v adsorption mainly forms inner sphere complexes goldberg and johnston 2001 gustafsson and bhattacharya 2007 4 2 importance of as iii oxidation in modeling as fate in oxic conditions mn iv oxides have high capacity of as iii oxidation tournassat et al 2002 arsenic iii oxidation is an very important process during modeling of as iii adsorption on the sediment with mn iv oxides due to different adsorption characteristics between as iii and as v the oxidation product of as iii amirbahman et al 2006 in order to precisely predict as iii fate in the batches as iii oxidation as iii and as v adsorption must be fully considered especially for the sediment containing mn iv oxides under oxic conditions it has been well known that the mn iv oxides are ready to oxidize dissolved as iii either in aquifer sediments amirbahman et al 2006 stollenwerk et al 2007 rathi et al 2017 or in experimental conditions ying et al 2012 villalobos et al 2014 accordingly our model m4 well predicted geochemical behavior of dissolved as in the fan 1 18 batches although mn iv oxides in the brown sediment oxidized as iii to as v its ability was limited at high initial as iii concentrations the ratio of as v to as iii decreased with increasing dissolved as iii concentration in experiments of as iii adsorption isotherms fig 3a the possible reason is the limited amount of oxidizing sites mc and or the amount of mn iv oxides table 2 according to model m4 the increase in dissolved as v concentration with ph fig 3b was the synergistic result of increasing as iii oxidation wu et al 2015 and decreasing as v adsorption at high ph fig 1b the decreases in dissolved as iii concentrations at lower phs 6 7 7 7 fig 3b is likely related to the fact that as iii oxidation and adsorption increase with ph while the increase in as iii concentrations at ph 7 7 might be due to the decrease in as iii adsorption being greater than the increase in as iii oxidation with increasing ph as simulated in model m4 both dissolved as v and as iii concentrations increased with increasing solution po4 concentrations fig 3c this is mainly related to po4 competition since po4 showed little effect on as iii oxidation and as v production amirbahman et al 2006 on account of this the gradual increases in both concentration and percentage of dissolved as v also imply that po4 competed with as v adsorption much more strongly than with as iii adsorption as mentioned above in addition as predicted by m4 increasing the hco3 concentration strongly increased as iii concentration but had limited effect on as v concentrations fig 3d these conclusions are also supported by the observations of as adsorption on the studied gray sediments figs 1 and 2 section 4 1 3 model m4 is different from other published models as it uses three different surface sites this contrasts with the models of stollenwerk et al 2007 and amirbahman et al 2006 which use the same surface sites for as iii and as v adsorption but do not consider the inhibition of dissolved mn ii on as iii oxidation the conceptual framework of model m4 is similar to the model proposed by rathi et al 2017 both of which consider the inhibition of dissolved mn ii on the as iii oxidation reaction however in the model of rathi et al 2017 preadsorbed as v po4 and mn ii are considered as calibrated parameters since that study did not account for as v desorption in the batches by performing blank experiments the reliability of their model is thus influenced by the uncertainty in these parameters our experiment based model framework reduces the number of calibrated parameters and therefore decreases the uncertainty of modeling results the experiment based modeling results model m4 indicated that the ability of aquifer sediments to oxidize aqueous as iii is highly associated with contents of mn iv oxides and sedimentary mn ii a relatively high content of mn iv oxides was observed in the brown sediment table 2 which acted as electron acceptors to oxidize as iii although mn iv oxides were also extracted in the two gray sediments their ability to oxidize as iii was inhibited by the equal amount of extracted sedimentary mn ii table 2 and therefore no as v was detected in the as iii batch experiments according to the study by amirbahman et al 2006 total extracted mn iv oxide contents were positively correlated with the number of oxidation sites in which the number of modeled oxidation sites accounted for around 5 of content of extracted mn iv oxide for the least reactive sediment and around 24 for the most reactive sediment on account of this the sedimentary mn ii with the equal amount to mn iv oxides in the two gray sediments may be enough to occupy most of the oxidation sites on mn iv oxides this could also be used to explain the fact that the oxidized aquifer sediments in the red river floodplain were unable to oxidize as iii rathi et al 2017 since contents of mn iv oxides were identical to those of sedimentary mn ii around 1 mmol kg postma et al 2010 4 3 comparisons of as adsorption onto sediments from river deltas and inland basins capacities of as adsorption were obtained by langmuir model fittings of our observed data and of published data stollenwerk et al 2007 rathi et al 2017 fig s3 these capacities of as adsorption together with other published capacities of as v and as iii adsorption onto natural sediments from inland basins ma et al 2015 and river deltas radloff et al 2011 jung et al 2012 chakraborty et al 2014 sø et al 2018 were plotted as a function of fe iii oxide contents in sediments fig 6 with the exception of as v adsorption onto the fan 1 18 brown sediment the capacities of as v adsorption onto inland basin sediments e g the hetao basin this study and the beijing plain ma et al 2015 showed a positive correlation with fe iii oxide contents n 4 r 2 0 38 fig 6a the fe iii oxide normalized as v adsorption was around 3 7 mmol as mol fe iii oxides the slope of the fitted line furthermore aquifer sediments from river deltas stollenwerk et al 2007 radloff et al 2011 jung et al 2012 showed a positive linear correlation between as v adsorption and fe iii oxide contents n 5 r 2 0 99 fig 6a according to the linear relationship the normalized as v adsorption was around 3 5 mmol as mol fe iii oxides in the river delta sediments fig 6a which is slightly lower than that in the inland basin sediments in addition there were positive correlations between as iii adsorption and fe iii oxide contents in aquifer sediments from inland basins with an exception of as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 data in this study ma et al 2015 n 4 r 2 0 74 and in river delta sediments radloff et al 2011 jung et al 2012 chakraborty et al 2014 rathi et al 2017 sø et al 2018 n 10 r 2 0 84 fig 6b arsenic iii adsorption normalized to fe iii oxide content in sediments from inland basins was around 8 2 mmol mol which is much higher than that from river deltas around 2 7 mmol mol fig 6b these results indicate that as v and as iii adsorption in aquifer sediments from river deltas and inland basins is highly dependent on the contents of fe iii oxides and would decrease as fe iii oxides decrease postma et al 2016 sø et al 2018 the fe iii oxide normalized as v and as iii adsorption onto aquifer sediments from river deltas were coincidentally lower than those from inland basins fig 6 which is possibly due to the dominance of crystalline fe iii oxides in sediments from river deltas amorphous fe iii oxides accounted for around 40 of the total fe iii oxides in gray sediments from the hetao basin table 2 whereas lesser amounts of amorphous phases were present in river deltas postma et al 2010 jessen et al 2012 stuckey et al 2016 dixit and hering 2003 suggested that decreases in the specific surface area and surface site density of fe iii oxides caused by the transformation of amorphous phases into crystalline phases could distinctly decrease as adsorption the values of the y intercepts in the fitted lines in fig 6 possibly reflect as adsorption onto other minerals in the sediments when fe iii oxides were absent for river deltas the y intercept was very low for as iii adsorption 0 025 μmol g r 2 0 84 and negative for as v adsorption in general as v and as iii adsorption were negligible once fe iii oxides were depleted in sediments which is in line with the observation by sø et al 2018 for inland basins the y intercepts were much higher indicating that other minerals in sediments from inland basins had affinities for as adsorption fig 6 likely explanations for this phenomenon include the presence of other minerals that act as potential adsorbents including clay minerals manning and goldberg 1997 chakraborty et al 2007 martin et al 2014 siderite guo et al 2013 and sulfide minerals e g mackinawite and pyrite bostick and fendorf 2003 wolthers et al 2005 xrd analysis revealed that the contents of clay minerals e g micas and kaolinite in fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 were 12 18 5 and 14 respectively table s1 fine sands in the hetao basin typically contain higher contents of clay minerals around 14 guo et al 2016a than those in river deltas around 2 in the red river floodplain sø et al 2018 in addition the gray sediments in inland basins generally contain higher contents of sulfide minerals median 13 mmol kg total sulfide in an 87 m depth profile from the hetao basin guo et al 2016b than the sulfide poor sediments of river deltas typically 0 3 mmol kg in bangladesh swartz et al 2004 jung et al 2012 found that sediments with high sulfide contents had stronger as retention than sediments with low sulfide contents the low relative contents of crystalline fe iii oxides and low sulfide contents in fan 1 18 and river delta sediments may be the reason that the data for the brown sediment of fan 1 18 fig 6 deviates from the regression line for inland basin sediments and is located around the trend line for river delta sediments the y intercept for as v adsorption 0 48 μmol g was around double that for as iii adsorption 0 17 μmol g onto inland basin sediments fig 6 the differences in as adsorption in inland basin and river delta sediments could be related to the combined effects of the above mentioned minerals which deserve further study as shown in fig 6 as iii adsorption normalized to fe iii oxides on sediments from inland basins 8 2 mmol mol was higher than that of as v adsorption 3 7 mmol mol which agrees well with the observation that as iii adsorption was greater than as v adsorption at ph 7 5 fig 5 however the fe iii oxide normalized as v adsorption onto sediments from river deltas 3 5 mmol mol was slightly higher than that for as iii adsorption 2 7 mmol mol according to experiments that were mostly performed under near neutral ph conditions stollenwerk et al 2007 radloff et al 2011 jung et al 2012 nguyen et al 2014 rathi et al 2017 sø et al 2018 this is consistent with the conclusion that more as v was adsorbed than as iii at ph 7 5 fig 5 the fe iii oxide normalized as v adsorption onto aquifer sediments 3 5 to 3 7 mmol mol was similar to reported as v adsorption onto synthetic al substituted goethite 2 8 mmol mol and goethite 6 7 mmol mol martin et al 2014 and hematite 7 4 mmol mol catalano et al 2011 but higher than that onto natural hematite 0 44 mmol mol guo et al 2007 in addition the fe iii oxide normalized as iii adsorption on aquifer sediments 2 7 8 2 mmol mol is similar to those reported for synthetic al substituted goethite 3 6 mmol mol martin et al 2014 and natural or synthetic goethite 8 8 8 9 mmol mol ladeira and ciminelli 2004 martin et al 2014 these outcomes confirm that fe iii oxides are important adsorbents in aquifer sediments for as adsorption which intrinsically explains the reported positive relationships between the contents of as and fe extracted from aquifer sediments from river deltas fendorf et al 2010 reza et al 2010 and inland basins guo et al 2014 however extracted as fe molar ratios in aquifer sediments from river deltas around 0 3 mmol mol fendorf et al 2010 and from inland basins around 0 8 mmol mol guo et al 2014 are considerably lower than the fe iii oxide normalized as adsorption observed in the present study fig 6 this indicates that the surface sites in natural aquifer sediments are far from being saturated with as 4 4 environmental implications the present study has important implications for understanding the roles of adsorption desorption processes in as mobility in oxic groundwater with as v dominating as v desorption induced by elevated ph and po4 was the primary mechanism of as v enrichment in groundwater while hco3 appeared to be an ineffective competitor fig 1 although the capacity for as v to adsorb onto brown sediment was lower than that for gray sediment low dissolved as concentrations mainly as as v were found in the alluvial fan mean 0 1 μmol l fig s1b the low dissolved as concentrations in this zone can be explained by the relatively low dissolved po4 concentrations mean 0 22 μmol l gao et al 2020 and neutral ph median 7 54 guo et al 2016a however these low as aquifers with brown sediments would be vulnerable to as contamination from high as groundwater even when dissolved as iii is oxidized to as v in anoxic groundwater with as iii dominating as iii desorption triggered by elevated ph and hco3 concentration could be a driver of as iii release in inland basins fig 2 where relatively high ph and hco3 concentrations occur e g mean phs of 8 1 8 0 and 7 9 and mean hco3 concentrations of 10 8 0 and 8 6 mmol l in the hetao datong and yinchuan basins respectively guo et al 2014 however this mechanism might be insignificant in river deltas with near neutral ph conditions e g mean phs of 7 0 7 0 and 6 9 in bangladesh the red river floodplain and the mekong delta respectively hug et al 2008 although our study observed competition of po4 with as iii adsorption this may not be an important influence on as mobility in the hetao basin since the dissolved po4 concentration was quite low mean 0 64 μmol l gao et al 2020 however po4 competition could be a trigger of as iii release in aquifers in river deltas which have relatively high po4 concentrations bangladesh mean po4 23 μmol l red river floodplain po4 26 μmol l mekong delta po4 16 μmol l hug et al 2008 this study also clarified that as v and as iii adsorption onto different sediments are both highly dependent on the content and crystallinity of fe iii oxides and the contents of the clay minerals and or fe ii minerals in the sediments the finding implies that as retardation should decrease over time under reducing conditions as fe iii oxides are gradually reduced in the sediments in particular poorly crystalline fe iii oxides with relatively high as adsorption are more readily reduced than crystalline fe iii oxides stuckey et al 2016 therefore as adsorbed on fe iii oxides with poor crystallinity is more sensitive to redox variations and is prone to being mobilized under reducing conditions in the flat plain of the study area release of fe ii may lead to the formation of secondary fe ii minerals e g siderite and fe ii sulfides which would have affinity for as adsorption jönsson and sherman 2008 burnol and charlet 2010 kocar et al 2010 couture et al 2013 xie et al 2016 however they generally had lower affinity for as than poorly crystalline fe iii oxides raven et al 1998 bostick and fendorf 2003 and could not scavenge all the as released via the reduction of fe iii oxides due to the higher relative contents of poorly crystalline fe iii oxides in the aquifers of inland basins mobilization of adsorbed as would be more sensitive to reducing conditions than in river deltas this finding also provides an explanation for the patchy distributions of groundwater as observed in as affected aquifers in river deltas and inland basins smedley and kinniburgh 2002 fendorf et al 2010 guo et al 2014 heterogeneity in the contents and crystallinity of fe iii oxides in natural sediments could result in diverse adsorption for as retardation which directly regulates concentrations of dissolved as knowing the types and contents of fe iii oxides in sediments may help estimate as retardation and attenuation along a flow path using reactive transport models a recent study predicted that an as v plume would be transported for around 2 4 km with ferrihydrite as the main phase in the sediments whereas it would move around 8 5 km with goethite as the adsorbent johannesson et al 2019 therefore a full understanding of the mineral phases existing in sediments is necessary when quantifying the reactive transport of groundwater as and predicting the temporal and spatial evolution of dissolved as in aquifer systems 5 conclusions measurements of as v and as iii adsorption onto the studied sediments produced nonlinear adsorption isotherms generally more as v was adsorbed than as iii at ph 7 5 whereas the opposite occurred at ph 7 5 the competitive effect of po4 was much stronger on as v adsorption than on as iii adsorption while hco3 competed considerably more with as iii adsorption than as v adsorption arsenic iii was partially oxidized when interacting with brown sediment with a high content of mn iv oxides the observed as iii oxidation was attributed to mn iv oxides but was constrained by the limited availability of oxidation sites and the adsorption of released mn ii three types of surface sites were simulated to model as v and as iii adsorption and oxidation by aquifer sediments the observed data were precisely captured by our geochemical models arsenic adsorption onto aquifer sediments was primarily controlled by the content and crystallinity of the fe iii oxide minerals in the sediments the brown sediment which had a lower proportion of amorphous fe iii oxide phases showed lower affinity for as v and as iii adsorption than the gray sediments the compilation of published data on as adsorption onto aquifer sediments from river deltas and inland basins showed that the fe iii oxide normalized as v adsorption and the normalized as iii adsorption onto aquifer sediments were higher in inland basins with higher relative contents of poorly crystalline fe iii oxides which underlined the crucial role of fe iii oxides in as v and as iii adsorption mobilization of adsorbed as would be more sensitive to reducing conditions in aquifers of inland basin with the higher relative contents of poorly crystalline fe iii oxides in addition to poorly crystalline of fe iii oxides clay and sulfide minerals in inland basin sediments would contribute to as retardation in groundwater which deserves further study credit authorship contribution statement zhipeng gao

5346,natural occurrence of groundwater arsenic as exists in many aquifers and threatens the health of hundreds of millions of people adsorption of as is critical to its distribution in aquifer groundwater as it can lower dissolved as concentrations and provide a source for as mobilization however little is known about as adsorption onto aquifer sediments in inland basins to fill this gap we investigated as v and as iii adsorption onto a brown sediment hosting low as groundwater and two gray sediments hosting high as groundwater sampled from an approximate flow path of the hetao basin china those three sediments had total fe contents of around 1 3 and as contents of around 9 0 μg g arsenic iii adsorption were kinetically faster than as v adsorption on the sediments the characteristics of as v and as iii adsorption both exhibited nonlinear isotherms with adsorption decreasing with increases in ph from around 7 to 9 typical ambient groundwater ph of inland basins generally as v adsorption was greater than as iii adsorption at ph 7 5 whereas the opposite was true at ph 7 5 phosphate competed more strongly with as v adsorption than as iii adsorption while hco3 competed more strongly with as iii adsorption aqueous as iii was oxidized to as v by interaction with the brown sediment mainly due to its high content of extractable mn iv oxides arsenic adsorption onto the sediments was primarily controlled by the content and crystallinity of their fe iii oxides the brown sediment showed weaker affinity for as v and as iii than the gray sediments possibly due to the better crystallinity of the fe iii oxides in the brown sediment in the two gray sediments containing fe iii oxides with similar crystallinities the as adsorption capacity was related to the content of fe iii oxides geochemical models were developed to quantitatively simulate as v and as iii adsorption onto aquifer sediments experimental data were approximated well by these models indicating that as v adsorption decreases at elevated ph and po4 concentration while as iii desorption is favored at high ph and concentrations of hco3 and po4 according to the models the extent and kinetics of as iii oxidation are controlled by the number of free oxidation sites in mn iv oxides ph and as iii concentration this study suggests that the characteristics of as adsorption are highly dependent on the mineral phases existing in the sediments which must be fully understood to quantify the reactive transport of groundwater as in aquifer systems keywords adsorption arsenic hetao basin oxidation surface complexation model 1 introduction naturally occurring high as groundwater 10 μg l has been discovered in aquifers throughout the world mainly in inland basins and river deltas smedley and kinniburgh 2002 guo et al 2014 chronic intake of high as groundwater leads to serious as related health problems threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people globally fendorf et al 2010 rodríguez lado et al 2013 therefore as remediation is highly important for which a proper understanding of the geochemical processes controlling as mobilization is a prerequisite there is a general consensus that as distributions in groundwaters are highly controlled by adsorption processes radloff et al 2011 jessen et al 2012 van geen et al 2013 under oxic conditions where as v is the dominant species the capacity for aquifer sediments to adsorb as v is the primary factor determining groundwater as levels smedley and kinniburgh 2002 in reducing aquifers once as is released into groundwater via the reductive dissolution of as bearing fe iii oxides its fate thereafter is affected by the process of as iii adsorption onto aquifer sediments nguyen et al 2014 under favorable geochemical conditions as desorption acts as a driver for as release in both oxidizing and reducing aquifers appelo et al 2002 podgorski et al 2017 postma et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the distribution coefficient k d and surface complexation model scm are the most frequently used approaches for quantifying as adsorption the distribution coefficient is determined from either in situ push pull experiments harvey et al 2002 radloff et al 2011 jessen et al 2012 van geen et al 2013 or a series of extraction procedures swartz et al 2004 van geen et al 2008 radloff et al 2011 richards et al 2019 that describes the retardation property of aquifer sediments on as transport the obtained k d values are then incorporated into as transport models to predict temporal and spatial evolutions in groundwater as van geen et al 2008 2013 radloff et al 2011 the scm has the ability to quantify as adsorption with regard to the transformation of as species and variation in the concentrations of competing anions e g oh hco3 po4 under variable geochemical conditions published scms are mostly based on databases of as adsorption onto fe iii al oxides dzombak and morel 1990 dixit and hering 2003 stachowicz et al 2006 kersten and vlasova 2009 karamalidis and dzombak 2010 clay minerals manning and goldberg 1997 micas chakraborty et al 2007 and calcite sø et al 2008 these published scms especially those based on adsorption onto hydrous ferric oxides hfo ddl model and goethite e g cd music model dixit and hering s 2003 model have been widely applied in many reactive transport models e g postma et al 2007 rotiroti et al 2015 pi et al 2018 sun et al 2018 however recent studies have concluded that as adsorption onto natural aquifer sediments has significant discrepancies to that of synthetic fe iii oxides nguyen et al 2014 although fe iii oxides are recognized as the dominant adsorbent in aquifer sediments sø et al 2018 although the langmuir model fitting technique is effective when competitors are limited and no transformation of as species occurs nguyen et al 2014 sø et al 2018 scms are applicable to multi competitor as adsorption systems previous studies have used a non electrostatic surface complexation model with a generalized composite approach gc scm to characterize as adsorption onto aquifer sediments from river deltas stollenwerk et al 2007 rathi et al 2017 and have shown that po4 is an effective competitor for both as v and as iii adsorption while increasing the ph from 6 to 8 decreases as v adsorption but has little effect on as iii adsorption onto aquifer sediments since gc scms are highly site specific davis et al 1998 2004 goldberg et al 2007 they cannot be directly adopted to describe as adsorption on sediments in inland basins to the best of our knowledge there are no gc scms describing as adsorption onto sediments in inland basins where sediment characteristics are very different from those in river deltas guo et al 2014 podgorski et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to investigate the nature of as adsorption onto sediments from inland basins and to develop relevant gc scms that can provide insight into such processes and improve our understanding of as enrichment in groundwater systems the hetao basin is a typical arid semiarid inland basin hosting high as groundwater guo et al 2014 previous studies have revealed the presence of brown aquifer sediments hosting low as groundwater near a mountainous region and gray aquifer sediments hosting high as groundwater in a flat plain within the basin jia et al 2014 guo et al 2016a gao et al 2020 therefore the hetao basin is an excellent area in which to investigate as adsorption onto aquifer sediments with different geochemical characteristics the present study was conducted in the hetao basin and aimed to 1 investigate as v and as iii adsorption onto different aquifer sediments 2 use experimental data to develop geochemical models that quantitatively describe as adsorption and can be applied to a reactive transport model and 3 evaluate the role of as adsorption in as mobilization in aquifer systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sampling of aquifer sediments aquifer sediments were collected in the northwestern part of the hetao basin china fig s1a in the hetao basin high as groundwater is widely distributed in late pleistocene fluvial lacustrine aquifers cao et al 2018 from shallow 40 m below land surface bls to deep groundwater 40 m bls jia et al 2014 guo et al 2016a an obvious redox zonation associated with increases in groundwater as concentration has been identified from the alluvial fan of the langshan mountains through the transition area to the flat plain fig s1b in aquifers near the mountains groundwater as is typically low under aerobic environments whereas mildly anoxic conditions prevail in the flat plain with high groundwater as concentrations jia et al 2014 high as groundwater in the flat plain is closely related to the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides and as desorption induced by high hco3 concentrations and alkaline phs gao et al 2020 detailed descriptions of the study area can be found elsewhere guo et al 2016a three boreholes of up to 80 m length were drilled in 2015 borehole fan 1 was located in the alluvial fan borehole tran 1 was in the transition area and borehole plain 1 was in the flat plain fig s1b brown sediments were observed in borehole fan 1 which hosted low as groundwater whereas gray sediments predominantly occurred in boreholes tran 1 and plain 1 which hosted high as groundwater the sample collection and storage procedures used in this study are described elsewhere guo et al 2016a to investigate as adsorption onto aquifer sediments along the flow path three sediments were chosen for batch adsorption experiments 1 sediment fan 1 18 a brown fine sand from 17 9 to 18 0 m bls in the alluvial fan 2 sediment tran 1 64 a steel gray fine sand from 64 1 to 64 2 m bls in the transition area and 3 sediment plain 1 78 a gray fine sand from 78 7 to 78 8 m bls in the flat plain our previous study showed that as v was the major as species 67 90 of total as in oxic suboxic brown sediments near the alluvial fan while as iii 67 81 prevailed in the gray sediments under reducing conditions in the flat plain guo et al 2016a 2 2 sediment characterization the mineral phases of the dried sediments were determined by quantitative x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis detailed procedures can be found in the supporting information sediment fe bearing mineral contents were determined by parallel dissolution experiments in an anoxic chamber coy laboratory products usa under anoxic conditions postma et al 2016 the experiments were carried out in three stages using 1 1 mmol l hcl at ph 3 to extract easily dissolved fe ii minerals 2 10 mmol l ascorbic acid at ph 3 to extract poorly crystalline fe iii oxides and easily dissolved fe ii minerals and 3 0 1 mol l ascorbic acid and 0 2 mol l ammonium oxalate at ph 3 to extract crystalline fe iii oxides poorly crystalline fe iii minerals and easily dissolved fe ii minerals because the latter dissolution stage also dissolved the fe forms present in the former stage the difference in the fe contents of the 10 mmol l ascorbic extract and the 1 mmol l hcl extract at ph 3 was related to poorly crystalline fe iii oxides while the difference in the fe contents of the 0 1 mol l ascorbic 0 2 mol l ammonium oxalate extract and the 10 mmol l ascorbic extract was related to crystalline fe iii oxides total fe iii oxide contents were determined from the difference in the fe contents of the 0 1 mol l ascorbic 0 2 mol l ammonium oxalate extract and the hcl extract at ph 3 details of the parallel dissolution procedures can be found in the supporting information the other extraction procedures were performed by adding 1 g of wet sediment around 0 85 g dry sediment to 1 20 ml solutions at ph 2 for dissolution of easily dissolved mn ii minerals and partial desorption of adsorbed mn ii referred to as sedimentary mn ii hereafter makino et al 2006 and 2 20 ml solutions with 0 1 mol l nh2oh hcl and 0 01 mol l hno3 at ph 2 for around 30 min for dissolutions of mn iv oxides and sedimentary mn ii reza et al 2010 the difference in mn contents between the nh2oh hcl hno3 extract and the ph 2 solution extract was related to the mn iv oxide contents in the sediments the extractions were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters and then analyzed for dissolved mn and as concentrations by icp ms 7500ce agilent the contents of sedimentary fes avs and cr ii reducible sulfide crs were extracted with 9 mol l hcl and 2 mol l crcl2 respectively detailed methods can be found elsewhere guo et al 2016b the contents of sedimentary inorganic sulfide were the sum of the avs and crs contents 2 3 batch adsorption experiments arsenic v and as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 sediments was investigated in a series of batch experiments to determine as adsorption isotherms and the effects of ph hco3 and po4 arsenic v adsorption onto fan 1 18 was conducted in contact with air whereas that for tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 was performed under anoxic conditions to simulate the typical geochemical conditions of the field site however as iii adsorption onto all three sediments was carried out under anoxic conditions the experiments were performed according to the study of stollenwerk et al 2007 all adsorption experiments were performed in 25 ml septum bottles containing 1 g of wet sediment around 0 85 g dry sediment and 20 ml of 20 mmol l nacl solution as a background electrolyte the moisture content and mass of dry sediment were determined from the weight lost during drying the solid liquid ratios were calculated from the mass of dry sediment and volume of liquid in the batch adsorption experiments and were 42 0 41 5 and 42 5 g l for the fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 batches respectively the ionic strength of 20 mmol l nacl was calculated as the median of over 300 samples collected in the hetao basin and was thus regarded as representative of the typical groundwater ionic strength stock solutions of as v as iii po4 and hco3 were prepared with reagent grade na2haso4 7h2o naaso2 na2hpo4 12h2o and nahco3 respectively all stock solutions used in the experiments of as iii adsorption onto the three sediments and as v adsorption onto sediments tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 were deoxygenated by purging with ultrapure n2 for 3 h 200 ml solution ph was adjusted using 1 mol l hcl and 1 mol l naoh during the experiments to examine the ph effect while in the other batch experiments the natural suspension phs were left undisturbed and measured at the end of each experiment all bottles were wrapped in aluminum foil and shaken at 180 rpm in darkness at 25 c equilibrium times for as adsorption were obtained from a series of preliminary kinetic experiments fig s2 a duration of 3 d was selected as the most appropriate time for as iii adsorption onto sediments tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 whereas a duration of 5 d was selected for as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 and as v adsorption onto all three sediments fig s2 blank experiments were also conducted to quantify as desorption in an as free electrolyte solution of 20 mmol l nacl the adsorbed as concentration was determined as the difference between the initial and final as concentrations in which the as concentration in the blank experiment was subtracted from the final as concentration during experiments as species were also measured all experiments were carried out in triplicate arsenic adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms for as v and as iii were determined by batch experiments with as concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 25 μmol l arsenic adsorption edge the effects of ph on as v and as iii adsorption were investigated using initial as concentrations of 2 μmol l and 10 μmol l and solution phs of 6 to 9 competitive adsorption by po4 the competitive effects of po4 on as v and as iii adsorption were studied using initial as concentrations of 2 μmol l 5 μmol l and 10 μmol l and po4 concentrations of 0 5 to 25 μmol l competitive adsorption by hco3 the competitive effects of hco3 on as adsorption were studied using initial as concentrations of 2 μmol l and 10 μmol l and hco3 concentrations varying from 2 to 12 mmol l time course samples were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters and stored in darkness at 4 c samples were divided into two subsamples one was preserved by addition of 6 mol l hno3 for detection of dissolved as fe mn and p by icp aes icap6300 thermo and the other was preserved with 0 25 mol l edta for detection of as species by hplc hg afs afs 9130 titan the detection limits for as iii and as v by hplc hg afs afs 9130 titan were 2 and 4 μg l respectively for competitive adsorption by hco3 another subsample was collected for the detection of dissolved hco3 via alkalinity testing mcolortest hc605827 2 4 geochemical modeling 2 4 1 modeling approach the data obtained from the batch experiments were approximated by geochemical models to quantitatively interpret the nature of as v and as iii adsorption onto the three typical sediments software phreeqc 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 was used with wateq4f dat as the database ball and nordstrom 1991 for surface complexation reactions we used a non electrostatic surface complexation model with a generalized composite approach gc scm to make a quantitative prediction of as v and as iii adsorption onto the surface of sediment because it is more suitable for the inherent physical and chemical heterogeneity of sediment assemblages davis et al 1998 rathi et al 2017 the gc scm model simplifies the complex functional groups of the mineral assemblage as generic surface sites to represent average surface properties of sediments goldberg et al 2007 all surface complexation reactions were referred to in the report by stollenwerk et al 2007 table 1 since as v and as iii should not be adsorbed onto the same surface sites of natural sediments nguyen et al 2014 the surface complexation reactions for as v and as iii adsorption onto the sediments were interpreted by different protonation and deprotonation reactions e g surf a as as v adsorption sites and surf b as as iii adsorption sites therefore six geochemical models in total models m1 m6 table 1 were developed to explain as v and as iii adsorption onto the three sediments models m1 m3 predicted as v adsorption onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 respectively while models m4 m6 simulated as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 respectively surface complexation reactions of h as po4 and hco3 onto aquifer sediments were included in the modeling matrix table 1 since there were no transformations of as species observed in the batch experiments of as v adsorption onto the three aquifer sediments and as iii adsorption onto the two gray sediments i e tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 no other geochemical reactions were considered in these five models i e models m1 m2 m3 m5 m6 table 1 however the results of as iii adsorption onto the brown sediment fan 1 18 showed transformation of as iii to as v presumably due to oxidation by mn iv oxides amirbahman et al 2006 ying et al 2012 therefore kinetic oxidation of as iii by mn iv oxides coupled with as iii and as v adsorption were considered in the modeling of as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 model m4 an oxidation site mn c was integrated into model m4 to simulate as iii oxidation in consequence three types of surface sites namely surf a for as v adsorption surf b for as iii adsorption and mn c for as iii oxidation were developed to interpret as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 table 1 2 4 2 calibration strategy to obtain the intrinsic as iii and as v surface complexation constants geochemical models were developed in phreeqc 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 and coupled with matlab software through the iphreeqc module charlton and parkhurst 2011 a genetic algorithm calibration code was linked with iphreeqc by matlab to estimate the parameters of the geochemical models including the equilibrium constant of each surface complexation reaction log k the amount of reactive surface sites m and the kinetic rate constants of as iii oxidation k ox and k m table 1 on the basis of the batch adsorption experiments the lower and upper ranges of each parameter during calibration were compiled from available literatures on these geochemical reactions with fe iii mn iv oxides and sediments dzombak and morel 1990 stollenwerk et al 2007 rathi et al 2017 table 1 during the calibration the sum of the squared weighted residuals between the experimental and modeled data was considered as the objective function and was consequently minimized manning and goldberg 1997 the root mean squared error rmse was calculated to assess the accuracy of modeling fits lin et al 2019 normalized rmse was obtained from dividing the rmse by the maximum measured concentration of corresponding datasets 3 results 3 1 sediment characterization the mineral phases of the three sediments were mainly quartz 45 59 feldspar 20 33 clay minerals 12 18 5 and calcite 2 9 4 table s1 crystalline fe minerals such as goethite hematite pyrite and siderite were below the detection limit 1 the results of parallel dissolution experiments showed that the contents of easily dissolved fe ii minerals presented an increasing trend along the flow path table 2 however a decreasing trend in contents of fe iii oxides including poorly crystalline fe iii oxides and crystalline fe iii oxides along the flow path was observed table 2 the content of fe iii oxides extracted in fan 1 18 was 123 mmol fe kg sediment among which around 82 was characterized as crystalline phases table 2 the contents of extracted fe iii oxides decreased to 81 8 mmol fe kg sediment in tran 1 64 of which the relative abundance of the crystalline phases decreased to around 60 table 2 iron iii oxides extracted in plain 1 78 were 46 5 mmol fe kg sediment with around 63 as crystalline phases table 2 the contents of fe iii oxides extracted in the hetao basin fell within the range of those measured in aquifer sediments from river deltas e g bangladesh west bengal and the red river floodplain stollenwerk et al 2007 nath et al 2009 radloff et al 2011 sø et al 2018 table s2 the contents of mn iv oxides also exhibited a decreasing trend along the flow path there were 4 0 mmol kg in fan 1 18 1 5 mmol kg in tran 1 64 and 1 0 mmol kg in plain 1 78 table 2 these values are 30 50 times lower than the contents of fe iii oxides observed the content of extracted sedimentary mn ii was negligible in fan 1 18 while its contents in tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 were equivalent to the amount of extracted mn iv oxides table 2 the content of extracted mn iv oxides in fan 1 18 was very close to that in brown sediment from bangladesh around 4 6 mmol kg stollenwerk et al 2007 but higher than those from sediments at a cape cod site which averaged 1 2 mmol kg amirbahman et al 2006 the contents of mn iv oxides in the two gray sediments table 2 were comparable to those in gray sediments from bangladesh at around 1 2 mmol kg stollenwerk et al 2007 no sedimentary inorganic sulfides were detected in fan 1 18 table 2 the content of inorganic sulfides in tran 1 64 was 2 6 mmol kg which is comparable to that in plain 1 78 at 2 0 mmol kg table 2 and identical to the median contents of sedimentary inorganic sulfides measured in 33 sediments at an 87 m depth profile in the hetao basin 2 8 mmol kg guo et al 2016b 3 2 arsenic v adsorption 3 2 1 adsorption isotherms the concentration dependent adsorption of as v onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 sediments produced nonlinear adsorption isotherms fig 1 a no transformations of as species were observed during the experiment the equilibrium phs were around 8 8 4 and 7 9 in the fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 batches respectively for the highest initial as v concentration of 25 μmol l the maximum adsorptions onto the three sediments were 0 26 0 39 and 0 34 μmol g respectively the experimental data were fitted with langmuir adsorption isotherms with the capacities of as v adsorption onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 calculated as being 0 33 0 75 and 0 59 μmol g respectively fig s3 table s2 although the brown fan 1 18 sediment had a much higher content of fe iii oxides than those of the two gray sediments table 2 the capacity of as v adsorption onto fan 1 18 was lower than those of tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 which may be due to the predominance of crystalline fe iii oxides in fan 1 18 table 2 in spite of the slightly higher equilibrium ph in the tran 1 64 batches a higher capacity of as v adsorption was observed on tran 1 64 than on plain 1 78 possibly resulting from a higher content of fe iii oxides table 2 at equilibrium phs and using 20 mmol l nacl as a background electrolyte no as desorption was detected in the blank fan 1 18 batches whereas 0 00096 μmol g 3 μg l and 0 0053 μmol g 16 9 μg l as were detected in the blanks of the tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 batches respectively the desorbed as mainly presented as as iii which is related to the desorption of natural pre adsorbed as in the sediments 3 2 2 ph effect solution ph showed an obvious impact on as v adsorption onto the three sediments especially at the initial as v concentration of 10 μmol l fig 1b in the experiments with an initial as v concentration of 10 μmol l as v adsorption onto fan 1 18 increased by around 13 as the ph increased from 6 3 to 6 8 and then decreased by around 30 as the ph increased from 6 8 to 8 6 however as the ph increased from 6 4 to 8 9 as v adsorption decreased by 24 onto tran 1 64 and 56 onto plain 1 78 3 2 3 competition with po4 phosphate appeared to be an effective competitor for as v adsorption onto the surface sites of the sediments fig 1c the competitive effect was more evident at the initial as concentration of 10 μmol l than at 5 and 2 μmol l with the initial as v concentration of 10 μmol l addition of 25 μmol l po4 decreased as v adsorption by 45 35 and 47 onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 respectively fig 1c the po4 adsorption data also produced nonlinear adsorption isotherms fig 1d competition between as v and po4 adsorption was obvious showing that a high initial as v concentration inhibited po4 adsorption onto the sediments fig 1d 3 2 4 competition with hco3 the competitive effect of hco3 on as v adsorption was almost negligible fig 1e a negligible competitive effect of hco3 on as v adsorption has also been reported for goethite stachowicz et al 2008 kanemstsu et al 2013 stolze et al 2019 and sediments from bangladesh stollenwerk et al 2007 and the red river floodplain nguyen et al 2014 this is likely related to the higher affinity for as v adsorption onto fe iii oxides than for hco3 stachowicz et al 2007 3 3 arsenic iii adsorption 3 3 1 adsorption isotherms arsenic iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 sediments produced nonlinear adsorption isotherms fig 2 a the equilibrium ph after adsorption was around 8 in the fan 1 18 batches 8 5 in the tran 1 64 batches and 7 8 in the plain 1 78 batches the equilibrium phs were much higher than those reported for sediments from the red river floodplain ph 6 3 6 4 rathi et al 2017 indicating that there is a more alkaline environment in the hetao basin with the highest initial as iii concentration of 25 μmol l the maximum adsorption was 0 3 μmol g in the fan 1 18 batches 0 406 μmol g in the tran 1 64 batches and 0 366 μmol g in the plain 1 78 batches these as iii adsorption isotherms were fitted with langmuir adsorption models fig s3 the calculated capacity of as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 0 44 μmol g was lower than those onto tran 1 64 0 8 μmol g and plain 1 78 0 71 μmol g fig s3 table s2 possibly due to the higher proportion of crystalline fe iii oxides in fan 1 18 table 2 in spite of the equilibrium ph in the tran 1 64 batches around 8 5 being slightly higher than that in the plain 1 78 batches 7 8 the capacity for as iii adsorption onto the former was higher than that onto the latter which may result from the higher content of fe iii oxides in tran 1 64 table s2 arsenic v was detected in the batches where as iii was adsorbed onto fan 1 18 fig 3 a indicating transformation of dissolved as iii to as v with initial as iii concentrations of 0 5 to 25 μmol l dissolved as iii exhibited a near linear rate of increase from 0 027 μmol l detection limit of 2 μg l to 10 7 μmol l while the dissolved as v concentration gradually increased from 0 08 μmol l to a plateau of around 2 μmol l fig 3a since no as v was detected in the blank sample the presence of as v can be attributed to oxidation of dissolved as iii rather than desorption of preadsorbed as v therefore the amount of adsorbed as in the fan 1 18 batches should be the sum of the adsorbed as iii and adsorbed as v shown in fig 2a no transformation of as species was associated with the as iii adsorption onto the two gray sediments desorbed as concentrations in the blanks of the tran 1 68 and plain 1 78 experiments were very close to those in the as v batches reported in section 3 2 1 3 3 2 ph effect there were considerable differences in the effect of ph on as iii adsorption onto the three batches especially at the higher initial as iii concentration fig 2b at the initial as iii concentration of 10 μmol l the as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 increased to the maximum at around ph 7 and decreased by 17 with a further increase in ph to around 8 6 fig 2b the as iii adsorption onto tran 1 64 showed an increase of around 9 from ph 6 7 to 7 3 and remained relatively constant from ph 7 3 to 8 2 before gradually decreasing by around 7 5 from ph 8 2 to 8 9 fig 2b this ph dependence is similar to that reported for synthesized goethite by dixit and hering 2003 showing that as iii adsorption initially increases with ph then has a broad plateau before decreasing with further increases in ph however as iii adsorption onto plain 1 78 slightly increased with the increase in ph from 6 3 to 6 5 and then decreased by around 25 from ph 6 5 to 8 9 fig 2b transformation of dissolved as iii to as v was observed within the studied ph range in the fan 1 18 batches fig 3b with initial as iii concentrations of 2 μmol l and 10 μmol l the dissolved as v concentration increased with ph fig 3b the dissolved as iii concentration exhibited decreases as the ph increased from 6 7 to 7 7 and then increased with further ph increases to 8 6 fig 3b however with a ph increase from 6 7 to 8 6 the percentage of dissolved as iii decreased from around 90 to 50 and around 90 to 70 with initial as iii concentrations of 2 μmol l and 10 μmol l respectively the amount of desorbed as in the blank sets of fan 1 18 sediment decreased from 0 0002 μmol g 0 7 μg l at ph 6 7 to below the detection limit at ph 8 2 and then increased to 0 0008 μmol g 2 6 μg l at ph 8 6 this illustrates that the desorption of preadsorbed as contributes less to the measured as v in the batches showing ph effect on as iii adsorption and that the detected as v was mainly produced from as iii oxidation 3 3 3 competition with po4 phosphate acted as an effective competitor for as iii adsorption onto the sediments fig 2c the competitive effect became more evident with a higher initial as iii concentration with an initial as iii concentration of 10 μmol l the addition of 25 μmol l po4 decreased as iii adsorption by 33 18 and 13 in the fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 sediments respectively fig 2c dissolved as v was detected in the fan 1 18 batches fig 3c therefore the competition between po4 and as was the result of the effects of po4 on as iii and as v adsorption in the blank set of fan 1 18 batches at an initial po4 concentration of 25 μmol l the amount of desorbed as was 0 002 μmol g 6 3 μg l which existed mainly as the as v species desorption of preadsorbed as v made a lesser contribution to the measured as v concentration as po4 concentrations increased from 0 5 to 25 μmol l concentrations of both dissolved as v and as iii showed increasing trends in the three batches with different initial as iii concentrations fig 3c in addition the percentages of measured as v increased from 28 to 54 from 20 to 32 and from 22 to 28 with increasing po4 concentrations in batches with initial as iii concentrations of 2 5 and 10 μmol l respectively fig 3c in the presence of as iii the adsorption of po4 also exhibited nonlinear isotherms fig 2d competition of as iii with po4 adsorption was less evident fig 2d than competition of as v with po4 adsorption fig 1d 3 3 4 competition with hco3 increasing the hco3 concentration caused visible competition with as iii adsorption under the experimental conditions fig 2e at an initial as iii concentration of 10 μmol l the addition of 12 mmol l hco3 decreased as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 by 26 19 and 33 respectively transformation of as iii was also observed in the fan 1 18 batches fig 3d dissolved as v concentrations remained relatively constant at 0 3 and 0 9 μmol l in the presence of 12 mmol l hco3 and initial as iii concentrations of 2 and 10 μmol l respectively fig 3d the relative abundance of measured as iii increased from 59 to 64 at an initial as iii concentration of 2 μmol l and from 77 to 84 at an initial as iii concentration of 10 μmol l this illustrates that as iii adsorption was apparently more influenced by hco3 competition than as v adsorption which is quite different to the fact mentioned above that po4 competed more strongly with as v than as iii 3 4 experiment based geochemical modeling 3 4 1 arsenic v adsorption three geochemical models m1 m3 were developed to decipher the nature of as v adsorption onto the three aquifer sediments table 1 for each model the reaction matrix included one type of generic surface site for as v adsorption surf a and 11 surface complexation reactions involving h as v po4 and hco3 table 1 therefore each model contained 12 parameters in the calibration system including the equilibrium constants log ka of the surface reactions and the number of reactive surface sites ma table 1 the calibrated parameters of the three models are listed in table 1 the equilibrium constants of each surface complexation reaction log ka were within the ranges of data published for as v adsorption table 1 the numbers of surface sites ma in the three models showed a decreasing trend in the order of m2 m3 m1 table 1 which is the same order as for the as v adsorption capacities table s2 the three models were able to interpret as v adsorption onto the three different sediments the model simulations accurately captured the concentration dependent as v adsorption isotherms ph effects and competition with po4 and hco3 observed in the experiments fig 1 with normalized rmse values of 5 7 3 5 and 2 8 for models m1 m2 and m3 respectively in modeling isotherm experiments m1 m2 and m3 simulated outputs provided well descriptions of the nonlinear as v adsorption with normalized rmses 5 fig 1a although simulated output was slightly underestimated at ph lower than 7 0 in model m1 the three models accurately captured the ph effects on as v adsorption with normalized rmses 5 fig 1b the peaked feature of ph dependent as v adsorption was predicted by model m1 while in models m2 and m3 as v adsorption decreased with increases in ph from 6 to 9 fig 1b the lack of competitions of hco3 with as v adsorption was precisely captured by the three models with normalized rmses 7 fig 1e the normalized rmses for modeling fits of competitions between po4 and as v 10 fig 1c and d were slightly higher than those for as v adsorption isotherms and competitions by ph and hco3 fig 1b and e 3 4 2 arsenic iii adsorption onto gray sediments two geochemical models were used to quantitatively predict as iii adsorption onto the two gray sediments m5 for tran 1 64 and m6 for plain 1 78 table 1 since no as v was detected during the experiments no redox reactions were considered in these two models another type of generic site was developed for as iii adsorption surf b table 1 ten surface complexation reactions of h as iii po4 and hco3 adsorption onto surf b were considered in the modeling matrix table 1 and therefore 11 parameters including the equilibrium constants log kb of the surface complexation reactions and the number of surface sites mb were considered in the calibration system each model was thus calibrated with the experimental results of as iii adsorption the calibrated parameters are shown in table 1 the results show that the numbers of calibrated surface sites mb in tran 1 64 m5 were higher than in plain 1 78 m6 table 1 which is in agreement with the capacities for as iii adsorption onto sediments calculated by fitting langmuir models fig s3 table s2 overall the experimental results of as iii adsorption isotherms ph effects and po4 and hco3 competition were correctly predicted by the two calibrated models fig 2 with normalized rmse values of 4 1 and 1 7 for models m5 and m6 respectively in modeling isotherm experiments fig 2a simulated outputs m5 and m6 matched the observed as iii adsorption well although the normalized rmse of model m5 was 12 the ph dependent as iii adsorption in model m5 predicted a maxima adsorption in the range of ph from 6 5 to 8 and a slightly decreasing adsorption at higher ph fig 2b while model m6 predicted a slight increase in as iii adsorption with ph increasing from 6 to 6 5 and a decrease with ph increasing from 6 5 to 9 fig 2b normalized rmses 4 the mild competitions of po4 with as iii adsorption fig 2c the negligible competitions of as iii with po4 adsorption fig 2d and the considerable competitions of hco3 with as iii adsorption fig 2e were all well simulated in these two models with normalized rmses 4 3 4 3 arsenic iii oxidation and adsorption onto brown sediment model m4 was developed to investigate as iii oxidation and adsorption onto the brown sediment sample fan 1 18 it considered as iii oxidation as iii and as v adsorption and mn ii adsorption table 1 arsenic iii oxidation was observed in the fan 1 18 batches fig 3 which was attributed to the mn iv oxides existing in the aquifer sediments eq 1 especially under oxic conditions amirbahman et al 2006 stollenwerk et al 2007 rathi et al 2017 because no transformation of as iii to as v was observed in the two experimental sets of as iii adsorption onto gray sediments the oxidation of as iii by fe iii oxides could be negligible similar to the observations in previous studies oscarson et al 1981 manning et al 1998 amirbahman et al 2006 although oxidation of as iii to as v by mn iv oxides produces mn ii eq 1 scott and morgan 1995 amirbahman et al 2006 dissolved mn ii concentrations were quite low in this study 0 1 μmol l the low dissolved mn ii concentrations were attributed to mn ii adsorption onto mn iv oxides and or other adsorbents such as fe iii oxides at high ph conditions ph 6 0 scott and morgan 1995 amirbahman et al 2006 stone and ulrich 1989 found that nearly 100 of mn ii was adsorbed at ph 6 undetectable dissolved mn ii was also reported in experiments where as iii was adsorbed onto oxidized aquifer sediments from cape cod usa amirbahman et al 2006 previous research has shown that dissolved mn ii may greatly inhibit as iii oxidation rates via adsorption onto mn iv oxides scott and morgan 1995 ehlert et al 2014 in addition to as iii oxidation by mn iv oxides the inhibition of as iii oxidation by dissolved mn ii was included in our model m4 the mechanism of inhibition is that adsorption of dissolved mn ii occupies the oxidation sites on the mn iv oxides and reduces the rate of as iii oxidation eq 2 rathi et al 2017 previous studies have also revealed that rates of as iii oxidation by mn iv oxides are higher at ph 6 than at ph 3 wu et al 2015 or ph 4 5 villalobos et al 2014 we therefore included the effect of ph on as iii oxidation in our model the kinetic rate of as iii oxidation by mn iv oxides was developed according to the literatures eq 3 tournassat et al 2002 amirbahman et al 2006 ying et al 2011 villalobos et al 2014 rathi et al 2017 1 mno2 2h h3aso3 h2o h3aso4 mn2 2 mn coh mn2 mn comn h 3 d a s i i i dt k o x a s i i i k m a s i i i a c t oh m n c o h where k ox is the oxidation rate constant l mol s as iii is the dissolved as iii concentration mol l k m is a half saturation constant for dissolved as iii mol l act oh is the activity of oh mol l and mn coh is the amount of free surface sites on the mn iv oxides mol l a relatively high content of mn iv oxides was observed in the brown sediment table 2 which could act as electron acceptors to oxidize as iii eq 1 once mn ii occupies the surface sites and produces mn comn species the number of free surface sites mn coh and the as iii oxidation rate both decrease a multi step surface reaction for as iii adsorption onto mn iv oxide containing sediments was adopted in this study fig 4 according to previous research radu et al 2008 ying et al 2012 step 1 during the reactions dissolved as iii firstly encountered the oxidation sites of mn iv oxides mn c and were oxidized to as v species on the surface with the production of mn ii which was released into solution eq 1 dissolved mn ii was then adsorbed and occupied the mn c oxidation sites on the mn iv oxides eq 2 thus decreasing the as iii oxidation rate eq 3 simultaneously the oxidized as v was quickly released from the mn c oxidation sites into the solution scott and morgan 1995 step 2 dissolved as iii was adsorbed onto surf b step 3 dissolved as v was adsorbed onto surf a this conceptual model assumes that as iii oxidation does not occur at the generic adsorption sites e g surf a surf b amirbahman et al 2006 the electron transfer between the as iii and mn iv oxides was considered to be much faster than the as iii and as v adsorption processes tournassat et al 2002 therefore as iii and as v would not accumulate much on oxidation site mn c scott and morgan 1995 since radu et al 2008 observed both as iii and as v to be negligibly adsorbed on mn iv oxides as iii and as v adsorption on the oxidation sites was not taken into account in the model m4 therefore both as iii oxidation on the oxidation sites and as iii as v adsorption onto the different adsorption sites of the sediment surfaces were considered in model m4 and were used to explain the observations of as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 figs 2a and 3 table 1 twenty seven parameters were considered in the calibration system for model m4 twelve parameters obtained in model m1 were employed in model m4 to simulate as v adsorption and related po4 and hco3 competition table 1 the other 15 parameters included 11 parameters for as iii po4 and hco3 adsorption and four parameters for as iii oxidation reactions table 1 in model m4 kinetic as iii oxidation was allowed to proceed for around 5 days corresponding to the period of observed equilibrium in the preliminary kinetic adsorption experiments fig s2 the predicted amounts of as adsorption were the sum of those of as iii and as v which closely approximated the observed amounts of as adsorption with a normalized rmse of 3 fig 2a as shown in figs 2a and 3 model m4 was capable of predicting the as adsorption isotherms ph effects and competitions with po4 and hco3 and concentrations of dissolved as iii and dissolved as v observed in the experiments modeling outputs suggested a much better simulations on dissolved as iii concentrations with the normalized rmse of 2 than on dissolved as v concentrations with the normalized rmse of 12 fig 3 in model m4 competitions of dissolved as with po4 were more apparent than those in models m5 and m6 fig 2d mainly due to partial oxidation of as iii to as v fig 3c which competed strongly with po4 adsorption fig 1d 4 discussion 4 1 differences between as v and as iii adsorption 4 1 1 inhibitation of ph and po4 on as v adsorption arsenic v adsorption appeared to be mainly inhibited by increasing ph and concentration of po4 fig 1 solution ph exhibited distinct effects on as v adsorption onto the brown and gray sediments fig 1b the ph dependent adsorption of as v onto the brown sediment resembled those reported for as v adsorption onto al oxides masue et al 2007 synthetic or natural hematite jeong et al 2007 guo et al 2007 goethite in the presence of 1 0 mmol l ca2 deng et al 2018 and soil samples cui and weng 2013 goldberg et al 2005 showing an increasing adsorption and further a decreasing adsorption along with the ph increases however the two gray sediments had similar ph dependent as v adsorption patterns to synthesized goethite stachowicz et al 2006 with as v adsorption decreased with the ph increase the as v adsorption edge onto plain 1 78 decreased much more sharply than that onto tran 1 64 fig 1b our previous study revealed that the groundwater in the transition area is mostly of ca mg cl type while groundwater in the flat plain is mainly of na cl type jia et al 2014 although our batch experiments were carried out using 20 mmol l nacl solution as a background electrolyte the two sediments experienced different groundwater environments in the field with more ca2 preadsorbed on tran 1 64 the greater amount of ca2 preadsorbed on tran 1 64 made the as v adsorption edges less affected by the solution ph masue et al 2007 preadsorbed ca2 may provide more positive charge on the sediment surface and thus be more favorable for as v adsorption relative to preadsorbed na system at high ph wilkie and hering 1996 gustafsson and bhattacharya 2007 the as v adsorption edge onto fe iii oxides decreased more obviously in the presence of na than ca2 stachowicz et al 2008 kanemstsu et al 2013 similar to our observation fig 1c and d evident competition between as v and po4 adsorption onto goethite has also been reported stollenwerk et al 2007 stachowicz et al 2008 kanemstsu et al 2013 stolze et al 2019 the strong competition between as v and po4 fig 1c and d is mainly due to the similarities in the chemical structures and reactivities of these two species zhao and guo 2014 and the interfacial charge distribution between as v δz 1 1 47 and 1 30 v u and po4 δz 1 1 46 and 1 28 v u stachowicz et al 2008 4 1 2 restrain of ph po4 and hco3 on as iii adsorption increases in ph concentrations of po4 and hco3 restrained as iii adsorption here as iii adsorption onto the brown sediment fan 1 18 was the combination of as iii oxidation and the sum of as iii and as v adsorption fig 2a decreases in as iii adsorption onto the three sediments was observed as ph increased from around 7 to 9 fig 2b which is different to the negligible effect of ph on as iii adsorption onto pleistocene brown sediments rathi et al 2017 and holocene gray sediments from the red river floodplain sø et al 2018 and oxidized holocene sediments from west bengal chakraborty et al 2014 however ph dependent as iii adsorption onto the three sediments was similar to that onto fe iii oxides dixit and hering 2003 raven et al 1998 a major discrepancy between as iii adsorption onto the three sediments and synthesized fe iii oxides was that the phs where the maximum as iii adsorption onto the three sediments occurred fig 2b were coincidentally lower than those for synthesized fe iii oxides typically from 8 5 to 9 dzombak and morel 1990 dixit and hering 2003 stachowicz et al 2006 which is possibly due to natural fe iii oxides having lower phpzc 6 5 6 8 giménez et al 2007 than synthetic ones 8 5 9 3 appelo and postma 2005 the lower phpzc for natural fe iii oxides is related to their better crystallinity caused by slower crystallization or the presence of negatively charged impurities schwertmann and fechter 1982 the strong competition of po4 with as iii adsorption onto the three sediments fig 2c is consistent with observations of nguyen et al 2014 and rathi et al 2017 for sediments from the red river floodplain however a negligible effect of po4 on as iii adsorption onto fe iii oxides was reported by stolze et al 2019 which was based on sensitivity analyses using cd music and ddl models this negligible effect might be related to the relatively low as iii concentrations used in their models 3 07 μmol l stolze et al 2019 with a low initial as iii concentration 2 μmol l the less important role of po4 in as iii adsorption was observable in this study fig 2c the negligible competition of as iii with po4 adsorption is consistent with observations of adsorption onto sediments from the red river floodplain rathi et al 2017 sø et al 2018 which might be due to po4 having a higher affinity for surface sites than as iii stachowicz et al 2008 in good agreement with previous studies bgs and dphe 2001 appelo et al 2002 harvey et al 2002 stachowicz et al 2008 stolze et al 2019 hco3 greatly promotes as iii desorption via competitive adsorption although others believe that hco3 is not a major competitor for as iii adsorption jessen et al 2012 nguyen et al 2014 sø et al 2018 therefore hco3 extraction was reported to greatly promote desorption of preadsorbed as iii in sediments relative to ultrapure water extraction anawar et al 2004 devore et al 2019 4 1 3 comparisons of as v and as iii adsorption generally as v adsorption onto fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 at ph 7 5 was greater than that of as iii while it was lower than that of as iii at ph 7 5 fig 5 greater as v adsorption at lower ph and higher as iii adsorption at higher ph have also been observed onto hfo and goethite manning et al 1998 raven et al 1998 goldberg 2002 dixit and hering 2003 kanemstsu et al 2013 the reason is that as v has more negative charges than as iii under high ph conditions and thus is adsorbed less with increasing ph raven et al 1998 the competitive effect of po4 was much stronger on as v adsorption than on as iii adsorption addition of 25 μmol l po4 resulted in a substantial decrease in as v adsorption onto the three sediments 35 fig 1c while as iii adsorption only decreased by 18 fig 2c a greater extent of po4 competition with as v adsorption was also observed for as v adsorption onto goethite via cd music prediction stachowicz et al 2008 stolze et al 2019 in turn as v showed a greater competitive effect on po4 adsorption fig 1d in contrast a minor effect of as iii on po4 adsorption was observed fig 2d which is in line with studies that showed little competition of as iii with po4 for the surface sites of aquifer sediments rathi et al 2017 sø et al 2018 the lesser competition between po4 and as iii can be explained by the smaller charge distribution of as iii δz 1 0 34 v u than as v δz 1 1 47 and 1 30 v u and po4 δz 1 1 46 and 1 28 v u in the 1 plane according to the cd music model stachowicz et al 2008 bicarbonate promoted as iii desorption more strongly than as v desorption via competitive adsorption figs 1e and 2e these differential effects of hco3 on as iii and as v adsorption are consistent with other studies radu et al 2005 stachowicz et al 2007 2008 kanemstsu et al 2013 stolze et al 2019 the stronger effect of hco3 on as iii adsorption was likely due to the inhibition of ternary goethite as iii fe ii complex formation by hco3 stolze et al 2019 or the much closer charge distribution of hco3 in the 1 plane δz 1 0 68 v u to as iii δz 1 0 34 v u than to as v δz 1 1 47 and 1 30 v u stachowicz et al 2008 another possible explanation is that as v adsorption is highly irreversible unlike the almost complete reversibility of as iii adsorption onto fe iii oxides and natural sediments radu et al 2005 nguyen et al 2014 radloff et al 2017 neidhardt et al 2018 the equilibrium constants for the protonation and deprotonation reactions in models m1 m3 pka 1 and pka 2 were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in models m4 m6 pkb 1 and pkb 2 table 1 this may indicate that as iii was adsorbed onto weakly reversible binding sites on the sediments rather than strongly irreversible adsorption sites for as v nguyen et al 2014 in addition the numbers of surface sites in models m4 m6 were around double those in models m1 m3 table 1 which shows good agreement with the observation that as v adsorption onto aquifer sediments had a lower capacity than that of as iii adsorption table s2 the greater numbers of surface sites for as iii adsorption than as v adsorption might be due to the fact that as iii adsorption onto fe iii oxides forms inner and outer sphere complexes while as v adsorption mainly forms inner sphere complexes goldberg and johnston 2001 gustafsson and bhattacharya 2007 4 2 importance of as iii oxidation in modeling as fate in oxic conditions mn iv oxides have high capacity of as iii oxidation tournassat et al 2002 arsenic iii oxidation is an very important process during modeling of as iii adsorption on the sediment with mn iv oxides due to different adsorption characteristics between as iii and as v the oxidation product of as iii amirbahman et al 2006 in order to precisely predict as iii fate in the batches as iii oxidation as iii and as v adsorption must be fully considered especially for the sediment containing mn iv oxides under oxic conditions it has been well known that the mn iv oxides are ready to oxidize dissolved as iii either in aquifer sediments amirbahman et al 2006 stollenwerk et al 2007 rathi et al 2017 or in experimental conditions ying et al 2012 villalobos et al 2014 accordingly our model m4 well predicted geochemical behavior of dissolved as in the fan 1 18 batches although mn iv oxides in the brown sediment oxidized as iii to as v its ability was limited at high initial as iii concentrations the ratio of as v to as iii decreased with increasing dissolved as iii concentration in experiments of as iii adsorption isotherms fig 3a the possible reason is the limited amount of oxidizing sites mc and or the amount of mn iv oxides table 2 according to model m4 the increase in dissolved as v concentration with ph fig 3b was the synergistic result of increasing as iii oxidation wu et al 2015 and decreasing as v adsorption at high ph fig 1b the decreases in dissolved as iii concentrations at lower phs 6 7 7 7 fig 3b is likely related to the fact that as iii oxidation and adsorption increase with ph while the increase in as iii concentrations at ph 7 7 might be due to the decrease in as iii adsorption being greater than the increase in as iii oxidation with increasing ph as simulated in model m4 both dissolved as v and as iii concentrations increased with increasing solution po4 concentrations fig 3c this is mainly related to po4 competition since po4 showed little effect on as iii oxidation and as v production amirbahman et al 2006 on account of this the gradual increases in both concentration and percentage of dissolved as v also imply that po4 competed with as v adsorption much more strongly than with as iii adsorption as mentioned above in addition as predicted by m4 increasing the hco3 concentration strongly increased as iii concentration but had limited effect on as v concentrations fig 3d these conclusions are also supported by the observations of as adsorption on the studied gray sediments figs 1 and 2 section 4 1 3 model m4 is different from other published models as it uses three different surface sites this contrasts with the models of stollenwerk et al 2007 and amirbahman et al 2006 which use the same surface sites for as iii and as v adsorption but do not consider the inhibition of dissolved mn ii on as iii oxidation the conceptual framework of model m4 is similar to the model proposed by rathi et al 2017 both of which consider the inhibition of dissolved mn ii on the as iii oxidation reaction however in the model of rathi et al 2017 preadsorbed as v po4 and mn ii are considered as calibrated parameters since that study did not account for as v desorption in the batches by performing blank experiments the reliability of their model is thus influenced by the uncertainty in these parameters our experiment based model framework reduces the number of calibrated parameters and therefore decreases the uncertainty of modeling results the experiment based modeling results model m4 indicated that the ability of aquifer sediments to oxidize aqueous as iii is highly associated with contents of mn iv oxides and sedimentary mn ii a relatively high content of mn iv oxides was observed in the brown sediment table 2 which acted as electron acceptors to oxidize as iii although mn iv oxides were also extracted in the two gray sediments their ability to oxidize as iii was inhibited by the equal amount of extracted sedimentary mn ii table 2 and therefore no as v was detected in the as iii batch experiments according to the study by amirbahman et al 2006 total extracted mn iv oxide contents were positively correlated with the number of oxidation sites in which the number of modeled oxidation sites accounted for around 5 of content of extracted mn iv oxide for the least reactive sediment and around 24 for the most reactive sediment on account of this the sedimentary mn ii with the equal amount to mn iv oxides in the two gray sediments may be enough to occupy most of the oxidation sites on mn iv oxides this could also be used to explain the fact that the oxidized aquifer sediments in the red river floodplain were unable to oxidize as iii rathi et al 2017 since contents of mn iv oxides were identical to those of sedimentary mn ii around 1 mmol kg postma et al 2010 4 3 comparisons of as adsorption onto sediments from river deltas and inland basins capacities of as adsorption were obtained by langmuir model fittings of our observed data and of published data stollenwerk et al 2007 rathi et al 2017 fig s3 these capacities of as adsorption together with other published capacities of as v and as iii adsorption onto natural sediments from inland basins ma et al 2015 and river deltas radloff et al 2011 jung et al 2012 chakraborty et al 2014 sø et al 2018 were plotted as a function of fe iii oxide contents in sediments fig 6 with the exception of as v adsorption onto the fan 1 18 brown sediment the capacities of as v adsorption onto inland basin sediments e g the hetao basin this study and the beijing plain ma et al 2015 showed a positive correlation with fe iii oxide contents n 4 r 2 0 38 fig 6a the fe iii oxide normalized as v adsorption was around 3 7 mmol as mol fe iii oxides the slope of the fitted line furthermore aquifer sediments from river deltas stollenwerk et al 2007 radloff et al 2011 jung et al 2012 showed a positive linear correlation between as v adsorption and fe iii oxide contents n 5 r 2 0 99 fig 6a according to the linear relationship the normalized as v adsorption was around 3 5 mmol as mol fe iii oxides in the river delta sediments fig 6a which is slightly lower than that in the inland basin sediments in addition there were positive correlations between as iii adsorption and fe iii oxide contents in aquifer sediments from inland basins with an exception of as iii adsorption onto fan 1 18 data in this study ma et al 2015 n 4 r 2 0 74 and in river delta sediments radloff et al 2011 jung et al 2012 chakraborty et al 2014 rathi et al 2017 sø et al 2018 n 10 r 2 0 84 fig 6b arsenic iii adsorption normalized to fe iii oxide content in sediments from inland basins was around 8 2 mmol mol which is much higher than that from river deltas around 2 7 mmol mol fig 6b these results indicate that as v and as iii adsorption in aquifer sediments from river deltas and inland basins is highly dependent on the contents of fe iii oxides and would decrease as fe iii oxides decrease postma et al 2016 sø et al 2018 the fe iii oxide normalized as v and as iii adsorption onto aquifer sediments from river deltas were coincidentally lower than those from inland basins fig 6 which is possibly due to the dominance of crystalline fe iii oxides in sediments from river deltas amorphous fe iii oxides accounted for around 40 of the total fe iii oxides in gray sediments from the hetao basin table 2 whereas lesser amounts of amorphous phases were present in river deltas postma et al 2010 jessen et al 2012 stuckey et al 2016 dixit and hering 2003 suggested that decreases in the specific surface area and surface site density of fe iii oxides caused by the transformation of amorphous phases into crystalline phases could distinctly decrease as adsorption the values of the y intercepts in the fitted lines in fig 6 possibly reflect as adsorption onto other minerals in the sediments when fe iii oxides were absent for river deltas the y intercept was very low for as iii adsorption 0 025 μmol g r 2 0 84 and negative for as v adsorption in general as v and as iii adsorption were negligible once fe iii oxides were depleted in sediments which is in line with the observation by sø et al 2018 for inland basins the y intercepts were much higher indicating that other minerals in sediments from inland basins had affinities for as adsorption fig 6 likely explanations for this phenomenon include the presence of other minerals that act as potential adsorbents including clay minerals manning and goldberg 1997 chakraborty et al 2007 martin et al 2014 siderite guo et al 2013 and sulfide minerals e g mackinawite and pyrite bostick and fendorf 2003 wolthers et al 2005 xrd analysis revealed that the contents of clay minerals e g micas and kaolinite in fan 1 18 tran 1 64 and plain 1 78 were 12 18 5 and 14 respectively table s1 fine sands in the hetao basin typically contain higher contents of clay minerals around 14 guo et al 2016a than those in river deltas around 2 in the red river floodplain sø et al 2018 in addition the gray sediments in inland basins generally contain higher contents of sulfide minerals median 13 mmol kg total sulfide in an 87 m depth profile from the hetao basin guo et al 2016b than the sulfide poor sediments of river deltas typically 0 3 mmol kg in bangladesh swartz et al 2004 jung et al 2012 found that sediments with high sulfide contents had stronger as retention than sediments with low sulfide contents the low relative contents of crystalline fe iii oxides and low sulfide contents in fan 1 18 and river delta sediments may be the reason that the data for the brown sediment of fan 1 18 fig 6 deviates from the regression line for inland basin sediments and is located around the trend line for river delta sediments the y intercept for as v adsorption 0 48 μmol g was around double that for as iii adsorption 0 17 μmol g onto inland basin sediments fig 6 the differences in as adsorption in inland basin and river delta sediments could be related to the combined effects of the above mentioned minerals which deserve further study as shown in fig 6 as iii adsorption normalized to fe iii oxides on sediments from inland basins 8 2 mmol mol was higher than that of as v adsorption 3 7 mmol mol which agrees well with the observation that as iii adsorption was greater than as v adsorption at ph 7 5 fig 5 however the fe iii oxide normalized as v adsorption onto sediments from river deltas 3 5 mmol mol was slightly higher than that for as iii adsorption 2 7 mmol mol according to experiments that were mostly performed under near neutral ph conditions stollenwerk et al 2007 radloff et al 2011 jung et al 2012 nguyen et al 2014 rathi et al 2017 sø et al 2018 this is consistent with the conclusion that more as v was adsorbed than as iii at ph 7 5 fig 5 the fe iii oxide normalized as v adsorption onto aquifer sediments 3 5 to 3 7 mmol mol was similar to reported as v adsorption onto synthetic al substituted goethite 2 8 mmol mol and goethite 6 7 mmol mol martin et al 2014 and hematite 7 4 mmol mol catalano et al 2011 but higher than that onto natural hematite 0 44 mmol mol guo et al 2007 in addition the fe iii oxide normalized as iii adsorption on aquifer sediments 2 7 8 2 mmol mol is similar to those reported for synthetic al substituted goethite 3 6 mmol mol martin et al 2014 and natural or synthetic goethite 8 8 8 9 mmol mol ladeira and ciminelli 2004 martin et al 2014 these outcomes confirm that fe iii oxides are important adsorbents in aquifer sediments for as adsorption which intrinsically explains the reported positive relationships between the contents of as and fe extracted from aquifer sediments from river deltas fendorf et al 2010 reza et al 2010 and inland basins guo et al 2014 however extracted as fe molar ratios in aquifer sediments from river deltas around 0 3 mmol mol fendorf et al 2010 and from inland basins around 0 8 mmol mol guo et al 2014 are considerably lower than the fe iii oxide normalized as adsorption observed in the present study fig 6 this indicates that the surface sites in natural aquifer sediments are far from being saturated with as 4 4 environmental implications the present study has important implications for understanding the roles of adsorption desorption processes in as mobility in oxic groundwater with as v dominating as v desorption induced by elevated ph and po4 was the primary mechanism of as v enrichment in groundwater while hco3 appeared to be an ineffective competitor fig 1 although the capacity for as v to adsorb onto brown sediment was lower than that for gray sediment low dissolved as concentrations mainly as as v were found in the alluvial fan mean 0 1 μmol l fig s1b the low dissolved as concentrations in this zone can be explained by the relatively low dissolved po4 concentrations mean 0 22 μmol l gao et al 2020 and neutral ph median 7 54 guo et al 2016a however these low as aquifers with brown sediments would be vulnerable to as contamination from high as groundwater even when dissolved as iii is oxidized to as v in anoxic groundwater with as iii dominating as iii desorption triggered by elevated ph and hco3 concentration could be a driver of as iii release in inland basins fig 2 where relatively high ph and hco3 concentrations occur e g mean phs of 8 1 8 0 and 7 9 and mean hco3 concentrations of 10 8 0 and 8 6 mmol l in the hetao datong and yinchuan basins respectively guo et al 2014 however this mechanism might be insignificant in river deltas with near neutral ph conditions e g mean phs of 7 0 7 0 and 6 9 in bangladesh the red river floodplain and the mekong delta respectively hug et al 2008 although our study observed competition of po4 with as iii adsorption this may not be an important influence on as mobility in the hetao basin since the dissolved po4 concentration was quite low mean 0 64 μmol l gao et al 2020 however po4 competition could be a trigger of as iii release in aquifers in river deltas which have relatively high po4 concentrations bangladesh mean po4 23 μmol l red river floodplain po4 26 μmol l mekong delta po4 16 μmol l hug et al 2008 this study also clarified that as v and as iii adsorption onto different sediments are both highly dependent on the content and crystallinity of fe iii oxides and the contents of the clay minerals and or fe ii minerals in the sediments the finding implies that as retardation should decrease over time under reducing conditions as fe iii oxides are gradually reduced in the sediments in particular poorly crystalline fe iii oxides with relatively high as adsorption are more readily reduced than crystalline fe iii oxides stuckey et al 2016 therefore as adsorbed on fe iii oxides with poor crystallinity is more sensitive to redox variations and is prone to being mobilized under reducing conditions in the flat plain of the study area release of fe ii may lead to the formation of secondary fe ii minerals e g siderite and fe ii sulfides which would have affinity for as adsorption jönsson and sherman 2008 burnol and charlet 2010 kocar et al 2010 couture et al 2013 xie et al 2016 however they generally had lower affinity for as than poorly crystalline fe iii oxides raven et al 1998 bostick and fendorf 2003 and could not scavenge all the as released via the reduction of fe iii oxides due to the higher relative contents of poorly crystalline fe iii oxides in the aquifers of inland basins mobilization of adsorbed as would be more sensitive to reducing conditions than in river deltas this finding also provides an explanation for the patchy distributions of groundwater as observed in as affected aquifers in river deltas and inland basins smedley and kinniburgh 2002 fendorf et al 2010 guo et al 2014 heterogeneity in the contents and crystallinity of fe iii oxides in natural sediments could result in diverse adsorption for as retardation which directly regulates concentrations of dissolved as knowing the types and contents of fe iii oxides in sediments may help estimate as retardation and attenuation along a flow path using reactive transport models a recent study predicted that an as v plume would be transported for around 2 4 km with ferrihydrite as the main phase in the sediments whereas it would move around 8 5 km with goethite as the adsorbent johannesson et al 2019 therefore a full understanding of the mineral phases existing in sediments is necessary when quantifying the reactive transport of groundwater as and predicting the temporal and spatial evolution of dissolved as in aquifer systems 5 conclusions measurements of as v and as iii adsorption onto the studied sediments produced nonlinear adsorption isotherms generally more as v was adsorbed than as iii at ph 7 5 whereas the opposite occurred at ph 7 5 the competitive effect of po4 was much stronger on as v adsorption than on as iii adsorption while hco3 competed considerably more with as iii adsorption than as v adsorption arsenic iii was partially oxidized when interacting with brown sediment with a high content of mn iv oxides the observed as iii oxidation was attributed to mn iv oxides but was constrained by the limited availability of oxidation sites and the adsorption of released mn ii three types of surface sites were simulated to model as v and as iii adsorption and oxidation by aquifer sediments the observed data were precisely captured by our geochemical models arsenic adsorption onto aquifer sediments was primarily controlled by the content and crystallinity of the fe iii oxide minerals in the sediments the brown sediment which had a lower proportion of amorphous fe iii oxide phases showed lower affinity for as v and as iii adsorption than the gray sediments the compilation of published data on as adsorption onto aquifer sediments from river deltas and inland basins showed that the fe iii oxide normalized as v adsorption and the normalized as iii adsorption onto aquifer sediments were higher in inland basins with higher relative contents of poorly crystalline fe iii oxides which underlined the crucial role of fe iii oxides in as v and as iii adsorption mobilization of adsorbed as would be more sensitive to reducing conditions in aquifers of inland basin with the higher relative contents of poorly crystalline fe iii oxides in addition to poorly crystalline of fe iii oxides clay and sulfide minerals in inland basin sediments would contribute to as retardation in groundwater which deserves further study credit authorship contribution statement zhipeng gao

5347,multi modelling aims to make use of the strengths of single hydrologic models to improve the accuracy of simulating the watershed system behavior considering hydrological signatures such as the flow duration curve segmentation in the calibration of each hydrologic model leads to a better parameter identifiability in this study a novel weighted average model wrapper based on flow duration curve segmentation is introduced to aggregate the calibrated models into a multi model the proposed framework is applied to develop a model wrapper of the upper assiniboine river basin for flood forecasting upstream of the shellmouth reservoir in the prairie region of canada the hec hms hbv ec hspf and watflood hydrologic models that are being used at the hydrologic forecast centre of manitoba infrastructure for operational inflow forecasting are calibrated using signature based multi objective optimization these models have significantly different structural complexities the calibration of each of these models is set up as three simulation optimization problems with different objective functions to balance the model capability in simulating multiple important hydrological signatures results show that the model wrapper outperforms each of the single calibrated models that are of operational use at manitoba infrastructure e g nse improved from 0 44 for the best individual model to 0 76 for the model wrapper in the calibration period moreover the weights associated with each hydrologic model component indicate the contribution rate of the individual models to the model wrapper in high flow mid flow and low flow portions of streamflow time series quantifying the contribution of each model component provides a deeper insight into model selection strategy especially when a component has minimal or no contribution e g hec hms and hbv ec in this paper to the model wrapper performance in all ranges of streamflow simulation compared to other model components keywords multi modelling model wrapper multi objective optimization hydrological signature canadian prairie flood forecasting 1 introduction hydrologic models are systems analysis tools that simulate our understanding of the hydrological processes and can help us reanalyze the historical events and estimate the watershed system responses to future hydrological events these models can be categorized based on their structural complexity in terms of the distribution of the geographical representation of the watershed system from lumped to distributed models and in terms of the base of their governing equations from conceptual to physically based models it is well known that a single model structure cannot adequately represent all governing processes of a watershed system response to hydrological events ajami et al 2007 therefore in order to address the model structural uncertainty in the model prediction one can combine results of multiple models in principle multi modelling aims to take advantage of strengths of a group of models that have different structural complexities to improve the overall prediction accuracy because it is expected that simulation error from different models can compensate each other ajami et al 2006 multi modelling has its roots in the study by bates and granger 1969 who showed that the weighted average of two sets of forecasted airline passenger datasets outperforms each individual dataset for forecasting the number of passenger miles flown it took about three decades for the community of hydrologic modelling to recognize multi modelling as a tool to improve the model prediction accuracy when shamseldin et al 1997 showed that even a simple or a weighted linear model averaging approach can outperform the individual models a conclusion that was confirmed by georgakakos et al 2004 and ajami et al 2006 to date several studies have investigated the superior performance of multi model ensembles to individual hydrologic models arsenault et al 2015 chen et al 2015 goswami et al 2007 jeong and kim 2009 kumar et al 2015 xiong et al 2001 zhang et al 2009 shamseldin et al 1997 recommended a neural network approach to build a non linear relationship between the models to improve the prediction accuracy ajami et al 2006 compared four different multi modelling approaches simple model average weighted model average wma multi model super ensemble mmse and modified multi model super ensemble m3se methods and recommended mmse and m3se that implement bias correction however madadgar et al 2014 argued that the bias correction through quantile mapping used in m3se for example that uses the cumulative distribution function of measured and simulated events does not maintain the sequence of events and therefore is not hydrologically expressive bayesian model averaging bma introduced by hoeting et al 1998 is a more sophisticated multi modelling approach that uses the bayesian statistical inference to calculate the weight of each model based on its performance during the training period ajami et al 2007 in this paper a novel model wrapper approach is introduced for multi modelling based on the weighted model averaging and flow duration curve partitioning this method allows the models for having different weights for predicting high average and low flow rates the optimal value of weights shows whether every model adds to the accuracy of flood forecasting the optimal value of weights also show the relative contribution of these models to the flow prediction for three mutually exclusive ranges of high mid range and low flow moreover the comparison between individual models and the model wrapper shows whether multi modelling could fix any model structural inadequacy the hydrologic models need to be calibrated individually before inserting their simulated streamflow time series into the model wrapper the performance of a calibrated hydrologic model depends on many factors including its structural complexity parametrization computational budget and problem formulation in principle due to the model parameter uncertainty more than one setting of a hydrologic model can adequately simulate the watershed system behavior the concept of equifinality beven and freer 2001 therefore in practice different settings of a hydrologic model are used to predict a range of watershed responses to future events either through a formal bayesian uncertainty approach by dream vrugt et al 2009 an informal uncertainty approach by generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and freer 2001 or a multi trial calibration with different calibration objectives such as tolson and shoemaker 2008 hydrologic model calibration is inherently multi objective because no single metric can comprehensively represent the distribution of simulation error residual between the simulated and measured data gupta et al 1998 over the past decade novel model performance metrics are developed and used in the literature as model calibration metrics that can guide the optimization to identify solutions that are more representative of hydrological signatures see for example yilmaz et al 2008 pfannerstill et al 2014 shafii and tolson 2015 and schaefli 2016 yilmaz et al 2008 advised that the automatic calibration of hydrologic models should consider objective functions that represent four major hydrological signatures the overall water balance vertical horizontal and temporal redistribution of water they introduced three model performance metrics using the flow duration curve partitioning multi objective optimization identifies the tradeoff among the conflicting objectives the so called pareto front solutions corresponding to the tails of the pareto front individually optimize a calibration objective however as discussed in kollat et al 2012 and asadzadeh et al 2014 the multi objective optimization can balance between the conflicting calibration objectives and identify a solution corresponding to the so called knee point of the pareto front that is closest to the ideal point and therefore can be selected as the best single tradeoff solution this study expresses the importance of using the signature based multi objective calibration approach along with multi modelling by combining the strong points of individual models to improve the calibration of the models for accurate forecasting of the streamflow with a focus on peak flow estimation the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the case study watershed and the hydrologic models that are used for the streamflow simulations three different types of formulations for the multi objective calibration of the models along with the proposed model combination approach are then explained the calibration results for each model and the effect of the model wrapper on simulation accuracy are presented and discussed in section 3 followed by study limitations and concluding remarks in section 4 and section 5 respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 importance of flood forecasting in canadian prairies flood forecasting is one of the major applications of hydrologic models in the canadian prairie provinces ahmari et al 2016 blais et al 2016a blais et al 2016b where flood is one of the most costly natural disasters over the past 100 years this region has experienced significant floods the assiniboine river in manitoba alone for example has experienced at least six major floods in the past 100 years manitoba infrastructure and transportation 2016 flooding has been worse in the past 20 years due to the wet cycle going through the provinces unduche et al 2018 causing billions of dollars infrastructural damages buttle et al 2016 jakob and church 2011 the 2013 flood in alberta with estimated damage and recovery cost of cad 6 billion burn and whitfield 2016 pomeroy et al 2016 and the 2011 flood in manitoba with estimated damage and recovery cost of cad 1 2 billion burn and whitfield 2016 manitoba infrastructure and transportation 2016 are few of the recent examples to mention in order to better prepare for future flood events and mitigate the damages the provincial and federal governments have initiated reviews of past major floods in manitoba the 2011 flood review task force was established to assess the cause of the 2011 flood flood recovery procedures and flood forecasting methodologies manitoba infrastructure and transportation 2013 a similar task force was established in alberta to review the 2013 historic flood alberta watersmart 2013 flood recovery task force 2013 both of these reviews emphasized the need for accurate and timely dissemination of flood forecasts to the public and policy and decision makers accurate flood forecasting can minimize infrastructural damages and the economic and social impacts of floods to communities and can result in measures that will enhance ecological conditions carsell et al 2004 penning rowsell et al 2000 2 2 region of study the upper assiniboine river basin at kamsack in the prairie region of canada is selected for this study see fig 1 it has a total drainage area of 13 000 km 2 that flows into the shellmouth reservoir also known as lake of the prairies the shellmouth reservoir which is retained by the shellmouth dam is used for multiple purposes including flood control municipal and irrigation water supplies and recreation the operation of the dam control structure at the outlet of the reservoir is assisted by inflow forecasts that are obtained by simulating multiple hydrologic models unduche et al 2018 the upper assiniboine river watershed is dominated by abundant potholes sloughs and wetlands these potholes and wetlands significantly increase the surface storage capacity through the fill and spill process in potholes during snowmelt and or rainfall periods and consecutively affect the ratio of contributing versus non contributing area to streamflow fang et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2005 in addition to the potholes and wetlands the upper assiniboine river watershed is also characterized by the presence of poorly developed stream networks that considerably affect the intensity and timing of surface runoff fang et al 2007 the other complexity of the upper assiniboine river watershed rises from the frozen ground effect during spring melt the frozen ground condition reduces infiltration rate during the freshet period and remarkably increases the runoff intensity at the outlet hayashi et al 2003 the canadian prairie is a semi arid region with long cold winters and short warm summers with perennial flow regime in the upper assiniboine river upper assiniboine river basin study 2000 the continental polar air mass that basically resides over this region creates relatively low amounts of precipitation mcginn 2010 the precipitation amount in this region is highly variable and according to shepherd and mcginn 2003 the annual precipitation over the entire canadian prairie region ranges from an annual low of 300 mm to a high of 550 mm with a mean value of 486 mm around 70 80 of precipitation is received as rain in the canadian prairies wheaton 1998 within the simulation period used in this study that is between 1994 and 2017 the average lowest and highest annual precipitation amounts are 520 mm 395 1 mm and 668 1 mm respectively the input data quality check is not a part of this study and the hfc of mi were previously conducted a rigorous quality control mechanism on the raw historical meteorological data obtained from the environment and climate change canada weather stations the data quality check tasks included filling missing values about three percent in daily temperature and daily precipitation time series by interpolating data from nearby stations and using the area ratio method the precipitation data were not corrected for rain gauge undercatch due to plugging a considerable source of error for precipitation data in snow dominated regions as discussed in rasmussen et al 2012 and need to be corrected in future research 2 3 hydrologic models the list of hydrologic models that have been applied for flood forecasting and historical reanalysis at hfc of mi include the watflood model kouwen 2010 the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model lindström et al 1997 the hydrologic modelling system hec hms developed by the us army corps of engineers usace 2017 and the hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf developed by bicknell et al 2001 these models have significantly different levels of complexity watflood and hbv ec models are distributed but hec hms and hspf are respectively lumped and semi distributed models the winter processes simulation is another main difference between these models the winter processes have a major contribution to shaping the hydrograph from the beginning of freeze up to the freshet period all the models simulate snow accumulation and melting processes but only the watflood model is able to simulate the winter processes such as ice formation and channel lake freeze up this study is solely focused on the hydrologic models that are in operation at hydrologic forecast centre hfc of mi and use conceptual methods for the hydrological processes however more advanced physically based hydrologic models need to be set up at hfc to help them have a better simulation information regarding the model structure and main characteristics of each model in terms of input requirements and process representation of each module are found in the following and readers are referred to unduche et al 2018 for more detail about the upper assiniboine river basin models such as digital elevation model and land cover map 2 3 1 watflood model kouwen 2016 the watflood hydrologic model was first developed in 1973 for long term hydrological simulation and flood forecasting this model uses conceptual approaches for simulating the hydrological processes but the streamflow routing is based on physical methods watflood has been under continuous development in the past four decades for example stadnyk et al 2013 made it capable of simulating stable water isotopes to make the model applicable to remote basins that are minimally gauged and kouwen 2010 added the reservoir operation simulation component to it the model maintains both energy and water balances to respectively calculate the losses through evapotranspiration and outflow from the basin it uses a simple conceptual approach for the winter processes simulation that cuts off evaporation starts sublimation and stops direct precipitation from being added to the streamflow land cover precipitation and temperature data are the minimum required datasets for watflood however it can incorporate information about snow depth solar radiation wind speed humidity and soil moisture as spatially distributed input variables watflood includes data pre processing tools to convert the input data points into gridded data sets the model works based on the grouped response unit gru as the smallest computational component that assumes regions with similar land cover have similar soil type and topography therefore the hydrologically significant land cover classes are placed in one gru in each grid cell if the land cover resolution is higher than the cell size this way the parameters are associated with the land cover classes rather than the grid cells that is each grid cell has the same parametrization the contribution of each land cover class to the runoff is calculated based on their coverage in each cell the total hydrological response for a cell is equal to the summation of gru responses for the cell the hydrological responses are routed from the upstream to downstream cells connected by the drainage network the drainage of the study basin is modelled with 980 cells at 0 09 longitude and 0 06 latitude 7 6 km2 each cell is further sub divided into eight general grus based on land classes that are croplands grasslands deciduous forest coniferous forest mixed forest wetlands water and impervious lands six river classes are also identified for streamflow routing purposes based on natural boundaries and the nature of streamflow further details about watflood can be found in kouwen 2016 2 3 2 hec hms model feldman 2000 the conceptual hydrologic modelling system hec hms has long been used for flood forecasting and control due to its advanced graphical user interface and flexibility of methods selection for the hydrological process calculations hec hms is a semi distributed hydrologic model that is developed for the spatiotemporal hydrologic simulation of a river basin with stream channels branching to form a tree like pattern usace hec 2016 it models the entire basin by multiple sub basin and reach elements lump models are primarily used for the simulation of hydrological processes in each sub basin element and the resulted outflow in each sub basin is routed downstream through reach elements user is able to choose interactively among different methods of precipitation distribution across the watershed loss models direct runoff base flow and streamflow channel routing given precipitation the outflow from a sub basin element as a representative of the physical watershed is computed by the summation of the overland flow interflow and base flow components after subtracting losses due to deep percolation and evapotranspiration a portion of excess precipitation turns directly into the overland flow and another portion infiltrates into the soil layer a portion of the infiltrated water then moves vertically to the land surface via capillary effect and moves horizontally as interflow to the channel the other portion of the infiltrated water also percolates to the groundwater aquifer and after losing to the deep groundwater moves horizontally until it is discharged as base flow to the stream the outflow from a sub basin is routed downstream if it enters a reach element to account for river channel flow attenuation three lumped sub basin elements are defined for the study area two of which with outlets at whitesand and sturgis see fig 1 and one element for the remaining portion of the upper assiniboine river basin from the outlet of the other sub basin elements to the outlet at kamsack the outflow from the sub basin elements are routed downstream through the reach elements and then aggregated by defining junction elements the hec hms model of this study uses the soil moisture accounting model scs unit hydrograph linear reservoir and muskingum cunge methods respectively for simulating runoff volume direct runoff base flow and channel routing unduche et al 2018 the hyetograph of mean areal precipitation over a watershed is derived by applying the inverse distance squared weighting method to precipitation gauges the priestley taylor method is selected for evapotranspiration and the temperature index method is the only option for snowmelt calculation in hec hms which represents a conceptual snowpack energy balance 2 3 3 hbv ec model moore 1993 the conceptual hbv ec hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning environment canada hydrologic model was developed by moore 1993 that accounts for a glacier routine in the model structure hbv ec is used for forecasting as it proved to be effective and efficient in simulating streamflow in a wide variety of climatic and physiographic conditions e g beck et al 2016 te linde et al 2008 vetter et al 2015 and zhang and lindstrom 1996 hbv ec model works based on the grouped response unit concept each gru contains regions with similar elevation slope aspect and land cover the model accepts only four land cover type that are forest densely vegetated open sparsely vegetated or non vegetated glacier and water e g lake and other types of wetlands hbv ec also divides a watershed into climate zones with unique parametrization to account for lateral climatic gradients across a watershed the snowmelt rate varies as a function of terrain slope or aspect within an area of a watershed with the same climate zone elevation band and land use class hbv ec requires daily precipitation and temperature in conjunction with long term monthly potential evaporation for a successful hydrologic modelling bergström 1995 hamilton et al 2000 zegre 2008 the model then uses the degree day method hamilton et al 2000 for snowmelt and snow accumulation to calculate the volume of liquid released water the released water from the snowmelt if any is added to the rainwater after subtracting evaporation as a function of soil moisture a portion of the released water runs off quickly as fast discharge and the remainder percolates into a lower linear reservoir that generates slow discharge or base flow grillakis et al 2010 zegre 2008 in this study the hbv ec model of the upper assiniboine river basin encompasses four major climate zones and it is developed and run in green kenue canadian hydraulic centre 2010 a freely available data processing tool readers are referred to bergström 1995 and lindström et al 1997 for further details about hbv ec structure 2 3 4 hspf model hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf is a conceptual model developed by bicknell et al 1996 for continuous modelling of the hydrological processes point and non point source pollutant loadings in agricultural basins based on water balance modelers are empowered to operate the model in different temporal scales from minute to day weather data and basin morphology characteristics such as land use drainage system soil type and topography are required for the runoff response quantification the hspf model partitions the watershed into sub basins with similar topographic characteristics each sub basin is further sub divided into multiple smaller units to account for land use variations inside the sub basin elements each unit is called hydrologic response unit that groups land uses with similar hydrological response each sub basin spills into a reach element and the overland flow pervious and impervious lands base flow pervious lands and interflow pervious lands from the local drainage is summed up with the inflows from upstream reaches and routed downstream by using the stage discharge volume relationship estimated by the user for the element the hspf model uses the kinematic wave assumption for the channel routing the air temperature varies with altitude the model simulates a wide range of hydrological processes including snowmelt and snow accumulation infiltration percolation soil moisture surface retention interflow base flow evapotranspiration and surface flow for more in depth information regarding the model structure concepts and applications readers are referred to xie and lian 2013 duda et al 2012 kim et al 2007 and bicknell et al 2001 the spatial breakdown of the basin is user specific and the upper assiniboine river basin in this paper is divided into 88 reach elements based on the topography and drainage system six land use type including upland and lowland glacial glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial are assigned to the reach elements each element is given the portion of drainage area covered by each land cover type the degree day method is used for snowmelt and snow accumulation processes 2 4 model calibration 2 4 1 model warm up calibration and validation periods daily time series are used for hydrologic modelling of the upper assiniboine river basin with simulation period starting from 1994 and ending in 2017 in order to determine the best out of the simulation period for the model calibration a pre processing analysis is carried out on the precipitation temperature and runoff data fig 2 shows the annual mean flow rate to distinguish the wet and dry years from the normal years the average flow rate in this period is equal to 15 023 m3 s and all years falling outside the range 75 125 of the average flow rate are considered as dry or wet years this range is case dependent and is selected based on visual inspection of the time series of streamflow to determine the streamflow variability from year to year and include years with relatively low and relatively high water volume in the calibration according to this range and figure a 1 1994 1998 to 2005 2008 and 2009 are considered as dry years and 1995 2007 2011 2012 2014 and 2016 are considered as wet years major hydrographic events in the precipitation runoff temperature graph figure a 1 is also checked for each year to identify years with similar dominant hydrological processes for instance a peak flow in the freshet period can be assumed to be due to a major snowmelt e g 2009 or rain on snow e g 2015 while a peak flow in the mid summer can be assumed to be caused by major rainfall events only e g 2010 each year is therefore classified into one of the categories in table 1 and 14 consecutive years from 2001 to 2014 are accordingly used for the calibration as this period contains both dry and wet years and encompasses at least one year from each category in table 1 according to kouwen 2016 at least one year preferably dry year is assumed sufficient for watflood model warm up however 1994 and 1995 that are respectively dry and wet years are used for the warm up to minimize the effect of wet and dry situations on the model initialization 1996 to 2000 and 2015 to 2017 are used for the evaluation of the calibrated models category 6 in table 1 is between categories 4 and 5 if the hydrologic models are capable of simulating years in categories 4 and 5 adequately they are expected to simulate 2016 as well that is why the only year in category 6 is left for model evaluation 2 4 2 flow duration curve segmentation flow duration curve fdc is an effective tool to evaluate multiple aspects of a hydrologic model performance against the actual watershed system behavior yilmaz et al 2008 suggested that the automatic model calibration should incorporate the partitioning of the flow duration curve fdc the sorted logarithmic flow rate plotted against cumulative probability of exceedance as in fig 3 they suggested dividing fdc into three segments of high low and mid range that represent important hydrological signatures the mid range flow often forms a straight line in the logarithmic scale 20 to 60 probability of exceedance in this study as in fig 3 and its slope shows how flashy the rainfall runoff relationship is this is a signature of a watershed because it is a function of the soil water retaining capacity a watershed with low field capacity is expected to have a steep mid segment slope and a higher chance of surface flow while a flatter mid segment slope signifies slower and more sustained groundwater response yilmaz et al 2008 the volume of high flow 0 to 5 probability of exceedance in this study shows the quick flow runoff due to the snowmelt or major rainfall and the volume of low flow 60 to 100 probability of exceedance in this study represents the vertical redistribution of water and the base flow contribution to the streamflow fdc does not preserve the sequence of events therefore metrics defined based on fdc must be accompanied with other metrics such as nash sutcliffe efficiency nse or root mean squared error for model calibration proposes 2 4 3 nse decomposition nash sutcliffe efficiency is arguably one of the most widely used metrics in the literature of hydrologic model calibration it specifically stresses the high flow portion of hydrograph since large residuals i e absolute difference between simulation and measured values usually occur in high flow periods and the fit between the simulation and observation in low flow periods has a minimal effect on the value of nse gupta et al 2009 showed that nse is composed of the variability index α the correlation coefficient r and the normalized water balance bias β n as shown in eq 1 where m s t n m s σ m and σ s respectively denote measured streamflow simulated streamflow time in daily scale total number of time steps mean of the measured values mean of simulations standard deviation of measured values and standard deviation of simulations 1 nse 2 α r α 2 β n 2 α σ s σ m β n m s σ m r n s t m t s t m t n m t 2 m t 2 n s t 2 s t 2 the variability index and normalized water balance bias aim to fit the model results to the first and second moments of the distribution of the measured streamflow and the correlation coefficient evaluates the model performance in terms of the shape and timing of the hydrograph response to rainfall and snowmelt dominated events gupta et al 2009 showed that the optimal nse value of 1 0 will be achieved when the variability index is equal to correlation coefficient and the bias term is equal to zero this means that α is constrained by the value of the correlation coefficient and cannot reach its optimal value of one due to the correlation coefficient being always less than or equal one the water balance bias has also a minimal effect on the value of nse since the discrepancy between the mean values is normalized by standard deviation of measured streamflow gupta et al 2009 hence gupta et al 2009 recommended a revised aggregation of these three metrics called the kling gupta efficiency kge or a segregated multi objective optimization of α r and β n instead of the single objective optimization of nse each of these components is used as one calibration objective in this study 2 5 model calibration problem formulations three different multi objective problems are formulated to automatically calibrate the four hydrologic models of the upper assiniboine river basin these problems use metrics that are common for automatic calibration of hydrologic models due to the lack of other information in the region such as evapotranspiration water quality records or groundwater data which increase parameter identifiability the model calibration objectives are error metrics and hydrological signatures that are based on streamflow the comparison between the results of these three problems show whether one formulation can guide the optimization algorithm toward better solutions the solution of a multi objective optimization problem with conflicting objectives is a tradeoff or pareto front between the objectives the true pareto front is the global optimal solution and any sub optimal tradeoff such as the result of multi objective model calibration is often called the pareto approximate front 2 5 1 max min formulation the first problem formulation p1 has three objective functions to 1 maximize the model performance over the whole calibration period as in eq 2 2 maximize the model performance for the most challenging wet year as in eq 3 and 3 minimize the bias for the most challenging dry year as in eq 4 simultaneously since flood forecasting is the main goal of models at hfc of mi nse that is sensitive to residuals in high flow periods is selected for objectives 1 and 2 if the lowest nse value based on eq 2 is maximized the nse values for other wet years are definitely higher nse is not a relevant metric for dry years since they are expected to have low or no peak flow rate and there is not a large variability in the annual hydrograph as a result absolute bias in eq 4 is selected for the third objective to evaluate the model performance for simulating persistent low flows in dry years 2 f 1 n s e overall 1 t t 0 t s t m t 2 t t 0 t m t

2013 for solving many objective optimization problems is utilized for the automatic calibration of the hydrologic model cases in this paper pa dds commences the search with a random solution generation if there are good quality behavioral solutions for example with overall nse of above 0 5 available prior to the optimization they can be injected by the user as the initial solutions the pa dds structure has three key elements namely dominance relation selection metric and perturbation to guide the search toward the optimal tradeoff pa dds generates only one solution at a time by perturbing the recently archived solution and the corresponding objective functions are evaluated the dominance relation is then applied to assess whether or not the objective values of the generated solution surpasses those of the previously archived solutions if the solution is non dominated it would be retained in the archive the archive set contains only non dominated solutions that means none is dominating or dominated by any other archived solutions a solution parameter set is dominated by another solution if all of its objective functions are worse than the other a solution is dominating another solution if all of its objective function values are better than the other two solutions are mutually non dominated if one has at least one objective function better and at least one objective function worse than the other solution the hyper volume contribution selection metric of pa dds is used in this paper as it is reported the best selection metric for solving general multi objective optimization problems asadzadeh and tolson 2013 an archived solution that has higher hyper volume contribution value has more chance to be selected for perturbation and subsequent solution generation asadzadeh et al 2014 introduced the convex hull contribution as the preferred selection metric for model calibration problems with up to three objectives however it is not applied in this study because p2 has four objectives the perturbation size is the only parameter of the pa dds that has a recommended robust value of 0 2 asadzadeh and tolson 2013 the multi objective calibration of the hydrologic models of this study are not readily available watflood is equipped with two types of single objective automatic calibration methods namely the pattern search hooke and jeeves 1961 and the dynamically dimensioned search dds optimization tools tolson and shoemaker 2007 the user is restricted to only select among the statistical metrics defined in watflood for single objective calibration of the model the hec hms model uses traditional optimization methods such as univariate gradient and nelder mead or downhill simplex method techniques for fine tuning the model parameters based on minimizing the statistical error metrics the modeler is restricted to use the monte carlo method for the automatic calibration of hbv ec model and hspf model is limited to using manual calibration thus the need for linking a modern multi objective optimization tool like pa dds to the hydrologic models for a better model parameter identifiability is undeniable table 2 shows the computational budgets and number of trials for each model due to the model complexity simulation time of each hydrologic model and available computing resources different budgets and trials are considered for their calibration to calibrate watflood three independent trials with 5000 iterations per trial 4 5 min per solution evaluation are executed five ten and five independent calibration trials are performed respectively for hbv ec 1 1 5 min per solution evaluation hec hms 35 50 s per solution evaluation and hspf 40 80 s per solution evaluation models with 10 000 solution evaluations for hbv ec and hec hms and 5000 solution evaluations for hspf the results of multiple trials for each calibration problem are aggregated and normalized to between zero and one after removing solutions that produced negative overall nse values then the solution with the smallest weighted euclidean distance to known ideal objective values is selected as the preferred solution for each problem formulation based on the weight factors presented in table 2 the objectives are normalized to between zero and one to minimize the scaling effect of the objective functions on the euclidean distance calculation a higher weight is given to the overall nse correlation coefficient and variability index to emphasize the high flow rates since the flood forecast and control is in higher priority for hfc see table 2 the preferred solution for each model is used to create the best calibrated model for the model wrapper 2 7 linking pa dds to the hydrologic models in order to use an external optimization algorithm such as pa dds to calibrate the hydrologic models of this study a matlab function is developed to receive the set of parameter values from the optimization algorithm update the model input files run the stand alone model application load the results and calculate the objective functions the structure of this code is shown fig 4 2 8 segmentation based model wrapper the novel multi modelling approach developed in this study is based on the hydrologic modelling practice at hfc of mi the forecast results from different hydrologic models are quantitatively and visually compared for more accurate prediction of the inflow rate to the shellmouth reservoir in high flow and low flow seasons in order to control flood and supply water to downstream communities the multi modelling approach proposed in this study is based on the weighted average of the simulations of the calibrated hbv ec watflood hec hms and hspf models in practice one model surpasses another depending on the flow rate and season this is due to the structure of the models and the simulation performance of a model for high flow and low flow may be different as a result the predictability of these models are separately evaluated for high mid and low flow periods which is also in line with the practical operations at hfc of mi eq 9 shows the weighted average multi modelling for each time step q multi t as a system of linear equations w is the weight between zero and one and the summation of the weights for each linear equation should be equal to one according to the fdc partitioning of the calibration period described in fig 3 1 7 m3 s and 15 7 m3 s are used for the mid flow range with relatively constant slope from 0 6 to 0 2 probability of exceedance and beyond this range is considered as either high flow or low flow condition for the model wrapper the optimal value of the weights is achieved by minimizing the nse metric between the multi modelling simulations and measured streamflow data for the calibration period shown in eq 10 as constrained minimization 9 s multi t w 1 q h b v e c t w 2 q w a t f l o o d t w 3 q h e c h m s t w 4 q h s p f t m t 15 7 w 5 q h b v e c t w 6 q w a t f l o o d

calibrated models and the model wrapper the comparisons are mainly based on the heat map visualization of daily nse values for each year in fig 5 and annual streamflow hydrograph for the calibration and evaluation periods in figure a 2 the main reason for considering nse as the main criteria for the model performance is that it is highly sensitive to the model performance in estimating the timing and volume of high flow events that are of particular interest for flood forecasting at hfc of mi moreover nse has been a very popular metric that is normalized for evaluating the hydrologic model performance therefore guidelines had been developed for interpreting the model performance based on its value for example moriasi et al 2007 noted that negative values of daily nse can be interpreted as inadequate simulation while nse values higher than 0 5 can be interpreted as adequate model simulation a negative nse is colored in red and a positive nse of higher than 0 5 is colored in blue in fig 5 the annual mean flow rate in fig 5 shows that the simulation period begins with a relatively dry hydrological cycle from 1996 to 2005 and transitions into a wet cycle from 2006 to 2017 the annual precipitation and annual mean temperature as the most important input variables are also visualized in fig 5 to distinguish between all combinations of humid cool dry and hot years according to the annual precipitation 2017 and 2010 are the years with extremely dry and extremely humid weather conditions respectively 2012 and 2014 are the hottest red and coolest years blue in the entire simulation period 3 1 single model performance comparison calibrated models in this study are compared to the same models that were calibrated by unduche et al 2018 and are currently being used at hfc of mi for flood forecasting this comparison highlights the advantages of the multi objective calibration conducted in this research according to fig 5 the parameter settings found by the multi objective automatic calibration using any optimization problem formulation p1 p2 or p3 outperforms the previously used settings the number of years with negative nse values is reduced and the model performance in years with positive nse values is improved the previous settings that are used for the hbv ec watflood hec hms and hspf models fail to simulate the annual peak streamflow in 8 6 8 and 7 years out of the 14 year calibration period 2001 2014 and 5 3 5 and 5 years out of 8 year evaluation period respectively by giving negative annual nse values according to figure a 2 the hydrologic models with the old setting tend to generally overestimate the peak flow rate except for watflood which had been previously calibrated with the single objective automatic calibration of overall nse metric moreover the calibrated models in this study generally give a more accurate simulation of the peak flows in the wet and normal years all hydrologic models calibrated in this study or by unduche et al 2018 failed to adequately simulate the extremely and persistently dry years 2002 to 2005 e g year 2002 with no peak throughout the year all the models overestimated streamflow in this period therefore it is concluded that all models that are operational at hfc of mi lack hydrological processes that are active in persistent low flow periods these processes should be related to the interaction between groundwater and surface water 3 2 problem formulation comparison in general none of the three problem formulations is superior for calibrating all the models hec hms and hspf calibrated using any of the three problem formulations can adequately simulate peak flows see figure a 2 the simulated peak flow by p1 as a result of snowmelt is generally lower than the simulated peak flow by p2 and p3 for all hydrologic models p1 tends to find a setting that decreases the variance for annual nse and annual bias during the calibration period by improving these metrics for the most challenging years toward their ideal values using p1 formulation for the calibration of hec hms and hbv ec results in better estimation of peak flow in freshet period than p2 and p3 however hbv ec and watflood underestimate the high flow rates when they are calibrated with p1 according to fig 5 the hbv ec model calibrated with p1 captures more number of years with positive nse values 16 years compared to the same model calibrated using p2 or p3 14 years despite higher overall nse value of 0 54 hbv ec calibrated with p1 generally underestimates the daily average annual peak flow in figure a 2 and p2 and p3 formulations with respective nse values of 0 50 and 0 48 better represent the streamflow variability for the hbv ec model therefore the preferred parameter values found by p3 is selected for multi modelling since the major peak flow rates from 2010 to 2015 are more accurately simulated not shown in this paper compared to p1 and p2 and hfc is more concerned about major flood forecast accuracy likewise the setting identified with p1 formulation for watflood excels those with p2 and p3 as its heat map column in fig 5 is more blue dominated 17 versus 13 and 15 years respectively however the peak flow rates for p1 are generally underestimated based on the annual streamflow hydrograph in figure a 2 the watflood setting identified by p3 is therefore preferred for the multi modelling since there is a balance between dry year and wet year simulation accuracies compared to p2 as regards the hec hms and hspf models the parameter set found by p1 has the best performance among other settings and its match to the snowmelt dominated peak flow is preferred to p2 and p3 see figure a 2 the preferred solution of p1 is thus selected for the hec hms and hspf models for the multi modelling analysis 3 3 multi model simulation fig 5 shows that the proposed multi model that assigns weight to each model based on the flow duration curve segmentation results in higher simulation accuracy and better fit in fdc value compared to individual model simulation as shown in eq 11 the model wrapper weight factors are obtained by maximizing the overall nse value for the calibration period each model has a different contribution to the multi model flow rate simulation hspf has the highest contribution 68 to the multi model for simulating high flows watflood contributes to the simulation of high flows as well with a weight equal to 32 but its most significant contribution is to the simulation of mid range and low flow periods with weights equal to 90 and 99 respectively the high contribution and simulation accuracy of watflood is also evident from fig 7 especially for flow rates with frequency of exceedance higher than 35 the low flow condition mostly occurs in the winter that is base flow or groundwater flow dominated the main reason for a more accurate simulation of low flows is that watflood is capable of simulating channel and lake ice formation freeze up and sublimation processes in the cold months of the year watflood automatically stops the evapotranspiration and activates sublimation in the winter however other models only consider the snow accumulation and melting processes and the winter processes are not simulated for this reason the low flow rate is mostly overestimated an example of which is hspf model in fig 6 fig 6 displays the worst 1999 and best 2017 performing hydrograph simulated by the model wrapper in the evaluation period compared to the hydrograph simulated by its individual components that are hspf and watflood since model wrapper is the optimal weighted average version of watflood and hspf its hydrograph falls between its individual components peak flow as a result of snowmelt is simulated but watflood starts an early melt process in march due to experiencing a temperature warmer than the calibrated base temperature for different land cover classes while soil is still frozen and infiltration is low the snowmelt process is conceptualized and it does not consider the temporal changes such as early or late melt as a result the calibrated watflood model looks for the best base temperature and other snowmelt parameters to give the overall best fit in the calibration period in addition watflood gives an overestimated response to the summer rainfall in june in 1999 and similar years owing to experiencing high summer peaks in calibration period one reason is that watflood relates soil characteristics to land cover classes and it assumes that areas with similar land cover have similar soil properties however hspf that is distributed based on soil properties gives a more reasonable estimation of streamflow in june 1999 compared to watflood 11 s multi t 0 3206 q watflood

improves the overall and year to year daily nse metric in the calibration and evaluation periods as is evident from the heat map in fig 5 17 out of 22 years of simulation have positive annual nse values 14 of which are greater than 0 5 significantly improving the performance of its individual hydrologic model components fig 8 also compares the overall performance of multi modelling against single hydrologic modelling based on nse and its log transformed nse log nse to check the goodness of fit for high and low flow situations respectively the red continuous line with circle marker in fig 8 represents the model wrapper performance that is obtained by considering all the hydrologic models fig 8 demonstrates that the model wrapper performance surpasses its individual model components for the entire simulation period except for 2015 to 2017 when it performs slightly worse than hspf based on nse and hbv ec based on log nse for instance hspf alone fails to simulate the evaluation period 1996 to 2000 by giving negative nse while its combination with other models increases the nse value to 0 43 in this period this improvement is also demonstrated in fig 9 in both the calibration and evaluation stages that daily average annual streamflow hydrograph of the model wrapper better represents its measured counterpart in the peak and rising and falling limbs moreover the model wrapper gives out a simulation range and a simulation mean that are consistent with the range and mean of daily streamflow in both the calibration and evaluation periods optimal weights of 0 0 for hbv ec and hec hms show that these two models do not contribute to the multi model according to fig 7 fdc of hec hms is significantly different compared to that for the measured streamflow in all three segments of fdc therefore the multi model does not benefit from hec hms simulation in high mid range or low flow periods the optimal weight of hbv ec is 0 0 as well because as shown in fig 7 it is very similar to hspf however hspf performs significantly better in high flow periods that have the highest influence on the overall nse when hspf or watflood is removed from the pool of models used for multi modelling hec hms and hbv ec contribute to the multi model if hspf is removed the hbv ec and hec hms receive optimal weighs of 27 3 and 5 9 respectively for simulating high flows but close to zero for simulating mid and low flow partitions on the other hand by eliminating watflood and keeping hspf in the pool of models hbv ec contributes to the simulation of low flow rates with a weight of 22 5 but still does not contribute to the simulation of high and mid range flows in this case hec hms would only contribute 9 5 to the simulation of mid range flows the performance of the aforementioned two variants of the multi model is represented by the dashed and dot lines respectively in fig 8 showing that including all hydrologic models in the multi model combination increases the reliability of the multi model by producing more consistently positive and relatively high nse and log transformed nse values due to decreasing the structural uncertainty in the hydrologic models 4 study limitations in this study we limited the hydrologic models to those that are currently operational at hfc of mi this does not mean that these models are the best ones for flood forecasting upstream of the shellmouth reservoir one would expect that including other models that perform better than the models used at hfc of mi individually would improve the overall performance of the multi model as well moreover each hydrologic model in this study has a significantly different number of parameters with watflood having the highest number of parameters 114 and hec hms having the lowest number of parameters 14 in general calibrating more parameters require more computational budget therefore watflood model should have been calibrated with a high number of solution evaluations however such computational resources were not available for this study it should be also noted that more solution evaluations can only improve the calibration results therefore we believe that this limitation does not have any negative impact on the results and conclusion however we believe that the watflood model used at hfc of mi has too many parameters to be identifiable therefore we suggest that parameters of this model be grouped for calibration in an approach similar to the calibration of curve number parameter of swat in abbaspour 2013 the parameters of the hec hms model are assumed spatially constant automatically calibrated hec hms model performs weakly for the streamflow simulation of upper assiniboine river basin at kamsack with an overall nse of 0 31 problem type p1 for the calibration period in an attempt to increase the model simulation accuracy each sub basin element was considered to have a unique parameterization for hec hms however this increases the number of parameters and leads to ill conditioning in the model ill conditioning means that it has a high condition number and it is very sensitive to the number of decimals in its parameter values a small change in the parameter values changes the simulation results drastically during the optimization pa dds generates a new parameter set and archives it if non dominated with full precision level but it is evaluated with lower precision since the hec hms model first rounds up or down the full precision parameter values in the parameter file to lower decimal values then it simulates the flow rate the parameter distribution in the model domain would be highly non smooth and consist of micro scale nonlinearities if it is assumed that parameters are spatially independent by taking spatial independency assumption into consideration inappropriate time stepping scheme and internal model thresholds lead to an ill conditioned model kavetski et al 2006 this issue is resolvable by implementing the regularization methods on model parameters such as tikhonov regularization tikhonov and arsenin 1977 or constraining the calibration problem by adding additional information about the parameter interdependency and their relations with the watershed characteristics pokhrel et al 2008 the implementation of the regularization methods is out of the scope of this study and the readers are referred to the mentioned citations to better understand the concept of ill conditioning and regularization 5 conclusions this study demonstrated a segmentation based model blending strategy for improving the performance of individual hydrologic models the proposed model wrapper was successfully applied to the models used for flood forecasting at hfc of mi the previously developed hydrologic models at hfc of mi were linked to the pa dds multi objective optimization tool to re calibrate the models using three suites of signature based calibration objective functions the final best parameter set or preferred solution found by post processing the archive set of pa dds outperformed the previous versions of the hydrologic models meaning that signature based multi objective calibration increases the simulation accuracy and parameter identifiability after calibrating the models a segmentation based weighted average combination technique was built to let each model have a different contribution to the simulation of high mid and low flow ranges the multi model had a significantly improved performance compared to each individual model results showed that hbv ec and hec hms do not partake in multi model simulation hspf is the main contributor to simulation of the flow rates higher than 15 7 m3 s time of exceedance less than 20 but the watflood model takes over the simulation of mid and low flow partitions less than 15 7 m3 s assuming the situation when either hspf or watflood is not available the hbv ec and hec hms models join the multi model combination helping to enhance the model wrapper simulation in comparison with its individual hydrologic model components this means that none of the hydrologic models is able to individually capture all the aspects of simulation error distribution therefore grouping the models increases the performance and decreases the model structural uncertainty the segmentation based model wrapper technique is in line with the practical operations at the hfc of mi for predicting inflow to the shellmouth reservoir at downstream during low flow and high flow seasons it is highly encouraged to include more physically based hydrologic models that take the temporal variations such as early or late melt and spatial distribution of soil properties into consideration to increase the timing and magnitude accuracy of peak flows resulted from snowmelt and summer rainfall the upper assiniboine river basin in the prairie region of canada is chosen for the method implementation results demonstration and discussions in this study however the signature based multi objective calibration and segmentation based model combination techniques are not limited to the upper assiniboine river basin and its hydrologic models in this paper the model wrapper is expected to perform better than its individual model components regardless of region of study and type of hydrologic modelling if one model outperform other individual models in all aspects of simulation error distribution the weight factor in the proposed model wrapper converges to one in all ranges of measured streamflow more broadly research is needed to study the impact of more physically based hydrologic models on flood forecasting performance of the model blending method in regions with different dominant hydrological processes the signature based calibration metrics in this study were defined solely based on streamflow measurements that were in line with the purpose of the models for flood forecasting however in general modelers are highly encouraged to include other calibration metrics in the optimization that explain other components of hydrological processes such as the interaction between surface water and groundwater evapotranspiration and sublimation snow pack upon existence of information and or measured data the models in this study were evaluated temporally but the spatial evaluation would help increase parameter identifiability if hydrometric observations exist at multiple locations across the basin future work can also focus on considering the ill conditioning issues for the multi objective calibration of the hydrologic models of this study via implementation of the regularization methods on the parameters for a better conditioned and more identifiable watershed system kavetski et al 2006 this is facilitated by exploiting additional information from the system such as spatial dependency of the model parameters on the watershed properties such as curve number soil properties and land cover to decrease the parameter space dimensionality and constrain the parameters not to take on arbitrary values in their feasible ranges pokhrel et al 2008 pokhrel et al 2012 credit

5347,multi modelling aims to make use of the strengths of single hydrologic models to improve the accuracy of simulating the watershed system behavior considering hydrological signatures such as the flow duration curve segmentation in the calibration of each hydrologic model leads to a better parameter identifiability in this study a novel weighted average model wrapper based on flow duration curve segmentation is introduced to aggregate the calibrated models into a multi model the proposed framework is applied to develop a model wrapper of the upper assiniboine river basin for flood forecasting upstream of the shellmouth reservoir in the prairie region of canada the hec hms hbv ec hspf and watflood hydrologic models that are being used at the hydrologic forecast centre of manitoba infrastructure for operational inflow forecasting are calibrated using signature based multi objective optimization these models have significantly different structural complexities the calibration of each of these models is set up as three simulation optimization problems with different objective functions to balance the model capability in simulating multiple important hydrological

the model wrapper in high flow mid flow and low flow portions of streamflow time series quantifying the contribution of each model component provides a deeper insight into model selection strategy

be categorized based on their structural complexity in terms of the distribution of the geographical representation of the watershed system from lumped to distributed models and in terms of the base of their governing equations from conceptual to physically based models it is well known that a single model structure cannot adequately represent all governing processes of a watershed system response to hydrological events ajami et al 2007 therefore in order to address the model structural uncertainty in the model prediction one can combine results of multiple models in principle multi modelling aims to take advantage of strengths of a group of models that have different structural complexities to improve the overall prediction accuracy because it is expected that simulation error from different models can compensate each other ajami et al 2006 multi modelling has its roots in the study by bates and granger 1969 who showed that the weighted average of two sets of forecasted airline passenger datasets outperforms each individual dataset for forecasting the number of passenger miles flown it took about three decades for the community of hydrologic modelling to recognize multi modelling as a tool to improve the model prediction accuracy when shamseldin et al 1997 showed that even a simple or a weighted linear model averaging approach can outperform the individual models a conclusion that was confirmed by georgakakos et al 2004 and ajami et al 2006 to date several studies have investigated the superior performance of multi model ensembles to individual hydrologic models arsenault et al 2015 chen et al 2015 goswami et al 2007 jeong and kim 2009 kumar et al 2015 xiong et al 2001 zhang et al 2009 shamseldin et al 1997 recommended a neural network approach to build a non linear relationship between the models to improve the prediction accuracy ajami et al 2006 compared four different multi modelling approaches simple model average weighted model average wma multi model super ensemble mmse and modified multi model super ensemble m3se methods and recommended mmse and m3se that implement bias correction however madadgar et al 2014 argued that the bias correction through quantile mapping used in m3se for example that uses the cumulative distribution function of measured and simulated events does not maintain the sequence of events and therefore is not hydrologically expressive bayesian model averaging bma introduced by hoeting et al 1998 is a more sophisticated multi modelling approach that uses the bayesian statistical inference to calculate the weight of each model based on its performance during the training period ajami et al 2007 in this paper a novel model wrapper approach is introduced for multi modelling based on the weighted model averaging and flow duration curve partitioning this method allows the models for having different weights for predicting high average and low flow rates the optimal value of weights shows whether every model adds to the accuracy of flood forecasting the optimal value of weights also show the relative contribution of these models to the flow prediction for three mutually exclusive ranges of high mid range and low flow moreover the comparison between individual models and the model wrapper shows whether multi modelling could fix any model structural inadequacy the hydrologic models need to be calibrated individually before inserting their simulated streamflow time series into the model wrapper the performance of a calibrated hydrologic model depends on many factors including its structural complexity parametrization computational budget and problem formulation in principle due to the model parameter uncertainty more than one setting of a hydrologic model can adequately simulate the watershed system behavior the concept of equifinality beven and freer 2001 therefore in practice different settings of a hydrologic model are used to predict a range of watershed responses to future events either through a formal bayesian uncertainty approach by dream vrugt et al 2009 an informal uncertainty approach by generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and freer 2001 or a multi trial calibration with different calibration objectives such as tolson and shoemaker 2008 hydrologic model calibration is inherently multi objective because no single metric can comprehensively represent the distribution of simulation error residual between the simulated and measured data gupta et al 1998 over the past decade novel model performance metrics are developed and used in the literature as model calibration metrics that can guide the optimization to identify solutions that are more representative of hydrological signatures see for example yilmaz et al 2008 pfannerstill et al 2014 shafii and tolson 2015 and schaefli 2016 yilmaz et al 2008 advised that the automatic calibration of hydrologic models should consider objective functions that represent four major hydrological signatures the overall water balance vertical horizontal and temporal redistribution of water they introduced three model performance metrics using the flow duration curve partitioning multi objective optimization identifies the tradeoff among the conflicting objectives the so called pareto front solutions corresponding to the tails of the pareto front individually optimize a calibration objective however as discussed in kollat et al 2012 and asadzadeh et al 2014 the multi objective optimization can balance between the conflicting calibration objectives and identify a solution corresponding to the so called knee point of the pareto front that is closest to the ideal point and therefore can be selected as the best single tradeoff solution this study expresses the importance of using the signature based multi objective calibration approach along with multi modelling by combining the strong points of individual models to improve the calibration of the models for accurate forecasting of the streamflow with a focus on peak flow estimation the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the case study watershed and the hydrologic models that are used for the streamflow simulations three different types of formulations for the multi objective calibration of the models along with the proposed model combination approach are then explained the calibration results for each model and the effect of the model wrapper on simulation accuracy are presented and discussed in section 3 followed by study limitations and concluding remarks in section 4 and section 5 respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 importance of flood forecasting in canadian prairies flood forecasting is one of the major applications of hydrologic models in the canadian prairie provinces ahmari et al 2016 blais et al 2016a blais et al 2016b where flood is one of the most costly natural disasters over the past 100 years this region has experienced significant floods the assiniboine river in manitoba alone for example has experienced at least six major floods in the past 100 years manitoba infrastructure and transportation 2016 flooding has been worse in the past 20 years due to the wet cycle going through the provinces unduche et al 2018 causing billions of dollars infrastructural damages buttle et al 2016 jakob and church 2011 the 2013 flood in alberta with estimated damage and recovery cost of cad 6 billion burn and whitfield 2016 pomeroy et al 2016 and the 2011 flood in manitoba with estimated damage and recovery cost of cad 1 2 billion burn and whitfield 2016 manitoba infrastructure and transportation 2016 are few of the recent examples to mention in order to better prepare for future flood events and mitigate the damages the provincial and federal governments have initiated reviews of past major floods in manitoba the 2011 flood review task force was established to assess the cause of the 2011 flood flood recovery procedures and flood forecasting methodologies manitoba infrastructure and transportation 2013 a similar task force was established in alberta to review the 2013 historic flood alberta watersmart 2013 flood recovery task force 2013 both of these reviews emphasized the need for accurate and timely dissemination of flood forecasts to the public and policy and decision makers accurate flood forecasting can minimize infrastructural damages and the economic and social impacts of floods to communities and can result in measures that will enhance ecological conditions carsell et al 2004 penning rowsell et al 2000 2 2 region of study the upper assiniboine river basin at kamsack in the prairie region of canada is selected for this study see fig 1 it has a total drainage area of 13 000 km 2 that flows into the shellmouth reservoir also known as lake of the prairies the shellmouth reservoir which is retained by the shellmouth dam is used for multiple purposes including flood control municipal and irrigation water supplies and recreation the operation of the dam control structure at the outlet of the reservoir is assisted by inflow forecasts that are obtained by simulating multiple hydrologic models unduche et al 2018 the upper assiniboine river watershed is dominated by abundant potholes sloughs and wetlands these potholes and wetlands significantly increase the surface storage capacity through the fill and spill process in potholes during snowmelt and or rainfall periods and consecutively affect the ratio of contributing versus non contributing area to streamflow fang et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2005 in addition to the potholes and wetlands the upper assiniboine river watershed is also characterized by the presence of poorly developed stream networks that considerably affect the intensity and timing of surface runoff fang et al 2007 the other complexity of the upper assiniboine river watershed rises from the frozen ground effect during spring melt the frozen ground condition reduces infiltration rate during the freshet period and remarkably increases the runoff intensity at the outlet hayashi et al 2003 the canadian prairie is a semi arid region with long cold winters and short warm summers with perennial flow regime in the upper assiniboine river upper assiniboine river basin study 2000 the continental polar air mass that basically resides over this region creates relatively low amounts of precipitation mcginn 2010 the precipitation amount in this region is highly variable and according to shepherd and mcginn 2003 the annual precipitation over the entire canadian prairie region ranges from an annual low of 300 mm to a high of 550 mm with a mean value of 486 mm around 70 80 of precipitation is received as rain in the canadian prairies wheaton 1998 within the simulation period used in this study that is between 1994 and 2017 the average lowest and highest annual precipitation amounts are 520 mm 395 1 mm and 668 1 mm respectively the input data quality check is not a part of this study and the hfc of mi were previously conducted a rigorous quality control mechanism on the raw historical meteorological data obtained from the environment and climate change canada weather stations the data quality check tasks included filling missing values about three percent in daily temperature and daily precipitation time series by interpolating data from nearby stations and using the area ratio method the precipitation data were not corrected for rain gauge undercatch due to plugging a considerable source of error for precipitation data in snow dominated regions as discussed in rasmussen et al 2012 and need to be corrected in future research 2 3 hydrologic models the list of hydrologic models that have been applied for flood forecasting and historical reanalysis at hfc of mi include the watflood model kouwen 2010 the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model lindström et al 1997 the hydrologic modelling system hec hms developed by the us army corps of engineers usace 2017 and the hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf developed by bicknell et al 2001 these models have significantly different levels of complexity watflood and hbv ec models are distributed but hec hms and hspf are respectively lumped and semi distributed models the winter processes simulation is another main difference between these models the winter processes have a major contribution to shaping the hydrograph from the beginning of freeze up to the freshet period all the models simulate snow accumulation and melting processes but only the watflood model is able to simulate the winter processes such as ice formation and channel lake freeze up this study is solely focused on the hydrologic models that are in operation at hydrologic forecast centre hfc of mi and use conceptual methods for the hydrological processes however more advanced physically based hydrologic models need to be set up at hfc to help them have a better simulation information regarding the model structure and main characteristics of each model in terms of input requirements and process representation of each module are found in the following and readers are referred to unduche et al 2018 for more detail about the upper assiniboine river basin models such as digital elevation model and land cover map 2 3 1 watflood model kouwen 2016 the watflood hydrologic model was first developed in 1973 for long term hydrological simulation and flood forecasting this model uses conceptual approaches for simulating the hydrological processes but the streamflow routing is based on physical methods watflood has been under continuous development in the past four decades for example stadnyk et al 2013 made it capable of simulating stable water isotopes to make the model applicable to remote basins that are minimally gauged and kouwen 2010 added the reservoir operation simulation component to it the model maintains both energy and water balances to respectively calculate the losses through evapotranspiration and outflow from the basin it uses a simple conceptual approach for the winter processes simulation that cuts off evaporation starts sublimation and stops direct precipitation from being added to the streamflow land cover precipitation and temperature data are the minimum required datasets for watflood however it can incorporate information about snow depth solar radiation wind speed humidity and soil moisture as spatially distributed input variables watflood includes data pre processing tools to convert the input data points into gridded data sets the model works based on the grouped response unit gru as the smallest computational component that assumes regions with similar land cover have similar soil type and topography therefore the hydrologically significant land cover classes are placed in one gru in each grid cell if the land cover resolution is higher than the cell size this way the parameters are associated with the land cover classes rather than the grid cells that is each grid cell has the same parametrization the contribution of each land cover class to the runoff is calculated based on their coverage in each cell the total hydrological response for a cell is equal to the summation of gru responses for the cell the hydrological responses are routed from the upstream to downstream cells connected by the drainage network the drainage of the study basin is modelled with 980 cells at 0 09 longitude and 0 06 latitude 7 6 km2 each cell is further sub divided into eight general grus based on land classes that are croplands grasslands deciduous forest coniferous forest mixed forest wetlands water and impervious lands six river classes are also identified for streamflow routing purposes based on natural boundaries and the nature of streamflow further details about watflood can be found in kouwen 2016 2 3 2 hec hms model feldman 2000 the conceptual hydrologic modelling system hec hms has long been used for flood forecasting and control due to its advanced graphical user interface and flexibility of methods selection for the hydrological process calculations hec hms is a semi distributed hydrologic model that is developed for the spatiotemporal hydrologic simulation of a river basin with stream channels branching to form a tree like pattern usace hec 2016 it models the entire basin by multiple sub basin and reach elements lump models are primarily used for the simulation of hydrological processes in each sub basin element and the resulted outflow in each sub basin is routed downstream through reach elements user is able to choose interactively among different methods of precipitation distribution across the watershed loss models direct runoff base flow and streamflow channel routing given precipitation the outflow from a sub basin element as a representative of the physical watershed is computed by the summation of the overland flow interflow and base flow components after subtracting losses due to deep percolation and evapotranspiration a portion of excess precipitation turns directly into the overland flow and another portion infiltrates into the soil layer a portion of the infiltrated water then moves vertically to the land surface via capillary effect and moves horizontally as interflow to the channel the other portion of the infiltrated water also percolates to the groundwater aquifer and after losing to the deep groundwater moves horizontally until it is discharged as base flow to the stream the outflow from a sub basin is routed downstream if it enters a reach element to account for river channel flow attenuation three lumped sub basin elements are defined for the study area two of which with outlets at whitesand and sturgis see fig 1 and one element for the remaining portion of the upper assiniboine river basin from the outlet of the other sub basin elements to the outlet at kamsack the outflow from the sub basin elements are routed downstream through the reach elements and then aggregated by defining junction elements the hec hms model of this study uses the soil moisture accounting model scs unit hydrograph linear reservoir and muskingum cunge methods respectively for simulating runoff volume direct runoff base flow and channel routing unduche et al 2018 the hyetograph of mean areal precipitation over a watershed is derived by applying the inverse distance squared weighting method to precipitation gauges the priestley taylor method is selected for evapotranspiration and the temperature index method is the only option for snowmelt calculation in hec hms which represents a conceptual snowpack energy balance 2 3 3 hbv ec model moore 1993 the conceptual hbv ec hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning environment canada hydrologic model was developed by moore 1993 that accounts for a glacier routine in the model structure hbv ec is used for forecasting as it proved to be effective and efficient in simulating streamflow in a wide variety of climatic and physiographic conditions e g beck et al 2016 te linde et al 2008 vetter et al 2015 and zhang and lindstrom 1996 hbv ec model works based on the grouped response unit concept each gru contains regions with similar elevation slope aspect and land cover the model accepts only four land cover type that are forest densely vegetated open sparsely vegetated or non vegetated glacier and water e g lake and other types of wetlands hbv ec also divides a watershed into climate zones with unique parametrization to account for lateral climatic gradients across a watershed the snowmelt rate varies as a function of terrain slope or aspect within an area of a watershed with the same climate zone elevation band and land use class hbv ec requires daily precipitation and temperature in conjunction with long term monthly potential evaporation for a successful hydrologic modelling bergström 1995 hamilton et al 2000 zegre 2008 the model then uses the degree day method hamilton et al 2000 for snowmelt and snow accumulation to calculate the volume of liquid released water the released water from the snowmelt if any is added to the rainwater after subtracting evaporation as a function of soil moisture a portion of the released water runs off quickly as fast discharge and the remainder percolates into a lower linear reservoir that generates slow discharge or base flow grillakis et al 2010 zegre 2008 in this study the hbv ec model of the upper assiniboine river basin encompasses four major climate zones and it is developed and run in green kenue canadian hydraulic centre 2010 a freely available data processing tool readers are referred to bergström 1995 and lindström et al 1997 for further details about hbv ec structure 2 3 4 hspf model hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf is a conceptual model developed by bicknell et al 1996 for continuous modelling of the hydrological processes point and non point source pollutant loadings in agricultural basins based on water balance modelers are empowered to operate the model in different temporal scales from minute to day weather data and basin morphology characteristics such as land use drainage system soil type and topography are required for the runoff response quantification the hspf model partitions the watershed into sub basins with similar topographic characteristics each sub basin is further sub divided into multiple smaller units to account for land use variations inside the sub basin elements each unit is called hydrologic response unit that groups land uses with similar hydrological response each sub basin spills into a reach element and the overland flow pervious and impervious lands base flow pervious lands and interflow pervious lands from the local drainage is summed up with the inflows from upstream reaches and routed downstream by using the stage discharge volume relationship estimated by the user for the element the hspf model uses the kinematic wave assumption for the channel routing the air temperature varies with altitude the model simulates a wide range of hydrological processes including snowmelt and snow accumulation infiltration percolation soil moisture surface retention interflow base flow evapotranspiration and surface flow for more in depth information regarding the model structure concepts and applications readers are referred to xie and lian 2013 duda et al 2012 kim et al 2007 and bicknell et al 2001 the spatial breakdown of the basin is user specific and the upper assiniboine river basin in this paper is divided into 88 reach elements based on the topography and drainage system six land use type including upland and lowland glacial glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial are assigned to the reach elements each element is given the portion of drainage area covered by each land cover type the degree day method is used for snowmelt and snow accumulation processes 2 4 model calibration 2 4 1 model warm up calibration and validation periods daily time series are used for hydrologic modelling of the upper assiniboine river basin with simulation period starting from 1994 and ending in 2017 in order to determine the best out of the simulation period for the model calibration a pre processing analysis is carried out on the precipitation temperature and runoff data fig 2 shows the annual mean flow rate to distinguish the wet and dry years from the normal years the average flow rate in this period is equal to 15 023 m3 s and all years falling outside the range 75 125 of the average flow rate are considered as dry or wet years this range is case dependent and is selected based on visual inspection of the time series of streamflow to determine the streamflow variability from year to year and include years with relatively low and relatively high water volume in the calibration according to this range and figure a 1 1994 1998 to 2005 2008 and 2009 are considered as dry years and 1995 2007 2011 2012 2014 and 2016 are considered as wet years major hydrographic events in the precipitation runoff temperature graph figure a 1 is also checked for each year to identify years with similar dominant hydrological processes for instance a peak flow in the freshet period can be assumed to be due to a major snowmelt e g 2009 or rain on snow e g 2015 while a peak flow in the mid summer can be assumed to be caused by major rainfall events only e g 2010 each year is therefore classified into one of the categories in table 1 and 14 consecutive years from 2001 to 2014 are accordingly used for the calibration as this period contains both dry and wet years and encompasses at least one year from each category in table 1 according to kouwen 2016 at least one year preferably dry year is assumed sufficient for watflood model warm up however 1994 and 1995 that are respectively dry and wet years are used for the warm up to minimize the effect of wet and dry situations on the model initialization 1996 to 2000 and 2015 to 2017 are used for the evaluation of the calibrated models category 6 in table 1 is between categories 4 and 5 if the hydrologic models are capable of simulating years in categories 4 and 5 adequately they are expected to simulate 2016 as well that is why the only year in category 6 is left for model evaluation 2 4 2 flow duration curve segmentation flow duration curve fdc is an effective tool to evaluate multiple aspects of a hydrologic model performance against the actual watershed system behavior yilmaz et al 2008 suggested that the automatic model calibration should incorporate the partitioning of the flow duration curve fdc the sorted logarithmic flow rate plotted against cumulative probability of exceedance as in fig 3 they suggested dividing fdc into three segments of high low and mid range that represent important hydrological signatures the mid range flow often forms a straight line in the logarithmic scale 20 to 60 probability of exceedance in this study as in fig 3 and its slope shows how flashy the rainfall runoff relationship is this is a signature of a watershed because it is a function of the soil water retaining capacity a watershed with low field capacity is expected to have a steep mid segment slope and a higher chance of surface flow while a flatter mid segment slope signifies slower and more sustained groundwater response yilmaz et al 2008 the volume of high flow 0 to 5 probability of exceedance in this study shows the quick flow runoff due to the snowmelt or major rainfall and the volume of low flow 60 to 100 probability of exceedance in this study represents the vertical redistribution of water and the base flow contribution to the streamflow fdc does not preserve the sequence of events therefore metrics defined based on fdc must be accompanied with other metrics such as nash sutcliffe efficiency nse or root mean squared error for model calibration proposes 2 4 3 nse decomposition nash sutcliffe efficiency is arguably one of the most widely used metrics in the literature of hydrologic model calibration it specifically stresses the high flow portion of hydrograph since large residuals i e absolute difference between simulation and measured values usually occur in high flow periods and the fit between the simulation and observation in low flow periods has a minimal effect on the value of nse gupta et al 2009 showed that nse is composed of the variability index α the correlation coefficient r and the normalized water balance bias β n as shown in eq 1 where m s t n m s σ m and σ s respectively denote measured streamflow simulated streamflow time in daily scale total number of time steps mean of the measured values mean of simulations standard deviation of measured values and standard deviation of simulations 1 nse 2 α r α 2 β n 2 α σ s σ m β n m s σ m r n s t m t s t m t n m t 2 m t 2 n s t 2 s t 2 the variability index and normalized water balance bias aim to fit the model results to the first and second moments of the distribution of the measured streamflow and the correlation coefficient evaluates the model performance in terms of the shape and timing of the hydrograph response to rainfall and snowmelt dominated events gupta et al 2009 showed that the optimal nse value of 1 0 will be achieved when the variability index is equal to correlation coefficient and the bias term is equal to zero this means that α is constrained by the value of the correlation coefficient and cannot reach its optimal value of one due to the correlation coefficient being always less than or equal one the water balance bias has also a minimal effect on the value of nse since the discrepancy between the mean values is normalized by standard deviation of measured streamflow gupta et al 2009 hence gupta et al 2009 recommended a revised aggregation of these three metrics called the kling gupta efficiency kge or a segregated multi objective optimization of α r and β n instead of the single objective optimization of nse each of these components is used as one calibration objective in this study 2 5 model calibration problem formulations three different multi objective problems are formulated to automatically calibrate the four hydrologic models of the upper assiniboine river basin these problems use metrics that are common for automatic calibration of hydrologic models due to the lack of other information in the region such as evapotranspiration water quality records or groundwater data which increase parameter identifiability the model calibration objectives are error metrics and hydrological signatures that are based on streamflow the comparison between the results of these three problems show whether one formulation can guide the optimization algorithm toward better solutions the solution of a multi objective optimization problem with conflicting objectives is a tradeoff or pareto front between the objectives the true pareto front is the global optimal solution and any sub optimal tradeoff such as the result of multi objective model calibration is often called the pareto approximate front 2 5 1 max min formulation the first problem formulation p1 has three objective functions to 1 maximize the model performance over the whole calibration period as in eq 2 2 maximize the model performance for the most challenging wet year as in eq 3 and 3 minimize the bias for the most challenging dry year as in eq 4 simultaneously since flood forecasting is the main goal of models at hfc of mi nse that is sensitive to residuals in high flow periods is selected for objectives 1 and 2 if the lowest nse value based on eq 2 is maximized the nse values for other wet years are definitely higher nse is not a relevant metric for dry years since they are expected to have low or no peak flow rate and there is not a large variability in the annual hydrograph as a result absolute bias in eq 4 is selected for the third objective to evaluate the model performance for simulating persistent low flows in dry years 2 f 1 n s e overall 1 t t 0 t s t m t 2 t t 0 t m t

are based on the hydrological signatures recommended by yilmaz et al 2008 it has four objectives to maximize the overall nse f1 as in eq 2 and find the best fit in all three segments of the simulated and measured fdc three segments of fdc are identified based on the measured flow at the kamsack hydrometric station minimizing the error in estimating the slope of the mid segment of fdc eq 5 error in

2 f 3 β 1 2 s m 1 2 2 6 automatic calibration approach rounded archiving based pa dds sahraei et al 2019 a more effective version of pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search asadzadeh and tolson 2013 for solving many objective optimization problems is utilized for the automatic calibration of the hydrologic model cases in this paper pa dds commences the search with a random solution generation if there are good quality behavioral solutions for example with overall nse of above 0 5 available prior to the optimization they can be injected by the user as the initial solutions the pa dds structure has three key elements namely dominance relation selection metric and perturbation to guide the search toward the optimal tradeoff pa dds generates only one solution at a time by perturbing the recently archived solution and the corresponding objective functions are evaluated the dominance relation is then applied to assess whether or not the objective values of the generated solution surpasses those of the previously archived solutions if the solution is non dominated it would be retained in the archive the archive set contains only non dominated solutions that means none is dominating or dominated by any other archived solutions a solution parameter set is dominated by another solution if all of its objective functions are worse than the other a solution is dominating another solution if all of its objective function values are better than the other two solutions are mutually non dominated if one has at least one objective function better and at least one objective function worse than the other solution the hyper volume contribution selection metric of pa dds is used in this paper as it is reported the best selection metric for solving general multi objective optimization problems asadzadeh and tolson 2013 an archived solution that has higher hyper volume contribution value has more chance to be selected for perturbation and subsequent solution generation asadzadeh et al 2014 introduced the convex hull contribution as the preferred selection metric for model calibration problems with up to three objectives however it is not applied in this study because p2 has four objectives the perturbation size is the only parameter of the pa dds that has a recommended robust value of 0 2 asadzadeh and tolson 2013 the multi objective calibration of the hydrologic models of this study are not readily available watflood is equipped with two types of single objective automatic calibration methods namely the pattern search hooke and jeeves 1961 and the dynamically dimensioned search dds optimization tools tolson and shoemaker 2007 the user is restricted to only select among the statistical metrics defined in watflood for single objective calibration of the model the hec hms model uses traditional optimization methods such as univariate gradient and nelder mead or downhill simplex method techniques for fine tuning the model parameters based on minimizing the statistical error metrics the modeler is restricted to use the monte carlo method for the automatic calibration of hbv ec model and hspf model is limited to using manual calibration thus the need for linking a modern multi objective optimization tool like pa dds to the hydrologic models for a better model parameter identifiability is undeniable table 2 shows the computational budgets and number of trials for each model due to the model complexity simulation time of each hydrologic model and available computing resources different budgets and trials are considered for their calibration to calibrate watflood three independent trials with 5000 iterations per trial 4 5 min per solution evaluation are executed five ten and five independent calibration trials are performed respectively for hbv ec 1 1 5 min per solution evaluation hec hms 35 50 s per solution evaluation and hspf 40 80 s per solution evaluation models with 10 000 solution evaluations for hbv ec and hec hms and 5000 solution evaluations for hspf the results of multiple trials for each calibration problem are aggregated and normalized to between zero and one after removing solutions that produced negative overall nse values then the solution with the smallest weighted euclidean distance to known ideal objective values is selected as the preferred solution for each problem formulation based on the weight factors presented in table 2 the objectives are normalized to between zero and one to minimize the scaling effect of the objective functions on the euclidean distance calculation a higher weight is given to the overall nse correlation coefficient and variability index to emphasize the high flow rates since the flood forecast and control is in higher priority for hfc see table 2 the preferred solution for each model is used to create the best calibrated model for the model wrapper 2 7 linking pa dds to the hydrologic models in order to use an external optimization algorithm such as pa dds to calibrate the hydrologic models of this study a matlab function is developed to receive the set of parameter values from the optimization algorithm update the model input files run the stand alone model application load the results and calculate the objective functions the structure of this code is shown fig 4 2 8 segmentation based model wrapper the novel multi modelling approach developed in this study is based on the hydrologic modelling practice at hfc of mi the forecast results from different hydrologic models are quantitatively and visually compared for more accurate prediction of the inflow rate to the shellmouth reservoir in high flow and low flow seasons in order to control flood and supply water to downstream communities the multi modelling approach proposed in this study is based on the weighted average of the simulations of the calibrated hbv ec watflood hec hms and hspf models in practice one model surpasses another depending on the flow rate and season this is due to the structure of the models and the simulation performance of a model for high flow and low flow may be different as a result the predictability of these models are separately evaluated for high mid and low flow periods which is also in line with the practical operations at hfc of mi eq 9 shows the weighted average multi modelling for each time step q multi t as a system of linear equations w is the weight between zero and one and the summation of the weights for each linear equation should be equal to one according to the fdc partitioning of the calibration period described in fig 3 1 7 m3 s and 15 7 m3 s are used for the mid flow range with relatively constant slope from 0 6 to 0 2 probability of exceedance and beyond this range is considered as either high flow or low flow condition for the model wrapper the optimal value of the weights is achieved by minimizing the nse metric between the multi modelling simulations and measured streamflow data for the

calibrated models and the model wrapper the comparisons are mainly based on the heat map visualization of daily nse values for each year in fig 5 and annual streamflow hydrograph for the calibration and evaluation periods in figure a 2 the main reason for considering nse as the main criteria for the model performance is that it is highly sensitive to the model performance in estimating the timing and volume of high flow events that are of particular interest for flood forecasting at hfc of mi moreover nse has been a very popular metric that is normalized for evaluating the hydrologic model performance therefore guidelines had been developed for interpreting the model performance based on its value for example moriasi et al 2007 noted that negative values of daily nse can be interpreted as inadequate simulation while nse values higher than 0 5 can be interpreted as adequate model simulation a negative nse is colored in red and a positive nse of higher than 0 5 is colored in blue in fig 5 the annual mean flow rate in fig 5 shows that the simulation period begins with a relatively dry hydrological cycle from 1996 to 2005 and transitions into a wet cycle from 2006 to 2017 the annual precipitation and annual mean temperature as the most important input variables are also visualized in fig 5 to distinguish between all combinations of humid cool dry and hot years according to the annual precipitation 2017 and 2010 are the years with extremely dry and extremely humid weather conditions respectively 2012 and 2014 are the hottest red and coolest years blue in the entire simulation period 3 1 single model performance comparison calibrated models in this study are compared to the same models that were calibrated by unduche et al 2018 and are currently being used at hfc of mi for flood forecasting this comparison highlights the advantages of the multi objective calibration conducted in this research according to fig 5 the parameter settings found by the multi objective automatic calibration using any optimization problem formulation p1 p2 or p3 outperforms the previously used settings the number of years with negative nse values is reduced and the model performance in years with positive nse values is improved the previous settings that are used for the hbv ec watflood hec hms and hspf models fail to simulate the annual peak streamflow in 8 6 8 and 7 years out of the 14 year calibration period 2001 2014 and 5 3 5 and 5 years out of 8 year evaluation period respectively by giving negative annual nse values according to figure a 2 the hydrologic models with the old setting tend to generally overestimate the peak flow rate except for watflood which had been previously calibrated with the single objective automatic calibration of overall nse metric moreover the calibrated models in this study generally give a more accurate simulation of the peak flows in the wet and normal years all hydrologic models calibrated in this study or by unduche et al 2018 failed to adequately simulate the extremely and persistently dry years 2002 to 2005 e g year 2002 with no peak throughout the year all the models overestimated streamflow in this period therefore it is concluded that all models that are operational at hfc of mi lack hydrological processes that are active in persistent low flow periods these processes should be related to the interaction between groundwater and surface water 3 2 problem formulation comparison in general none of the three problem formulations is superior for calibrating all the models hec hms and hspf calibrated using any of the three problem formulations can adequately simulate peak flows see figure a 2 the simulated peak flow by p1 as a result of snowmelt is generally lower than the simulated peak flow by p2 and p3 for all hydrologic models p1 tends to find a setting that decreases the variance for annual nse and annual bias during the calibration period by improving these metrics for the most challenging years toward their ideal values using p1 formulation for the calibration of hec hms and hbv ec results in better estimation of peak flow in freshet period than p2 and p3 however hbv ec and watflood underestimate the high flow rates when they are calibrated with p1 according to fig 5 the hbv ec model calibrated with p1 captures more number of years with positive nse values 16 years compared to the same model calibrated using p2 or p3 14 years despite higher overall nse value of 0 54 hbv ec calibrated with p1 generally underestimates the daily average annual peak flow in figure a 2 and p2 and p3 formulations with respective nse values of 0 50 and 0 48 better represent the streamflow variability for the hbv ec model therefore the preferred parameter values found by p3 is selected for multi modelling since the major peak flow rates from 2010 to 2015 are more accurately simulated not shown in this paper compared to p1 and p2 and hfc is more concerned about major flood forecast accuracy likewise the setting identified with p1 formulation for watflood excels those with p2 and p3 as its heat map column in fig 5 is more blue dominated 17 versus 13 and 15 years respectively however the peak flow rates for p1 are generally underestimated based on the annual streamflow hydrograph in figure a 2 the watflood setting identified by p3 is therefore preferred for the multi modelling since there is a balance between dry year and wet year simulation accuracies compared to p2 as regards the hec hms and hspf models the parameter set found by p1 has the best performance among other settings and its match to the snowmelt dominated peak flow is preferred to p2 and p3 see figure a 2 the preferred solution of p1 is thus selected for the hec hms and hspf models for the multi modelling analysis 3 3 multi model simulation fig 5 shows that the proposed multi model that assigns weight to each model based on the flow duration curve segmentation results in higher simulation accuracy and better fit in fdc value compared to individual model simulation as shown in eq 11 the model wrapper weight factors are obtained by maximizing the overall nse value for the calibration period each model has a different contribution to the multi model flow rate simulation hspf has the highest contribution 68 to the multi model for simulating high flows watflood contributes to the simulation of high flows as well with a weight equal to 32 but its most significant contribution is to the simulation of mid range and low flow periods with weights equal to 90 and 99 respectively the high contribution and simulation accuracy of watflood is also evident from fig 7 especially for flow rates with frequency of exceedance higher than 35 the low flow condition mostly occurs in the winter that is base flow or groundwater flow dominated the main reason for a more accurate simulation of low flows is that watflood is capable of simulating channel and lake ice formation freeze up and sublimation processes in the cold months of the year watflood automatically stops the evapotranspiration and activates sublimation in the winter however other models only consider the snow accumulation and melting processes and the winter processes are not simulated for this reason the low flow rate is mostly overestimated an example of which is hspf model in fig 6 fig 6 displays the worst 1999 and best 2017 performing hydrograph simulated by the model wrapper in the evaluation period compared to the hydrograph simulated by its individual components that are hspf and watflood since model wrapper is the optimal weighted average version of watflood and hspf its hydrograph falls between its individual components peak flow as a result of snowmelt is simulated but watflood starts an early melt process in march due to experiencing a temperature warmer than the calibrated base temperature for different land cover classes while soil is still frozen and infiltration is low the snowmelt process is conceptualized and it does not consider the temporal changes such as early or late melt as a result the calibrated watflood model looks for the best base temperature and other snowmelt parameters to give the overall best fit in the calibration period in addition watflood gives an overestimated response to the summer rainfall in june in 1999 and similar years owing to experiencing high summer peaks in calibration period one reason is that watflood relates soil characteristics to land cover classes and it assumes that areas with similar land cover have similar soil properties however hspf that is distributed based on soil properties gives a more reasonable estimation of streamflow in june 1999 compared to watflood 11 s multi t 0 3206 q watflood

improves the overall and year to year daily nse metric in the calibration and evaluation periods as is evident from the heat map in fig 5 17 out of 22 years of simulation have positive annual nse values 14 of which are greater than 0 5 significantly improving the performance of its individual hydrologic model components fig 8 also compares the overall performance of multi modelling against single hydrologic modelling based on nse and its log transformed nse log nse to check the goodness of fit for high and low flow situations respectively the red continuous line with circle marker in fig 8 represents the model wrapper performance that is obtained by considering all the hydrologic models fig 8 demonstrates that the model wrapper performance surpasses its individual model components for the entire simulation period except for 2015 to 2017 when it performs slightly worse than hspf based on nse and hbv ec based on log nse for instance hspf alone fails to simulate the evaluation period 1996 to 2000 by giving negative nse while its combination with other models increases the nse value to 0 43 in this period this improvement is also demonstrated in fig 9 in both the calibration and evaluation stages that daily average annual streamflow hydrograph of the model wrapper better represents its measured counterpart in the peak and rising and falling limbs moreover the model wrapper gives out a simulation range and a simulation mean that are consistent with the range and mean of daily streamflow in both the calibration and evaluation periods optimal weights of 0 0 for hbv ec and hec hms show that these two models do not contribute to the multi model according to fig 7 fdc of hec hms is significantly different compared to that for the measured streamflow in all three segments of fdc therefore the multi model does not benefit from hec hms simulation in high mid range or low flow periods the optimal weight of hbv ec is 0 0 as well because as shown in fig 7 it is very similar to hspf however hspf performs significantly better in high flow periods that have the highest influence on the overall nse when hspf or watflood is removed from the pool of models used for multi modelling hec hms and hbv ec contribute to the multi model if hspf is removed the hbv ec and hec hms receive optimal weighs of 27 3 and 5 9 respectively for simulating high flows but close to zero for simulating mid and low flow partitions on the other hand by eliminating watflood and keeping hspf in the pool of models hbv ec contributes to the simulation of low flow rates with a weight of 22 5 but still does not contribute to the simulation of high and mid range flows in this case hec hms would only contribute 9 5 to the simulation of mid range flows the performance of the aforementioned two variants of the multi model is represented by the dashed and dot lines respectively in fig 8 showing that including all hydrologic models in the multi model combination increases the reliability of the multi model by producing more consistently positive and relatively high nse and log transformed nse values due to decreasing the structural uncertainty in the hydrologic models 4 study limitations in this study we limited the hydrologic models to those that are currently operational at hfc of mi this does not mean that these models are the best ones for flood forecasting upstream of the shellmouth reservoir one would expect that including other models that perform better than the models used at hfc of mi individually would improve the overall performance of the multi model as well moreover each hydrologic model in this study has a significantly different number of parameters with watflood having the highest number of parameters 114 and hec hms having the lowest number of parameters 14 in general calibrating more parameters require more computational budget therefore watflood model should have been calibrated with a high number of solution evaluations however such computational resources were not available for this study it should be also noted that more solution evaluations can only improve the calibration results therefore we believe that this limitation does not have any negative impact on the results and conclusion however we believe that the watflood model used at hfc of mi has too many parameters to be identifiable therefore we suggest that parameters of this model be grouped for calibration in an approach similar to the calibration of curve number parameter of swat in abbaspour 2013 the parameters of the hec hms model are assumed spatially constant automatically calibrated hec hms model performs weakly for the streamflow simulation of upper assiniboine river basin at kamsack with an overall nse of 0 31 problem type p1 for the calibration period in an attempt to increase the model simulation accuracy each sub basin element was considered to have a unique parameterization for hec hms however this increases the number of parameters and leads to ill conditioning in the model ill conditioning means that it has a high condition number and it is very sensitive to the number of decimals in its parameter values a small change in the parameter values changes the simulation results drastically during the optimization pa dds generates a new parameter set and archives it if non dominated with full precision level but it is evaluated with lower precision since the hec hms model first rounds up or down the full precision parameter values in the parameter file to lower decimal values then it simulates the flow rate the parameter distribution in the model domain would be highly non smooth and consist of micro scale nonlinearities if it is assumed that parameters are spatially independent by taking spatial independency assumption into consideration inappropriate time stepping scheme and internal model thresholds lead to an ill conditioned model kavetski et al 2006 this issue is resolvable by implementing the regularization methods on model parameters such as tikhonov regularization tikhonov and arsenin 1977 or constraining the calibration problem by adding additional information about the parameter interdependency and their relations with the watershed characteristics pokhrel et al 2008 the implementation of the regularization methods is out of the scope of this study and the readers are referred to the mentioned citations to better understand the concept of ill conditioning and regularization 5 conclusions this study demonstrated a segmentation based model blending strategy for improving the performance of individual hydrologic models the proposed model wrapper was successfully applied to the models used for flood forecasting at hfc of mi the previously developed hydrologic models at hfc of mi were linked to the pa dds multi objective optimization tool to re calibrate the models using three suites of signature based calibration objective functions the final best parameter set or preferred solution found by post processing the archive set of pa dds outperformed the previous versions of the hydrologic models meaning that signature based multi objective calibration increases the simulation accuracy and parameter identifiability after calibrating the models a segmentation based weighted average combination technique was built to let each model have a different contribution to the simulation of high mid and low flow ranges the multi model had a significantly improved performance compared to each individual model results showed that hbv ec and hec hms do not partake in multi model simulation hspf is the main contributor to simulation of the flow rates higher than 15 7 m3 s time of exceedance less than 20 but the watflood model takes over the simulation of mid and low flow partitions less than 15 7 m3 s assuming the situation when either hspf or watflood is not available the hbv ec and hec hms models join the multi model combination helping to enhance the model wrapper simulation in comparison with its individual hydrologic model components this means that none of the hydrologic models is able to individually capture all the aspects of simulation error distribution therefore grouping the models increases the performance and decreases the model structural uncertainty the segmentation based model wrapper technique is in line with the practical operations at the hfc of mi for predicting inflow to the shellmouth reservoir at downstream during low flow and high flow seasons it is highly encouraged to include more physically based hydrologic models that take the temporal variations such as early or late melt and spatial distribution of soil properties into consideration to increase the timing and magnitude accuracy of peak flows resulted from snowmelt and summer rainfall the upper assiniboine river basin in the prairie region of canada is chosen for the method implementation results demonstration and discussions in this study however the signature based multi objective calibration and segmentation based model combination techniques are not limited to the upper assiniboine river basin and its hydrologic models in this paper the model wrapper is expected to perform better than its individual model components regardless of region of study and type of hydrologic modelling if one model outperform other individual models in all aspects of simulation error distribution the weight factor in the proposed model wrapper converges to one in all ranges of measured streamflow more broadly research is needed to study the impact of more physically based hydrologic models on flood forecasting performance of the model blending method in regions with different dominant hydrological processes the signature based calibration metrics in this study were defined solely based on streamflow measurements that were in line with the purpose of the models for flood forecasting however in general modelers are highly encouraged to include other calibration metrics in the optimization that explain other components of hydrological processes such as the interaction between surface water and groundwater evapotranspiration and sublimation snow pack upon existence of information and or measured data the models in this study were evaluated temporally but the spatial evaluation would help increase parameter identifiability if hydrometric observations exist at multiple locations across the basin future work can also focus on considering the ill conditioning issues for the multi objective calibration of the hydrologic models of this study via implementation of the regularization methods on the parameters for a better conditioned and more identifiable watershed system kavetski et al 2006 this is facilitated by exploiting additional information from the system such as spatial dependency of the model parameters on the watershed properties such as curve number soil properties and land cover to decrease the parameter space dimensionality and constrain the parameters not to take on arbitrary values in their feasible ranges pokhrel et al 2008 pokhrel et al 2012 credit

5348,the swat model is a semi distributed hydrological watershed model with an explicit physical mechanism which is widely applied in areas characterized by a wide variety of precipitation distributions and slope conditions however the soil conservation service curve number scs cn value and precipitation initial abstraction ratio were not related to slope soil moisture content precipitation intensity and land cover interception within the original swat model thus a modified scs cn model is proposed by considering the slope rainfall intensity soil moisture and interception effects of the landscape in this study specifically revising the critical sensitive parameters including cn2 and initial abstraction ratio λ the modified scs cn model was added to the original swat model and named the swat ch model which is applied to chao river watershed which experiences obvious differences in precipitation and slope for this application the daily streamflow was simulated for the calibration and validation periods of 1993 2005 and 2006 2013 respectively the simulated variable is monthly runoff at watershed outlet namely xiahui hydrological station the parameter sensitivity and uncertainty and the model applicability were analyzed using as chao river watershed as a case study the main results are as follows ① compared with the original swat model the parameters of sol k hru slp slsubbsn and canmx were identified as the most sensitive parameters for the runoff simulation in the new swat ch model ② the prediction efficiency of the swat ch model surpasses that of the original swat model the nash sutcliffe efficiency kge index and the pbias were 0 94 0 83 and 4 55 respectively for swat ch during the calibration stage while those corresponding indexes were 0 91 0 84 and 7 00 for the validation period the modified swat ch model can better reproduce the hydrological process than the swat model in detail the nash sutcliffe efficiency kge index and the pbias were improved by 0 02 0 10 4 01 percentage points for the calibration period as well as by 0 18 0 25 and 28 55 percentage points for the validation period in the modified swat ch model compared with the original swat model ③ influenced by soil moisture there is a substantial difference between the swat ch and swat models in wet periods at various temporal scales ④ parameter uncertainty is the main source of the uncertainty in hydrological estimation for the chao river watershed the modified swat ch model has to some extent reduced the effect of parameter uncertainty with increasing structure uncertainty from 6 00 for the swat model to 9 00 for the swat ch model the model adaptability has been enhanced by introducing terrace slope precipitation intensity and soil moisture for the modification of cn2 and the abstraction ratio which makes the revised swat ch model have better simulation performance in areas with the obvious characteristics of terrain rainfall heterogeneity and drastic dry wet cycles in the soil profile keywords swat slope precipitation intensity parameter sensitivity uncertainty adaptability 1 introduction affected by drastic land use change and climate change the global surface water environment has been increasingly disturbed kirby et al 2016 worku et al 2017 with the combined influence of meteorological and social economic conditions it has become a complex issue to precisely quantify the spatial temporal distribution and characteristics of water resources in the field of hydrological research and water resources management thus it is essential to reasonably evaluate the distribution characteristics of water resources to increase the water utilization rate and achieve sustainable use of water resources hydrological simulation which is based on numerical simulation is one of the most important and effective approaches for hydrological analysis flood prediction and the evaluation and management of water resources hydrological models can describe the complex surface hydrological cycle process which makes models effective tools for examining hydrological phenomenon and processes widely used hydrological models include topmodel a topography based hydrological model metcalfe et al 2015 hspf hydrological simulation program fortran berndt et al 2016 swmm storm water management model zhang et al 2018 slurp semi land use runoff program shin et al 2016 mike she mike system hydrologic european zhang et al 2015 xinanjiang model zhao and liu 1995 and swat soil and water assessment tool gassman et al 2007 among the aforementioned models the swat model is a daily time step hydrological model based on the soil conservation service curve number scs cn module and the green and ampt module for runoff computation major functions for swat is evaluating the long term comprehensive effects of climate change land use change and agricultural management practices on streamflow and water quality muenich et al 2016 the swat model has various sub modules for instance the hydrological module sediment module nutrient module crop growth module and agricultural practices module the swat model has been applied to different research fields including watershed hydrology abbaspour et al 2015 soil erosion evaluation wellen et al 2014 agricultural nonpoint source pollution wang et al 2018a b evaluation and allocation of agricultural best management practices bmps panagopoulos et al 2012 and assessment of ecosystem services functions francesconi et al 2016 as the fundamental module in the swat model the accuracy of the hydrological module is most important to the transport and transformation of pollutants e g sediment nutrients and insecticides surface runoff interflow groundwater runoff and evaporation processes are simulated in the swat model because of the differences in terrain and hydrology factors i e slope variation precipitation intensity soil moisture etc the original swat model is not completely suited to all watershed circumstances over the world resulting in simulations with notable uncertainty kim and lee 2008 vigiak et al 2015 jiao et al 2017 given the model limitations various model modification research has been done by scholars considering the effects of soil moisture groundwater snowmelt and streamflow generation for example a modified swat version named swat g was constructed for overcoming problems with higher baseflow contributions the swat g model was tested in a mountainous basin with a thin soil profile showing good adaptability with a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mccuen et al 2006 of 0 76 against 0 17 for the original swat model eckhardt et al 2002 considering the effect of agricultural irrigation on groundwater a nonlinear groundwater module was designed and integrated into the swat model for the karst topography of southwestern china wang and brubaker 2014 a groundwater evaporation module was revised and integrated into the swat model based on long term observation data in this sub module the evaporation coefficient of shallow groundwater was rewritten as a function of groundwater depth soil moisture and crop roots luo et al 2008 snowmelt runoff is one of the principal runoff components in snow covered areas qi et al 2017 developed a novel snowmelt module with an energy conservation methodology basis instead of the temperature based snowmelt module meng et al 2014 proposed a physically based snowmelt moisture added to the original swat model surface runoff generation is an essential component in the swat model where the scs cn or green ampt method is utilized for daily streamflow simulation in the scs cn module the curve number cn2 has been recognized as the most critical comprehensive parameter which is strongly sensitive in the hydrological process simulation in the swat model zhang and huang 2011 previous studies have shown that the cn2 is affected not only by soil antecedent moisture content but also the precipitation volume in given day van liew and garbrecht 2003 kim and lee 2008 a temporal weighted average cn twa cn algorithm was introduced for improving the streamflow simulation in swat kim and lee 2008 the flood calculation method was adjusted based on the actual peak flow transport mechanism the revised methodology has the capability to make peak flow and baseflow match observations well and reduce the lag effect between simulated peak flow and observed peak flow lv et al 2014 rajib and merwade 2016 have put forward a soil moisture based cn method sma cn increasing the simulation performance to a large extent shi et al 2017 have optimized the scs cn module considering the effect of storm duration and soil antecedent moisture content the results showing that the modified algorithm has better simulation performance than original swat model the initial abstraction ratio has also proven to be an important parameter for surface runoff generation in the classical scs cn module the initial abstraction ratio was set as a constant equaling 0 20 yet the initial abstraction ratio should be calibrated according the actual rainfall runoff monitoring data fu et al 2011 shi et al 2009 in fact the slope variation is the important factor controlling the runoff generation xin et al 2019 specifically the cn2 and initial abstraction ratio are closely associated with the slope condition in the original scs cn model the effect of slope on the initial abstraction ratio was not emphasized which may make it unsuitable for hydrological simulation for steep watersheds meanwhile asian monsoon climate areas have greatly heterogeneous precipitation differing from north american conditions the rainfall intensity perhaps has a more obvious influence than the precipitation volume this can partially explain the low accuracy of runoff simulation in the original classical swat model for some watersheds the miyun reservoir is the primary surface drinking water supply for beijing since 1999 the streamflow has been drastically reduced for this reservoir because of climate change and human activities pang and wang 2016 water shortage has become one of the conditions constraining economic development around beijing because of the environmental difference between study watershed and the area of the original scs cn model development the application of universal hydrological models may be questionable for various underlying conditions in the present study the swat ch model was developed and tested considering the slope and precipitation intensity effects on the cn for the chao river watershed north of beijing this paper is organized as follows ①the modified flow chart is depicted and described along with the major processes for the swat model ②the difference in parameter sensitivity is examined between the swat and swat ch models ③the simulation performance was evaluated for the swat ch model in calibration and validation periods ④the hydrological difference was compared for both the swat and swat ch models for various temporal scales and land use types ⑤the model uncertainty is investigated including model parameter uncertainty and model structure uncertainty 2 modification of the swat model 2 1 swat model the swat model developed by the u s department of agriculture in 1994 is a semi distributed watershed model with an explicit physical mechanism which can simulate continuous daily outputs of flow and water quality abbaspour et al 2015 in applications of the swat model the stream structure is first extracted using the terrain data digital elevation model dem and the whole basin is divided into several sub watersheds then the hydrological response units hrus are generated by overlaying land use types soils map and slope distribution the hrus comprise the basic calculation unit of the swat model the input data includes daily meteorological data rainfall temperature wind speed relative humanity and solar radiation and agricultural management practice information cultivation method crop types fertilization irrigation and harvest schedule the output of spatial files is categorized into three types namely sub watershed scale tributary scale and hru scale meanwhile the temporal resolution of swat output also includes three scales yearly monthly and daily 2 2 hydrological water balance the swat model consists of the hydrology module soil erosion module nutrient module insecticide module and crop growth module where the hydrology module is the basic module affecting all other sub modules the hydrology module simulates the rainfall runoff processes snowmelt soil interflow evapotranspiration and soil water seepage the rainfall runoff process results in direct discharge into main channel after interception seepage and evaporation affect the precipitation the direct runoff is one of the most important components of swat hydrology simulation in the swat model the hydrological process satisfies the law of water conservation expressed as follows 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw t is the soil moisture content at t time mm sw0 is the initial soil moisture content mm t refers to time with units of days ｒday is the precipitation depth mm on the ith day qsurf is surface runoff mm on the ith day ea is the evapotranspiration mm on the ith day wweep is the soil water seepage mm from the vadose zone into the soil profile and qgw is the groundwater volume mm returning to main channel on the ith day in the swat model the direct runoff is calculated with the scs cn or green and ampt modules of the two modules the green and ampt module requires hourly precipitation and temperature for simulating the streamflow hourly meteorological input data often is not available especially for large scale watersheds which has restricted the application of the green and ampt module bauwe et al 2016 compared with the green and ampt module the scs cn module is suitable for simulating daily runoff only using the daily precipitation data which is applied in various swat versions for streamflow calculation the scs cn model embraces two critical parameters namely the runoff curve number cn2 and initial abstraction ratio λ the computation procedure is as follows 2 r p λ s 2 p 1 λ s p λ s 0 p λ s 3 s 25400 cn 254 where r is the surface runoff mm p is precipitation mm p r s is the water storage capacity mm of different land use and soil types the cn value is an index of the water storage coefficient of the soil profile and λis the initial abstraction ratio dimensionless in the original scs cn model λwas assumed as a constant value 0 20 including the effect of canopy interception and soil pore storage volume from the aforementioned formulations it can be seen that the original scs cn model can only be applied to gently sloped agricultural watersheds with even i e fairly uniform rainfall like the watersheds for which it was presumably derived because the parameters cn2 and λ do not change with terrain and precipitation distribution especially the original scs cn model cannot simulate the hydrological characteristics in a forest dominated basin with strong heterogeneous slope and rainfall variation for example ponce and hawkins 1996 noted the original scs cn method has yielded poor performance for forest sites in view of this a modified scs cn model was proposed combining the effect of precipitation intensity and terrain on cn2 and the influence of land roughness soil moisture content and slope on λ the technical approach of the scs cn modification is shown in fig 1 2 3 modification of the scs cn method 2 3 1 modification of cn2 it is clear that cn2 is the most sensitive parameter in the swat model thus it is essential to choose a suitable cn2 value for improving the performance of the hydrological simulation fu et al 2013 however cn2 is a comprehensive watershed parameter related to land use type soil type and soil moisture condition moreover cn2 is strongly affected by precipitation intensity and underlying surface slope thus ignoring the effects of rainfall intensity and terrain could cause a significant runoff simulation deviation especially in two zones with different soil types land uses and vegetation covers this can be explained by the following reasons first the classical cn2 was presumably developed for gentle plots with slopes less than 5 00 yet the simulation performance could be reduced for steep areas so to enhance the prediction ability of the scs cn model for different slope conditions several modifications of the cn value have been proposed according to the slope condition for example williams et al 2011 have proposed a modified cn algorithm for all different slope conditions huang et al 2006 put forward an adjusted cn for the loess plateau in china eq 4 the rainfall intensity also is an important external factor determining the cn value the original scs cn model uses the precipitation volume to predict runoff which does not consider the effect of rainfall intensity and duration on the runoff generation capacity tasdighi et al 2018 jiao et al 2017 indicated that runoff and soil erosion are linked to the maximum precipitation volume during 30 min and a new concept of cn formulation was developed based on the rainfall intensity eq 5 jiao et al 2017 for simplification of the modeling a hypothesis is proposed where the effects of slope and rainfall intensity on the cn value are independent even though it is possible that those two factors to a certain degree are interdependent according to the aforementioned assumption a new cn module is proposed by combining eqs 4 and 5 as shown in eq 6 4 cn sl c n 15 63 s l o p e 322 79 slope 323 52 5 cn sp a c n p 30 p b 6 cn s a c n 15 63 s l o p e 322 79 slope 323 52 p 30 p b where cn sl cn sp and cn s are the modified cn values for slope precipitation intensity and both factors respectively cn is the original cn value not adjusted by slope and rainfall intensity slope is the terrain with the unit of percentage gratitude p is the daily rainfall volume and p30 is maximum precipitation volume during a 30 min period mm obtained by the experimental formula of p30 simulation based on daily precipitation volume in the original swat weather generator schuol and abbaspour 2007 which is documented in the swat theoretical documentation version 2009 by neitsch et al 2011 theoretically the term of a and b can be seen as calibrated parameters in the model application on the other hand some field experiments also can be adopted in same watershed or catchment to determine the value of a and b thus based on the results for the shixia catchment in the miyun district of beijing a and b were 1 474 and 0 4862 respectively jiao et al 2017 2 3 2 modification of the λ value some research has revealed that the initial abstraction ratio λ is the other sensitive parameter in the scs cn model whose sensitivity rank is higher than that of the cn value deng et al 2018 generally λ is set as 0 20 in the original scs cn model suiting zones with slopes no more than 5 00 ajmal et al 2015 but the value of λ perhaps is not a constant varying as the slope changes so it is necessary to adjust λ with slope in a specific area ponce and hawkins 1996 it has been reported that λ has a negative exponential relation with slope zhang et al 2008 here the slope adjustment factor for λ by slope is given in eq 7 7 f s l o p e e 0 083 s l o p e where the term of slope is the average slope of the hrus with units of degrees the precipitation has significant seasonal variation in monsoon climate zones in dry periods the value of λis relatively higher than in the rainy season because of lower soil moisture saturation which leads to reduced runoff when the runoff generation is dominated by the excess runoff mechanism during the rainy season the soil profile gradually approaches saturation resulting in smaller λ values and the streamflow is characterized by saturation runoff in this paper a novel soil water adjustment factor is proposed termed f w profile in eq 8 what can be seen is that the f w profile will tend toward zero when the soil water content is saturated as expressed in eq 8 the factor of f w profile is designed to adjust the initial abstraction ratio λ other than the cn2 in classical scs cn model because of its ignorance of soil moisture variation over time therefore the value of λ can be modified by soil moisture content in the day before 8 f w profile 1 w profile w fc where w profile is the water content of the soil profile mm and w fc is maximum field capacity of the soil profile mm different land use distributions also have influenced the initial abstraction ratio λ but this influence has been omitted in the original swat model this may result in different amounts of interception for different land use types in fact grassland and forest land surfaces are coarse and need more precipitation volume to satisfy the retention and infiltration processes therefore the value of λ frequently is higher in grassland and forest land than other land covers further the λ of cropland could be more than that of bare land and urban land for this aspect a factor for λ is developed associated with land use as shown in eq 9 in this equation the factor is expressed as a power function of the manning s roughness coefficient n ratio between cropland and various land use types the main manning coefficient for different land uses are listed in table 1 9 f l a n d u s e n landuse n cropland 0 60 where n landuse and n cropland are the manning s roughness coefficients for the land use type of interest and cropland respectively as previously mentioned the default value of λ is 0 20 in the swat model which is treated as the maximum theoretical value for the initial abstraction ratio namely λ max 0 20 in summary an amended formulation for λ is proposed considering the slope soil moisture content and land use effects as shown in eq 10 10 λ f l a n d u s e f w profile f s l o p e λ max where the λ is the modified initial abstraction ratio for precipitation in order to integrate the revised equations into the swat model the source files of the swat2012 model were downloaded from the official website of the swat model https swat tamu edu then related code files were rewritten and compiled involving the files parm f allocate parms f surq daycn f and surface f in the fortran language 2 4 accuracy assessment of the model model performance assessment is essential to model selection and utilization the common criteria for model evaluation include the nash and sutcliffe 1970 efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and percent bias pbias those three methods were used to compare the result accuracy between model simulation and field observations the three criteria are computed as follows 11 n s e 1 i 1 n q i s i 2 i 1 n q i q avg 2 12 k g e 1 r sim o b s 1 2 sd s i m sd o b s 1 2 mean s i m q a v g 1 2 13 p b i a s i 1 n q i s i 2 100 i 1 n q i 2 where si qi and qavg are model simulated value at time i observed data at time i and average of the observations respectively n is time span for model simulation r sim o b s is the correlation coefficient between simulated and observed values sd s i m and sd obs are the standard deviations of simulated and observed values respectively and finally mean s i m is average of the simulated values theoretically the nse and kge range from to 1 the simulation results tend to be perfect when the nse or kge approaches 1 the simulation result is accepted with a small pbias for the hydrological simulation the simulation results will be acceptable when nse or kge is more than 0 50 as well as the absolute pbias is less than 15 0 in order to further assess the effect of model structure change on prediction uncertainty a criterion is considered for evaluating the model structure uncertainty all of the uncertain factors can be expressed as the parameter uncertainty including input data model structure assumptions and model parameters guo et al 2014 hence the p factor could be defined to explain the contribution of parameter uncertainty to total model prediction uncertainty the p factor also is called the proposed 95 confidence interval 95 ppu ranging from 0 to 1 which can describe the ratio of the direct observations in 95 ppu guo et al 2014 when the p value is 0 it means that the parameter uncertainty has little influence on model simulation and structure uncertainty and input data are the most critical reasons for model simulation uncertainty whereas when the p value equals 100 0 it means that parameter uncertainty is the only source causing the model simulation uncertainty it can be concluded that the higher the p value is the more significant the parameter uncertainty in the case of the same input data the model structure uncertainty is defined as ps which is expressed as ps 1 p to characterize the effect of parameter variation on the prediction results this paper uses the r factor defined as the quotient of 95 ppu width and the deviation of the prediction to the observation which is greater than or equal to 0 due to the error existing in the model structure and the observations however the simulation cannot strictly match the observed data therefore the calculation result must satisfy the following two constraints first the nse and kge exceed 0 50 meanwhile the pbias must less than 15 0 then the p value should more than 0 70 which means that more than 70 00 of the observed data falls into the 95 ppu interval 2 5 detection of point of discontinuity in hydrological serial in some studies on hydrological model calibration the determination of calibration and validation period is arbitrary action without definite theoretical support thus the reliability of model performance might be lowered especially for the hydrological parameters with a high temporal variation fortunately the mann kendall test can be utilized to find the trend and discontinuity of calibrated data serial which can be used as division basis for calibration and validation periods in details if the hydrological data serial has several discontinuity points implying that different hydrology mechanisms were identified in historical hydrological serial the individual sub serials were regarded as calibration and validation set respectively the algorithm of mann kendal was documented in some literatures hamed 2008 kisi and ay 2014 in this method two main statistical parameters were critical for data trend distinction named uf and ub which is the sequence serial and inverted sequence serial for the rank information of raw hydrological data respectively the time was treated as the discontinuity point where the uf and ub curve have crossed in the specific range of significance level 3 application of the swat ch model 3 1 description of the study area the chao river watershed 116 87 117 34 e 40 20 41 27 n is located northeast of beijing the length of the main channel is about 239 5 km with a total drainage area of 4888 km2 this watershed includes 3 counties and 24 towns involving the miyun district luanping county and fengning county fig 2 the climate type is a classical temperate continental monsoon climate with annual mean precipitation of 494 mm mainly concentrating between june and september the main soils are brown earth and cinnamon soil accounting for 80 0 of the total watershed area the vegetation type is dominated by mixed forest according to the census of 2015 the total population in this watershed is about 370 000 with a population density of 76 people per ha agricultural plants and livestock are the main source of livelihood in this watershed the main crops include maize and wheat and the livestock types consist of sheep pigs poultry and large animals extensive agricultural management has lasted for a long period with mean fertilizer application of 225 300 kg ha influenced by ecological restoration construction of water resource facilities and agricultural development the streamflow has been significantly reduced for five decades especially after 1999 qin et al 2018 3 2 scenario settings to compare the model performance before and after modification two simulations were done including the original swat model and the modified swat ch model considering the slope and rainfall intensity adjustments the chao river watershed was used as study case area to test the performance improvement of the swat modification work 3 3 source of study data the research data include a digital elevation model dem land use land cover soil type meteorological data hydrological data and related agricultural management information listed in table 2 all of the spatial data were projected as wgs 1984 utm zone 50n to unify the geographic reference and projections of the various spatial data 4 results and discussion 4 1 parameter sensitivity a total of 17 parameters are selected for sensitivity analysis in the swat model in this paper based on published research table 3 the sufi 2 algorithm integrated in the swat cup calibration and uncertainty program for the swat model software is utilized for the parameter sensitivity analysis for both the swat and swat ch models this algorithm was executed for 2000 iterations and the sensitivity rank was identified from the p value and t stat of the two indexes the parameter sensitivity was recognized as a high rank with a small p value and a bigger absolute t stat value in the original swat model six parameters were discerned as sensitive parameters in the hydrological module namely cn2 sol k alpha bnk canmx hru slp and slsubbsn what can be seen is that cn2 is the most sensitive parameter for streamflow simulation in the original swat model this result is consistent with other reports boughton 1989 found that a cn variation of 10 would lead to a range of 45 to 55 of runoff fluctuation moreover the parameters sol k alpha bnk canmx hru slp and slsubbsn also were important external factors affecting streamflow prediction which is confirmed by existing research zadeh et al 2017 for the swat ch model the sensitive parameters include sol k hru slp slsubbsn canmx alpha bnk gwqmn and esco and sol k hru slp slsubbsn canmx and alpha bnk were identified the common parameters sensitive for both the swat and swat ch models however the sensitivity rank is markedly different for those parameters in the swat and swat ch models specifically sol k hru slp slsubbsn canmx and alpha bnk were in order the top five ranked parameters in the swat ch model yet those parameters are the second fifth sixth fourth and third ranked parameters respectively in the swat model so the change in sensitivity is related with the modification of the model algorithm especially for the parameters sol k hru slp slsubbsn and anmx soil moisture has a dry wet cycle over the entire hydrological year in the chao river watershed with a typical a semi arid drainage the soil saturation level was used as an adjustment factor for the initial abstraction ratio in the modified swat ch model sol k can regulate soil moisture content which may further influence the change of streamflow volume the slope ranges from 0 00 to 235 59 with a mean slope of 24 93 in the watershed this value differs from the suitable mean slope of the original swat model 5 00 the swat ch model can revise the cn2 value and the initial abstraction ratio of rainfall comparing the original model structure cn2 increases and the initial abstraction ratio decreases as the slope becomes steep thus the parameter hru slp is an important variable controlling streamflow generation for mountainous watersheds grassland and forest land are the most common land use types which account for over 80 0 of the total watershed area the canopy has redistributed the spatial temporal pattern of precipitation this makes canmx a critical parameter for the chao river watershed 4 2 model calibration and validation the determination of calibration and validation periods affects the prediction accuracy of model simulation but the selection of calibration and validation periods is subject to the experience of the model user with some amount of subjectivity therefore it is essential to scientifically define the calibration and validation periods to properly determine the improvement in the simulation performance for the hydrological model in this study the mann kendall test was applied to discern the change point during the total runoff series which is used to divide the series into calibration and validation sub series the monthly streamflow of the chao river watershed has experienced three different stages from 1993 to 2013 in detail the runoff series has slightly increased for 1993 to 1998 sharply declined 1999 2004 and slowly rebounded 2005 2013 as is shown in fig 3 the uf curve has surpassed the lower limits of the 95 and 99 confidence limits e g 1 96 and 2 32 in april and june of 2000 respectively this indicates that the decreasing trend of streamflow has increased for the watershed since june 2000 yet the trend of streamflow shifted from decreasing to increasing in june of 2004 overall the streamflow has experienced an obvious decline before 2004 which turned to a steady increasing trend after 2004 which shows that 2004 can be seen as change point in the runoff series for the chao river watershed then the total streamflow was divided into two parts recognized as calibration and validation stages namely sub series a 1993 2004 and sub series b 2005 2013 respectively in this paper the sufi 2 algorithm was applied to calibrate the swat and swat ch models based on the monthly streamflow data at the xiahui hydrological station from 1993 to 2013 according to the result of the change point test of mann kendall the warm up period is defined as 1990 1992 and the calibration and validation periods defined as 1993 2004 and 2005 2013 respectively the initial calibrated parameter intervals were determined based on the swat cup manual and related literature arabi et al 2007 qiu et al 2018 the optimal parameter values were fixed after several iterations in which 500 simulations were done the optimal parameters are listed in table 4 the differences in the parameter values for the swat and swat ch models reflects the changes in model structure for the swat ch model which then necessitates changes in the optimal value of parameters that are common to both models for the swat model the nse is 0 92 and 0 73 the kge is 0 73 and 0 59 and the pbias is 8 57 and 35 55 in the calibration and validation periods respectively the nse efficiency for the swat ch model is 0 94 and 0 91 kge is 0 83 and 0 84 and the pbias is 4 56 and 7 00 in the calibration and validation periods respectively clearly both the swat and swat ch models have satisfied the accuracy requirements for acceptable model simulation moriasi et al 2007 however the performance of the swat ch model is better than that of the swat model especially in term of the kge efficiency all of the criteria for the swat ch model surpass those of the swat model in the validation period for the pbias simulation using the swat model cannot be accepted due to the large pbias 35 55 in the validation period on the other hand the parameters show an obvious disparity between the calibration results of the swat and swat ch models including ch k2 sol awc alpha bf and revapmn this may be attributed to the fact that the swat and swat ch models were separately optimized with the related parameters in the reasonable range therefore equifinality is inevitable in the calibration process of hydrological models in other words a lot of parameter combinations seldom a single combination can reach a satisfactory model performance her and chaubey 2015 as is shown in fig 4 the streamflow process has a significant fluctuation in the calibration period although the performance of the swat and swat ch models was similar especially in the dry period e g 1999 2004 compared with the swat model for the validation period the simulated flow from the swat ch model matched well with observed flows the nse of the swat ch model 0 91 is better than that of the swat model 0 73 in the validation period this can be explained because runoff has significantly reduced since 1999 while the precipitation doesn t show an obvious declining trend this difference in trends perhaps makes the simulated value of streamflow relatively higher for the original swat model whereas the rainfall intensity maximum precipitation during a 30 min period is considered in the modified swat ch model which could decrease the peak volume improving the simulation ability compared to the original swat model in other words the original swat model might not be appropriate for applications to a basin with strong heterogeneity of terrain and precipitation whereas the modified swat ch model may be suitable for hydrological simulation to reproduce the actual streamflow process in such watersheds ideally it is desirable to have a calibration period with more year to year variability in rainfall and runoff than in the current calibration period of 1993 to 2004 because a small variation over the calibration period may affect the robustness of the calibrated model when applied to other periods this can be seen for the case of the original swat model that has markedly poorer performance for the validation period which experiences higher variability in the rainfall and runoff compared to the calibration period the original swat model has less flexibility to adjust for changes in storm intensity than the swat ch model and the calibrated parameters thus are more tied to the period of lower variability in runoff however the fact that the swat ch model performs equally well for both the calibration and validation periods indicates that because this model considers storm intensity it is more flexible than the original swat model to handle differences in the rainfall and runoff in the periods to be simulated compared to the calibration period therefore the good results for calibration and validation provide strong support for the usefulness of the swat ch model 4 3 variation of different hydrological periods in order to evaluate the temporal adaptability of the swat ch model this model was tested at different temporal scales consisting of daily monthly and annual scales then the hydrological variation was determined for both the swat and swat ch models on the annual scale fig 5 the annual streamflow from the swat ch model is generally higher than that from the swat model in detail the simulated runoff in swat ch surpasses that from swat in wet years for instance this runoff difference between the swat ch and swat models is about 13 56 18 32 and 26 28 in the wet years of 1994 2005 and 2010 respectively yet the streamflow simulation of the two model versions doesn t show a significant variation in dry years e g 2000 2002 and 2007 this demonstrates that the structure modification yields little effect on improvement in dry years in the modified scs cn module antecedent soil moisture and precipitation are the most important parameters the soil moisture will be tend to high in wet years with more rainfall than dry years which in turn directly increases surface direct runoff at the monthly scale runoff simulation from the swat ch model exceeds that of the swat model in the monsoon flood period june to october whereas the streamflow simulation of the two models has little difference in the non monsoon non flood months as shown in fig 6 the streamflow volume for the swat and swat ch models match well before june this can be explained by the fact that rainfall is the main source of streamflow in the chao river watershed and the precipitation is mainly distributed in the flood period this means those months with little rainfall result in lower soil moisture content in the non flood period as precipitation increases the moisture content of the soil profile tends to be saturated in the flood period the runoff retention capability of the soil profile decreases causing runoff generation to increase from july to october from the runoff variability the coefficient of variation cv of simulated runoff from the swat ch model is higher than that from the swat model with the difference in the cv for the two models over 25 especially from january to may these results indicate that output from swat ch is more sensitive to external meteorological conditions such as precipitation and evaporation as shown in fig 7 there is a violent fluctuation in the daily runoff series in the high flow period of the wet year 1996 with peak of 464 m3 s the average streamflow is 11 70 m3 s this phenomenon is closely related to the runoff mechanism in the swat ch model the soil moisture profile rapidly reaches saturation because of heavy rainfall which may decrease the initial abstraction capability of the watershed therefore the streamflow mechanism will shift from an excess infiltration runoff mechanism to a saturated runoff mechanism whereas the daily hydrological process of the swat model is relatively gentle with a peak of 98 05 m3 s and a mean streamflow of 11 38 m3 s the streamflow has little difference for the swat ch and swat models in non flood periods for a normal runoff year 1997 the streamflow trend of the swat ch model is analogous to that of the swat model in the flood period the peak is 12 43 and 13 04 m3 s for the swat ch model and swat models respectively however the streamflow simulation for the swat ch model significantly exceeds that of the swat model in the non flood period with the mean runoff of 2 89 and 1 90 m3 s respectively this can be affected by the high precipitation of the previous year 1996 which may lead to the soil being in a higher moisture status this higher moisture reduces the watershed initial ratio of rainfall and increases the surface runoff for the swat ch model compared to the swat model in the non flood period for this normal runoff year for the dry year 2002 the simulated total streamflow is generally consistent for the swat ch and swat models it can be clearly seen that the peak flow for the swat ch model is lower than that from the swat model the main reason is that rainfall intensity is considered in the swat ch model in this watershed precipitation and rainfall intensity are lower in a dry year than a wet year and a normal year which reduces the runoff peak from the swat ch model this consequence indicates that adding of rainfall intensity can effectively enhance the simulation flexibility and accuracy for a hydrological model such as swat ch 4 4 variation of different land uses land cover land use can be recognized as an important factor influencing the runoff distribution affected by the differences in precipitation evaporation interflow and groundwater water yield shows variation among different land use types in table 5 the water yield of grassland and forest land is higher than cropland and unused land especially in the high flow year of 1996 the water yield of forest land and grassland is 3 22 times and 2 78 times respectively that of cropland in the high flow year these proportions declined to 1 92 times and 1 61 times respectively in the normal flow year 1997 and increased to 7 73 times and 5 60 times in the low flow year 2002 respectively the main causes are as follows ①as the primary land uses in the chao river watershed forest land and grassland experience little disturbance by human activities therefore the infiltration intensity will be lower than for cropland which is influenced by agricultural cultivation practices ②although forest land and grassland have a capability for water storage the water storage ability is characterized by a significant threshold feature thus as precipitation increases the effectiveness of water storage declines for forest land and grassland the effectiveness of water storage is higher for forest land and grassland in low flow years than high flow years and normal flow years the water yield of a given land use obviously differs in normal flow years compared to high and low flow years as calculated by the swat and swat ch models generally water yield simulation using the swat ch model for forest land and cropland is 2 22 times and 1 43 times respectively that of the swat model this result illustrates that the modified water yield is higher for the swat ch model considering the soil moisture saturation slope and precipitation heterogeneity than in the original swat model forests have the ecological function of retaining runoff and purifying pollutants and land use roughness is used as an adjustment factor for the initial abstraction ratio of rainfall while the chao river watershed is in an earth rocky mountainous area thus the abstraction ratio of precipitation can be reduced to some extent which would in turn increase the streamflow production from different landscapes for instance forest land grassland and cropland systems the water yield capability of various land uses were seemingly contradictory to the normal circumstances in which unused land is characterized by the highest water yield followed by cropland grassland and forest land this phenomenon may be explained by the following two potential causes first the water yield difference was calculated based on an annual scale in the swat and swat ch models where the forest land and grassland are characterized by a stronger water storage capacity than cropland and unused land in an annual period this makes the soil moisture of forest land and grassland higher than the others therefore the annual mean water yield of forestland and grassland could exceed the other land use types under heavy rainfall especially in the high flow year on the other hand the unused land mainly consists of sandy land in the swat model configuration whose infiltration rate is higher within all landuse types the direct surface runoff and water yield was significantly reduced due to the rainfall interception and infiltration for the unused land 4 5 model uncertainty analysis as previously mentioned the total uncertainty can be decomposed into structure uncertainty input data uncertainty and parameter uncertainty jin et al 2010 in the case of the same external data total uncertainty would be simplified to only include structure uncertainty and parameter uncertainty monte carlo simulation with 2000 iterations was applied to evaluate the parameter uncertainty and structure uncertainty for both the swat and swat ch models as is listed in table 6 the parameter uncertainty of the modified swat ch model 91 00 is lower than that of the swat model 94 00 whereas the structure uncertainty of the swat ch model 9 00 is higher than that of the swat model 6 00 although the model algorithm was adjusted based on original the swat model parameter uncertainty is still the critical source of uncertainty in model prediction this is also the cause of equifinality effects of model parameters jiang et al 2017 xie and lian 2013 structure adjustment could reduce the parameter uncertainty to some extent while the calculation complexity was enhanced causing a relative structure uncertainty increase in the range of 3 00 for the model adaptability the result has been seen as acceptable when the criteria of br2 more than 0 60 krause et al 2005 in table 6 the adaptability of the swat ch model br2 94 01 is clearly higher than that of the original swat model br2 71 90 although both of the models are suitable for hydrological simulation in chao river watershed this means that the adaptability of the swat ch model has been significantly improved through revising the model algorithm of the original swat model as shown in fig 8 there is a strong temporal consistency in the prediction uncertainty between the swat ch and swat models the model output uncertainty is significantly positively correlated to rainfall volume p less than 0 05 which can be confirmed by other studies pang et al 2018 some scholars think that precipitation is the essential source of streamflow variation for hydrological models shen et al 2008 similarly melching et al 1990 found that the rainfall excess variability uncertainty was the dominant source of uncertainty in predictions of flood peaks therefore the prediction uncertainty for the wet season is higher than for the dry season by comparing the uncertainty ranges of the swat and swat ch models it can be found that the uncertainty of the swat model is higher than that of the swat ch model for hydrological simulation from table 6 it can clearly be seen that the r factors of the swat ch and swat models were 3 54 and 5 21 respectively indicating that the width of the uncertainty prediction of the swat ch model is less than that of the swat model in detail the mean width and the standard deviation of the 95 ppu 95 confidence interval of the streamflow prediction for the swat model are 44 29 and 45 69 m3 s respectively whereas the mean width and the standard deviation of the 95 ppu of the streamflow prediction of the swat ch model are 30 05 and 32 91 m3 s respectively it is obvious that the fluctuation of the predicted output is significantly reduced by revising the model algorithm the width and standard deviation of the 95 ppu was reduced by 32 15 and 44 97 respectively resulting from introducing the precipitation intensity maximum precipitation during 30 min in the modified swat ch model the chao river watershed is located in a monsoon climate zone with semi arid and semi humid features the relatively lower rainfall intensity and duration cause a smaller variation in the hydrology prediction in the swat ch model than in the swat model 5 conclusions a modified swat ch model was proposed considering the effects of the terrain slope and rainfall intensity on the runoff curve number and abstraction index ratio then it was applied to the chao river watershed of the upper watershed of the miyun reservoir in beijing china the result of model application shows that the swat ch model has perfect performance in monthly steam flow simulation compared with original swat model and the uncertainty range of streamflow prediction is to some extent also lowered in swat ch model especially in the wet year the primary conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the parameters sol k hru slp slsubbsn and canmx were recognized as the important parameters for the modified swat ch model 2 the swat ch model yielded better simulation performance than the swat model the nash sutcliffe efficiency for the swat ch model is 0 94 and 0 91 for the calibration and validation periods the kge efficiency is 0 83 and 0 84 and pbias is 4 55 and 7 00 respectively whereas the nash sutcliffe efficiency for the original the swat model is 0 92 and 0 73 for the calibration and validation periods the kge efficiency is 0 73 and 0 59 and pbias is 8 57 and 35 55 respectively 3 compared with the swat model the swat ch model can properly reproduce the streamflow process essentially for high flow conditions obvious differences in simulated runoff existed between the swat and swat ch models in the wet season at various temporal scales mainly influenced by the effects of soil water saturation affected by steep terrain natural land uses e g forest land and grassland become the main landscape type generating more surface streamflow than cropland the moisture storage capability of forest land and grassland will decrease in wet years reducing potential runoff storage compared to dry and normal years 4 parameter uncertainty has been recognized as the critical source of uncertainty in hydrological prediction in the chao river watershed the modified swat ch model can reduce the parameter uncertainty and relatively increase the structure uncertainty from 6 00 for the original swat model to 9 00 for the modified swat ch model on the other hand the adaptability of the swat ch model has been significantly improved from 71 90 to 94 01 of br2 through revising the model algorithms of the original swat model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

5348,the swat model is a semi distributed hydrological watershed model with an explicit physical mechanism which is widely applied in areas characterized by a wide variety of precipitation distributions and slope conditions however the soil conservation service curve number scs cn value and precipitation initial abstraction ratio were not related to slope soil moisture content precipitation intensity and land cover interception within the original swat model thus a modified scs cn model is proposed by considering the slope rainfall intensity soil moisture and interception effects of the landscape in this study specifically revising the critical sensitive parameters including cn2 and initial abstraction ratio λ the modified scs cn model was added to the original swat model and named the swat ch model which is applied to chao river watershed which experiences obvious differences in precipitation and slope for this application the daily streamflow was simulated for the calibration and validation periods of 1993 2005 and 2006 2013 respectively the simulated variable is monthly runoff at watershed outlet namely xiahui hydrological station the parameter sensitivity and uncertainty and the model applicability were analyzed using as chao river watershed as a case study the main results are as follows ① compared with the original swat model the parameters of sol k hru slp slsubbsn and canmx were identified as the most sensitive parameters for the runoff simulation in the new swat ch model ② the prediction efficiency of the swat ch model surpasses that of the original swat model the nash sutcliffe efficiency kge index and the pbias were 0 94 0 83 and 4 55 respectively for swat ch during the calibration stage while those corresponding indexes were 0 91 0 84 and 7 00 for the validation period the modified swat ch model can better reproduce the hydrological process than the swat model in detail the nash sutcliffe efficiency kge index and the pbias were improved by 0 02 0 10 4 01 percentage points for the calibration period as well as by 0 18 0 25 and 28 55 percentage points for the validation period in the modified swat ch model compared with the original swat model ③ influenced by soil moisture there is a substantial difference between the swat ch and swat models in wet periods at various temporal scales ④ parameter uncertainty is the main source of the uncertainty in hydrological estimation for the chao river watershed the modified swat ch model has to some extent reduced the effect of parameter uncertainty with increasing structure uncertainty from 6 00 for the swat model to 9 00 for the swat ch model the model adaptability has been enhanced by introducing terrace slope precipitation intensity and soil moisture for the modification of cn2 and the abstraction ratio which makes the revised swat ch model have better simulation performance in areas with the obvious characteristics of terrain rainfall heterogeneity and drastic dry wet cycles in the soil profile keywords swat slope precipitation intensity parameter sensitivity uncertainty adaptability 1 introduction affected by drastic land use change and climate change the global surface water environment has been increasingly disturbed kirby et al 2016 worku et al 2017 with the combined influence of meteorological and social economic conditions it has become a complex issue to precisely quantify the spatial temporal distribution and characteristics of water resources in the field of hydrological research and water resources management thus it is essential to reasonably evaluate the distribution characteristics of water resources to increase the water utilization rate and achieve sustainable use of water resources hydrological simulation which is based on numerical simulation is one of the most important and effective approaches for hydrological analysis flood prediction and the evaluation and management of water resources hydrological models can describe the complex surface hydrological cycle process which makes models effective tools for examining hydrological phenomenon and processes widely used hydrological models include topmodel a topography based hydrological model metcalfe et al 2015 hspf hydrological simulation program fortran berndt et al 2016 swmm storm water management model zhang et al 2018 slurp semi land use runoff program shin et al 2016 mike she mike system hydrologic european zhang et al 2015 xinanjiang model zhao and liu 1995 and swat soil and water assessment tool gassman et al 2007 among the aforementioned models the swat model is a daily time step hydrological model based on the soil conservation service curve number scs cn module and the green and ampt module for runoff computation major functions for swat is evaluating the long term comprehensive effects of climate change land use change and agricultural management practices on streamflow and water quality muenich et al 2016 the swat model has various sub modules for instance the hydrological module sediment module nutrient module crop growth module and agricultural practices module the swat model has been applied to different research fields including watershed hydrology abbaspour et al 2015 soil erosion evaluation wellen et al 2014 agricultural nonpoint source pollution wang et al 2018a b evaluation and allocation of agricultural best management practices bmps panagopoulos et al 2012 and assessment of ecosystem services functions francesconi et al 2016 as the fundamental module in the swat model the accuracy of the hydrological module is most important to the transport and transformation of pollutants e g sediment nutrients and insecticides surface runoff interflow groundwater runoff and evaporation processes are simulated in the swat model because of the differences in terrain and hydrology factors i e slope variation precipitation intensity soil moisture etc the original swat model is not completely suited to all watershed circumstances over the world resulting in simulations with notable uncertainty kim and lee 2008 vigiak et al 2015 jiao et al 2017 given the model limitations various model modification research has been done by scholars considering the effects of soil moisture groundwater snowmelt and streamflow generation for example a modified swat version named swat g was constructed for overcoming problems with higher baseflow contributions the swat g model was tested in a mountainous basin with a thin soil profile showing good adaptability with a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mccuen et al 2006 of 0 76 against 0 17 for the original swat model eckhardt et al 2002 considering the effect of agricultural irrigation on groundwater a nonlinear groundwater module was designed and integrated into the swat model for the karst topography of southwestern china wang and brubaker 2014 a groundwater evaporation module was revised and integrated into the swat model based on long term observation data in this sub module the evaporation coefficient of shallow groundwater was rewritten as a function of groundwater depth soil moisture and crop roots luo et al 2008 snowmelt runoff is one of the principal runoff components in snow covered areas qi et al 2017 developed a novel snowmelt module with an energy conservation methodology basis instead of the temperature based snowmelt module meng et al 2014 proposed a physically based snowmelt moisture added to the original swat model surface runoff generation is an essential component in the swat model where the scs cn or green ampt method is utilized for daily streamflow simulation in the scs cn module the curve number cn2 has been recognized as the most critical comprehensive parameter which is strongly sensitive in the hydrological process simulation in the swat model zhang and huang 2011 previous studies have shown that the cn2 is affected not only by soil antecedent moisture content but also the precipitation volume in given day van liew and garbrecht 2003 kim and lee 2008 a temporal weighted average cn twa cn algorithm was introduced for improving the streamflow simulation in swat kim and lee 2008 the flood calculation method was adjusted based on the actual peak flow transport mechanism the revised methodology has the capability to make peak flow and baseflow match observations well and reduce the lag effect between simulated peak flow and observed peak flow lv et al 2014 rajib and merwade 2016 have put forward a soil moisture based cn method sma cn increasing the simulation performance to a large extent shi et al 2017 have optimized the scs cn module considering the effect of storm duration and soil antecedent moisture content the results showing that the modified algorithm has better simulation performance than original swat model the initial abstraction ratio has also proven to be an important parameter for surface runoff generation in the classical scs cn module the initial abstraction ratio was set as a constant equaling 0 20 yet the initial abstraction ratio should be calibrated according the actual rainfall runoff monitoring data fu et al 2011 shi et al 2009 in fact the slope variation is the important factor controlling the runoff generation xin et al 2019 specifically the cn2 and initial abstraction ratio are closely associated with the slope condition in the original scs cn model the effect of slope on the initial abstraction ratio was not emphasized which may make it unsuitable for hydrological simulation for steep watersheds meanwhile asian monsoon climate areas have greatly heterogeneous precipitation differing from north american conditions the rainfall intensity perhaps has a more obvious influence than the precipitation volume this can partially explain the low accuracy of runoff simulation in the original classical swat model for some watersheds the miyun reservoir is the primary surface drinking water supply for beijing since 1999 the streamflow has been drastically reduced for this reservoir because of climate change and human activities pang and wang 2016 water shortage has become one of the conditions constraining economic development around beijing because of the environmental difference between study watershed and the area of the original scs cn model development the application of universal hydrological models may be questionable for various underlying conditions in the present study the swat ch model was developed and tested considering the slope and precipitation intensity effects on the cn for the chao river watershed north of beijing this paper is organized as follows ①the modified flow chart is depicted and described along with the major processes for the swat model ②the difference in parameter sensitivity is examined between the swat and swat ch models ③the simulation performance was evaluated for the swat ch model in calibration and validation periods ④the hydrological difference was compared for both the swat and swat ch models for various temporal scales and land use types ⑤the model uncertainty is investigated including model parameter uncertainty and model structure uncertainty 2 modification of the swat model 2 1 swat model the swat model developed by the u s department of agriculture in 1994 is a semi distributed watershed model with an explicit physical mechanism which can simulate continuous daily outputs of flow and water quality abbaspour et al 2015 in applications of the swat model the stream structure is first extracted using the terrain data digital elevation model dem and the whole basin is divided into several sub watersheds then the hydrological response units hrus are generated by overlaying land use types soils map and slope distribution the hrus comprise the basic calculation unit of the swat model the input data includes daily meteorological data rainfall temperature wind speed relative humanity and solar radiation and agricultural management practice information cultivation method crop types fertilization irrigation and harvest schedule the output of spatial files is categorized into three types namely sub watershed scale tributary scale and hru scale meanwhile the temporal resolution of swat output also includes three scales yearly monthly and daily 2 2 hydrological water balance the swat model consists of the hydrology module soil erosion module nutrient module insecticide module and crop growth module where the hydrology module is the basic module affecting all other sub modules the hydrology module simulates the rainfall runoff processes snowmelt soil interflow evapotranspiration and soil water seepage the rainfall runoff process results in direct discharge into main channel after interception seepage and evaporation affect the precipitation the direct runoff is one of the most important components of swat hydrology simulation in the swat model the hydrological process satisfies the law of water conservation expressed as follows 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw t is the soil moisture content at t time mm sw0 is the initial soil moisture content mm t refers to time with units of days ｒday is the precipitation depth mm on the ith day qsurf is surface runoff mm on the ith day ea is the evapotranspiration mm on the ith day wweep is the soil water seepage mm from the vadose zone into the soil profile and qgw is the groundwater volume mm returning to main channel on the ith day in the swat model the direct runoff is calculated with the scs cn or green and ampt modules of the two modules the green and ampt module requires hourly precipitation and temperature for simulating the streamflow hourly meteorological input data often is not available especially for large scale watersheds which has restricted the application of the green and ampt module bauwe et al 2016 compared with the green and ampt module the scs cn module is suitable for simulating daily runoff only using the daily precipitation data which is applied in various swat versions for streamflow calculation the scs cn model embraces two critical parameters namely the runoff curve number cn2 and initial abstraction ratio λ the computation procedure is as follows 2 r p λ s 2 p 1 λ s p λ s 0 p λ s 3 s 25400 cn 254 where r is the surface runoff mm p is precipitation mm p r s is the water storage capacity mm of different land use and soil types the cn value is an index of the water storage coefficient of the soil profile and λis the initial abstraction ratio dimensionless in the original scs cn model λwas assumed as a constant value 0 20 including the effect of canopy interception and soil pore storage volume from the aforementioned formulations it can be seen that the original scs cn model can only be applied to gently sloped agricultural watersheds with even i e fairly uniform rainfall like the watersheds for which it was presumably derived because the parameters cn2 and λ do not change with terrain and precipitation distribution especially the original scs cn model cannot simulate the hydrological characteristics in a forest dominated basin with strong heterogeneous slope and rainfall variation for example ponce and hawkins 1996 noted the original scs cn method has yielded poor performance for forest sites in view of this a modified scs cn model was proposed combining the effect of precipitation intensity and terrain on cn2 and the influence of land roughness soil moisture content and slope on λ the technical approach of the scs cn modification is shown in fig 1 2 3 modification of the scs cn method 2 3 1 modification of cn2 it is clear that cn2 is the most sensitive parameter in the swat model thus it is essential to choose a suitable cn2 value for improving the performance of the hydrological simulation fu et al 2013 however cn2 is a comprehensive watershed parameter related to land use type soil type and soil moisture condition moreover cn2 is strongly affected by precipitation intensity and underlying surface slope thus ignoring the effects of rainfall intensity and terrain could cause a significant runoff simulation deviation especially in two zones with different soil types land uses and vegetation covers this can be explained by the following reasons first the classical cn2 was presumably developed for gentle plots with slopes less than 5 00 yet the simulation performance could be reduced for steep areas so to enhance the prediction ability of the scs cn model for different slope conditions several modifications of the cn value have been proposed according to the slope condition for example williams et al 2011 have proposed a modified cn algorithm for all different slope conditions huang et al 2006 put forward an adjusted cn for the loess plateau in china eq 4 the rainfall intensity also is an important external factor determining the cn value the original scs cn model uses the precipitation volume to predict runoff which does not consider the effect of rainfall intensity and duration on the runoff generation capacity tasdighi et al 2018 jiao et al 2017 indicated that runoff and soil erosion are linked to the maximum precipitation volume during 30 min and a new concept of cn formulation was developed based on the rainfall intensity eq 5 jiao et al 2017 for simplification of the modeling a hypothesis is proposed where the effects of slope and rainfall intensity on the cn value are independent even though it is possible that those two factors to a certain degree are interdependent according to the aforementioned assumption a new cn module is proposed by combining eqs 4 and 5 as shown in eq 6 4 cn sl c n 15 63 s l o p e 322 79 slope 323 52 5 cn sp a c n p 30 p b 6 cn s a c n 15 63 s l o p e 322 79 slope 323 52 p 30 p b where cn sl cn sp and cn s are the modified cn values for slope precipitation intensity and both factors respectively cn is the original cn value not adjusted by slope and rainfall intensity slope is the terrain with the unit of percentage gratitude p is the daily rainfall volume and p30 is maximum precipitation volume during a 30 min period mm obtained by the experimental formula of p30 simulation based on daily precipitation volume in the original swat weather generator schuol and abbaspour 2007 which is documented in the swat theoretical documentation version 2009 by neitsch et al 2011 theoretically the term of a and b can be seen as calibrated parameters in the model application on the other hand some field experiments also can be adopted in same watershed or catchment to determine the value of a and b thus based on the results for the shixia catchment in the miyun district of beijing a and b were 1 474 and 0 4862 respectively jiao et al 2017 2 3 2 modification of the λ value some research has revealed that the initial abstraction ratio λ is the other sensitive parameter in the scs cn model whose sensitivity rank is higher than that of the cn value deng et al 2018 generally λ is set as 0 20 in the original scs cn model suiting zones with slopes no more than 5 00 ajmal et al 2015 but the value of λ perhaps is not a constant varying as the slope changes so it is necessary to adjust λ with slope in a specific area ponce and hawkins 1996 it has been reported that λ has a negative exponential relation with slope zhang et al 2008 here the slope adjustment factor for λ by slope is given in eq 7 7 f s l o p e e 0 083 s l o p e where the term of slope is the average slope of the hrus with units of degrees the precipitation has significant seasonal variation in monsoon climate zones in dry periods the value of λis relatively higher than in the rainy season because of lower soil moisture saturation which leads to reduced runoff when the runoff generation is dominated by the excess runoff mechanism during the rainy season the soil profile gradually approaches saturation resulting in smaller λ values and the streamflow is characterized by saturation runoff in this paper a novel soil water adjustment factor is proposed termed f w profile in eq 8 what can be seen is that the f w profile will tend toward zero when the soil water content is saturated as expressed in eq 8 the factor of f w profile is designed to adjust the initial abstraction ratio λ other than the cn2 in classical scs cn model because of its ignorance of soil moisture variation over time therefore the value of λ can be modified by soil moisture content in the day before 8 f w profile 1 w profile w fc where w profile is the water content of the soil profile mm and w fc is maximum field capacity of the soil profile mm different land use distributions also have influenced the initial abstraction ratio λ but this influence has been omitted in the original swat model this may result in different amounts of interception for different land use types in fact grassland and forest land surfaces are coarse and need more precipitation volume to satisfy the retention and infiltration processes therefore the value of λ frequently is higher in grassland and forest land than other land covers further the λ of cropland could be more than that of bare land and urban land for this aspect a factor for λ is developed associated with land use as shown in eq 9 in this equation the factor is expressed as a power function of the manning s roughness coefficient n ratio between cropland and various land use types the main manning coefficient for different land uses are listed in table 1 9 f l a n d u s e n landuse n cropland 0 60 where n landuse and n cropland are the manning s roughness coefficients for the land use type of interest and cropland respectively as previously mentioned the default value of λ is 0 20 in the swat model which is treated as the maximum theoretical value for the initial abstraction ratio namely λ max 0 20 in summary an amended formulation for λ is proposed considering the slope soil moisture content and land use effects as shown in eq 10 10 λ f l a n d u s e f w profile f s l o p e λ max where the λ is the modified initial abstraction ratio for precipitation in order to integrate the revised equations into the swat model the source files of the swat2012 model were downloaded from the official website of the swat model https swat tamu edu then related code files were rewritten and compiled involving the files parm f allocate parms f surq daycn f and surface f in the fortran language 2 4 accuracy assessment of the model model performance assessment is essential to model selection and utilization the common criteria for model evaluation include the nash and sutcliffe 1970 efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and percent bias pbias those three methods were used to compare the result accuracy between model simulation and field observations the three criteria are computed as follows 11 n s e 1 i 1 n q i s i 2 i 1 n q i q avg 2 12 k g e 1 r sim o b s 1 2 sd s i m sd o b s 1 2 mean s i m q a v g 1 2 13 p b i a s i 1 n q i s i 2 100 i 1 n q i 2 where si qi and qavg are model simulated value at time i observed data at time i and average of the observations respectively n is time span for model simulation r sim o b s is the correlation coefficient between simulated and observed values sd s i m and sd obs are the standard deviations of simulated and observed values respectively and finally mean s i m is average of the simulated values theoretically the nse and kge range from to 1 the simulation results tend to be perfect when the nse or kge approaches 1 the simulation result is accepted with a small pbias for the hydrological simulation the simulation results will be acceptable when nse or kge is more than 0 50 as well as the absolute pbias is less than 15 0 in order to further assess the effect of model structure change on prediction uncertainty a criterion is considered for evaluating the model structure uncertainty all of the uncertain factors can be expressed as the parameter uncertainty including input data model structure assumptions and model parameters guo et al 2014 hence the p factor could be defined to explain the contribution of parameter uncertainty to total model prediction uncertainty the p factor also is called the proposed 95 confidence interval 95 ppu ranging from 0 to 1 which can describe the ratio of the direct observations in 95 ppu guo et al 2014 when the p value is 0 it means that the parameter uncertainty has little influence on model simulation and structure uncertainty and input data are the most critical reasons for model simulation uncertainty whereas when the p value equals 100 0 it means that parameter uncertainty is the only source causing the model simulation uncertainty it can be concluded that the higher the p value is the more significant the parameter uncertainty in the case of the same input data the model structure uncertainty is defined as ps which is expressed as ps 1 p to characterize the effect of parameter variation on the prediction results this paper uses the r factor defined as the quotient of 95 ppu width and the deviation of the prediction to the observation which is greater than or equal to 0 due to the error existing in the model structure and the observations however the simulation cannot strictly match the observed data therefore the calculation result must satisfy the following two constraints first the nse and kge exceed 0 50 meanwhile the pbias must less than 15 0 then the p value should more than 0 70 which means that more than 70 00 of the observed data falls into the 95 ppu interval 2 5 detection of point of discontinuity in hydrological serial in some studies on hydrological model calibration the determination of calibration and validation period is arbitrary action without definite theoretical support thus the reliability of model performance might be lowered especially for the hydrological parameters with a high temporal variation fortunately the mann kendall test can be utilized to find the trend and discontinuity of calibrated data serial which can be used as division basis for calibration and validation periods in details if the hydrological data serial has several discontinuity points implying that different hydrology mechanisms were identified in historical hydrological serial the individual sub serials were regarded as calibration and validation set respectively the algorithm of mann kendal was documented in some literatures hamed 2008 kisi and ay 2014 in this method two main statistical parameters were critical for data trend distinction named uf and ub which is the sequence serial and inverted sequence serial for the rank information of raw hydrological data respectively the time was treated as the discontinuity point where the uf and ub curve have crossed in the specific range of significance level 3 application of the swat ch model 3 1 description of the study area the chao river watershed 116 87 117 34 e 40 20 41 27 n is located northeast of beijing the length of the main channel is about 239 5 km with a total drainage area of 4888 km2 this watershed includes 3 counties and 24 towns involving the miyun district luanping county and fengning county fig 2 the climate type is a classical temperate continental monsoon climate with annual mean precipitation of 494 mm mainly concentrating between june and september the main soils are brown earth and cinnamon soil accounting for 80 0 of the total watershed area the vegetation type is dominated by mixed forest according to the census of 2015 the total population in this watershed is about 370 000 with a population density of 76 people per ha agricultural plants and livestock are the main source of livelihood in this watershed the main crops include maize and wheat and the livestock types consist of sheep pigs poultry and large animals extensive agricultural management has lasted for a long period with mean fertilizer application of 225 300 kg ha influenced by ecological restoration construction of water resource facilities and agricultural development the streamflow has been significantly reduced for five decades especially after 1999 qin et al 2018 3 2 scenario settings to compare the model performance before and after modification two simulations were done including the original swat model and the modified swat ch model considering the slope and rainfall intensity adjustments the chao river watershed was used as study case area to test the performance improvement of the swat modification work 3 3 source of study data the research data include a digital elevation model dem land use land cover soil type meteorological data hydrological data and related agricultural management information listed in table 2 all of the spatial data were projected as wgs 1984 utm zone 50n to unify the geographic reference and projections of the various spatial data 4 results and discussion 4 1 parameter sensitivity a total of 17 parameters are selected for sensitivity analysis in the swat model in this paper based on published research table 3 the sufi 2 algorithm integrated in the swat cup calibration and uncertainty program for the swat model software is utilized for the parameter sensitivity analysis for both the swat and swat ch models this algorithm was executed for 2000 iterations and the sensitivity rank was identified from the p value and t stat of the two indexes the parameter sensitivity was recognized as a high rank with a small p value and a bigger absolute t stat value in the original swat model six parameters were discerned as sensitive parameters in the hydrological module namely cn2 sol k alpha bnk canmx hru slp and slsubbsn what can be seen is that cn2 is the most sensitive parameter for streamflow simulation in the original swat model this result is consistent with other reports boughton 1989 found that a cn variation of 10 would lead to a range of 45 to 55 of runoff fluctuation moreover the parameters sol k alpha bnk canmx hru slp and slsubbsn also were important external factors affecting streamflow prediction which is confirmed by existing research zadeh et al 2017 for the swat ch model the sensitive parameters include sol k hru slp slsubbsn canmx alpha bnk gwqmn and esco and sol k hru slp slsubbsn canmx and alpha bnk were identified the common parameters sensitive for both the swat and swat ch models however the sensitivity rank is markedly different for those parameters in the swat and swat ch models specifically sol k hru slp slsubbsn canmx and alpha bnk were in order the top five ranked parameters in the swat ch model yet those parameters are the second fifth sixth fourth and third ranked parameters respectively in the swat model so the change in sensitivity is related with the modification of the model algorithm especially for the parameters sol k hru slp slsubbsn and anmx soil moisture has a dry wet cycle over the entire hydrological year in the chao river watershed with a typical a semi arid drainage the soil saturation level was used as an adjustment factor for the initial abstraction ratio in the modified swat ch model sol k can regulate soil moisture content which may further influence the change of streamflow volume the slope ranges from 0 00 to 235 59 with a mean slope of 24 93 in the watershed this value differs from the suitable mean slope of the original swat model 5 00 the swat ch model can revise the cn2 value and the initial abstraction ratio of rainfall comparing the original model structure cn2 increases and the initial abstraction ratio decreases as the slope becomes steep thus the parameter hru slp is an important variable controlling streamflow generation for mountainous watersheds grassland and forest land are the most common land use types which account for over 80 0 of the total watershed area the canopy has redistributed the spatial temporal pattern of precipitation this makes canmx a critical parameter for the chao river watershed 4 2 model calibration and validation the determination of calibration and validation periods affects the prediction accuracy of model simulation but the selection of calibration and validation periods is subject to the experience of the model user with some amount of subjectivity therefore it is essential to scientifically define the calibration and validation periods to properly determine the improvement in the simulation performance for the hydrological model in this study the mann kendall test was applied to discern the change point during the total runoff series which is used to divide the series into calibration and validation sub series the monthly streamflow of the chao river watershed has experienced three different stages from 1993 to 2013 in detail the runoff series has slightly increased for 1993 to 1998 sharply declined 1999 2004 and slowly rebounded 2005 2013 as is shown in fig 3 the uf curve has surpassed the lower limits of the 95 and 99 confidence limits e g 1 96 and 2 32 in april and june of 2000 respectively this indicates that the decreasing trend of streamflow has increased for the watershed since june 2000 yet the trend of streamflow shifted from decreasing to increasing in june of 2004 overall the streamflow has experienced an obvious decline before 2004 which turned to a steady increasing trend after 2004 which shows that 2004 can be seen as change point in the runoff series for the chao river watershed then the total streamflow was divided into two parts recognized as calibration and validation stages namely sub series a 1993 2004 and sub series b 2005 2013 respectively in this paper the sufi 2 algorithm was applied to calibrate the swat and swat ch models based on the monthly streamflow data at the xiahui hydrological station from 1993 to 2013 according to the result of the change point test of mann kendall the warm up period is defined as 1990 1992 and the calibration and validation periods defined as 1993 2004 and 2005 2013 respectively the initial calibrated parameter intervals were determined based on the swat cup manual and related literature arabi et al 2007 qiu et al 2018 the optimal parameter values were fixed after several iterations in which 500 simulations were done the optimal parameters are listed in table 4 the differences in the parameter values for the swat and swat ch models reflects the changes in model structure for the swat ch model which then necessitates changes in the optimal value of parameters that are common to both models for the swat model the nse is 0 92 and 0 73 the kge is 0 73 and 0 59 and the pbias is 8 57 and 35 55 in the calibration and validation periods respectively the nse efficiency for the swat ch model is 0 94 and 0 91 kge is 0 83 and 0 84 and the pbias is 4 56 and 7 00 in the calibration and validation periods respectively clearly both the swat and swat ch models have satisfied the accuracy requirements for acceptable model simulation moriasi et al 2007 however the performance of the swat ch model is better than that of the swat model especially in term of the kge efficiency all of the criteria for the swat ch model surpass those of the swat model in the validation period for the pbias simulation using the swat model cannot be accepted due to the large pbias 35 55 in the validation period on the other hand the parameters show an obvious disparity between the calibration results of the swat and swat ch models including ch k2 sol awc alpha bf and revapmn this may be attributed to the fact that the swat and swat ch models were separately optimized with the related parameters in the reasonable range therefore equifinality is inevitable in the calibration process of hydrological models in other words a lot of parameter combinations seldom a single combination can reach a satisfactory model performance her and chaubey 2015 as is shown in fig 4 the streamflow process has a significant fluctuation in the calibration period although the performance of the swat and swat ch models was similar especially in the dry period e g 1999 2004 compared with the swat model for the validation period the simulated flow from the swat ch model matched well with observed flows the nse of the swat ch model 0 91 is better than that of the swat model 0 73 in the validation period this can be explained because runoff has significantly reduced since 1999 while the precipitation doesn t show an obvious declining trend this difference in trends perhaps makes the simulated value of streamflow relatively higher for the original swat model whereas the rainfall intensity maximum precipitation during a 30 min period is considered in the modified swat ch model which could decrease the peak volume improving the simulation ability compared to the original swat model in other words the original swat model might not be appropriate for applications to a basin with strong heterogeneity of terrain and precipitation whereas the modified swat ch model may be suitable for hydrological simulation to reproduce the actual streamflow process in such watersheds ideally it is desirable to have a calibration period with more year to year variability in rainfall and runoff than in the current calibration period of 1993 to 2004 because a small variation over the calibration period may affect the robustness of the calibrated model when applied to other periods this can be seen for the case of the original swat model that has markedly poorer performance for the validation period which experiences higher variability in the rainfall and runoff compared to the calibration period the original swat model has less flexibility to adjust for changes in storm intensity than the swat ch model and the calibrated parameters thus are more tied to the period of lower variability in runoff however the fact that the swat ch model performs equally well for both the calibration and validation periods indicates that because this model considers storm intensity it is more flexible than the original swat model to handle differences in the rainfall and runoff in the periods to be simulated compared to the calibration period therefore the good results for calibration and validation provide strong support for the usefulness of the swat ch model 4 3 variation of different hydrological periods in order to evaluate the temporal adaptability of the swat ch model this model was tested at different temporal scales consisting of daily monthly and annual scales then the hydrological variation was determined for both the swat and swat ch models on the annual scale fig 5 the annual streamflow from the swat ch model is generally higher than that from the swat model in detail the simulated runoff in swat ch surpasses that from swat in wet years for instance this runoff difference between the swat ch and swat models is about 13 56 18 32 and 26 28 in the wet years of 1994 2005 and 2010 respectively yet the streamflow simulation of the two model versions doesn t show a significant variation in dry years e g 2000 2002 and 2007 this demonstrates that the structure modification yields little effect on improvement in dry years in the modified scs cn module antecedent soil moisture and precipitation are the most important parameters the soil moisture will be tend to high in wet years with more rainfall than dry years which in turn directly increases surface direct runoff at the monthly scale runoff simulation from the swat ch model exceeds that of the swat model in the monsoon flood period june to october whereas the streamflow simulation of the two models has little difference in the non monsoon non flood months as shown in fig 6 the streamflow volume for the swat and swat ch models match well before june this can be explained by the fact that rainfall is the main source of streamflow in the chao river watershed and the precipitation is mainly distributed in the flood period this means those months with little rainfall result in lower soil moisture content in the non flood period as precipitation increases the moisture content of the soil profile tends to be saturated in the flood period the runoff retention capability of the soil profile decreases causing runoff generation to increase from july to october from the runoff variability the coefficient of variation cv of simulated runoff from the swat ch model is higher than that from the swat model with the difference in the cv for the two models over 25 especially from january to may these results indicate that output from swat ch is more sensitive to external meteorological conditions such as precipitation and evaporation as shown in fig 7 there is a violent fluctuation in the daily runoff series in the high flow period of the wet year 1996 with peak of 464 m3 s the average streamflow is 11 70 m3 s this phenomenon is closely related to the runoff mechanism in the swat ch model the soil moisture profile rapidly reaches saturation because of heavy rainfall which may decrease the initial abstraction capability of the watershed therefore the streamflow mechanism will shift from an excess infiltration runoff mechanism to a saturated runoff mechanism whereas the daily hydrological process of the swat model is relatively gentle with a peak of 98 05 m3 s and a mean streamflow of 11 38 m3 s the streamflow has little difference for the swat ch and swat models in non flood periods for a normal runoff year 1997 the streamflow trend of the swat ch model is analogous to that of the swat model in the flood period the peak is 12 43 and 13 04 m3 s for the swat ch model and swat models respectively however the streamflow simulation for the swat ch model significantly exceeds that of the swat model in the non flood period with the mean runoff of 2 89 and 1 90 m3 s respectively this can be affected by the high precipitation of the previous year 1996 which may lead to the soil being in a higher moisture status this higher moisture reduces the watershed initial ratio of rainfall and increases the surface runoff for the swat ch model compared to the swat model in the non flood period for this normal runoff year for the dry year 2002 the simulated total streamflow is generally consistent for the swat ch and swat models it can be clearly seen that the peak flow for the swat ch model is lower than that from the swat model the main reason is that rainfall intensity is considered in the swat ch model in this watershed precipitation and rainfall intensity are lower in a dry year than a wet year and a normal year which reduces the runoff peak from the swat ch model this consequence indicates that adding of rainfall intensity can effectively enhance the simulation flexibility and accuracy for a hydrological model such as swat ch 4 4 variation of different land uses land cover land use can be recognized as an important factor influencing the runoff distribution affected by the differences in precipitation evaporation interflow and groundwater water yield shows variation among different land use types in table 5 the water yield of grassland and forest land is higher than cropland and unused land especially in the high flow year of 1996 the water yield of forest land and grassland is 3 22 times and 2 78 times respectively that of cropland in the high flow year these proportions declined to 1 92 times and 1 61 times respectively in the normal flow year 1997 and increased to 7 73 times and 5 60 times in the low flow year 2002 respectively the main causes are as follows ①as the primary land uses in the chao river watershed forest land and grassland experience little disturbance by human activities therefore the infiltration intensity will be lower than for cropland which is influenced by agricultural cultivation practices ②although forest land and grassland have a capability for water storage the water storage ability is characterized by a significant threshold feature thus as precipitation increases the effectiveness of water storage declines for forest land and grassland the effectiveness of water storage is higher for forest land and grassland in low flow years than high flow years and normal flow years the water yield of a given land use obviously differs in normal flow years compared to high and low flow years as calculated by the swat and swat ch models generally water yield simulation using the swat ch model for forest land and cropland is 2 22 times and 1 43 times respectively that of the swat model this result illustrates that the modified water yield is higher for the swat ch model considering the soil moisture saturation slope and precipitation heterogeneity than in the original swat model forests have the ecological function of retaining runoff and purifying pollutants and land use roughness is used as an adjustment factor for the initial abstraction ratio of rainfall while the chao river watershed is in an earth rocky mountainous area thus the abstraction ratio of precipitation can be reduced to some extent which would in turn increase the streamflow production from different landscapes for instance forest land grassland and cropland systems the water yield capability of various land uses were seemingly contradictory to the normal circumstances in which unused land is characterized by the highest water yield followed by cropland grassland and forest land this phenomenon may be explained by the following two potential causes first the water yield difference was calculated based on an annual scale in the swat and swat ch models where the forest land and grassland are characterized by a stronger water storage capacity than cropland and unused land in an annual period this makes the soil moisture of forest land and grassland higher than the others therefore the annual mean water yield of forestland and grassland could exceed the other land use types under heavy rainfall especially in the high flow year on the other hand the unused land mainly consists of sandy land in the swat model configuration whose infiltration rate is higher within all landuse types the direct surface runoff and water yield was significantly reduced due to the rainfall interception and infiltration for the unused land 4 5 model uncertainty analysis as previously mentioned the total uncertainty can be decomposed into structure uncertainty input data uncertainty and parameter uncertainty jin et al 2010 in the case of the same external data total uncertainty would be simplified to only include structure uncertainty and parameter uncertainty monte carlo simulation with 2000 iterations was applied to evaluate the parameter uncertainty and structure uncertainty for both the swat and swat ch models as is listed in table 6 the parameter uncertainty of the modified swat ch model 91 00 is lower than that of the swat model 94 00 whereas the structure uncertainty of the swat ch model 9 00 is higher than that of the swat model 6 00 although the model algorithm was adjusted based on original the swat model parameter uncertainty is still the critical source of uncertainty in model prediction this is also the cause of equifinality effects of model parameters jiang et al 2017 xie and lian 2013 structure adjustment could reduce the parameter uncertainty to some extent while the calculation complexity was enhanced causing a relative structure uncertainty increase in the range of 3 00 for the model adaptability the result has been seen as acceptable when the criteria of br2 more than 0 60 krause et al 2005 in table 6 the adaptability of the swat ch model br2 94 01 is clearly higher than that of the original swat model br2 71 90 although both of the models are suitable for hydrological simulation in chao river watershed this means that the adaptability of the swat ch model has been significantly improved through revising the model algorithm of the original swat model as shown in fig 8 there is a strong temporal consistency in the prediction uncertainty between the swat ch and swat models the model output uncertainty is significantly positively correlated to rainfall volume p less than 0 05 which can be confirmed by other studies pang et al 2018 some scholars think that precipitation is the essential source of streamflow variation for hydrological models shen et al 2008 similarly melching et al 1990 found that the rainfall excess variability uncertainty was the dominant source of uncertainty in predictions of flood peaks therefore the prediction uncertainty for the wet season is higher than for the dry season by comparing the uncertainty ranges of the swat and swat ch models it can be found that the uncertainty of the swat model is higher than that of the swat ch model for hydrological simulation from table 6 it can clearly be seen that the r factors of the swat ch and swat models were 3 54 and 5 21 respectively indicating that the width of the uncertainty prediction of the swat ch model is less than that of the swat model in detail the mean width and the standard deviation of the 95 ppu 95 confidence interval of the streamflow prediction for the swat model are 44 29 and 45 69 m3 s respectively whereas the mean width and the standard deviation of the 95 ppu of the streamflow prediction of the swat ch model are 30 05 and 32 91 m3 s respectively it is obvious that the fluctuation of the predicted output is significantly reduced by revising the model algorithm the width and standard deviation of the 95 ppu was reduced by 32 15 and 44 97 respectively resulting from introducing the precipitation intensity maximum precipitation during 30 min in the modified swat ch model the chao river watershed is located in a monsoon climate zone with semi arid and semi humid features the relatively lower rainfall intensity and duration cause a smaller variation in the hydrology prediction in the swat ch model than in the swat model 5 conclusions a modified swat ch model was proposed considering the effects of the terrain slope and rainfall intensity on the runoff curve number and abstraction index ratio then it was applied to the chao river watershed of the upper watershed of the miyun reservoir in beijing china the result of model application shows that the swat ch model has perfect performance in monthly steam flow simulation compared with original swat model and the uncertainty range of streamflow prediction is to some extent also lowered in swat ch model especially in the wet year the primary conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the parameters sol k hru slp slsubbsn and canmx were recognized as the important parameters for the modified swat ch model 2 the swat ch model yielded better simulation performance than the swat model the nash sutcliffe efficiency for the swat ch model is 0 94 and 0 91 for the calibration and validation periods the kge efficiency is 0 83 and 0 84 and pbias is 4 55 and 7 00 respectively whereas the nash sutcliffe efficiency for the original the swat model is 0 92 and 0 73 for the calibration and validation periods the kge efficiency is 0 73 and 0 59 and pbias is 8 57 and 35 55 respectively 3 compared with the swat model the swat ch model can properly reproduce the streamflow process essentially for high flow conditions obvious differences in simulated runoff existed between the swat and swat ch models in the wet season at various temporal scales mainly influenced by the effects of soil water saturation affected by steep terrain natural land uses e g forest land and grassland become the main landscape type generating more surface streamflow than cropland the moisture storage capability of forest land and grassland will decrease in wet years reducing potential runoff storage compared to dry and normal years 4 parameter uncertainty has been recognized as the critical source of uncertainty in hydrological prediction in the chao river watershed the modified swat ch model can reduce the parameter uncertainty and relatively increase the structure uncertainty from 6 00 for the original swat model to 9 00 for the modified swat ch model on the other hand the adaptability of the swat ch model has been significantly improved from 71 90 to 94 01 of br2 through revising the model algorithms of the original swat model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

5349,as important sensitive feedback of ecosystems spatial distribution and patterns of vegetation can remarkably reflect eco environmental conditions in arid and semiarid areas where groundwater plays a significant role the impact of groundwater depth gd on the spatial variance in remote sensing vegetation index is highlighted in this study over the ordos plateau china the 250 m resolution mean annual enhanced vegetation index evi data are analyzed and compared to the same resolution data of altitude air temperature aridity index and gd a linear regression analysis indicates a significant weak correlation between the evi and the climatic and topographic controls at the regional scale a semivariogram analysis is introduced to quantify the gd dependent variance in the residual evi w evi filtered from this linear regression the pixel to pixel dependency of w evi on gd is nonlinear and significant only when gd is smaller than 10 m the semivariance of w evi increases with the lag distance and slightly fluctuates around the sill when the distance is sufficiently larger than 5 km the sill of w evi variance in the situation of gd 5 m is significantly higher than that in deeper groundwater situations the semivariogram range of w evi in the middle zone of the study area is lowest due to the lowest semivariogram range of gd the nugget effect in the w evi variance is weak but positively related to the nugget of gd variance when groundwater is shallow high sensitivity of the vegetation cover to the shallow groundwater should be considered in the regulation of groundwater resources for ecological benefits keywords hydrogeology vegetation ecology semivariance aridity index ordos plateau 1 introduction as a biodiversity surrogate vegetation structural variation is important sensitive feedback of ecosystems mcelhinny et al 2005 spatial distribution and patterns of vegetation which are key components of vegetation condition assessment gibbons and freudenberger 2006 can remarkably reflect eco hydrological system in arid and semiarid areas liu et al 2012 vegetation growth is water limited over arid to semiarid regions and more likely to suffer degradation controlled by relatively low precipitation and high evapotranspiration fensholt et al 2009 vicente serrano et al 2012 bunting et al 2017 even so shallow groundwater accessible by roots can relieve vegetation from water stress typical plant species using groundwater as the dominant source of water have been defined as phreatophytes such as populus spp salix spp and tamarix spp meinzer 1927 naumburg et al 2005 cooper et al 2006 therefore groundwater may be a control of the vegetation distribution in arid and semiarid zones however the quantitative relationship between the groundwater depth gd and vegetation distribution is still unclear except limited statistical analyses remote sensing vegetation indices such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi have been used to identify the dependency of vegetation coverage on gd at the landscape scale gong et al 2004 lv et al 2013 jin et al 2014 seeyan et al 2014 qi et al 2017 yang et al 2019 as indicated the relationship between vegetation indices and gd could be linear or non linear gong et al 2004 discovered a linear correlation between ndvi and gd for a californian mountain meadow however the correlation between vegetation indices or relative coverage and gd seemed to be nonlinear for desert and grassland ecosystems at semiarid and arid sites in the northwestern china jin et al 2011 lv et al 2013 qi et al 2017 yang et al 2019 in general vegetation coverage is more sensitive to the change in gd at places with shallower groundwater though the sensitivity of plants varies among communities due to plant species elmore et al 2006 mclendon et al 2008 when water tables are within the rooting depth of plants the vegetation cover is almost insensitive to gd variation mata gonzález et al 2012 dominant plant species could indicate the range of gd at a place loheide and gorelick 2007 mata gonzález et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 for example an investigation in the cele oasis tarim basin in china li et al 2010 indicated that the dominant communities change following the sequence of alhagi tamarix spp populus phragmites and sophora from deep groundwater zone to shallow groundwater zone at the regional scale the vegetation distribution is controlled by climate factors normally the precipitation p potential evapotranspiration e 0 and air temperature t air hulme 2005 zhao et al 2011 xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 in general p and t air are positive to the vegetation coverage whereas e 0 is a negative factor because it would increase the dryness at the landscape scale vegetation distribution and diversity are more sensitive to heterogeneous topographical variables such as the elevation aspect and slope the soil moisture also plays a crucial role in the vegetation patterns franz et al 2011 ruiz sinoga et al 2011 which also synthetically depends on the climatic and hydrogeological conditions for example shallower gd could maintain higher soil moisture for larger vegetation coverage the soil moisture is not easy to be observed at the landscape and regional scales however its relative distribution could be partially implied by the distributed vegetation index thus distinguishing the role of gd on the vegetation variance from the climatic and topographic controls has the potential to improve our knowledge of the soil water heterogeneity the plant groundwater relationship at the landscape scale should not be limited in the pixel to pixel correlation between vegetation indices and gd but would be also exhibited in the spatial variance in the vegetation cover the distribution patterns and variance in vegetation are linked to the abundance of different plant species gould 2000 john et al 2008 which could be also effectively detected with remote sensing vegetation indices fairbanks and mcgwire 2004 pau et al 2012 yuan et al 2019 investigated the spatial variability of ndvi and typical environmental factors e g precipitation topographical slope and soil properties using geo statistical methods costantini et al 2012 used the semivariogram range of ndvi to represent the spatial homogeneity of vegetation and show the fragility of forests gul and ersahin 2019 evaluated the semivariogram of an environmental sensitivity index incorporating vegetation coverage plant type and other factors in the semiarid north central anatolia the standard deviation of vegetation indices could be also used as surrogate measures of the vegetation variance oindo 2002 yao et al 2019 to our knowledge the role of gd on the spatial variance in remote sensing vegetation index has not been investigated in the literature which could be an essential feature of groundwater dependent eco system in arid and semiarid regions in this study the spatial distributions of the vegetation cover and gd in a semiarid to arid region in the ordos plateau china are investigated using 250 m resolution data the study site and data are presented in section 2 as well as the methods we introduced a multivariable regression analysis on evi to filter linear impacts of the climatic and topographic controls on the vegetation distribution the residual evi is defined as w evi section 2 5 which is considered as a stochastic index of the vegetation distribution with a groundwater dependent variance this relationship is observed using a semivariogram model with parameters identified from the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue analysis in section 3 the results of the multivariable regression analysis on evi and the semivariogram analyses on w evi and gd are illustrated for different zones the relationship between w evi and gd is discussed in detail with the results in section 4 the practical significance of this study on groundwater resources regulation in the ordos plateau is also discussed 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located at the ordos plateau fig 1 a in north china where the plateau is enclosed by the yellow river on the western northern and eastern boundaries and mainly covered by the mu us desert in the middle landscape in the area is characterized by lowlands near rivers normally below 1200 m a s l and highlands along watershed ridges normally higher than 1300 m the whole study area is 19649 km2 and was divided into three zones according to the watersheds of drainage basins fig 1b where zone a refers to the dusitu river basin 10684 km2 zone b shows a relatively closed basin with numerous small lakes 3853 km2 and zone c includes the basins of the hailiutu river and nalin river 5112 km2 the region has an arid to semiarid continental climate with mean annual p ranging from 200 to 500 mm and annual mean t air varies around 9 the vegetation cover is dominated by xeric plants e g artemisia desertorum and salix psammophila especially over the high topographic regions with relatively large gd whereas riparian plants pastures and high density shrubs mainly appear on lowlands distribution of groundwater in the ordos plateau is mainly controlled by topography and hydrogeological conditions hou et al 2008 shallow groundwater normally exists in the unconfined aquifer with the quaternary sandy sediments that are mainly composed of the saluwusu formation and generally less than 50 m in thickness the underlying cretaceous sandstones form a semi confined aquifer and the thickness is generally 500 1200 m so that groundwater circulation could occur in a wide and deep subsurface space the jurassic formations below the cretaceous formations are mostly mudstones and act as aquitards as indicated by hydrogeological surveys hou et al 2008 at most places in the ordos plateau both the shallow and deep groundwater in the quaternary cretaceous aquifers are fresh water the total dissolved solids tds in groundwater is generally smaller than 1 0 g l the dominant anion in shallow groundwater is generally h c o 3 locally being s o 4 2 or c l at places where groundwater slowly discharges to river or lakes the cationic components in shallow groundwater are generally dominated by n a 2 and c a 2 water table in the aquifers shows an undulating shape that is briefly similar to the topography fig 1c but has a smaller fluctuation consequently gd is relatively large on the hills because of the arid to semiarid climate groundwater discharge is a major source of runoff in the river basins for example the estimated value of the base flow index for the annual streamflow in the hailiutu river was higher than 0 80 up to 0 95 zhou et al 2013 wang and zhou 2016 rivers generally cut deeply into the aquifer in the downstream area lowing water table and increasing gd on riverbanks 2 2 data the datasets used in this study are listed in table 1 the evi and ndvi data were collected from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis vegetation indices mod13q1 version 6 product didan 2015 evi incorporates both background adjustment and atmospheric resistance concepts into the ndvi miura et al 2001 wardlow and egbert 2010 it has been considered as a modified index with improved sensitivity to high biomass regions through a decoupling of the canopy background signal and a reduction in atmospheric influences huete et al 1999 the 90 m resolution digital elevation data was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm product and resampled onto the same 250 m resolution grid with respect to the evi data the distributed groundwater level data was provided by qi et al 2017 based on a large number of observation wells and introduced in this study to estimate gd the difference between dem and groundwater level yields the value of gd with the same resolution the monthly t air p and pan evaporation e pan observed in the 20 cm diameter pan at 30 meteorological stations fig 1a in or near the ordos plateau were extracted from the china meteorological data service center cmdc the monthly e 0 at these meteorological stations was estimated from e pan with empirical pan coefficients shi et al 1986 the global land cover in 2010 was classified and recorded in globeland30 chen et al 2015 that provided by the national geomatics center of china ngcc with the resolution of 30 m the globeland30 was generated from satellite images including landsat tm and etm multispectral images and chinese environmental disaster alleviation satellite hj 1 multispectral images which is effective to represent the 2010 land over in china 2 3 natural vegetation index in growing season in the study area croplands exist in several places at the middle and lower reaches of rivers but occupy only 3 2 of the area land use data were extracted from the globeland30 and resampled to 250 m resolution to recognize cropland pixels from the evi data and remain the natural vegetation index there are also bare lands and surface water bodies in the region disturbing evi distribution from the patterns of vegetation a low threshold value of evi is needed to identify lands covered by normal vegetation the percentage of pixels in a certain range of evi at an interval of 0 01 is calculated every 16 days for 2004 2005 and compared with the monthly p and t air as shown in fig 2 in 2004 the rainfall in the rainy season was much higher than that in 2005 indicating a wet year whereas the weather in 2005 was relatively dry even the t air in the two years was similar fig 2a the evi of natural vegetation reached a maximum in august during the growing season fig 2b when both of p and t air were relatively high in the non growing season the evi pixels are concentrated in a zone below the line of evi 0 1 and the maximum pixel density occurs along a line between evi 0 07 and evi 0 08 according to the results the threshold of evi is settled as 0 07 to abstract pixels for vegetation covered lands in this study the mean evi value in the growing season of the period 2000 2010 was calculated for each pixel with natural plants appendix a and used to investigate the vegetation distribution patterns in the following sections we also obtain the multi year average ndvi covering the growing seasons from 2000 to 2010 for each pixel which is the alternative vegetation index that could be used to check the correspondence between the ndvi and evi data they are plotted in fig 3 there is a strong linear correlation between them when evi is higher than 0 3 data points of the ndvi are mostly a bit lower than the correlation line this is caused by the saturation problem in ndvi at sites with densely vegetated canopies huete et al 1999 however it is indicated in fig 3 that the ndvi and evi are basically equivalent indices to show the distributed vegetation in this study area as previously mentioned evi is a modified index and so that only the evi data are adopted in the following analyses 2 4 distributed air temperature and aridity index temperature is essential for vegetation growth over the ordos plateau zheng et al 2006 ma et al 2019 the mean annual t air at the 30 meteorological stations during 2000 2010 are interpolated into the same resolution data as that of evi using the inverse distance weighting idw method the results are shown in fig 4 a as indicated t air c in the eastern and western parts of the study area is higher than that in the middle part but the difference is smaller than 2 c both e 0 and p significantly influence the soil water conditions for runoff yield and plant growing in a region to a large extent arora 2002 which can be lumped into a factor named the aridity index ϕ as follows 1 ϕ e 0 p where e 0 is given as the mean annual potential evaporation mm p is given as the mean annual precipitation mm the aridity index is not a normalized indicator but generally ranges between 0 and 10 in the world the semi arid and arid climatic conditions can be characterized by a ϕ value from 2 to 5 and a ϕ value higher than 5 respectively unesco 1979 unep 1992 in this study the aridity index at meteorological stations for the period 2000 2010 are calculated and also interpolated into a 250 m resolution data with the idw method results are shown in fig 4b which indicates that zones b and c locate in the semi arid region whereas zone a is a transition region from semi arid to arid 2 5 multivariable regression semivariogram model and glue method multivariable regression analysis is applied to distinguish the impacts of climatic and topographic controls on the vegetation distribution from gd dependent behaviors it has been demonstrated that the gd significantly influences the vegetation coverage in the ordos plateau only when the gd is not larger than 10 m lv et al 2013 qi et al 2017 to achieve a highly reliable result we use 15 m gd a value larger than 10 m as the cut off point of zones with gd dependent and gd independent plants in this study area in the zone of gd 15 m it is considered that the natural vegetation coverage is controlled by climatic and topographic elements such as the ϕ value t air and ground surface altitude the relationship is described through a multivariable regression formula as follows 2 evi i j λ 1 ϕ i j λ 2 z i j λ 3 t air i j w evi i j for gd i j 15 m where i j denotes the column and row of the pixel position in the 250 m resolution data z is the ground surface altitude m a s l λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 are regression coefficients and w evi is the residual evi value filtered from the multivariable regression as a stochastic variable w evi represents the evi response to other factors in the zone of gd 15 m this multivariable regression could be also applied and expressed as 3 evi i j λ 1 ϕ i j λ 2 z i j λ 3 t i j w evi i j for gd i j 15 m where the coefficients λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 are different from that in eq 2 and w evi is another stochastic variable the differences in the regression coefficients between eqs 2 and 3 could imply a unique impact of the gd on evi semivariogram analysis is a geostatistical method that has been widely used to investigate spatial heterogeneity of geographical properties zawadzki et al 2005 fu et al 2018 for example it is useful in detecting the spatial autocorrelation among measured sample points meisel and turner 1998 morris 1999 correa galeote et al 2012 it has been widely applied in ecological studies to reveal the variability of ecological indices in a region cohen et al 1990 robertson and gross 1994 franklin et al 1997 josée and king 1999 the semivariance of a vector is obtained from calculating one half the average squared difference between all data pairs within a specific lag distance krige 1966 isaaks and srivastava 1989 chen and feng 2013 and can be expressed as 4 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h v x i v x i h 2 where γ is the semivariance at the lag distance of h n h is the number of pairs with respect to h v xi and v xi h are data at the position of xi and xi h respectively for gridded data eq 4 can be rewritten as 5 γ δ i δ j 1 2 n i 1 n v i j v i δ i j δ j 2 where δi and δj denote a two dimensional shift of the pixel position on the grid and they should not concurrently be zero the real distance can be estimated with 6 h d δ i 2 δ j 2 where d is the resolution and the minimum distance in calculating the dependency of the semivariance on the lag distance is normally illustrated as semivariogram where a curve could be obtained from matching data points in general γ increases with h until reaches a maximum value the sill at a critical distance the range and then it becomes stable the sill indicates the total variation within the system the value of γ h at h 0 is the nugget a curve in the semivariogram can be characterized by the nugget the sill and the range representing the spatial distribution patterns of data with random variation and autocorrelation hani et al 2010 an empirical variogram model was widely used to represent the semivariogram curve as follows mcbradney and webster 1986 haining 1990 7 γ h c 0 c 1 e 3 h a m where c 0 is the nugget c is the partial sill c 0 c is the sill a is the range and m is a constant between 0 and 2 eq 7 yields a more general γ h function than the exponential model with m 1 and the gaussian model with m 2 parameters of the semivariogram model could be identified with optimization methods to fit well on data points in the semivariogram in this study we use the glue method to capture the uncertainties in these parameters the glue is a widely adopted technique for model identification which searches a global optimum parameter set and assesses the uncertainty of any parameter with respect to this global optimum beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 it uses a likelihood function for example the determination coefficient 8 l θ y 1 σ m 2 σ 0 2 where l θ y is the likelihood when y a realization of the model is selected from the parameter set θ σ m 2 is the error variance of the model output and σ 0 2 is the variance of observations in this study a c 0 c and m form the parameter set and the observed γ h values are estimated from eqs 5 and 6 the parameter ranges can be determined by preheating the model with the observations the parameter set is generated from a uniform distribution in the range as the prior probability using a monte carlo approach the likelihood is estimated with eq 8 for each realization while only data of l θ y 0 9 are accepted to represent the equifinality the posterior probability of the model is determined following the bayesian estimation which can be expressed as 9 p y θ l r θ y p 0 y k 1 n l r θ y k p 0 y k where p y θ is the posterior probability of y p 0 y is the specified prior probability from uniform distribution in this study lr θ y is the renormalized likelihood from accepted realizations and n is the number of accepted realizations processing steps for glue have been introduced in detail by bastola et al 2011 3 results 3 1 evi distribution and multivariable regression statistics the distribution patterns of evi data are exhibited in fig 5 a the evi of natural vegetation cover is generally less than 0 3 showing a patch distribution on different scales for the whole study area the evi frequency shows a non gaussian distribution with the mean at 0 13 zonal properties of evi and other factors are listed in table 2 the mean standard deviation std and coefficient of variation cv for evi in zone a are smaller than that in zones b and c linking with the largest average ϕ and gd values the differences in evi statistics between zones b and c are not significant whereas zone c has the highest mean evi due to the lowest ϕ and gd in average linear correlations between climatic and topographic controls and the evi data in the study area are investigated for zones of gd 15 m with eq 2 and gd 15 m with eq 3 table 3 provides result of this regression analysis as well as the evi statistics in zones divided by gd 15 m both of the std and cv of the evi data in the zone of gd 15 m are significantly smaller than that in the zone of gd 15 m indicating a relatively homogeneous vegetation cover for the groundwater independent situation all of the regression coefficients λ 1 to λ 3 in eq 2 and λ 1 to λ 3 in eq 3 pass the t test with a normal significance level over 0 05 the p values of the f test on overall significance are almost zero and of course less than this significance level therefore the proposed linear relationship in such regression formulas is significant however the cross correlation is not strong as indicated by small coefficients of determination r2 this is partially caused by the large number of data points in summary the regression analysis shows a significant weak correlation between evi and the climatic and topographic controls in the zone of gd 15 m the regression coefficients are quite different from that in the zone of gd 15 m suggesting a significant impact of groundwater on vegetation over when gd is small as indicated in table 3 the shallow groundwater increases the sensitivities of the vegetation index to ϕ negative λ 1 λ 1 and t air positive λ 3 λ 3 but decreases the sensitivity of the vegetation index to z from a positive λ 2 0 to negative λ 2 0 the positive correlation between evi and z in deep groundwater zone may be caused by the elevation effect on the monsoon rainfall increases with the altitude that was not considered in the interpolation of p data from meteorological stations in shallow groundwater zone gd generally increases with z so that the evi z correlation becomes negative due to the negative gd effect on plants 3 2 semivariogram of w evi and uncertainty the multivariable regression analysis produces a residual vegetation index w evi from the impacts of climatic and topographic controls in this study we take w evi as a stochastic variable and calculate it in the whole study area as follows 10 w evi i j e v i i j λ 1 ϕ i j λ 2 z i j λ 3 t i j this w evi value incorporates the groundwater dependent behaviors in the zone of gd 15 m fig 5b shows the distribution of w evi in general the patchy patterns of w evi are similar to that of evi while the relative contrast ratio is enhanced in many places w evi also shows a more concentrated frequency on sides of the mean 0 09 the semivariance γ in w evi is further calculated for the 250 m resolution data and plotted in fig 6 it is clear that the γ value of w evi rapidly increases with the lag distance when h is less than 5 km and then gradually increases to or fluctuates round a stable value this characterization indicates that the w evi distribution approximately follows a stationary random process the maximum γ denotes the magnitude of the sill c 0 c this sill value should be small in zone a fig 6a which seems to be less than the 1 3 of sills in zones b fig 6b and c fig 6c it also implies a relatively homogeneous vegetation cover in zone a the mixed result for the whole study area fig 6d shows a more stable γ value of w evi when h 10 km however it does not exactly mean that the range a of the semivariogram is 10 km because the γ value still varies even h is close to 25 km we use the semivariogram model presented in eq 7 to capture the variance behaviors of w evi shown in fig 6 uncertainties in the model parameters a c 0 c and m are investigated through the glue method from observations in fig 6 a maximum possible value of a 50 km is applied the c 0 value should be very small because the γ value of w evi is close to zero when h is 250 m the resolution of data it is presumed that c 0 could range from zero to 3 10 4 the c 0 c value should be less than 12 10 4 according to the maximum γ value of w evi in fig 6 the m value ranges between 0 and 2 in theory fig 7 shows the glue results for the w evi data in the whole study area the scattered falling data points in fig 7 a d indicate the equifinality of the model with variable parameters the peak likelihood exits when c 0 c a and m are close to zero 6 10 4 11 km and 0 6 respectively non gaussian distributions of parameters are revealed from the curves of the posterior probability being shown in fig 7 e h the a value should be higher than 7 km most probably between 10 km and 20 km as indicated in fig 7g but it has a significant tail probability between 20 and 50 km the range of m could be further concentrated into 0 5 1 3 and is most probably less than 1 as indicated in fig 7h it implies a quicker rise in the semivariance with the distance than the prediction from the exponential model m 1 or gaussian model m 2 because the sensitivity of γ to h a is negatively subject to m zonal properties of the semivariogram model for w evi are characterized in fig 8 with box plots of parameters from glue the a value in zone b should be less than 10 km as indicated in fig 8a which is significantly smaller than the highly possible a values between 10 km and 30 km in zones a and c the sill c 0 c falls in a relatively narrow range round 3 10 4 in zone a fig 8b which is significantly lower than that in b and to c this difference agrees with the features shown in fig 6 a c the highly possible range of the m value 0 5 0 7 in zone a is similar to that in zone c as shown in fig 8c in comparison zone b has a larger range for m with concentrated frequency around 1 which is in contrast to the feature of the a value in fig 8a 3 3 gd distribution and variance the spatial gd distribution is shown in fig 9 it indicates that the deepest gd area lies in zone a where the mean gd is larger than 28 m and only 34 of the area shows gd smaller than 10 m in the other two zones gd is generally smaller than 20 m in particular 82 of the area in zone c shows gd below 10 m the frequency curve of gd in these zones is far beyond the gaussian distribution the spatial variance of gd is also exhibited by the semivariance plots in fig 6 in zone a the γ value of gd continuously increases along the lag distance until h is close to 25 km fig 6a reaching a maximum γ value around 700 m2 this increasing process also exists in zone c fig 6c but limited in a much smaller scale the γ value is less than 100 m2 in zone b the γ value of gd soundly converges to 200 m2 when h is larger than 10 km the semivariogram model of gd is checked with eq 7 using the glue method the results are shown in fig 10 similar to that in fig 8a the highly possible a value of gd in zone b is smaller than that in the other zones however the c 0 c value of gd shown in fig 10b decreases from zone a to b and then to c which is contrary to the patterns in fig 8b the highly possible m value of gd shown in fig 10c is generally higher than that of w evi in fig 8c and decreases from zone a to b and c similar to the patterns in fig 10b 4 discussions 4 1 w evi versus gd it is presumed in this study that the w evi data calculated from eq 10 for the zone of gd 15 m incorporates the impact of groundwater on the vegetation coverage even though it is a stochastic variable this impact can be observed through two steps the first step is to investigate the pixel to pixel dependency of the w evi on gd by organizing the pair data w evi and gd on the same pixel this dependency behavior does not like a simple function because of the stochastic nature of w evi as shown in fig 11 to further quantitatively characterize the relationship the range of gd is divided into intervals and two thresholds of the w evi data with respect to the intervals are introduced the 50 w evi refers to the half dividing threshold of data points for an interval which is an equivalent value of the average w evi the 98 w evi represents a typically high threshold over 98 data points the interval of 1 m for gd is used to calculate the 50 w evi and 98 w evi when groundwater is shallower than 10 m an interval exists between 10 m and 15 m curves of the two thresholds are shown in fig 11 for different zones in general both 50 w evi and 98 w evi decrease with gd when groundwater is shallower than 10 m whereas the change in 50 w evi is much smaller than the change in 98 w evi in zone a the 50 w evi is almost steady at 0 08 however the 98 w evi varies between 0 11 and 0 14 with a negative dependency on gd the ranges of the 98 w evi in zones b and c are larger than that in zone a a special feature in zone c is that the 98 w evi almost keeps to be 0 19 when gd is smaller than 3 m but decreases from 0 19 to 0 15 when gd increases from 3 m to 9 m this may indicate that high coverage plants in zone c are sensitive to groundwater only when gd varies between 3 m and 9 m the 50 w evi and 98 w evi are also estimated for all pixels in the zone of gd 15 m and plotted in fig 11 as circles at gd 20 m for a comparison they would be different from the thresholds for the interval of gd between 10 m and 15 m but the relative changes are smaller than 10 it confirms the previous finding lv et al 2013 qi et al 2017 the vegetation cover at the landscape scale is insensitive to groundwater when gd is larger than 10 m the second step is investigating the impact of gd on the semivariogram of w evi we divide gd into four sections 0 5 m 5 10 m 10 15 m and 15 m to identify the gd dependent semivariogram model for w evi with the glue algorithm the results are plotted in fig 12 the autocorrelation range a shows irregular changing patterns with gd the a value in zone a and b changes a little when gd varies from 0 m to 15 m where the shift of the center value 5 km is not lager than the wide of boxes 20 km in zone c the highly possible a value is smaller than 20 km when gd 5 m whereas it is 20 km when gd falls between 5 m and 10 m however when gd increases from 10 m to 15 m and more the box of a gradually decreases to the level between 10 km and 25 km note that in zone c the deep groundwater gd 15 m only exists beneath narrow banded lands on river sides and watershed boundaries fig 9 so that the autocorrelation range of w evi is limited therefore this is a topographic effect on the spatial variance in w evi it is clear that the sill c 0 c has been significantly influenced by the shallow groundwater because the sill value is highest when gd 5 m in all of the three zones the difference in the sill is relatively small in zone a where the aridity index is highest indicating a climatic effect on spatial variance in w evi the sill also decreases when gd increases from 5 m to 15 m and more even though in zone c this response is slight the parameter m doesn t seem to be affected by gd because the highly possible range of m just slightly fluctuated around the average when gd varies in summary the sill of w evi variance is definitely dependent on gd but may be coupling with the effect of climatic conditions the other two parameters a and m in the semivariogram model of w evi are normally insensitive to gd 4 2 nugget effect versus resolution of data an interesting part in the semivariogram analysis on w evi is the nugget c 0 which included in eq 7 as a constant for an analyzed zone the nugget denotes an unexplained spatial variance costantini et al 2012 or a sampling dependent variance robertson and gross 1994 in this study the c 0 value of w evi for the whole study area should be less than 3 10 4 according to the glue result shown in fig 7e whereas the c value should be larger than 4 10 4 thus the ratio c c 0 c which denotes the contribution of structural variance to the sill should be higher than 0 57 this ratio is much small in comparison with semivariogram results in ndvi 0 9 of an italian forested area costantini et al 2012 seemingly indicating that the nugget effect is significant in the ordos plateau however we should be aware of the resolution effect implied in eq 6 and illustrated in fig 13 a where the heterogeneity of data begins from a pixel element to the four adjacent elements with a distance at d 250 m the resolution the real nugget should be less than γ d as shown in fig 13b the γ d values for w evi in different zones are smaller than 1 6 10 4 and so that c c 0 c should be higher than 0 8 according to the sill results fig 8b thus the exact nugget effect on evi variance is non significant in this study area the γ d value for the semivariogram model of the 250 m resolution gd data is also provided in fig 13b in zone b the γ d value is the largest but less than 14 m2 the sill of gd variance in zone b is close to 200 m2 fig 10b so that c c 0 c should be higher than 0 9 the c c 0 c values of gd variance are also higher than 0 9 in zones a and c according to semivariance data therefore the nugget effect on gd variance in this study is weak it is seemed from comparison of the relative γ d values between w evi and gd for different zones that the nugget of w evi variance is not subject to the nugget of gd for example zone a has the lowest γ d of w evi variance but the γ d of gd variance is in the middle among three zones however the relationship could be observed alternatively for pixels with shallow groundwater as indicated in fig 12 pixels with gd 5 m have the biggest sill for w evi variance among different gd sections we calculate γ d values of w evi and gd variances for the situation of gd 5 m in three zones and also plot data in fig 13c respectively in such a situation both γ d values of w evi and gd are lowest in zone a whereas the difference between zone b and c is not significant this comparison suggests that the nugget of w evi variance can be controlled by the nugget of gd variance when groundwater is shallow the behaviors of spatial variance in vegetation cover below the scale of 250 m can be indirectly observed from high resolution gd data following the dem data the original gd data is 90 m resolution with higher density pixels fig 13d for the heterogeneity analysis in particular we calculate γ h values of this high resolution gd data for gd 5 m because the vegetation cover is sensitive to shallow groundwater as shown in fig 13 e when the distance h is less than 1000 m the semivariance γ of the 90 m resolution data is generally smaller than 2 m2 similar to the γ d value of the 250 m resolution data an increase of γ with the distance is exhibited but disturbed by a slight fluctuation at h 270 m where the distance is mostly close to 250 m the γ values are 1 09 m2 1 40 m2 and 1 36 m2 respectively in zones a b and c the order of these γ values in gd variance for three zones satisfies the order of γ d values in 250 resolution w evi data fig 13c in fact such an order exists when the distance is between 270 and 400 m implying that the nugget of the w evi variance is positively related to the nugget of gd variance according to the increasing patterns in γ of gd with the distance the semivariance of the vegetation coverage should also decrease with decreasing lag distance below the scale of 250 m however the w evi nugget c 0 γ 0 seems to be higher than zero because there would be c 0 0 for gd according to the slopes of γ h curves in fig 13e investigation on the exact relationship is expected in future by using fine resolution data of both gd and vegetation indices 4 3 practical significance this study highlights the regulation of groundwater resources for ecological benefits in the ordos plateau under the changing climate as indicated from study results the distribution of natural vegetation in this area is dominated by climate topography and groundwater although it can be also affected by other factors such as the soil properties the climate in zones b and c is relatively wet compared to zone a which results in a higher level of vegetation index and diversity however the vegetation growth and variance in zones b and c are sensitive to the change in gd whether the change in gd is triggered by the climate change and human activities in zone c where the aridity index is generally less than 4 the 50 w evi and 98 w evi are mostly sensitive to the change in gd especially when gd is less than 7 m fig 11 thus heavy utilization of groundwater for irrigation on croplands in zone c would cause significant lowering of groundwater level and degenerating of natural vegetation ecosystem in zone b the mostly fragmented distribution of groundwater is exhibited fig 9 and indicated by the lowest semivariogram range in gd fig 10a leading to the lowest semivariogram range in the vegetation index fig 8a as well as the highest variance in w evi for gd less than 5 m fig 12 and fig 13b shallow groundwater in zone b mainly distributes around small lakes and in lowlands between sand dunes forming patches of high density vegetation a decrease in groundwater level at the regional scale in zone b would increase the area of deep groundwater as that exhibited in zone a and significantly decrease the continuity of high density vegetation patches this is a negative effect for the ecosystem and the risk should be carefully assessed before groundwater utilization the vegetation distribution and variance in the arid zone a also depend on gd however as indicated from the lowest mean std and cv in evi table 2 and the smallest sill of w evi variance with shallow groundwater fig 12 the dependency seems to be not as significant as that in zones b and c even the 98 w evi slightly increases with the decreasing gd in zone a as shown in fig 11 the 50 w evi is almost independent on gd since gd is larger than 7 m in the major part of zone a fig 9 it is speculated that a decrease in the groundwater level in this zone would not cause a severe degradation in the vegetation coverage thus groundwater resources in zone a may be more usable for economic benefits without significant negative consequence in the ecosystem when the inter basin influence is insignificant in fact agricultural development in the region was rapid in the last decade benefitted by growing utilization of groundwater meanwhile desertification the study area is included in the original mu us desert has been controlled well from the vegetation protection that partially supported by using groundwater in artificial afforestation however the impact of groundwater utilization for the natural vegetation should be carefully examined at the basin scale because zones a b and c are linked together with the regional groundwater flow in the same aquifer system hou et al 2008 heavy decline of groundwater in any zone could cause a drawdown in other zones and lead to inter basin influences of groundwater utilization on ecosystems 5 conclusions in this study we investigate the relationship of spatial patterns between the vegetation cover in the ordos plateau china and groundwater in the regional quaternary cretaceous aquifers the 250 m resolution mean annual evi data during the growing seasons for the period 2000 2010 are extracted to represent the mean steady state vegetation cover the same resolution data of the altitude z annual mean air temperature t air mean annual aridity index ϕ and groundwater depth gd are collected to identify impacts of topographic climatic and hydrogeological conditions on the evi distribution a semivariogram analysis with the gule method is introduced to quantify the gd dependent variance in the residual evi w evi filtered from a linear regression with t air z and ϕ the major results and conclusions of this investigation are included in the following 1 at the regional scale there is a significant weak correlation between evi and the climatic and topographic controls when groundwater is deep gd 15 m the evi value is positively correlated with z and t air whereas negatively correlated with ϕ when groundwater is relatively shallow gd 15 m the correlation coefficients significantly change and the correlation between evi and z becomes negative implying the impact of groundwater 2 the w evi value approximately shows a stationary stochastic distribution with almost stable values of the semivariance in different zones when the lag distance is sufficiently large parameters in the semivariogram model of w evi are identified with uncertainties where the range could be as larger as 50 km but mostly like to be less than 30 km and larger than 5 km the sill generally falls between 3 10 4 and 12 10 4 and the m value varies generally between 0 5 and 1 0 less than that in the exponential and gaussian models the nugget effect in the w evi variance is weak 3 the pixel to pixel dependency of the w evi on gd is nonlinear and varies from the arid to semiarid zones the 98 threshold value of w evi is much more sensitive to the change in gd than the 50 threshold value this dependency is strong only when gd is smaller than 10 m 4 the semivariogram behaviors of the w evi are influenced by groundwater the sill of the w evi variance in the situation of gd 5 m is significantly higher than that in deeper groundwater situations the semivariogram range and m values of w evi are relatively insensitive to gd but the lowest range of w evi variance in zone b is caused by the lowest semivariogram range of gd the nugget of the w evi variance is positively related to the nugget of gd variance when groundwater is shallow which is expected to be investigated in detail with higher resolution data these study results highlight the role of groundwater on the vegetation heterogeneity at the landscape scale beside the climatic and topographic controls at the regional scale accordingly a potential negative impact of groundwater utilization in the study area on the vegetation ecosystems should be carefully considered credit

5349,as important sensitive feedback of ecosystems spatial distribution and patterns of vegetation can remarkably reflect eco environmental conditions in arid and semiarid areas where groundwater plays a significant role the impact of groundwater depth gd on the spatial variance in remote sensing vegetation index is highlighted in this study over the ordos plateau china the 250 m resolution mean annual enhanced vegetation index evi data are analyzed and compared to the same resolution data of altitude air temperature aridity index and gd a linear regression analysis indicates a significant weak correlation between the evi and the climatic and topographic controls at the regional scale a semivariogram analysis is introduced to quantify the gd dependent variance in the residual evi w evi filtered from this linear regression the pixel to pixel dependency of w evi on gd is nonlinear and significant only when gd is smaller than 10 m the semivariance of w evi increases with the lag distance and slightly fluctuates around the sill when the distance is sufficiently larger than 5 km the sill of w evi variance in the situation of gd 5 m is significantly higher than that in deeper groundwater situations the semivariogram range of w evi in the middle zone of the study area is lowest due to the lowest semivariogram range of gd the nugget effect in the w evi variance is weak but positively related to the nugget of gd variance when groundwater is shallow high sensitivity of the vegetation cover to the shallow groundwater should be considered in the regulation of groundwater resources for ecological benefits keywords hydrogeology vegetation ecology semivariance aridity index ordos plateau 1 introduction as a biodiversity surrogate vegetation structural variation is important sensitive feedback of ecosystems mcelhinny et al 2005 spatial distribution and patterns of vegetation which are key components of vegetation condition assessment gibbons and freudenberger 2006 can remarkably reflect eco hydrological system in arid and semiarid areas liu et al 2012 vegetation growth is water limited over arid to semiarid regions and more likely to suffer degradation controlled by relatively low precipitation and high evapotranspiration fensholt et al 2009 vicente serrano et al 2012 bunting et al 2017 even so shallow groundwater accessible by roots can relieve vegetation from water stress typical plant species using groundwater as the dominant source of water have been defined as phreatophytes such as populus spp salix spp and tamarix spp meinzer 1927 naumburg et al 2005 cooper et al 2006 therefore groundwater may be a control of the vegetation distribution in arid and semiarid zones however the quantitative relationship between the groundwater depth gd and vegetation distribution is still unclear except limited statistical analyses remote sensing vegetation indices such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi have been used to identify the dependency of vegetation coverage on gd at the landscape scale gong et al 2004 lv et al 2013 jin et al 2014 seeyan et al 2014 qi et al 2017 yang et al 2019 as indicated the relationship between vegetation indices and gd could be linear or non linear gong et al 2004 discovered a linear correlation between ndvi and gd for a californian mountain meadow however the correlation between vegetation indices or relative coverage and gd seemed to be nonlinear for desert and grassland ecosystems at semiarid and arid sites in the northwestern china jin et al 2011 lv et al 2013 qi et al 2017 yang et al 2019 in general vegetation coverage is more sensitive to the change in gd at places with shallower groundwater though the sensitivity of plants varies among communities due to plant species elmore et al 2006 mclendon et al 2008 when water tables are within the rooting depth of plants the vegetation cover is almost insensitive to gd variation mata gonzález et al 2012 dominant plant species could indicate the range of gd at a place loheide and gorelick 2007 mata gonzález et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 for example an investigation in the cele oasis tarim basin in china li et al 2010 indicated that the dominant communities change following the sequence of alhagi tamarix spp populus phragmites and sophora from deep groundwater zone to shallow groundwater zone at the regional scale the vegetation distribution is controlled by climate factors normally the precipitation p potential evapotranspiration e 0 and air temperature t air hulme 2005 zhao et al 2011 xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 in general p and t air are positive to the vegetation coverage whereas e 0 is a negative factor because it would increase the dryness at the landscape scale vegetation distribution and diversity are more sensitive to heterogeneous topographical variables such as the elevation aspect and slope the soil moisture also plays a crucial role in the vegetation patterns franz et al 2011 ruiz sinoga et al 2011 which also synthetically depends on the climatic and hydrogeological conditions for example shallower gd could maintain higher soil moisture for larger vegetation coverage the soil moisture is not easy to be observed at the landscape and regional scales however its relative distribution could be partially implied by the distributed vegetation index thus distinguishing the role of gd on the vegetation variance from the climatic and topographic controls has the potential to improve our knowledge of the soil water heterogeneity the plant groundwater relationship at the landscape scale should not be limited in the pixel to pixel correlation between vegetation indices and gd but would be also exhibited in the spatial variance in the vegetation cover the distribution patterns and variance in vegetation are linked to the abundance of different plant species gould 2000 john et al 2008 which could be also effectively detected with remote sensing vegetation indices fairbanks and mcgwire 2004 pau et al 2012 yuan et al 2019 investigated the spatial variability of ndvi and typical environmental factors e g precipitation topographical slope and soil properties using geo statistical methods costantini et al 2012 used the semivariogram range of ndvi to represent the spatial homogeneity of vegetation and show the fragility of forests gul and ersahin 2019 evaluated the semivariogram of an environmental sensitivity index incorporating vegetation coverage plant type and other factors in the semiarid north central anatolia the standard deviation of vegetation indices could be also used as surrogate measures of the vegetation variance oindo 2002 yao et al 2019 to our knowledge the role of gd on the spatial variance in remote sensing vegetation index has not been investigated in the literature which could be an essential feature of groundwater dependent eco system in arid and semiarid regions in this study the spatial distributions of the vegetation cover and gd in a semiarid to arid region in the ordos plateau china are investigated using 250 m resolution data the study site and data are presented in section 2 as well as the methods we introduced a multivariable regression analysis on evi to filter linear impacts of the climatic and topographic controls on the vegetation distribution the residual evi is defined as w evi section 2 5 which is considered as a stochastic index of the vegetation distribution with a groundwater dependent variance this relationship is observed using a semivariogram model with parameters identified from the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue analysis in section 3 the results of the multivariable regression analysis on evi and the semivariogram analyses on w evi and gd are illustrated for different zones the relationship between w evi and gd is discussed in detail with the results in section 4 the practical significance of this study on groundwater resources regulation in the ordos plateau is also discussed 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located at the ordos plateau fig 1 a in north china where the plateau is enclosed by the yellow river on the western northern and eastern boundaries and mainly covered by the mu us desert in the middle landscape in the area is characterized by lowlands near rivers normally below 1200 m a s l and highlands along watershed ridges normally higher than 1300 m the whole study area is 19649 km2 and was divided into three zones according to the watersheds of drainage basins fig 1b where zone a refers to the dusitu river basin 10684 km2 zone b shows a relatively closed basin with numerous small lakes 3853 km2 and zone c includes the basins of the hailiutu river and nalin river 5112 km2 the region has an arid to semiarid continental climate with mean annual p ranging from 200 to 500 mm and annual mean t air varies around 9 the vegetation cover is dominated by xeric plants e g artemisia desertorum and salix psammophila especially over the high topographic regions with relatively large gd whereas riparian plants pastures and high density shrubs mainly appear on lowlands distribution of groundwater in the ordos plateau is mainly controlled by topography and hydrogeological conditions hou et al 2008 shallow groundwater normally exists in the unconfined aquifer with the quaternary sandy sediments that are mainly composed of the saluwusu formation and generally less than 50 m in thickness the underlying cretaceous sandstones form a semi confined aquifer and the thickness is generally 500 1200 m so that groundwater circulation could occur in a wide and deep subsurface space the jurassic formations below the cretaceous formations are mostly mudstones and act as aquitards as indicated by hydrogeological surveys hou et al 2008 at most places in the ordos plateau both the shallow and deep groundwater in the quaternary cretaceous aquifers are fresh water the total dissolved solids tds in groundwater is generally smaller than 1 0 g l the dominant anion in shallow groundwater is generally h c o 3 locally being s o 4 2 or c l at places where groundwater slowly discharges to river or lakes the cationic components in shallow groundwater are generally dominated by n a 2 and c a 2 water table in the aquifers shows an undulating shape that is briefly similar to the topography fig 1c but has a smaller fluctuation consequently gd is relatively large on the hills because of the arid to semiarid climate groundwater discharge is a major source of runoff in the river basins for example the estimated value of the base flow index for the annual streamflow in the hailiutu river was higher than 0 80 up to 0 95 zhou et al 2013 wang and zhou 2016 rivers generally cut deeply into the aquifer in the downstream area lowing water table and increasing gd on riverbanks 2 2 data the datasets used in this study are listed in table 1 the evi and ndvi data were collected from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis vegetation indices mod13q1 version 6 product didan 2015 evi incorporates both background adjustment and atmospheric resistance concepts into the ndvi miura et al 2001 wardlow and egbert 2010 it has been considered as a modified index with improved sensitivity to high biomass regions through a decoupling of the canopy background signal and a reduction in atmospheric influences huete et al 1999 the 90 m resolution digital elevation data was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm product and resampled onto the same 250 m resolution grid with respect to the evi data the distributed groundwater level data was provided by qi et al 2017 based on a large number of observation wells and introduced in this study to estimate gd the difference between dem and groundwater level yields the value of gd with the same resolution the monthly t air p and pan evaporation e pan observed in the 20 cm diameter pan at 30 meteorological stations fig 1a in or near the ordos plateau were extracted from the china meteorological data service center cmdc the monthly e 0 at these meteorological stations was estimated from e pan with empirical pan coefficients shi et al 1986 the global land cover in 2010 was classified and recorded in globeland30 chen et al 2015 that provided by the national geomatics center of china ngcc with the resolution of 30 m the globeland30 was generated from satellite images including landsat tm and etm multispectral images and chinese environmental disaster alleviation satellite hj 1 multispectral images which is effective to represent the 2010 land over in china 2 3 natural vegetation index in growing season in the study area croplands exist in several places at the middle and lower reaches of rivers but occupy only 3 2 of the area land use data were extracted from the globeland30 and resampled to 250 m resolution to recognize cropland pixels from the evi data and remain the natural vegetation index there are also bare lands and surface water bodies in the region disturbing evi distribution from the patterns of vegetation a low threshold value of evi is needed to identify lands covered by normal vegetation the percentage of pixels in a certain range of evi at an interval of 0 01 is calculated every 16 days for 2004 2005 and compared with the monthly p and t air as shown in fig 2 in 2004 the rainfall in the rainy season was much higher than that in 2005 indicating a wet year whereas the weather in 2005 was relatively dry even the t air in the two years was similar fig 2a the evi of natural vegetation reached a maximum in august during the growing season fig 2b when both of p and t air were relatively high in the non growing season the evi pixels are concentrated in a zone below the line of evi 0 1 and the maximum pixel density occurs along a line between evi 0 07 and evi 0 08 according to the results the threshold of evi is settled as 0 07 to abstract pixels for vegetation covered lands in this study the mean evi value in the growing season of the period 2000 2010 was calculated for each pixel with natural plants appendix a and used to investigate the vegetation distribution patterns in the following sections we also obtain the multi year average ndvi covering the growing seasons from 2000 to 2010 for each pixel which is the alternative vegetation index that could be used to check the correspondence between the ndvi and evi data they are plotted in fig 3 there is a strong linear correlation between them when evi is higher than 0 3 data points of the ndvi are mostly a bit lower than the correlation line this is caused by the saturation problem in ndvi at sites with densely vegetated canopies huete et al 1999 however it is indicated in fig 3 that the ndvi and evi are basically equivalent indices to show the distributed vegetation in this study area as previously mentioned evi is a modified index and so that only the evi data are adopted in the following analyses 2 4 distributed air temperature and aridity index temperature is essential for vegetation growth over the ordos plateau zheng et al 2006 ma et al 2019 the mean annual t air at the 30 meteorological stations during 2000 2010 are interpolated into the same resolution data as that of evi using the inverse distance weighting idw method the results are shown in fig 4 a as indicated t air c in the eastern and western parts of the study area is higher than that in the middle part but the difference is smaller than 2 c both e 0 and p significantly influence the soil water conditions for runoff yield and plant growing in a region to a large extent arora 2002 which can be lumped into a factor named the aridity index ϕ as follows 1 ϕ e 0 p where e 0 is given as the mean annual potential evaporation mm p is given as the mean annual precipitation mm the aridity index is not a normalized indicator but generally ranges between 0 and 10 in the world the semi arid and arid climatic conditions can be characterized by a ϕ value from 2 to 5 and a ϕ value higher than 5 respectively unesco 1979 unep 1992 in this study the aridity index at meteorological stations for the period 2000 2010 are calculated and also interpolated into a 250 m resolution data with the idw method results are shown in fig 4b which indicates that zones b and c locate in the semi arid region whereas zone a is a transition region from semi arid to arid 2 5 multivariable regression semivariogram model and glue method multivariable regression analysis is applied to distinguish the impacts of climatic and topographic controls on the vegetation distribution from gd dependent behaviors it has been demonstrated that the gd significantly influences the vegetation coverage in the ordos plateau only when the gd is not larger than 10 m lv et al 2013 qi et al 2017 to achieve a highly reliable result we use 15 m gd a value larger than 10 m as the cut off point of zones with gd dependent and gd independent plants in this study area in the zone of gd 15 m it is considered that the natural vegetation coverage is controlled by climatic and topographic elements such as the ϕ value t air and ground surface altitude the relationship is described through a multivariable regression formula as follows 2 evi i j λ 1 ϕ i j λ 2 z i j λ 3 t air i j w evi i j for gd i j 15 m where i j denotes the column and row of the pixel position in the 250 m resolution data z is the ground surface altitude m a s l λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 are regression coefficients and w evi is the residual evi value filtered from the multivariable regression as a stochastic variable w evi represents the evi response to other factors in the zone of gd 15 m this multivariable regression could be also applied and expressed as 3 evi i j λ 1 ϕ i j λ 2 z i j λ 3 t i j w evi i j for gd i j 15 m where the coefficients λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 are different from that in eq 2 and w evi is another stochastic variable the differences in the regression coefficients between eqs 2 and 3 could imply a unique impact of the gd on evi semivariogram analysis is a geostatistical method that has been widely used to investigate spatial heterogeneity of geographical properties zawadzki et al 2005 fu et al 2018 for example it is useful in detecting the spatial autocorrelation among measured sample points meisel and turner 1998 morris 1999 correa galeote et al 2012 it has been widely applied in ecological studies to reveal the variability of ecological indices in a region cohen et al 1990 robertson and gross 1994 franklin et al 1997 josée and king 1999 the semivariance of a vector is obtained from calculating one half the average squared difference between all data pairs within a specific lag distance krige 1966 isaaks and srivastava 1989 chen and feng 2013 and can be expressed as 4 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h v x i v x i h 2 where γ is the semivariance at the lag distance of h n h is the number of pairs with respect to h v xi and v xi h are data at the position of xi and xi h respectively for gridded data eq 4 can be rewritten as 5 γ δ i δ j 1 2 n i 1 n v i j v i δ i j δ j 2 where δi and δj denote a two dimensional shift of the pixel position on the grid and they should not concurrently be zero the real distance can be estimated with 6 h d δ i 2 δ j 2 where d is the resolution and the minimum distance in calculating the dependency of the semivariance on the lag distance is normally illustrated as semivariogram where a curve could be obtained from matching data points in general γ increases with h until reaches a maximum value the sill at a critical distance the range and then it becomes stable the sill indicates the total variation within the system the value of γ h at h 0 is the nugget a curve in the semivariogram can be characterized by the nugget the sill and the range representing the spatial distribution patterns of data with random variation and autocorrelation hani et al 2010 an empirical variogram model was widely used to represent the semivariogram curve as follows mcbradney and webster 1986 haining 1990 7 γ h c 0 c 1 e 3 h a m where c 0 is the nugget c is the partial sill c 0 c is the sill a is the range and m is a constant between 0 and 2 eq 7 yields a more general γ h function than the exponential model with m 1 and the gaussian model with m 2 parameters of the semivariogram model could be identified with optimization methods to fit well on data points in the semivariogram in this study we use the glue method to capture the uncertainties in these parameters the glue is a widely adopted technique for model identification which searches a global optimum parameter set and assesses the uncertainty of any parameter with respect to this global optimum beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 it uses a likelihood function for example the determination coefficient 8 l θ y 1 σ m 2 σ 0 2 where l θ y is the likelihood when y a realization of the model is selected from the parameter set θ σ m 2 is the error variance of the model output and σ 0 2 is the variance of observations in this study a c 0 c and m form the parameter set and the observed γ h values are estimated from eqs 5 and 6 the parameter ranges can be determined by preheating the model with the observations the parameter set is generated from a uniform distribution in the range as the prior probability using a monte carlo approach the likelihood is estimated with eq 8 for each realization while only data of l θ y 0 9 are accepted to represent the equifinality the posterior probability of the model is determined following the bayesian estimation which can be expressed as 9 p y θ l r θ y p 0 y k 1 n l r θ y k p 0 y k where p y θ is the posterior probability of y p 0 y is the specified prior probability from uniform distribution in this study lr θ y is the renormalized likelihood from accepted realizations and n is the number of accepted realizations processing steps for glue have been introduced in detail by bastola et al 2011 3 results 3 1 evi distribution and multivariable regression statistics the distribution patterns of evi data are exhibited in fig 5 a the evi of natural vegetation cover is generally less than 0 3 showing a patch distribution on different scales for the whole study area the evi frequency shows a non gaussian distribution with the mean at 0 13 zonal properties of evi and other factors are listed in table 2 the mean standard deviation std and coefficient of variation cv for evi in zone a are smaller than that in zones b and c linking with the largest average ϕ and gd values the differences in evi statistics between zones b and c are not significant whereas zone c has the highest mean evi due to the lowest ϕ and gd in average linear correlations between climatic and topographic controls and the evi data in the study area are investigated for zones of gd 15 m with eq 2 and gd 15 m with eq 3 table 3 provides result of this regression analysis as well as the evi statistics in zones divided by gd 15 m both of the std and cv of the evi data in the zone of gd 15 m are significantly smaller than that in the zone of gd 15 m indicating a relatively homogeneous vegetation cover for the groundwater independent situation all of the regression coefficients λ 1 to λ 3 in eq 2 and λ 1 to λ 3 in eq 3 pass the t test with a normal significance level over 0 05 the p values of the f test on overall significance are almost zero and of course less than this significance level therefore the proposed linear relationship in such regression formulas is significant however the cross correlation is not strong as indicated by small coefficients of determination r2 this is partially caused by the large number of data points in summary the regression analysis shows a significant weak correlation between evi and the climatic and topographic controls in the zone of gd 15 m the regression coefficients are quite different from that in the zone of gd 15 m suggesting a significant impact of groundwater on vegetation over when gd is small as indicated in table 3 the shallow groundwater increases the sensitivities of the vegetation index to ϕ negative λ 1 λ 1 and t air positive λ 3 λ 3 but decreases the sensitivity of the vegetation index to z from a positive λ 2 0 to negative λ 2 0 the positive correlation between evi and z in deep groundwater zone may be caused by the elevation effect on the monsoon rainfall increases with the altitude that was not considered in the interpolation of p data from meteorological stations in shallow groundwater zone gd generally increases with z so that the evi z correlation becomes negative due to the negative gd effect on plants 3 2 semivariogram of w evi and uncertainty the multivariable regression analysis produces a residual vegetation index w evi from the impacts of climatic and topographic controls in this study we take w evi as a stochastic variable and calculate it in the whole study area as follows 10 w evi i j e v i i j λ 1 ϕ i j λ 2 z i j λ 3 t i j this w evi value incorporates the groundwater dependent behaviors in the zone of gd 15 m fig 5b shows the distribution of w evi in general the patchy patterns of w evi are similar to that of evi while the relative contrast ratio is enhanced in many places w evi also shows a more concentrated frequency on sides of the mean 0 09 the semivariance γ in w evi is further calculated for the 250 m resolution data and plotted in fig 6 it is clear that the γ value of w evi rapidly increases with the lag distance when h is less than 5 km and then gradually increases to or fluctuates round a stable value this characterization indicates that the w evi distribution approximately follows a stationary random process the maximum γ denotes the magnitude of the sill c 0 c this sill value should be small in zone a fig 6a which seems to be less than the 1 3 of sills in zones b fig 6b and c fig 6c it also implies a relatively homogeneous vegetation cover in zone a the mixed result for the whole study area fig 6d shows a more stable γ value of w evi when h 10 km however it does not exactly mean that the range a of the semivariogram is 10 km because the γ value still varies even h is close to 25 km we use the semivariogram model presented in eq 7 to capture the variance behaviors of w evi shown in fig 6 uncertainties in the model parameters a c 0 c and m are investigated through the glue method from observations in fig 6 a maximum possible value of a 50 km is applied the c 0 value should be very small because the γ value of w evi is close to zero when h is 250 m the resolution of data it is presumed that c 0 could range from zero to 3 10 4 the c 0 c value should be less than 12 10 4 according to the maximum γ value of w evi in fig 6 the m value ranges between 0 and 2 in theory fig 7 shows the glue results for the w evi data in the whole study area the scattered falling data points in fig 7 a d indicate the equifinality of the model with variable parameters the peak likelihood exits when c 0 c a and m are close to zero 6 10 4 11 km and 0 6 respectively non gaussian distributions of parameters are revealed from the curves of the posterior probability being shown in fig 7 e h the a value should be higher than 7 km most probably between 10 km and 20 km as indicated in fig 7g but it has a significant tail probability between 20 and 50 km the range of m could be further concentrated into 0 5 1 3 and is most probably less than 1 as indicated in fig 7h it implies a quicker rise in the semivariance with the distance than the prediction from the exponential model m 1 or gaussian model m 2 because the sensitivity of γ to h a is negatively subject to m zonal properties of the semivariogram model for w evi are characterized in fig 8 with box plots of parameters from glue the a value in zone b should be less than 10 km as indicated in fig 8a which is significantly smaller than the highly possible a values between 10 km and 30 km in zones a and c the sill c 0 c falls in a relatively narrow range round 3 10 4 in zone a fig 8b which is significantly lower than that in b and to c this difference agrees with the features shown in fig 6 a c the highly possible range of the m value 0 5 0 7 in zone a is similar to that in zone c as shown in fig 8c in comparison zone b has a larger range for m with concentrated frequency around 1 which is in contrast to the feature of the a value in fig 8a 3 3 gd distribution and variance the spatial gd distribution is shown in fig 9 it indicates that the deepest gd area lies in zone a where the mean gd is larger than 28 m and only 34 of the area shows gd smaller than 10 m in the other two zones gd is generally smaller than 20 m in particular 82 of the area in zone c shows gd below 10 m the frequency curve of gd in these zones is far beyond the gaussian distribution the spatial variance of gd is also exhibited by the semivariance plots in fig 6 in zone a the γ value of gd continuously increases along the lag distance until h is close to 25 km fig 6a reaching a maximum γ value around 700 m2 this increasing process also exists in zone c fig 6c but limited in a much smaller scale the γ value is less than 100 m2 in zone b the γ value of gd soundly converges to 200 m2 when h is larger than 10 km the semivariogram model of gd is checked with eq 7 using the glue method the results are shown in fig 10 similar to that in fig 8a the highly possible a value of gd in zone b is smaller than that in the other zones however the c 0 c value of gd shown in fig 10b decreases from zone a to b and then to c which is contrary to the patterns in fig 8b the highly possible m value of gd shown in fig 10c is generally higher than that of w evi in fig 8c and decreases from zone a to b and c similar to the patterns in fig 10b 4 discussions 4 1 w evi versus gd it is presumed in this study that the w evi data calculated from eq 10 for the zone of gd 15 m incorporates the impact of groundwater on the vegetation coverage even though it is a stochastic variable this impact can be observed through two steps the first step is to investigate the pixel to pixel dependency of the w evi on gd by organizing the pair data w evi and gd on the same pixel this dependency behavior does not like a simple function because of the stochastic nature of w evi as shown in fig 11 to further quantitatively characterize the relationship the range of gd is divided into intervals and two thresholds of the w evi data with respect to the intervals are introduced the 50 w evi refers to the half dividing threshold of data points for an interval which is an equivalent value of the average w evi the 98 w evi represents a typically high threshold over 98 data points the interval of 1 m for gd is used to calculate the 50 w evi and 98 w evi when groundwater is shallower than 10 m an interval exists between 10 m and 15 m curves of the two thresholds are shown in fig 11 for different zones in general both 50 w evi and 98 w evi decrease with gd when groundwater is shallower than 10 m whereas the change in 50 w evi is much smaller than the change in 98 w evi in zone a the 50 w evi is almost steady at 0 08 however the 98 w evi varies between 0 11 and 0 14 with a negative dependency on gd the ranges of the 98 w evi in zones b and c are larger than that in zone a a special feature in zone c is that the 98 w evi almost keeps to be 0 19 when gd is smaller than 3 m but decreases from 0 19 to 0 15 when gd increases from 3 m to 9 m this may indicate that high coverage plants in zone c are sensitive to groundwater only when gd varies between 3 m and 9 m the 50 w evi and 98 w evi are also estimated for all pixels in the zone of gd 15 m and plotted in fig 11 as circles at gd 20 m for a comparison they would be different from the thresholds for the interval of gd between 10 m and 15 m but the relative changes are smaller than 10 it confirms the previous finding lv et al 2013 qi et al 2017 the vegetation cover at the landscape scale is insensitive to groundwater when gd is larger than 10 m the second step is investigating the impact of gd on the semivariogram of w evi we divide gd into four sections 0 5 m 5 10 m 10 15 m and 15 m to identify the gd dependent semivariogram model for w evi with the glue algorithm the results are plotted in fig 12 the autocorrelation range a shows irregular changing patterns with gd the a value in zone a and b changes a little when gd varies from 0 m to 15 m where the shift of the center value 5 km is not lager than the wide of boxes 20 km in zone c the highly possible a value is smaller than 20 km when gd 5 m whereas it is 20 km when gd falls between 5 m and 10 m however when gd increases from 10 m to 15 m and more the box of a gradually decreases to the level between 10 km and 25 km note that in zone c the deep groundwater gd 15 m only exists beneath narrow banded lands on river sides and watershed boundaries fig 9 so that the autocorrelation range of w evi is limited therefore this is a topographic effect on the spatial variance in w evi it is clear that the sill c 0 c has been significantly influenced by the shallow groundwater because the sill value is highest when gd 5 m in all of the three zones the difference in the sill is relatively small in zone a where the aridity index is highest indicating a climatic effect on spatial variance in w evi the sill also decreases when gd increases from 5 m to 15 m and more even though in zone c this response is slight the parameter m doesn t seem to be affected by gd because the highly possible range of m just slightly fluctuated around the average when gd varies in summary the sill of w evi variance is definitely dependent on gd but may be coupling with the effect of climatic conditions the other two parameters a and m in the semivariogram model of w evi are normally insensitive to gd 4 2 nugget effect versus resolution of data an interesting part in the semivariogram analysis on w evi is the nugget c 0 which included in eq 7 as a constant for an analyzed zone the nugget denotes an unexplained spatial variance costantini et al 2012 or a sampling dependent variance robertson and gross 1994 in this study the c 0 value of w evi for the whole study area should be less than 3 10 4 according to the glue result shown in fig 7e whereas the c value should be larger than 4 10 4 thus the ratio c c 0 c which denotes the contribution of structural variance to the sill should be higher than 0 57 this ratio is much small in comparison with semivariogram results in ndvi 0 9 of an italian forested area costantini et al 2012 seemingly indicating that the nugget effect is significant in the ordos plateau however we should be aware of the resolution effect implied in eq 6 and illustrated in fig 13 a where the heterogeneity of data begins from a pixel element to the four adjacent elements with a distance at d 250 m the resolution the real nugget should be less than γ d as shown in fig 13b the γ d values for w evi in different zones are smaller than 1 6 10 4 and so that c c 0 c should be higher than 0 8 according to the sill results fig 8b thus the exact nugget effect on evi variance is non significant in this study area the γ d value for the semivariogram model of the 250 m resolution gd data is also provided in fig 13b in zone b the γ d value is the largest but less than 14 m2 the sill of gd variance in zone b is close to 200 m2 fig 10b so that c c 0 c should be higher than 0 9 the c c 0 c values of gd variance are also higher than 0 9 in zones a and c according to semivariance data therefore the nugget effect on gd variance in this study is weak it is seemed from comparison of the relative γ d values between w evi and gd for different zones that the nugget of w evi variance is not subject to the nugget of gd for example zone a has the lowest γ d of w evi variance but the γ d of gd variance is in the middle among three zones however the relationship could be observed alternatively for pixels with shallow groundwater as indicated in fig 12 pixels with gd 5 m have the biggest sill for w evi variance among different gd sections we calculate γ d values of w evi and gd variances for the situation of gd 5 m in three zones and also plot data in fig 13c respectively in such a situation both γ d values of w evi and gd are lowest in zone a whereas the difference between zone b and c is not significant this comparison suggests that the nugget of w evi variance can be controlled by the nugget of gd variance when groundwater is shallow the behaviors of spatial variance in vegetation cover below the scale of 250 m can be indirectly observed from high resolution gd data following the dem data the original gd data is 90 m resolution with higher density pixels fig 13d for the heterogeneity analysis in particular we calculate γ h values of this high resolution gd data for gd 5 m because the vegetation cover is sensitive to shallow groundwater as shown in fig 13 e when the distance h is less than 1000 m the semivariance γ of the 90 m resolution data is generally smaller than 2 m2 similar to the γ d value of the 250 m resolution data an increase of γ with the distance is exhibited but disturbed by a slight fluctuation at h 270 m where the distance is mostly close to 250 m the γ values are 1 09 m2 1 40 m2 and 1 36 m2 respectively in zones a b and c the order of these γ values in gd variance for three zones satisfies the order of γ d values in 250 resolution w evi data fig 13c in fact such an order exists when the distance is between 270 and 400 m implying that the nugget of the w evi variance is positively related to the nugget of gd variance according to the increasing patterns in γ of gd with the distance the semivariance of the vegetation coverage should also decrease with decreasing lag distance below the scale of 250 m however the w evi nugget c 0 γ 0 seems to be higher than zero because there would be c 0 0 for gd according to the slopes of γ h curves in fig 13e investigation on the exact relationship is expected in future by using fine resolution data of both gd and vegetation indices 4 3 practical significance this study highlights the regulation of groundwater resources for ecological benefits in the ordos plateau under the changing climate as indicated from study results the distribution of natural vegetation in this area is dominated by climate topography and groundwater although it can be also affected by other factors such as the soil properties the climate in zones b and c is relatively wet compared to zone a which results in a higher level of vegetation index and diversity however the vegetation growth and variance in zones b and c are sensitive to the change in gd whether the change in gd is triggered by the climate change and human activities in zone c where the aridity index is generally less than 4 the 50 w evi and 98 w evi are mostly sensitive to the change in gd especially when gd is less than 7 m fig 11 thus heavy utilization of groundwater for irrigation on croplands in zone c would cause significant lowering of groundwater level and degenerating of natural vegetation ecosystem in zone b the mostly fragmented distribution of groundwater is exhibited fig 9 and indicated by the lowest semivariogram range in gd fig 10a leading to the lowest semivariogram range in the vegetation index fig 8a as well as the highest variance in w evi for gd less than 5 m fig 12 and fig 13b shallow groundwater in zone b mainly distributes around small lakes and in lowlands between sand dunes forming patches of high density vegetation a decrease in groundwater level at the regional scale in zone b would increase the area of deep groundwater as that exhibited in zone a and significantly decrease the continuity of high density vegetation patches this is a negative effect for the ecosystem and the risk should be carefully assessed before groundwater utilization the vegetation distribution and variance in the arid zone a also depend on gd however as indicated from the lowest mean std and cv in evi table 2 and the smallest sill of w evi variance with shallow groundwater fig 12 the dependency seems to be not as significant as that in zones b and c even the 98 w evi slightly increases with the decreasing gd in zone a as shown in fig 11 the 50 w evi is almost independent on gd since gd is larger than 7 m in the major part of zone a fig 9 it is speculated that a decrease in the groundwater level in this zone would not cause a severe degradation in the vegetation coverage thus groundwater resources in zone a may be more usable for economic benefits without significant negative consequence in the ecosystem when the inter basin influence is insignificant in fact agricultural development in the region was rapid in the last decade benefitted by growing utilization of groundwater meanwhile desertification the study area is included in the original mu us desert has been controlled well from the vegetation protection that partially supported by using groundwater in artificial afforestation however the impact of groundwater utilization for the natural vegetation should be carefully examined at the basin scale because zones a b and c are linked together with the regional groundwater flow in the same aquifer system hou et al 2008 heavy decline of groundwater in any zone could cause a drawdown in other zones and lead to inter basin influences of groundwater utilization on ecosystems 5 conclusions in this study we investigate the relationship of spatial patterns between the vegetation cover in the ordos plateau china and groundwater in the regional quaternary cretaceous aquifers the 250 m resolution mean annual evi data during the growing seasons for the period 2000 2010 are extracted to represent the mean steady state vegetation cover the same resolution data of the altitude z annual mean air temperature t air mean annual aridity index ϕ and groundwater depth gd are collected to identify impacts of topographic climatic and hydrogeological conditions on the evi distribution a semivariogram analysis with the gule method is introduced to quantify the gd dependent variance in the residual evi w evi filtered from a linear regression with t air z and ϕ the major results and conclusions of this investigation are included in the following 1 at the regional scale there is a significant weak correlation between evi and the climatic and topographic controls when groundwater is deep gd 15 m the evi value is positively correlated with z and t air whereas negatively correlated with ϕ when groundwater is relatively shallow gd 15 m the correlation coefficients significantly change and the correlation between evi and z becomes negative implying the impact of groundwater 2 the w evi value approximately shows a stationary stochastic distribution with almost stable values of the semivariance in different zones when the lag distance is sufficiently large parameters in the semivariogram model of w evi are identified with uncertainties where the range could be as larger as 50 km but mostly like to be less than 30 km and larger than 5 km the sill generally falls between 3 10 4 and 12 10 4 and the m value varies generally between 0 5 and 1 0 less than that in the exponential and gaussian models the nugget effect in the w evi variance is weak 3 the pixel to pixel dependency of the w evi on gd is nonlinear and varies from the arid to semiarid zones the 98 threshold value of w evi is much more sensitive to the change in gd than the 50 threshold value this dependency is strong only when gd is smaller than 10 m 4 the semivariogram behaviors of the w evi are influenced by groundwater the sill of the w evi variance in the situation of gd 5 m is significantly higher than that in deeper groundwater situations the semivariogram range and m values of w evi are relatively insensitive to gd but the lowest range of w evi variance in zone b is caused by the lowest semivariogram range of gd the nugget of the w evi variance is positively related to the nugget of gd variance when groundwater is shallow which is expected to be investigated in detail with higher resolution data these study results highlight the role of groundwater on the vegetation heterogeneity at the landscape scale beside the climatic and topographic controls at the regional scale accordingly a potential negative impact of groundwater utilization in the study area on the vegetation ecosystems should be carefully considered credit
