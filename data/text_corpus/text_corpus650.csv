3250,porous media pm flow is essential in many natural and industrial processes the pm can be either hydrophilic or hydrophobic substantially affecting its imbibition and flow as opposed to a decreasing infiltration rate with time concave shape in hydrophilic pm an increasing rate with time convex shape has been observed in hydrophobic pm a commonly accepted mechanism to explain the convex infiltration pattern is still lacking the current study elucidates the latter by focusing on flow in hydrophobic capillary tubes under different boundary conditions a convex shape meniscus propagation in a hydrophobic capillary tube was observed for low ponded water depth at the tube inlet whereas a concave shape propagation was observed for high ponded water depths to the best of our awareness such a finding is innovative once the meniscus reached the tube outlet the hydraulic conductivity of the hydrophobic tube depended on the driving head for an open to air outlet while having a constant value for a submerged one the saturated hydraulic conductivity for an open to air capillary tube depends on the ratio between ponded water depth and tube water entry head r 0 and reaches a constant value measured for a submerged tube for r 0 20 8 while successfully predicting the wetting front propagation for r 0 20 8 the modified lucas washburn lw equation with slip boundary condition failed to predict the convex infiltration patterns the observed infiltration patterns in hydrophobic porous media in general and soils in particular seem inherent since capillary tubes are fundamental units in such media moreover flow in pm has been frequently modeled using a bundle of nonuniform capillary tubes the failure of the modified lw equation to predict the measured data for r 0 20 8 calls for a new approach to model water flow in hydrophobic tubes and pm keywords hydrophobic capillary tube convex infiltration pattern low driving head the flow resistance of capillary tubes immersed and open to air tube outlet 1 introduction flow in porous media pm and soils are of substantial importance in water infiltration into soils richards 1931 enhanced oil recovery orr and taber 1984 and geologic c o 2 sequestration juanes et al 2006 among others wettability control of flow in pm has been demonstrated and intensively studied zhao et al 2016 and references therein it has been widely reported that the wettability of pm can be changed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic water solid contact angle 90 such as following the exposure of pm to non aqueous phase liquid lipsius and mooney 2006 quyum et al 2002 wildfire doerr et al 2004 varela et al 2005 natural organic matter doerr et al 2000 and long term treated wastewater irrigation wallach et al 2005 a substantial impact on flow takes place when hydrophilic pm turns hydrophobic water repellency diminishes evaporation kettridge et al 2017 shokri et al 2008 turns stable flow into an unstable one wallach and jortzick 2008 wallach et al 2013 and references therein accelerating the transport of dissolved chemical substances ritsema and dekker 1996 in addition slippage along the solid interface in hydrophobic pm affects the flow regime lee et al 2007 while infiltration rate in wettable pm soils is initially high and decreases gradually with time concave shape a gradual increase of the infiltration rate with time convex shape has been found for hydrophobic pm and soils alagna et al 2019 abou najm et al 2021 beatty and smith 2014 bughici and wallach 2016 clothier et al 2000 debano 1981 feng et al 2001 hilpert and glantz 2013 letey et al 1962 lichner et al 2013 sándor et al 2021 wallach and graber 2007 wang et al 2000 different mechanisms have been suggested for convex infiltration pattern formation letey et al 1962 related this pattern to the rate dependent dissolution of organic molecules from the soil particle surface in the soil solution that gradually reduces soil hydrophobicity and increases the infiltration rate debano 1981 referred the change in infiltration pattern to the water vapor that advances into the soil pores coalesces on isolated wettable organic and inorganic sites and preconditions the soil feng et al 2001 explored the impact of ponded water depth at the surface on the infiltration pattern in artificially made hydrophobic sand they related the convex infiltration pattern to infiltration of the small pores once the pressure at the wetting front surpasses the water entry pressure of these pores once infiltrating these pores contribute to the overall flow and gradually increase the infiltration rate hilpert and glantz 2013 related the convex infiltration pattern in a hydrophobic pm to the formation of an initial water depth in the soil profile beatty and smith 2014 bughici and wallach 2016 and abou najm et al 2021 attributed the formation of convex infiltration patterns in water repellent soils to the breakdown of soil water repellency the convex infiltration pattern measured by feng et al 2001 and hilpert and glantz 2013 for a stable and uniform hydrophobic pm rules out the organic matter gradual dissolution mechanism suggested by letey et al 1962 and unevenly distributed hydrophobic sites theory proposed by debano 1981 since feng et al s 2001 study was made under low ponded water depth at the column inlet it is inconsistent with the assumption made by hilpert 2010 and hilpert and glantz 2013 that an initial wetting front depth is needed to form a convex infiltration pattern therefore a conclusive and coherent mechanism is still lacking to explain the formation of a convex infiltration pattern in hydrophobic pm and soils the current study aims to narrow the gap between the mechanism and the observed convex infiltration pattern in hydrophobic pm soils by considering the processes taking place for hydrophobic capillary tube processes this approach follows the common assumption that a capillary tube is an elementary pm unit bartley and ruth 1999 dahle et al 2005 hilpert 2010 noted that an accelerating downward infiltration has rarely been discussed in the literature for a single capillary tube nor experimentally observed our current literature search supports hilpert s conclusion consequently the current study focused on flow in hydrophobic capillary tubes and the conditions under which a convex infiltration pattern is formed furthermore we measured the saturated hydraulic conductivity resistance to flow of hydrophobic capillary tubes under different ponded water depths at their inlet and boundary conditions at the outlet this study intends to investigate feng et al s 2001 observation that the hydraulic conductivity gradually increases with the ponded water depth at the hydrophobic sand column inlet until reaching a constant value independent of the water depth fig 1 in feng et al 2001 2 materials and methods 2 1 theory flow is usually assumed in a hydrophilic capillary tube under no slip boundary conditions at the tube wall however slippage can occur along a hydrophobic surface berg et al 2008 lee et al 2007 schnell 1956 the modified poiseuille s law for steady water flow through a horizontal hydrophobic circular tube that includes a slip boundary condition is berg et al 2008 1 q π δ p 8 η l r 4 4 b r 3 where q is the flow rate δ p is the pressure drop η is the dynamic viscosity of the water l is the length of the tube r is the radius of the tube and b is the slip length eq 1 becomes poiseuille s law for b 0 2 q π δ p r 4 8 η l assuming the poiseuille flow profile throughout the capillary tube zhmud et al 2000 viscous friction force in a capillary tube as derived from eq 1 is 3 f η 8 η l r 2 4 b r q using eq 3 as a force term the newton dynamics equation as applied to water flow in a hydrophobic cylindrical capillary under a constant driving read in the vertical direction z becomes 4 ρ z d 2 z d t 2 dz dt 2 ρ g h w z 2 r γ cos θ 8 η z r 2 4 b r dz dt where ρ is the water density g is the gravitational constant h w is the ponded water depth at the tube inlet γ is the surface tension of water and θ is the water solid contact angle eq 4 with b 0 reduces to the modified lucas washburn equation zhmud et al 2000 which describes the flow in a capillary tube under a no slip boundary condition at the wall obeying poiseuille s law eq 2 2 2 experimental study 2 2 1 water invasion of hydrophobic capillary tubes cylindrical glass capillary tubes with inner radii of 0 3 or 0 5 m m an outer diameter of 7 m m and a length of 10 c m were used for the experimental study before coating the capillary tubes were soaked in a hot detergent solution alconox powdered precision cleaner and ultrasonicated for 15 min to remove trace contaminants they were then flushed with deionized water and ultrasonicated with deionized water for another 15 min finally the clean tubes inner wall was coated with a hydrophobic solution made up of isopropanol ethanol and salinized silica nanobeads delannoy et al 2018 which rendered the tubes hydrophobic the hydrophobic coating was uniform and stable in preliminary tests with glass slides the water entry pressure head was 1 2 c m and 0 66 c m for the 0 3 and 0 5 m m hydrophobic capillary tubes respectively an upper glass tube with an inner diameter of 5 m m and outer diameter of 7 m m in which distilled water was ponded was connected to the inlet of the hydrophobic capillary tubes using parafilm m sigma aldrich a mariotte bottle was connected to the water inlet port on the upper glass tube through a valve and tubing to keep ponded water depth constant prior to each infiltration run the end of the hydrophobic capillary tube was sealed using parafilm m the predefined water head larger than the water entry pressure head was then ponded in the upper glass tube and at the same time was connected to the mariotte bottle with the valve kept open upon quick removal of the parafilm m at the end of the capillary tube water infiltration took place for the predefined water head the meniscus position along the tube was monitored using a grayscale high speed andor zyla 5 5 scmos camera with a zoom lens af nikkor 24 85 c m nikon the captured frames were loaded and saved on a pc using solis imaging software solis 4 28 3 andor the camera speed was set to a maximum of 100 frames s the meniscus location along the tube was obtained by a frame by frame analysis using imagej https imagej nih gov ij three repetitions were performed for each water depth and the average values were further used the model for flow in a capillary tube eq 4 was used to predict the measured wetting front position along the tube following the measured water entry pressure head and jurin s law the contact angle for the 0 3 m m hydrophobic capillary tube was determined as 104 and 103 for the 0 5 m m capillary tube these two contact angles were introduced into eq 4 as the liquid solid contact line moves the dynamic contact angle differs from the equilibrium one zhmud et al 2000 for capillary flow in a hydrophilic capillary tube different velocity dependent contact angle relationships have been introduced into the governing equation to improve the prediction accuracy popescu et al 2008 while little attention has been paid to a hydrophobic one and the related knowledge is therefore limited the camera used in this study cannot capture the dynamic contact angle at the moving wetting front therefore eq 4 does not include the effect of velocity dependent contact angle in the current study the ambient temperature was 25 c for which the density viscosity and surface tension of the water were 1 g c m 3 0 89 m p a s and 72 m n m respectively a slip length b of 1 10 μ m was previously measured for hydrophobic capillary tubes with hydrophobic treatment and tube sizes similar to the current ones berg et al 2008 schnell 1956 therefore b 10 μ m and b 0 μ m were used in this study for slip and no slip boundary conditions respectively matlab ode45 solver was used to solve eq 4 2 2 2 velocity dependent resistance to flow in hydrophobic capillary tubes essential complementary information for the experimental study in section 2 2 1 is the two tested capillary tubes hydraulic conductivity inverse of resistance the pioneering work of schnell 1956 studied the slippage of water through hydrophobic capillary tubes he found that when the water was allowed to drip into the air at the outlet of a hydrophobic capillary tube the volumetric flow rate at low pressure was significantly slower than for a hydrophilic tube however when the capillary tube outlet was immersed in water the volumetric flow rate in the hydrophobic capillary tube was higher than that in the hydrophilic tube owing to the slippage effect in the former surprisingly feng et al 2001 also observed that hydraulic conductivity of hydrophobic pm was low at low ponded water depth compared to that of hydrophilic pm and noted that they allowed the water to drip into the air inspired by schnell 1956 measured the volumetric flow rate for open to the air and immersed boundary conditions we studied their effect on the tube s resistance to flow such results can be compared to the study outcomes of feng et al 2001 the capillary tube s resistance to flow namely saturated hydraulic conductivity k s is calculated by the ratio of velocity to hydraulic gradient 5 k s q a h w l 1 where a is the cross sectional area the water leaving the tube s outlet was weighed every 0 1 s precisa xt 6200c a periodical change in measured water mass generated by 1 mm water level fluctuations of the meniscus in the upper tube connected to the mariotte bottle could be detected by the high temporal resolution of the water weight measurements the average volumetric flow rate q was obtained by smoothing the periodically changing water weight fig 1 illustrates the experimental setup for infiltration and saturated hydraulic conductivity 3 results 3 1 invasion of hydrophobic capillary tubes the wetting front propagation trend in the 0 3 and 0 5 m m hydrophobic capillary tubes at different ponded water depths figs 2 and 3 respectively demonstrates its dependence on the ponded water depth at the tube inlet a convex pattern of meniscus propagation with time along the tube was obtained for the low ponded water depths of 2 4 cm for the 0 3 m m tube fig 2a and 1 3 and 2 8 cm for the 0 5 m m tube fig 3a b a linear pattern was obtained for a water depth of 5 cm in the 0 3 m m tube fig 2b and the 0 5 m m tube fig 3c whereas a concave propagation trend was obtained for the higher ponded water depth values for both tubes fig 2c i and fig 3d i denoting the ratio between ponded water depth and water entry head by r 0 feng et al 2001 a concave propagation trend was associated with r 0 7 5 for both capillary tubes figs 2 and 3 prediction of the wetting front propagation with time for the different ponded water depths in the 0 3 mm and 0 5 mm capillary tubes using eq 4 is depicted in figs 2 and 3 respectively providing concave patterns eq 4 failed to predict the convex patterns in fig 2a and 3a b however it worked better as ponded water depth increased figs 2 and 3 especially better at predicting the beginning of imbibition a satisfactory prediction by eq 4 was obtained for r 0 20 8 for both tubes fig 2h and 3h 3 2 resistance to flow in hydrophobic capillary tubes the relationship between saturated hydraulic conductivity and ponded water depth for hydrophobic capillary tubes of radius 0 3 m m and 0 5 m m is depicted in fig 4 a and b respectively for similar ponded water depths and r 0 as in figs 2 and 3 respectively two conditions at the tube outlet were used i open to the air and ii immersed in water the dashed line in fig 4 represents the related average hydraulic conductivity of the tube outlet immersed in the water fig 4 indicates that i a higher hydraulic conductivity was obtained for the hydrophobic capillary tubes whose outlet was immersed in water before a certain ponded water depth always independent of the driving head at the tube inlet ii in contrast the hydraulic conductivity depended on ponded water depth at the tube inlet when the outlet was open to the air the hydraulic conductivity became equal for the open to air and immersed conditions when the ponded water depth was 25 c m for the 0 3 m m capillary tube and 13 7 c m for the 0 5 m m t u b e note that r 0 20 8 for both cases fig 4 4 analysis and discussion 4 1 the implication of observed convex infiltration pattern our innovative results show the influence of the ratio of water driving head at the hydrophobic tube inlet to its water entry head r 0 on wetting front propagation along the tube figs 2 and 3 similar to independently observed water infiltration patterns into hydrophobic pm e g figs 2 and 3 in feng et al 2001 in the latter as for the hydrophobic tube figs 2 and 3 the infiltration rate increases with time for low ponded water depth at the column inlet and decreases with time as ponded water depth increases previous pm experiments have indicated a convex infiltration pattern under low ponded water depths at the soil or sand surface alagna et al 2019 abou najm et al 2021 beatty and smith 2014 bughici and wallach 2016 feng et al 2001 sándor et al 2021 analogous to the cases of low r 0 in fig 2a and 3a different interpretations have been provided for the initially low infiltration rate that increases in hydrophobic soils or pm the mechanism in feng et al 2001 failed in this study because it did not consider the uniform pore size of the hydrophobic capillary tubes used here the initial condition proposed by hilpert 2010 and hilpert and glantz 2013 was not adopted in this study either hence the results presented herein in particular for low r 0 fig 2a and 3a provide a new mechanism for the convex infiltration pattern for hydrophobic pm based on the frequently used bundle of capillary tubes approach to describing flow and transport in pm bartley and ruth 1999 dahle et al 2005 note that the use of a bundle of uniform capillary tubes for soil pores is a simplified approach czachor et al 2010 since the pores of real pm are preferably nonuniform and should be therefore represented by a bundle of nonuniform wavy rather than uniform capillary tubes wallach and wang 2013 we propose that the hydrophobic surface can induce an intrinsic convex infiltration pattern at low ponded water depth in hydrophobic pm unlike the very good fit between the concave measured infiltration patterns r 0 20 8 and the modified lucas washburn equation eq 4 that includes a slip boundary condition at the tube wall this model was unsuccessful in fitting the convex shaped wetting front propagation pattern low r 0 fig 2a and 3a from a qualitative point of view the difference between the slip and non slip boundary conditions in terms of predicted flow pattern was small particularly for a wider tube figs 2 and 3 eq 4 with no slip boundary condition has been widely used in the literature to predict capillary flow in a hydrophilic capillary tube popescu et al 2008 zhmud et al 2000 we were not aware of the unexpected failure of the modified lucas washburn equation for a hydrophobic capillary tube at low r 0 contrary to its success in high r 0 the failure at low r 0 calls for a different approach to modeling convex infiltration patterns at low r 0 that is beyond the scope of the current study 4 2 the dependence of hydraulic conductivity on driving head the tube s hydraulic conductivity resistance to flow varied substantially with ponded water depth r 0 values when its outlet was open to the air fig 4 the dependence of tube hydraulic conductivity on ponded water depth at the tube inlet in this case calls for a comparison with a similar study for hydrophobic pm feng et al 2001 feng et al 2001 also observed the dependence of hydraulic conductivity of hydrophobic pm on ponded water depth for an open to air outlet they attributed this dependence to the small pores with the higher water entry head being filled with water as ponded water depth increased leading to higher hydraulic conductivity feng et al s 2001 explanation does not apply to a single hydrophobic capillary tube comparing the results for hydrophobic and hydrophilic capillary tubes and based on the measured higher volumetric flow rate in the hydrophobic tube when its outlet was immersed in water schnell 1956 attributed the low volumetric flow rate observed at the low driving head with an open to air outlet to surface tension effect at the tube outlet we favor the interpretation of schnell 1956 about the surface tension effect at the tube outlet because we found that there was a dependence of hydraulic conductivity on the driving head when the outlet was open to air while it disappeared when the outlet was immersed in water fig 4 the modified poiseuille s flux eq 1 for a hydrophobic capillary tube in the vertical direction with the outlet immersed in water reads berg et al 2008 6 q π 8 η ρ g h w l ρ g r 4 4 b r 3 the hydraulic conductivity of a capillary tube k s obtained by the introduction of eq 6 into eq 5 is 7 k s ρ g 8 η r 2 4 b r eq 7 supports the experimental results depicted in fig 4 showing that the hydraulic conductivity of a hydrophobic tube was constant for an immersed outlet and independent of the pressure at the inlet the measured q for tubes whose outlet was immersed in water was slightly larger than that predicted by eq 6 for instance our measured water weight for the hydrophobic capillary tube of radius 0 5 m m with its outlet immersed in water subject to a ponded water depth of 1 3 cm was 0 037 g per 0 1 s instead of 0 033 g per 0 1 s as predicted by eq 6 this difference led to a measured k s of 41 7 cm s compared to a predicted k s of 37 2 cm s this difference can be attributed to using a mariotte bottle to maintain a constant water pressure at the tube inlet as this error is intrinsic to the experimental system setup its effect is consistent and assumed negligible when comparing the results obtained by the different experimental scenarios following eq 7 and based on the experimental results the hydraulic conductivity is an intrinsic property of the capillary tube with an immersed outlet it is independent of the ponded water depth fig 4 once the increase in water depth at the tube inlet does not change the flow regime k s turns independent of this depth however a further increase in the water depth may change the flow regime from laminar to turbulent for which k s again becomes dependent on the water depth increase as was demonstrated by schnell 1956 where flow in the capillary tube became turbulent re 2300 and the hydraulic conductivity changed sharply to a new constant value the re in our study was 127 3 and 467 7 respectively for the 0 3 and 0 5 mm tubes with an immersed outlet fig 4 our study outcomes were within the laminar regime and therefore justify the use of eq 6 since poiseuille s flux is only applicable in laminar flow using eq 5 introduces a dependence of k s of hydrophobic pm and capillary tube on ponded water depth as was found by feng et al 2001 and in the current study respectively the consequences of the current study call into the question of using eq 5 for open to air hydrophobic pm and capillary tubes as the surface tension effect at the outlet is disregarded in this equation this surface tension effect at the tube outlet can affect the pressure gradient in eq 5 the similar results found for a single capillary tube and pm feng et al 2001 expose the shortcoming of applying eq 5 to both cases for an open to air outlet note that eq 5 is broadly used for calculating k s of hydrophilic capillary tube or pm the calculated value is in fact independent of ponded water depth for open to air and immersed outlets note that the calculated k s for a hydrophilic tube is obtained by setting b 0 in eq 7 note that the k s calculated by eq 5 in feng et al 2001 and for the current study does not represent the actual hydraulic conductivity for flow in a capillary tube with an open to air outlet at low ponded water depth at its inlet the time dependent contact angle between the pendant drop and the tube s edge driven by the surface tension forms a pressure buildup behind the pendant drop meniscus wang et al 2013 the pressure buildup violates eq 5 and pseudo k s values are obtained for these cases however for higher water depth at the tube inlet the pendant drops buildup and falling off are fast which turns the associated pressure oscillations on the calculated k s negligible the k s then approaches to the values obtained for an immersed tubes outlet eq 5 is used herein to calculate the pseudo k s for flow in hydrophobic capillary tubes with an open to air outlet for the sake of comparison with feng et al s 2001 study a modification of eq 5 to include the surface tension effect on the pendant drop shape for open to air tube outlets is beyond the scope of the current study 4 3 the relationship between water invasion and tube s resistance to flow given that k s became constant for the tubes of different radii and water entry heads fig 4 beyond a certain ponded water depth r 0 20 8 the dependence of k s on ponded water depth for hydrophobic capillary tubes results from the inherent flow regime at the open to air outlet vicinity under the influence of the surface tension effect the dependence on ponded water depth occurs as water leaves the tube initially dripping out for the low ponded water depth and gradually forming a continuous jet with increasing ponded water depth k s becomes constant and independent of any further increase in water depth once a full jet develops r 0 20 8 and the surface tension effect was completely overridden fig 4 note that the tube s hydraulic conductivity for r 0 20 8 was equal for both open and immersed outlets of hydrophobic tubes and hydrophilic tubes alike it is worth noting that feng et al 2001 found a critical r 0 3 1 for the cessation of the dependence of k s for two hydrophobic sands of different water entry heads the excellent predictions made by the modified lucas washburn equation eq 4 particularly for the beginning of imbibition were also obtained for r 0 20 8 fig 2h i and 3h i 5 conclusions the effect of different ponded water depths at the inlet of a hydrophobic capillary tube and the tube radius on the meniscus propagation pattern along the tube and the tube s resistance to flow for submerged or open to air outlets were explored successfully these results were compared to flow in hydrophobic pm for which the convex infiltration pattern based on a fundamental understanding of this phenomenon is still missing the comparison of flow in a hydrophobic capillary tube with the flow in hydrophobic pm emanates from the common assumption that pm consists of capillary tubes we therefore hypothesized that the flow pattern in a single hydrophobic capillary tube might shed light on flow in hydrophobic pm the experimental results revealed that a convex infiltration pattern is obtained at low ponded water depth fig 2a and 3a as was previously reported for hydrophobic pm feng et al 2001 using a similar experimental setup with low ponded water depth this novel finding provided new insight into the convex infiltration pattern in hydrophobic pm beyond the similar infiltration pattern found for hydrophobic capillary tube and pm it is surprising that the dependence of hydraulic conductivity on ponded water depth as first observed by feng et al 2001 for hydrophobic pm was observed in the current study for hydrophobic capillary tubes we infer that this dependence is induced using eq 5 without considering the surface tension effect at the column or tube outlet the dependence of tube hydraulic conductivity on ponded water depth for open to air outlet valid for r 0 20 8 for the two tubes having different radii and water entry heads on the contrary the hydraulic conductivity of the hydrophobic tubes with an immersed tube outlet was constant and independent of ponded water depth it could be predicted based on poiseuille s law eq 7 without considering the surface tension effect at the tube outlet a modified lucas washburn equation assuming a poiseuille flow profile with slip boundary condition throughout the capillary eq 4 used to predict the measured wetting front position failed to capture the convex infiltration pattern that was obtained for low driving heads fig 2a and 3a this equation worked better as ponded water depth increases fig 2b g and 3b g significantly better predicting the initial stage of the imbibition it satisfactorily described the flow dynamics once a critical high driving head was reached r 0 20 8 for the two hydrophobic capillary tubes fig 2h i and 3h i the dependence of the hydraulic conductivity of these two tubes stops at r 0 20 8 consequently the dependence of hydraulic conductivity on ponded water depth and the later influence of hydrophobic capillary tube invasion are related eqs 4 with non slip boundary conditions and 5 have been widely used in the literature for a hydrophilic capillary tube their failure for r 0 20 8 calls for the development of alternative mathematical models for the invasion and flow of water into a hydrophobic capillary tube such a model could then be upscaled for modeling the infiltration pattern in hydrophobic pm soils credit authorship contribution

the tube wall however slippage can occur along a hydrophobic surface berg et al 2008 lee et al 2007 schnell 1956 the modified poiseuille s law for steady water flow through a horizontal hydrophobic circular tube that includes a slip boundary condition is berg et al 2008 1 q π δ p 8 η l r 4 4 b r 3 where q is the flow rate δ p is the pressure drop η is the dynamic viscosity of the water l is the

is the gravitational constant h w is the ponded water depth at the tube inlet γ is the surface tension of water and θ is the water solid contact angle eq 4 with b 0 reduces to the modified lucas washburn equation zhmud et al 2000 which describes the flow in a capillary tube under a no slip boundary condition at the wall obeying poiseuille s law eq 2 2 2 experimental study 2 2 1 water invasion of hydrophobic capillary tubes cylindrical glass capillary tubes with inner radii of 0 3 or 0 5 m m an outer diameter of 7 m m and a length of 10 c m were used for the experimental study before coating the capillary tubes were soaked in a hot detergent solution alconox powdered precision cleaner and ultrasonicated for 15 min to remove trace contaminants they were then flushed with deionized water and ultrasonicated with deionized water for another 15 min finally the clean tubes inner wall was coated with a hydrophobic solution made up of isopropanol ethanol and salinized silica nanobeads delannoy et al 2018 which rendered the tubes hydrophobic the hydrophobic coating was uniform and stable in preliminary tests with glass slides the water entry pressure head was 1 2 c m and 0 66 c m for the 0 3 and 0 5 m m hydrophobic capillary tubes respectively an upper glass tube with an inner diameter of 5 m m and outer diameter of 7 m m in which distilled water was ponded was connected to the inlet of the hydrophobic capillary tubes using parafilm m sigma aldrich a mariotte bottle was connected to the water inlet port on the upper glass tube through a valve and tubing to keep ponded water depth constant prior to each infiltration run the end of the hydrophobic capillary tube was sealed using parafilm m the predefined water head larger than the water entry pressure head was then ponded in the upper glass tube and at the same time was connected to the mariotte bottle with the valve kept open upon quick removal of the parafilm m at the end of the capillary tube water infiltration took place for the predefined water head the meniscus position along the tube was monitored using a grayscale high speed andor zyla 5 5 scmos camera with a zoom lens af nikkor 24 85 c m nikon the captured frames were loaded and saved on a pc using solis imaging software solis 4 28 3 andor the camera speed was set to a maximum of 100 frames s the meniscus location along the tube was obtained by a frame by frame analysis using imagej https imagej nih gov ij three repetitions were performed for each water depth and the average values were further used the model for flow in a capillary tube eq 4 was used to predict the measured wetting front position along the tube following the measured water entry pressure head and jurin s law the contact angle for the 0 3 m m hydrophobic capillary tube was determined as 104 and 103 for the 0 5 m m capillary tube these two contact angles were introduced into eq 4 as the liquid solid contact line moves the dynamic contact angle differs from the equilibrium one zhmud et al 2000 for capillary flow in a hydrophilic capillary tube different velocity dependent contact angle relationships have been introduced into the governing equation to improve the prediction accuracy popescu et al 2008 while little attention has been paid to a hydrophobic one and the related knowledge is therefore limited the camera used in this study cannot capture the dynamic contact angle at the moving wetting front therefore eq 4 does not include the effect of velocity dependent contact angle in the current study the ambient temperature was 25 c for which the density viscosity and surface tension of the water were 1 g c m 3 0 89 m p a s and 72 m n m respectively a slip length b of 1 10 μ m was previously measured for hydrophobic capillary tubes with hydrophobic treatment and tube sizes similar to the current ones berg et al 2008 schnell 1956 therefore b 10 μ m and b 0 μ m were used in this study for slip and no slip boundary conditions respectively matlab ode45 solver was used to solve eq 4 2 2 2 velocity dependent resistance to flow in hydrophobic capillary tubes essential complementary information for the experimental study in section 2 2 1 is the two tested capillary tubes hydraulic conductivity inverse of resistance the pioneering work of schnell 1956 studied the slippage of water through hydrophobic capillary tubes he found that when the water was allowed to drip into the air at the outlet of a hydrophobic capillary tube the volumetric flow rate at low pressure was significantly slower than for a hydrophilic tube however when the capillary tube outlet was immersed in water the volumetric flow rate in the hydrophobic capillary tube was higher than that in the hydrophilic tube owing to the slippage effect in the former surprisingly feng et al 2001 also observed that hydraulic conductivity of hydrophobic pm was low at low ponded water depth compared to that of hydrophilic pm and noted that they allowed the water to drip into the air inspired by schnell 1956 measured the volumetric flow rate for open to the air and immersed boundary conditions we studied their effect on the tube s resistance to flow such results can be compared to the study outcomes of feng et al 2001 the capillary tube s resistance to flow namely saturated hydraulic conductivity k s is calculated by the ratio of velocity to hydraulic gradient 5 k s q a h w l 1 where a is the cross sectional area the water leaving the tube s outlet was weighed every 0 1 s precisa xt 6200c a periodical change in measured water mass generated by 1 mm water level fluctuations of the meniscus in the upper tube connected to the mariotte bottle could be detected by the high temporal resolution of the water weight measurements the average volumetric flow rate q was obtained by smoothing the periodically changing water weight fig 1 illustrates the experimental setup for infiltration and saturated hydraulic conductivity 3 results 3 1 invasion of hydrophobic capillary tubes the wetting front propagation trend in the 0 3 and 0 5 m m hydrophobic capillary tubes at different ponded water depths figs 2 and 3 respectively demonstrates its dependence on the ponded water depth at the tube inlet a convex pattern of meniscus propagation with time along the tube was obtained for the low ponded water depths of 2 4 cm for the 0 3 m m tube fig 2a and 1 3 and 2 8 cm for the 0 5 m m tube fig 3a b a linear pattern was obtained for a water depth of 5 cm in the 0 3 m m tube fig 2b and the 0 5 m m tube fig 3c whereas a concave propagation trend was obtained for the higher ponded water depth values for both tubes fig 2c i and fig 3d i denoting the ratio between ponded water depth and water entry head by r 0 feng et al 2001 a concave propagation trend was associated with r 0 7 5 for both capillary tubes figs 2 and 3 prediction of the wetting front propagation with time for the different ponded water depths in the 0 3 mm and 0 5 mm capillary tubes using eq 4 is depicted in figs 2 and 3 respectively providing concave patterns eq 4 failed to predict the convex patterns in fig 2a and 3a b however it worked better as ponded water depth increased figs 2 and 3 especially better at predicting the beginning of imbibition a satisfactory prediction by eq 4 was obtained for r 0 20 8 for both tubes fig 2h and 3h 3 2 resistance to flow in hydrophobic capillary tubes the relationship between saturated hydraulic conductivity and ponded water depth for hydrophobic capillary tubes of radius 0 3 m m and 0 5 m m is depicted in fig 4 a and b respectively for similar ponded water depths and r 0 as in figs 2 and 3 respectively two conditions at the tube outlet were used i open to the air and ii immersed in water the dashed line in fig 4 represents the related average hydraulic conductivity of the tube outlet immersed in the water fig 4 indicates that i a higher hydraulic conductivity was obtained for the hydrophobic capillary tubes whose outlet was immersed in water before a certain ponded water depth always independent of the driving head at the tube inlet ii in contrast the hydraulic conductivity depended on ponded water depth at the tube inlet when the outlet was open to the air the hydraulic conductivity became equal for the open to air and immersed conditions when the ponded water depth was 25 c m for the 0 3 m m capillary tube and 13 7 c m for the 0 5 m m t u b e note that r 0 20 8 for both cases fig 4 4 analysis and discussion 4 1 the implication of observed convex infiltration pattern our innovative results show the influence of the ratio of water driving head at the hydrophobic tube inlet to its water entry head r 0 on wetting front propagation along the tube figs 2 and 3 similar to independently observed water infiltration patterns into hydrophobic pm e g figs 2 and 3 in feng et al 2001 in the latter as for the hydrophobic tube figs 2 and 3 the infiltration rate increases with time for low ponded water depth at the column inlet and decreases with time as ponded water depth increases previous pm experiments have indicated a convex infiltration pattern under low ponded water depths at the soil or sand surface alagna et al 2019 abou najm et al 2021 beatty and smith 2014 bughici and wallach 2016 feng et al 2001 sándor et al 2021 analogous to the cases of low r 0 in fig 2a and 3a different interpretations have been provided for the initially low infiltration rate that increases in hydrophobic soils or pm the mechanism in feng et al 2001 failed in this study because it did not consider the uniform pore size of the hydrophobic capillary tubes used here the initial condition proposed by hilpert 2010 and hilpert and glantz 2013 was not adopted in this study either hence the results presented herein in particular for low r 0 fig 2a and 3a provide a new mechanism for the convex infiltration pattern for hydrophobic pm based on the frequently used bundle of capillary tubes approach to describing flow and transport in pm bartley and ruth 1999 dahle et al 2005 note that the use of a bundle of uniform capillary tubes for soil pores is a simplified approach czachor et al 2010 since the pores of real pm are preferably nonuniform and should be therefore represented by a bundle of nonuniform wavy rather than uniform capillary tubes wallach and wang 2013 we propose that the hydrophobic surface can induce an intrinsic convex infiltration pattern at low ponded water depth in hydrophobic pm unlike the very good fit between the concave measured infiltration patterns r 0 20 8 and the modified lucas washburn equation eq 4 that includes a slip boundary condition at the tube wall this model was unsuccessful in fitting the convex shaped wetting front propagation pattern low r 0 fig 2a and 3a from a qualitative point of view the difference between the slip and non slip boundary conditions in terms of predicted flow pattern was small particularly for a wider tube figs 2 and 3 eq 4 with no slip boundary condition has been widely used in the literature to predict capillary flow in a hydrophilic capillary tube popescu et al 2008 zhmud et al 2000 we were not aware of the unexpected failure of the modified lucas washburn equation for a hydrophobic capillary tube at low r 0 contrary to its success in high r 0 the failure at low r 0 calls for a different approach to modeling convex infiltration patterns at low r 0 that is beyond the scope of the current study 4 2 the dependence of hydraulic conductivity on driving head the tube s hydraulic conductivity resistance to flow varied substantially with ponded water depth r 0 values when its outlet was open to the air fig 4 the dependence of tube hydraulic conductivity on ponded water depth at the tube inlet in this case calls for a comparison with a similar study for hydrophobic pm feng et al 2001 feng et al 2001 also observed the dependence of hydraulic conductivity of hydrophobic pm on ponded water depth for an open to air outlet they attributed this dependence to the small pores with the higher water entry head being filled with water as ponded water depth increased leading to higher hydraulic conductivity feng et al s 2001 explanation does not apply to a single hydrophobic capillary tube comparing the results for hydrophobic and hydrophilic capillary tubes and based on the measured higher volumetric flow rate in the hydrophobic tube when its outlet was immersed in water schnell 1956 attributed the low volumetric flow rate observed at the low driving head with an open to air outlet to surface tension effect at the tube outlet we favor the interpretation of schnell 1956 about the surface tension effect at the tube outlet because we found that there was a dependence of hydraulic conductivity on the driving head when the outlet was open to air while it disappeared when the outlet was immersed in water fig 4 the modified poiseuille s flux eq 1 for a hydrophobic capillary tube in the vertical direction with the outlet immersed in water reads berg et al 2008 6 q π 8 η ρ g h w l ρ g r 4 4 b r 3 the hydraulic conductivity of a capillary tube k s obtained by the introduction of eq 6 into eq 5 is 7 k s ρ g 8 η r 2 4 b r eq 7 supports the experimental results depicted in fig 4 showing that the hydraulic conductivity of a hydrophobic tube was constant for an immersed outlet and independent of the pressure at the inlet the measured q for tubes whose outlet was immersed in water was slightly larger than that predicted by eq 6 for instance our measured water weight for the hydrophobic capillary tube of radius 0 5 m m with its outlet immersed in water subject to a ponded water depth of 1 3 cm was 0 037 g per 0 1 s instead of 0 033 g per 0 1 s as predicted by eq 6 this difference led to a measured k s of 41 7 cm s compared to a predicted k s of 37 2 cm s this difference can be attributed to using a mariotte bottle to maintain a constant water pressure at the tube inlet as this error is intrinsic to the experimental system setup its effect is consistent and assumed negligible when comparing the results obtained by the different experimental scenarios following eq 7 and based on the experimental results the hydraulic conductivity is an intrinsic property of the capillary tube with an immersed outlet it is independent of the ponded water depth fig 4 once the increase in water depth at the tube inlet does not change the flow regime k s turns independent of this depth however a further increase in the water depth may change the flow regime from laminar to turbulent for which k s again becomes dependent on the water depth increase as was demonstrated by schnell 1956 where flow in the capillary tube became turbulent re 2300 and the hydraulic conductivity changed sharply to a new constant value the re in our study was 127 3 and 467 7 respectively for the 0 3 and 0 5 mm tubes with an immersed outlet fig 4 our study outcomes were within the laminar regime and therefore justify the use of eq 6 since poiseuille s flux is only applicable in laminar flow using eq 5 introduces a dependence of k s of hydrophobic pm and capillary tube on ponded water depth as was found by feng et al 2001 and in the current study respectively the consequences of the current study call into the question of using eq 5 for open to air hydrophobic pm and capillary tubes as the surface tension effect at the outlet is disregarded in this equation this surface tension effect at the tube outlet can affect the pressure gradient in eq 5 the similar results found for a single capillary tube and pm feng et al 2001 expose the shortcoming of applying eq 5 to both cases for an open to air outlet note that eq 5 is broadly used for calculating k s of hydrophilic capillary tube or pm the calculated value is in fact independent of ponded water depth for open to air and immersed outlets note that the calculated k s for a hydrophilic tube is obtained by setting b 0 in eq 7 note that the k s calculated by eq 5 in feng et al 2001 and for the current study does not represent the actual hydraulic conductivity for flow in a capillary tube with an open to air outlet at low ponded water depth at its inlet the time dependent contact angle between the pendant drop and the tube s edge driven by the surface tension forms a pressure buildup behind the pendant drop meniscus wang et al 2013 the pressure buildup violates eq 5 and pseudo k s values are obtained for these cases however for higher water depth at the tube inlet the pendant drops buildup and falling off are fast which turns the associated pressure oscillations on the calculated k s negligible the k s then approaches to the values obtained for an immersed tubes outlet eq 5 is used herein to calculate the pseudo k s for flow in hydrophobic capillary tubes with an open to air outlet for the sake of comparison with feng et al s 2001 study a modification of eq 5 to include the surface tension effect on the pendant drop shape for open to air tube outlets is beyond the scope of the current study 4 3 the relationship between water invasion and tube s resistance to flow given that k s became constant for the tubes of different radii and water entry heads fig 4 beyond a certain ponded water depth r 0 20 8 the dependence of k s on ponded water depth for hydrophobic capillary tubes results from the inherent flow regime at the open to air outlet vicinity under the influence of the surface tension effect the dependence on ponded water depth occurs as water leaves the tube initially dripping out for the low ponded water depth and gradually forming a continuous jet with increasing ponded water depth k s becomes constant and independent of any further increase in water depth once a full jet develops r 0 20 8 and the surface tension effect was completely overridden fig 4 note that the tube s hydraulic conductivity for r 0 20 8 was equal for both open and immersed outlets of hydrophobic tubes and hydrophilic tubes alike it is worth noting that feng et al 2001 found a critical r 0 3 1 for the cessation of the dependence of k s for two hydrophobic sands of different water entry heads the excellent predictions made by the modified lucas washburn equation eq 4 particularly for the beginning of imbibition were also obtained for r 0 20 8 fig 2h i and 3h i 5 conclusions the effect of different ponded water depths at the inlet of a hydrophobic capillary tube and the tube radius on the meniscus propagation pattern along the tube and the tube s resistance to flow for submerged or open to air outlets were explored successfully these results were compared to flow in hydrophobic pm for which the convex infiltration pattern based on a fundamental understanding of this phenomenon is still missing the comparison of flow in a hydrophobic capillary tube with the flow in hydrophobic pm emanates from the common assumption that pm consists of capillary tubes we therefore hypothesized that the flow pattern in a single hydrophobic capillary tube might shed light on flow in hydrophobic pm the experimental results revealed that a convex infiltration pattern is obtained at low ponded water depth fig 2a and 3a as was previously reported for hydrophobic pm feng et al 2001 using a similar experimental setup with low ponded water depth this novel finding provided new insight into the convex infiltration pattern in hydrophobic pm beyond the similar infiltration pattern found for hydrophobic capillary tube and pm it is surprising that the dependence of hydraulic conductivity on ponded water depth as first observed by feng et al 2001 for hydrophobic pm was observed in the current study for hydrophobic capillary tubes we infer that this dependence is induced using eq 5 without considering the surface tension effect at the column or tube outlet the dependence of tube hydraulic conductivity on ponded water depth for open to air outlet valid for r 0 20 8 for the two tubes having different radii and water entry heads on the contrary the hydraulic conductivity of the hydrophobic tubes with an immersed tube outlet was constant and independent of ponded water depth it could be predicted based on poiseuille s law eq 7 without considering the surface tension effect at the tube outlet a modified lucas washburn equation assuming a poiseuille flow profile with slip boundary condition throughout the capillary eq 4 used to predict the measured wetting front position failed to capture the convex infiltration pattern that was obtained for low driving heads fig 2a and 3a this equation worked better as ponded water depth increases fig 2b g and 3b g significantly better predicting the initial stage of the imbibition it satisfactorily described the flow dynamics once a critical high driving head was reached r 0 20 8 for the two hydrophobic capillary tubes fig 2h i and 3h i the dependence of the hydraulic conductivity of these two tubes stops at r 0 20 8 consequently the dependence of hydraulic conductivity on ponded water depth and the later influence of hydrophobic capillary tube invasion are related eqs 4 with non slip boundary conditions and 5 have been widely used in the literature for a hydrophilic capillary tube their failure for r 0 20 8 calls for the development of alternative mathematical models for the invasion and flow of water into a hydrophobic capillary tube such a model could then be upscaled for modeling the infiltration pattern in hydrophobic pm soils credit authorship contribution

3251,advances in satellite remote sensing rs techniques have greatly prompted the development of large scale evapotranspiration et models yielding several freely available global et products a comprehensive evaluation on these products is necessary for selecting the most suitable et products and developing large scale et models step forward in this study the accuracy and uncertainty of five rs based global et products mod16 ssebop gleam avhrr and bess were evaluated at multi scales at point scale their accuracy was evaluated through a direct comparison with in situ observations from 94 worldwide flux towers results indicate that accuracy differences of these five products vary with statistical metrics and land cover types the combination of all statistics illustrates that gleam and avhrr outperform three other products which is consistent with the findings of most previous continental scale studies the accuracy at basin scale was assessed through water balance analysis across 19 big river basins bess is found to be the product that is superior to four other et products at both monthly and multi annual scale which may be related with its low random error at point scale the uncertainty of these five products at pixel scale was assessed by the three cornered hat tch method and comparison analysis the tch outputs reveal that bess and ssebop are the two products with the lowest and largest relative uncertainty respectively that explains the good performance of bess at basin scale from another perspective as for the two modis based et products mod16 and ssebop their accuracy at fluxnet site scale is comparable in monthly et estimation however ssebop has special advantage in the capture of multiyear et patterns the comparison analysis indicates that ssebop is the product that agrees best with the ensemble mean not only on a global scale but also in four of the six continents our results imply that it is difficult or even impossible to figure out the best et product in all respects the selection of et products for scientific research should consider their performance difference in spatial scale as well as the influence of land cover and climate conditions keywords evapotranspiration satellite remote sensing three cornered hat evaluation accuracy uncertainty 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et composed of plant transpiration soil evaporation and canopy interception evaporation plays a pivotal role in global water cycle and energy exchanges it returns about two thirds of the annual terrestrial precipitation to the atmosphere and consumes more than half of the total solar energy absorbed by land surfaces oki and kanae 2006 jasechko et al 2013 pan et al 2020 besides due to the linkage between carbon uptake and water cycling the information on terrestrial et is useful to analyze ecosystem carbon cycling and climate change vinukollu et al 2011 novick et al 2016 fisher et al 2017 consequently accurate knowledge of et is crucial to understand the budgets of water and energy as well as their effects on ecosystems at different spatial and temporal scales however large scale ground based et measurements are difficult to achieve due to the sparse distribution of gauges heterogeneity of landscapes as well as complexity of controlling factors cleugh et al 2007 wang et al 2015 in order to tackle these difficulties different kinds of models for large scale et estimation have been developed such as machine learning models jung et al 2010 carter and liang 2019 zhao et al 2019 land surface models lsms sun et al 2017 zeng and cai 2018 data assimilation models rodell et al 2004 cui and jia 2021 and satellite remote sensing based models fisher et al 2008 miralles et al 2011a mu et al 2011 chen and liu 2020 specifically the essence of most machine learning algorithms is to upscale flux tower based et observations to regional or global scale the advantage of such algorithms lies in their high accuracy in et estimates however it must be noted that their high accuracy is guaranteed by enough inputs of in situ et observations baldocchi et al 2001 jung et al 2019 another significant disadvantage of such models is their lack of physical mechanisms machine learning models usually contribute little to the knowledge of physical process because of their black box characteristics gentine et al 2018 yuan et al 2020 in contrast the lsms have a clear physical mechanism and explicitly account for various thermodynamic and aerodynamic processes however the focus of lsms is the overall performances of water and energy flux simulations resulting in large uncertainties in et estimates cai et al 2014 bechtold et al 2019 besides their requirements for large amounts of input variables and extensive parameterizations irrelevant to et have limited their applications in et estimates data assimilation is promising to map regional and global et in a spatially and temporally continuous manner this technique has a unique ability on the combination of model simulated et and multi source observations so that the cumulative errors and uncertainty can be reduced jang et al 2013 cui and jia 2021 the main drawback of data assimilation technique lies in its heavy reliance on a numerical model which needs a lot of atmospheric forcing and is computationally demanding li et al 2009 satellite remote sensing rs provides an unprecedented global coverage of critical land surface and atmosphere parameters which enables et mapping at high temporal and spatial resolution with lower cost and less time it is even recognized by some researchers as the only viable means to map reginal patterns of et at the earth s surface in a globally consistent and economically feasible manner tang et al 2010 zhang et al 2016a accordingly a large amount of rs based et models have been developed since the advent of earth observation from space in 1957 chen and liu 2020 fisher et al 2020 several studies have provided comprehensive reviews of these rs based et models li et al 2009 zhang et al 2016b mohan et al 2020 following yan et al 2012 these rs based models can be broadly classified into two types according to their physical mechanisms the first category is energy balance based et model which is represented by the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 and the two source energy balance model tseb kustas and norman 1999 the second category is surface conductance based et models following chen and liu 2020 examples of this category include penman monteith models mu et al 2007 2011 canopy photosynthesis models sprintsin et al 2012 and et models that couple with photosynthesis luo et al 2018 although the above rs based et models have only been applied to regional scale in most studies they hold great potential for mapping et at continental and even global scale accordingly several global et products have been developed and released over the past few decades which provides a foundation for large scale hydro climatological studies however it must be noted that global et mapping is always not easy before these products can be confidently used accuracy evaluation and uncertainty analysis are required in terms of comparing these products with in situ observations and each other khan et al 2018 for example four satellite and model based et datasets were compared with et measurements from five eddy covariance ec based flux towers in khan et al 2020 to evaluate their accuracy over different land cover types across australia based on et observations from eight ec flux stations and water balance analysis over 22 river basins bai and liu 2018 compared and evaluated the accuracy of et products retrieved from three lsms across china xu et al 2019 evaluated the performance of twelve et products retrieved from machine learning remote sensing and lsms over conterminous united states using et observations from 15 ameriflux sites water balance analysis and three corned hat method similarly the performance of eighteen et datasets from machine learning remote sensing and lsms was evaluated by pan et al 2020 but this evaluation was performed at the global scale through the intercomparison of different datasets without the support of ground based observations a close look at the above and other similar studies indicates that current evaluation on global et products is mostly conducted at continental scale based on a limited number of ec based flux towers bai and liu 2018 khan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in addition the accuracy of et products retrieved from machine learning remote sensing and lsms with different mechanisms is usually assessed together chen et al 2014 baik et al 2018 pan et al 2020 under the support of water cycle multi mission observation strategy wacmos project michel et al 2016 and miralles et al 2016 evaluated four and three rs based global et datasets respectively however their evaluations were only performed over a three year period from 2005 to 2007 in view of the special advantage of remote sensing in global et mapping a comprehensive evaluation specialized in rs based et datasets at the global scale is still lacking inspired by this background the main objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and uncertainty of five global rs based et products at multi scales this was achieved through four procedures 1 their accuracy at point scale was evaluated through comparison with in situ observations from 94 flux stations 2 their accuracy at the basin scale was assessed through water balance analysis across 19 big basins 3 their uncertainty at the pixel scale was evaluated by three cornered hat tch method and 4 their uncertainty in quantity and trend at the global scale was assessed through comparison with each other 2 materials the materials used in this study include two parts namely the five rs based et products for evaluation and some ancillary datasets for reference 2 1 global rs based monthly et products this study was designed to evaluate global rs based et products at monthly scale however the application of rs technique is so widely that most machine learning lsms and data assimilation also treat rs observations as indispensable inputs for et estimation liang et al 2010 lettenmaier et al 2015 to be different from these three kinds of models the rs based models here refer to those developed at pixel scale with physical mechanisms by using rs images as the main inputs for et mapping based on this criterion and the popularity of different et products five rs based et products were selected in this study for evaluation details about these et products are summarized in table 1 the bess breathing earth system simulator et dataset is produced by the environmental ecology lab at seoul national university it is a simplified process based model that couples atmosphere and canopy radiative transfer canopy photosynthesis transpiration and energy balance jiang and ryu 2016 uniquely bess quantifies the flux contributions from sunlit shaded canopy through the explicit computation of direct diffuse radiation in the atmosphere and canopy radiative transfer the current bess et dataset is achieved by taking full advantage of modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products and is designed to be most sensitive to the variables that can be retrieved reliably yang et al 2020 the gleam global land evaporation amsterdam model et dataset is generated by a set of algorithms that separately estimate the different components of terrestrial evapotranspiration exclusively from satellite forcing data miralles et al 2011a miralles et al 2011b khan et al 2018 ever since its development in 2011 the model has been regularly revised aiming at the optimal incorporation of new satellite observed geophysical variables and improving the representation of physical processes martens et al 2017 specifically potential evaporation is simulated based on the priestley taylor pt equation evaporative stress factor is retrieved from vegetation optical depth and root zone soil moisture using a semi empirical model and interception loss is estimated with the gash analytical model miralles et al 2010 the avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer et dataset is produced by zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 using avhrr gimms ndvi normalized difference vegetation index ncep ncar reanalysis daily surface meteorology and nasa gewex surface radiation budget as inputs this model separately estimates three different components of land surface et specifically the canopy transpiration and soil evaporation are quantified using a modified penman monteith pm approach with biome specific canopy conductance retrieved from ndvi and open water evaporation is simulated using a pt approach ground based observations from 34 flux towers are utilized to parameterize the ndvi based canopy conductance model the mod16 et dataset is generated through an improved pm algorithm proposed by mu et al 2007 2011 its terrestrial et is calculated as the sum of evaporation from wet and moist soil evaporation from wet canopy and plant transpiration through canopy stomata he et al 2019 the required modis inputs to mod16 product include land cover mod12q1 albedo mcd43b2 and mcd43b3 leaf area index mod15a2 and enhanced vegetation index mod13a2 the meteorological forcing data is the gmao modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra daily meteorological reanalysis data including air temperature specific humidity and shortwave solar radiation in addition ameriflux tower observations have also been adopted for calibration purpose in the parameterization the ssebop et product is generated based on the simplified surface energy balance sseb model which is parameterized by senay et al 2013 for operational applications and renamed as ssebop its algorithms are designed based on sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and metric models allen et al 2007 the innovative aspect is that it applies predefined boundary conditions that are unique to each pixel for the hot and cold reference conditions thus eliminating the need to choose extreme anchoring hot and cold pixels singh et al 2014 chen et al 2016 the key inputs of the global ssebop et product include modis and gdas global data assimilation system data streams 2 2 ancillary datasets for reference in order to evaluate the above five et products six ancillary datasets were adopted for reference which were classified into three categories according to their utilities the first category is for accuracy evaluation at point scale including fluxnet2015 mcd12c1 and aridity index three datasets the fluxnet2015 dataset provides worldwide multiple temporal scale et observations collected at sites from multiple regional flux networks https fluxnet org data fluxnet2015 dataset it consists of two groups of products with different selections of variables for data distribution the fullset data product was adopted in this study which contains 212 sites with monthly et observations ranging discretely from 1991 to 2014 however due to the discontinuity of et observations only 94 flux towers with measurements as long as three consecutive years were adopted in this study the spatial distribution and list of these 94 towers are presented in fig 1 and table a1 respectively these sites cover a wide range of land cover types over all continents except for the antarctica jiang and ryu 2016 the data column labeled with le corr was selected as the reference for et evaluation it represents monthly latent heat flux corrected by energy balance closure correction factor details about this dataset as well as its processing methods are available in pastorello et al 2020 in order to further reduce the uncertainty of this reference dataset we only adopted le corr variables with quality frag filled with high confidence mcd12c1 provides annual land cover types at 0 05 spatial resolution for the entire globe following the igbp international geosphere biosphere programme classification scheme the land cover of the above 94 towers is classified into eight categories according to their vegetation types including evergreen needleleaf forest enf evergreen broadleaf forest ebf deciduous broadleaf forest dbf mixed forest mf shrublands shb savanna sav grasslands gra and croplands cro the aridity index ai is provided online by theconsultative group for international agricultural research cgiar consortium for spatial information csi which is expressed as the ratio of annual average precipitation to potential evapotranspiration this ai dataset is generated using the data available from worldclim global climate data with a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds zomer et al 2008 based on the united nations convention to combat desertification classification four climate zones were defined in this study as arid ai 0 2 semi arid 0 2 ai 0 5 dry sub humid 0 5 ai 0 65 and humid ai greater than 0 65 the second category is for the accuracy evaluation at basin scale which includes four datasets the first one is the basin boundary dataset retrieved from the interactive database of the world s river basins http riverbasins wateractionhub org which features a comprehensive list of river basins worldwide to match the coarse spatial resolution of global et products only 19 big basins with areas larger than 1000000 km2 were selected in this study their spatial distribution and details are presented in fig 1 and table a2 respectively precipitation is always indispensable for water balance analysis monthly precipitation with a spatial resolution of 0 25 produced by the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc was adopted here the gpcc has a unique capacity to collect perform quality control and analyze rain gauge data from across the globe rudolf et al 2010 schneider et al 2014 hence this dataset has commonly been used as reference data for assessing the reliability of other gauge based reanalysis and satellite related precipitation data sets on both regional and global scales sun et al 2018 streamflow datasets were mainly collected from the global runoff data center grdc https www bafg de grdc which has been the largest and mostly extensively used dataset for streamflow analysis at global scale do et al 2018 however due to the unavailability of river discharge observations at global scale grdc only provides monthly streamflow observations for 10 of the 19 big basins the time span of these observations is presented in table a2 in addition grdc archives global maps of mean annual runoff by combing observed river discharge information with a climate driven water balance model fekete et al 2002 which enables us to perform water balance analysis for all 19 big basins at the mean annual time scale the fourth dataset is the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa downloaded from the grace tellus website https grace jpl nasa gov which was used to account for the monthly change in terrestrial water storage the third category of our ancillary datasets is the digital elevation model dem generate by the global land one kilometer base elevation globe project it was utilized to investigate the impact of topography on et estimation on a global scale 3 methodology 3 1 statistical metrics four statistical metrics including pearson s correlation coefficient r bias b mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse were used in our work for accuracy evaluation equations of these metrics are expressed as r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 1 b x i y i 2 mae 1 n i 1 n x i y i 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 4 where n represents the sample size x i and y i represent the modeled and observed et respectively and the subscript i represents the sample number at the i th position the application of the above equations requires that the units of x i and y i should be consistent accordingly the unit of both rs based and in situ et datasets was converted to mm month following allen et al 1998 as 1 w m 2 0 0353 m m d 3 2 water balance analysis the accuracy of global et products at basin scale is usually assessed based on water balance analysis which assumes that the water balance closure across a whole drainage basin is dominated by precipitation p runoff r change in total water storage δ s and et as follows p e t r δ s 5 although δ s is assumed to be negligible over ten year periods in numerous studies the study of rodell et al 2015 suggests that such assumption does not hold true from the perspective of water cycle closure accordingly we derived monthly and annual δ s from grace derived twsa following the numerical differentiation algorithm proposed by xu et al 2019 consequently monthly and annual average et over the whole basin can be approximately estimated as p r δ s which was adopted as the benchmark to evaluate global et products at basin scale senay et al 2011 miralles et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 in consideration of the differences in time span of five et products we selected an 11 year common period from 2003 to 2013 to evaluate their performance at the basin scale the p and r inputs of eq 5 were retrieved from gpcc and grdc respectively 3 3 uncertainty analysis the three cornered hat tch method proposed by tavella and premoli 1994 was used in this paper to quantify the uncertainties of each et product at pixel scale where the true value of et is unknown its basic principles are described as below suppose the time series of monthly et at each pixel from 2003 to 2013 are expressed as x k k 1 2 n the subscript k represents the time series retrieved from the k th et product n stands for the total number of rs based et products to be evaluated and equals to 5 in this study a given set of x k is composed of the true value x t and the error term ε k as follows x k x t ε k k 1 2 n 6 obviously x t is required to obtain the error term of each et time series however due to the lack of x t at pixel scale it is impossible to calculate ε k like we did at point and basin scale in the tch method this problem is solved by defining the differences between the n 1 et products and one reference time series x r as y k m x k x r ε k ε r k 1 2 n 1 7 where x r can be chosen arbitrarily in any one of x k and y k m is an m n 1 matrix defined as y m n 1 y 11 y 12 y 21 y 22 y 1 n 1 y 2 n 1 y m 1 y m 2 y m n 1 8 s c o v y m n 1 9 where s represents the covariance matrix of y m n 1 and m stands for the sample size of x k the study period of our research ranges from 2003 to 2013 and thus m is equal to 11 for each calendar month according to galindo and palacio 2003 the unknown m n covariance matrix of the individual noise r is related to s as s j r j t 10 where the n 1 n matrix of j is expressed as j n 1 n 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 11 according to eq 10 the elements of matrix r r ij can be represented as r ij s ij r nn r in r jn 12 the combination of above equations indicates that the number of unknown elements n n 1 2 is larger than the number of equations n n 1 2 thus eq 12 cannot be directly solved the remaining n free parameters need to be assigned a unique value in a reasonable way in the tch method proposed by tavella and premoli 1994 a constraint d e t r 0 was suggested to keep the validity of the n free parameters in the solution domain then premoli and tavella 1993 proposed an optimal criterion to minimize the global correlation between the noises of time series while maintaining the positive definiteness of r finally galindo and palacio 1999 solved the constrained minimization problem based on the kuhn tucker theorem the objective function is defined as f r 1 n r nn 1 k 2 i j n r ij 2 13 subjecting to a constraint g r 1 n r nn r s k 0 14 where k d e t s n 1 and r s r nn r 1 n r nn r n 1 n r nn s 1 r 1 n r nn r n 1 n r nn t the initial conditions for the iteration are defined as r in 0 0 i n r nn 0 1 2 s s 1 1 s 1 1 1 t 15 the n free parameters can be determined by minimizing the objective function with the constraint conditions through iterative operation then the rest unknown elements can be solved using eq 12 the square root of the diagonal elements in the r matrix represents the uncertainty of the time series x k k 1 2 n and is stored as σ k k 1 2 n accordingly the ratio of σ k to the mean value of x k stands for the relative uncertainty more details about the tch method can be found in xu et al 2018 xu et al 2020 and liu et al 2021 3 4 trend analysis the mann kendall mk trend detection test proposed by mann 1945 and kendall 1975 has been commonly used to assess the significance of monotonic trends in climatological meteorological and hydrological data time series kisi and ay 2014 asoka et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 accordingly it was adopted in this paper to analyze the long term variation characteristics of global et products specifically the nonparametric mk test is based on the correlation between the ranks of time series and their time order for time series x t t 1 2 n with n observations the mk test statistic s is given as follows s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i 16 s g n x j x i 1 x j x i 0 x j x i 1 x j x i 17 where x i and x j are the date values at times i and j respectively obviously s depends only on the ranks of the samples rather than their actual values resulting in a distribution free test statistic in contrast parametric trend tests such as the regression coefficient test usually assume the samples follow the normal distribution consequently the mk test has the advantage that its power and significance are not influenced by the actual distribution of the data hamed 2008 the null hypothesis h0 of the mk test is that the time series are independent and identically distributed under this assumption the above s statistic is approximately normally distributed when the data length n is larger than 10 and its mean and variance are given as e s 0 18 v s n n 1 2 n 5 18 19 accordingly the null hypothesis can be tested by comparing the standard mk test statistic z defined in eq 20 with the standard normal distribution table at the desired significance level α if the calculated z is larger than z 1 α 2 the null hypothesis is invalid positive z values represent increasing trend while negative z values stand for decreasing trend otherwise the h0 hypothesis is accepted significance level of α 1 was applied in this research z s 1 v s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v s s 0 20 4 results 4 1 direct evaluation against flux tower observations the accuracy of global et products at point scale was evaluated through comparison with in situ observations from 94 flux towers this comparison was conducted for each et product at its original spatial resolution monthly et observations of each flux tower with three consecutive years were compared with the pixel values extracted based on site locations directly even if some adjacent sites may be located in the same pixel consequently the sample size of each et product is the same as each other across all sites which is 3384 at monthly scale and 282 at annual scale respectively the results are presented in table 2 which illustrates that the accuracy differences of these five products depend heavily on statistical metrics specifically the r at monthly scale ranges from 0 73 to 0 79 the best and worst agreement with in situ observations is achieved by bess and mod16 respectively the high accuracy of bess is also confirmed by mae and rmse which are 17 35 and 25 66 mm month respectively both are the lowest values among all products in contrast the highest values are achieved by ssebop with mae and rmse as high as 21 84 and 30 96 mm month respectively however when judged from the bias the bess product has achieved the worst accuracy in et estimation the b of bess mod16 ssebop gleam and avhrr is 5 58 4 07 1 12 0 54 and 0 52 mm month respectively obviously bess and mod16 have underestimated monthly et seriously by contrast the low b values of avhrr and gleam indicate that these two products outperform other three products significantly in terms of systematic error annual et was calculated as the sum of monthly values as a result in terms of b values the best and worst accuracy are still achieved by avrhh and bess respectively the b of avhrr is only 6 20 mm yr while the b of bess is as high as 67 01 mm yr however all the other three statistics show that the performance of these five products at annual scale is not the same as that at monthly scale for example the r values indicate that the worst agreement with in situ observations is achieved by gleam rather than mod16 judged from mae and rmse avrhh and mod16 become the two products with the highest and lowest accuracy respectively the above analysis suggests that it is difficult to judge which product is superior in all respects however considering the slight difference in r mae and rmse as well as the significant difference in b among different products we suppose that avhrr and gleam outperform three other products in order to investigate the reasons that contribute to the results displayed in table 2 the accuracy of these five products for each calendar month is shown in fig 2 the boxplots were defined by the difference between modeled and observed monthly et with the outliers removed it must be noted that the calendar month presented here was organized based on meteorological seasons meteorological seasons were reckoned by temperature with summer and winter being the hottest and coldest quarter of the year respectively considering the difference between northern and southern hemispheres the calendar month of the southern hemisphere was transformed to be consistent with the north hemisphere based on its meteorological seasons the median of these boxplots provides a good explanation for the reasons why the accuracy difference of these products is most significant in bias values to be specific monthly et is underestimated by bess in all months which explains why the largest negative bias is produced by this product in table 2 in table 2 significant negative bias is also observed in mod16 and ssebop products however the reasons leading to their underestimation are different fig 2 indicates that the underestimation of mod16 is only observed in warm seasons from april to october while the underestimation of ssebop is only observed in cold seasons from august to next april by comparison the difference between observed and modeled et of avhrr product is remarkably close to zero in all months except for august september october and november the overestimation in these four months makes avhrr have a positive and low bias at annual scale significant overestimation is also observed in some individual months for gleam product such as march april and may however this overestimation has been partly offset by the significant underestimation in august and september as a result gleam also has a positive and low bias at annual scale in table 2 in spite of the above differences there are still some common patterns shared by these five boxplots both the overall and interquartile range of these boxplots indicate that the seasonal variations of the differences in et follow a trend similar to sinusoidal curves with the peak values arising in summer the monthly average interquartile range of bess gleam avhrr mod16 and ssebop is 23 83 26 89 25 51 28 83 and 30 79 mm month respectively the accuracy of these five products over different land cover types is presented in fig 3 as the significance level of pearson s correlation coefficient is dependent on sample size it should be highlighted that the sample size over these five land cover types is different the sample size of forest shrublands savanna grasslands and croplands is 26 14 14 20 and 20 respectively consequently it is reasonable to say that all et products have achieved the highest accuracy over forest in terms of r the low values of mae and rmse over forest have also confirmed this high accuracy in addition the comparison of mae and rmse among different products indicates that the good performance of bess in table 2 also holds true over most land cover types among these five land cover types only avrhh is significantly superior to bess over savanna in this respect however when judged from the bias the situation becomes much more complex none of these five products performs significantly well over all land cover types specifically the et over savanna and grasslands has been underestimated by all products by comparison the lowest bias over these two land cover types is achieved by mod16 and ssebop respectively however mod16 has the largest bias over shrublands and grasslands which is particularly obvious over grasslands as a result its overall bias in table 2 is as high as 4 07 mm month among all products bess is the only one that has underestimated et over all land cover types due to the largest negative bias over forest savanna and croplands as well as the second largest negative bias over the rest two land cover types bess has underestimated et most seriously in table 2 except for bess all products have overestimated the et over forest on the contrary the et over croplands has been underestimated by all products except for avhrr however the same for both forest and croplands is that the lowest bias among all products is achieved by avhrr in addition the bias of avhrr over savanna and grasslands is quite close to the best one the combination of these two aspects makes avhrr outperform other products in table 2 in terms of bias fig 3 also shows the monthly rmse values over different land cover types to investigate the seasonality of these et products the results indicate that these products perform better in cold seasons than in warm seasons which holds true for all land cover types except for forest specifically all products present obvious unimodal curves of rmse in croplands with the peak values observed in july by comparison bimodal patterns of rmse are observed for all products in savanna with another peak values occurring in april the rmse values over shrublands also follow a trend similar to unimodal curves but there is significant difference in peal time of five et products the maximum rmse values over grasslands are also observed in warm seasons for all products except for bess however its seasonal fluctuation range is much smaller than the above three land cover types in addition the rmse of grassland in the first half of a year is much higher than the values in the second half the combination of these two aspects makes the seasonal variations of rmse over grasslands not noticeable similar to grasslands the seasonal variations of rmse over forest are relatively stable in comparison with three other land cover types however its rmse values in the second half of a year are much higher than the values in the first half with the peaks for most et products observed in autumn rather than in summer the performance of these five et products over different climate zones is summarized in table 3 it can be explained from two aspects the performance of certain product over four climate zones and the performance of five products over certain climate zone for the first aspect judging from et accuracy in terms of rmse and r the best performance of all products is observed in humid zone for bess mod16 and ssebop their best performance in humid zone is also confirmed by the mae values by contrast the worst performance over different climate zones is dependent heavily on the statistical metrics uniformity is only observed in r values which suggests that all products achieve the lowest accuracy in arid zone the worst performance of two modis based et products mod16 and ssebop in arid zone is also confirmed by their b values judging from mae and rmse both bess and gleam achieve lowest accuracy in dry sub humid zone and avhrr achieves lowest accuracy in arid zone the values of mae and rmse also demonstrate the similarity in performance of two modis based et products the mae and rmse values show that their lowest accuracy is observed in semi arid and dry sub humid zone respectively for the second aspect the performance of different datasets over certain climate zone is helpful to select the most suitable et product for regional study judging from the values of mae rmse and r bess shows the best performance among these five products in semi arid and humid zones and avhrr achieves the highest accuracy in dry sub humid zone as for the most suitable et product for arid zone it is gleam bess ssebop and avhrr respectively depending on the values of mae rmse r and b in addition the superiority of avhrr in b values among all products is also observed in semi arid and humid zones by comparison mod16 has no advantage over other products in any climate zone and any statistical metric 4 2 accuracy and uncertainty evaluation at basin scale accuracy evaluation at basin scale was conducted based on water balance analysis in order to make sure that the overlapping area of different et products is consistent within the same basin boundary all et products were resampled to 0 25 0 25 grid resolution with nearest neighbor assignment algorithm the center of a grid was used to determine whether this grid is inside or outside a basin boundary it means that only grids whose center is within the arcs of the basin boundary were selected for evaluation the results are summarized in table 4 it should be noted that the water balance analysis at monthly scale was only performed for 10 big basins with monthly streamflow observations while at the mean annual time scale it was performed for all 19 big basins accordingly the sample size for each et product is the same as each other across all basins which is 889 at monthly scale and 11 at the mean annual time scale respectively at monthly scale avhrr and bess are superior to three other products in three out of the four statistical metrics specifically the r mae and rmse of avhrr are 0 89 14 70 mm month and 20 07 mm month and these three metrics of bess are 0 88 15 13 mm month and 20 47 mm month respectively the slight difference in above values suggests that the accuracy of these two products is comparable to each other by comparison the performance of gleam is significantly inferior to these two products although it has advantage over two modis based et products in all these three metrics however when judged from the bias mod16 becomes the product with the best performance followed by bess avhrr ssebop and gleam their b values are 1 19 1 61 5 51 5 69 and 6 66 mm month respectively mod16 and bess have significant advantage over other products in this respect on the whole the accuracy of bess is not the best in any statistical metric but it has reached a level comparable to the best in all metrics therefore it is reasonable to conclude that bess is the most suitable et proxy for big basins at monthly scale in terms of mae and rmse the superiority of bess becomes more obvious at the mean annual time scale it has achieved the lowest mae and rmse values among all products followed subsequently by ssebop avhrr gleam and mod16 however based on the values of b the accuracy of these five products follows the order mod16 bess gleam avhrr ssebop the significant advantage of mod16 and bess in b values still holds true at the mean annual time scale the tch method was adopted in this study for uncertainty evaluation fig 4 shows the uncertainties of these five et products during the period of 2003 2013 at annual scale the lowest uncertainty is achieved by gleam 9 99 mm yr followed subsequently by bess 11 48 mm yr avhrr 14 94 mm yr ssebop 24 65 mm yr and mod16 25 38 mm yr the comparison indicates that uncertainties observed in bess gleam and avhrr are relatively stable over different river basins while those observed in mod16 and ssebop are fluctuated significantly specifically the variation range observed in bess gleam and avhrr is 29 69 18 03 and 28 26 mm yr respectively in contrast mod16 and ssebop have a variation range as high as 90 mm yr in addition the combination of fig 4a and fig 1 shows that the uncertainty of these et products has some common spatial patterns specifically the seven big basins with the highest mean uncertainty are all distributed in the southern hemisphere which are lake eyre basin 41 95 mm yr lake chad basin 27 86 mm yr parana river basin 27 53 mm yr zambezi river basin 24 50 mm yr nile river basin 21 55 mm yr niger river basin 20 57 mm yr and congo river basin 19 18 mm yr respectively the highest uncertainty over the lake eyre basin is mainly attributed to ssebop product the uncertainty of which is as high as 102 40 mm yr in contrast the five basins with the lowest mean uncertainty are all located in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere which are lena river basin 7 05 mm yr mackenzie river basin 7 45 mm yr yenisei river basin 8 43 mm yr amur river basin 9 68 mm yr and ob river basin 9 83 mm yr respectively at monthly scale the average uncertainty of bess gleam avhrr mod16 and ssebop is 1 68 1 83 2 29 3 16 and 3 78 mm month respectively the low uncertainty of bess partly explains why this product is the most suitable et proxy for big basins in table 4 as for temporalandspatial variations the standard deviation sd of these five et products uncertainties is 1 26 1 23 1 55 3 43 and 3 37 mm month respectively by comparison the variations of et uncertainty are the lowest in bess and gleam moderate in avhrr and the highest in mod16 and ssebop nevertheless fig 4b shows that the uncertainty of these five products shares some common temporal patterns the uncertainty in cold seasons is lower than that observed in warm seasons which is particularly obvious for two modis based products it should be noted that the basins labeled with 1 3 4 14 19 are located in the southern hemisphere the seasons of which are opposite to those in the northern hemisphere 4 3 uncertainty quantification at pixel scale the tch method was performed pixel by pixel to quantify the uncertainty of these global et products at annual scale from 2003 to 2013 it was conducted at 0 25 0 25 grid resolution for all et products the same as water balance analysis fig 5 presents the spatial distribution of relative uncertainty ru which is defined as the ratio of uncertainty to the annual average et of the corresponding product compared with uncertainty ru is much more comparable among different et products because all products share the same ru variation range from 0 to 100 in terms of the mean values bess has the lowest relative uncertainty 4 68 followed subsequently by avhrr 5 11 gleam 6 80 mod16 7 57 and ssebop 16 12 judged from its variations with latitudes all products share two obvious peak zones near 15 n and 25 s the first peak zone is mainly caused by the high ru values in saharanafrica while the second is related with the high ru values in australia ssebop presents much higher ru values than other products in all latitudinal zones except for low latitude area where its ru is comparable to that observed in mod16 that explains why the overall ru of ssebop is as high as 16 12 for ssebop low ru values are only observed in latitudinal zones around the equator in comparison other four products present stable and low ru values in all latitudinal zones except for the above two peak zones as for the regional distribution of ru ssebop exhibits the most significant spatial heterogeneity with a sd of 0 15 followed by mod16 0 10 gleam 0 06 avhrr 0 05 and bess 0 04 except for saharanafrica and australia mentioned above the regions with extremely high ru values are both product and continent specific as for ssebop a large number of pixels with high ru values are observed in tibet plateau andes patagonia rocky mountains and namibiaformpartofthe southafrica plateau a close look at mod16 indicates that the ru over the himalaya mountains is also much higher than its surrounding areas obviously the complex terrain in mountain areas has a negative impact on the performance of et products this negative impact observed in andes patagonia rocky mountains and namibia also holds true for gleam in addition both gleam and mod16 have a large number of pixels with high ru in thar desert bordering western indian and southeast pakistan given the high ru values of sahara africa as well as the central and west of australia observed in all products it is obvious that the desert land cover also exerts negative impact on et estimation as for the two products with the lowest ru values the sd of bess is a little lower but avrhh exhibits homogeneous ru distribution in more continents specifically the pixels with high ru values of avhrr are mostly concentrated in the two common high value areas shared by all products namely sahara africa and australia by contrast bess has a large number of pixels with high ru values concentrated in the middle of north america and a sporadicdistribution of high ru in north china and south america 4 4 comparison of et products in terms of annual mean and trend the intercomparison of different et products is essential for increasing our understanding of their uncertainty the focus of this study is the comparison of the five et products listed in table 1 so our comparison was performed over an 11 year common period of these five products to evaluate their performance in terms of annual mean and trend from 2003 to 2013 fig 6 shows the annual average et of these five products with 0 25 0 25 grid resolution due to the absence of et estimation in extremely arid areas such as saharanafrica and taklimakandesert the spatial scope of bess and mod16 is not consistent with three other products accordingly the ensemble mean et of these five products at global scale can only be synthetized by products with valid et value at the target pixel this must be kept in mind when comparison is performed in fig 6 for example the extremely high et values of mod16 and bess in 20 nare mainly caused by the absence of et estimation in saharanafrica in addition due to the small number of pixels with valid et values in high latitudes of the southern hemisphere some obvious outliers are observed to the south of 55 s apart from these two latitudinal zones the variations of all et products with latitudes generally follow the same trend with the peak values arising at the equator the comparison also reveals several significant differences among these five products specifically bess has the lowest et value among all products in the middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere which holds true for all latitudinal zones to the north of 30 n in contrast for most latitudinal zones located from 10 s to 35 s the lowest et is achieved by mod16 product coincidentally avhrr has produced the highest et within the same latitudinal zones and the et of three other products seems to be the average of mod16 and avhrr in terms of rmse the best agreement with the ensemble mean in fig 6f is achieved by gleam 47 60 mm yr followed subsequently by ssebop 61 75 mm yr avhrr 79 37 mm yr bess 90 99 mm yr and mod16 145 86 mm yr however in terms of bias the matching degree of these five products against the ensemble mean follows the order mod16 10 35 mm yr ssebop 20 50 mm yr gleam 23 63 mm yr bess 33 01 mm yr avhrr 37 04 mm yr however it should be noted that the low bias of mod16 product is achieved by the absence of et values in extremely arid areas therefore the combination of these two statistics shows that ssebop and gleam are the two products that agree best with the ensemble mean on a global scale the annual average et of these five products in different continents is summarized in table 5 the results achieved by rodell et al 2015 under the support of global energy and water cycle experiment gewex project are also presented for comparison the ensemble mean et of these five products is 460 60 mm yr at global scale the largest et is achieved by mod16 512 79 mm yr followed subsequently by avhrr 502 69 mm yr gleam 483 40 mm yr ssebop 456 95 mm yr and bess 449 45 mm yr the absence of et estimation in taklimakandesert and saharanafrica contributes most to the overall high et of mod16 product which is confirmed by its highest et value in asia and the second largest value in africa among all products in addition mod16 also achieves the largest et in north america which contributes the rest part to its largest et at the global level the estimation of et in bess product is also absent in parts of saharanafrica and taklimakandesert as a result bess produces the largest et value in africa among all products however contrary to mod16 product the et of bess is lowest both in asia and on a global scale the contrary between mod16 and bess is also observed in australia where mod16 produces the lowest et among all products while bess produces the highest nevertheless the highest et of bess product in australia and africa cannot reverse its lowest value at the global level because it has achieved the lowest et in all the remaining continents the above analysis indicates that bess and mod16 are the two products that have produced global et with the largest spatial heterogeneity it is not only because they have achieved the lowest and largest et on a global scale but also because nine of the twelve extreme values maximum and minimum et of the six continents are achieved by these two products the remaining three extreme values are achieved by gleam and avhrr respectively to be specific gleam has produced the largest et in europe and the lowest in africa among all products and avhrr has produced the largest et in south america in comparison ssebop is theclosestmatch for the ensemble mean of these five products firstly its et on a global scale is 456 95 mm yr which is very close to the ensemble mean 460 60 mm yr secondly this similarity is also observed in four of the six continents including asia australia europe and north america for africa and south america the best agreement with the ensemble mean is achieved by gleam and mod16 respectively based on satellite measurements first and data integrating models second optimized flux estimates of earth s water cycle from 2000 to 2010 were qualified by rodell et al 2015 in a variational framework the similarity in time span makes it possible for us to conduct a direct comparison obviously the best agreement with rodell et al 2015 is achieved by gleam product their similarity is not only confirmed by the global mean value but also the annual average et in north and south america et in asia and europe was optimized together as eurasia in rodell et al 2015 with a value of 422 66 mm yr which is also very close to the et statistics of gleam in these two continents as for africa and australia the best agreement with rodell et al 2015 is achieved by avhrr and ssebop product respectively the mk test was adopted in this study to detect the annual trend of these five et products from 2003 to 2013 at the significance level of α 1 the results are shown in fig 7 none of these products present significant increasing or decreasing trend inmostregionsaroundtheworld this is particularly true for ssebop product which has only a limited number of sporadic pixels with significant trend the number of pixels with significant trend is also relatively small for gleam product however it shows apparently intensive distribution of pixels with increasing trend in the high latitudes of russia and parts of eastern europe mongolian plateau and central asia in contrast a large number of pixels with significant trend are observed in mod16 and avhrr specifically the pixels with significant trend for avhrr are mostly in a state of et increasing and concentrated in the amazonbasin parts of eastern europe the high latitudes in russia and parts of north africa pixels with significant increasing trend in amazon basin are also observed in mod16 product however only a small number of these pixels overlap with the above pixels observed in avhrr product moreover the trend analysis of mod16 product indicates that et is decreasing in some parts of the amazon basin which is opposite to the findings of avhrr product significant increasing trend is also observed in parts of north africa for mod16 product however compared with avhrr product these pixels are more concentrated in the west rather than the central and east another significant difference between mod16 and avhrr is that mod16 has a large number of pixels with significant decreasing trend located in central africa bess product also confirms the decreasing of et in central africa but its spatial scope is very limited and fragmented by contrast it has relatively concentrated distribution of pixels with decreasing trend in the west of central asia alaska of the united states and some parts of south america fig 7f shows the combination results of these five et products in terms of annual trend the intersection indicates that these products share few pixels with common significant trend while the union shows that the pixels with possible significant trend are mostly distributed in the north of south america the central and north of africa the high latitudes of russia the west of central asia and parts of eastern europe 5 discussion five global rs based et products were evaluated at multi scales in this study our original intention was to figure out the best et product in all respects however the results illustrate that it is difficult or even impossible to achieve this purpose it is not only because the accuracy difference of these et products varies with statistical metrics and spatial scales but also because there is significant uncertainty involved in the reference datasets and evaluation methods therefore it is necessary to discuss these issues and evaluate present study in light of work done before 5 1 uncertainty of reference datasets and evaluation methods the uncertainty of et evaluation at point scale mainly arises from the scale mismatch between global et products and eddy covariance ec observations to be specific in this study the spatial resolution of five monthly et products ranges from 1 km to 0 5 however the footprint of ec observations is usually limited to a few kilometers from the flux tower zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2015 therefore a direct comparison of ec based measurements and rs based estimation is always subject to the issue of scale mismatch which is particularly obvious over complex topographical and atmospheric conditions long et al 2014 song et al 2018 et upscaling technique is usually suggested to acquire ground truth et data at the satellite pixel scale however the performance of such technique relies heavily on the density of flux towers which limits its applications on a continent scale liu et al 2016 li et al 2018 consequently a direct comparison between ec observations and model estimates is still adopted in most studies to evaluate rs based et products for large scale areas similarly the accuracy evaluation presented in table 2 was performed for each et product at its original spatial resolution in order to investigate the impact of scale mismatch table 6 shows the accuracy of five et products across all flux towers after they were resampled with nearest neighbor assignment algorithm specifically mod16 and ssebop were resampled from 1 km and avhrr was resampled from 8 km to 0 25 grid resolution consequently these three products are now consistent with the original resolution of gleam bess dataset provides two et products with different spatial resolution by itself in comparison with its performance at 1 km resolution here we present its accuracy at 0 5 grid resolution compared with table 2 all statistical metrics indicate that there is a slight decrease in accuracy for two modis based et products the mae and rmse values of avhrr have also conformed the relatively poor performance of these resampled et products although some superiority in bias is observed for avhrr as for bess significant difference in performance is observed between its 1 km and 0 5 et product in table 2 bess at 1 km resolution has achieved the lowest mae and rmse among all products at monthly scale however all statistical metrics show that its performance at 0 5 grid resolution is much poorer than all other products resampled to 0 25 grid resolution basin wide et estimates from water balance analysis provide benchmark values at regional scale as a result the water balance approach has also been adopted in numerous studies to evaluate the remotely sensed et estimates zeng et al 2012 velpuri et al 2013 wan et al 2015 however this approach also involves significant uncertainty firstly because et is computed as the residual of water balance equation the quality of precipitation and runoff inputs has a direct influence due to the unavailability of runoff observations on a global basis we only performed monthly water balance analysis for 10 of the 19 big basins using monthly streamflow observations as a supplement the global maps of mean annual runoff provided by grdc were adopted to conduct water balance analysis for all 19 big basins at the mean annual time scale the comparison of grdc derived and observed annual average runoff over these ten basins are presented in fig 8 obviously the mean annual runoff provide by the grdc with a spatial resolution of 0 5 agrees well with the observed discharges over these ten basins the r mae rmse and b are 0 97 20 88 mm yr 24 55 mm yr and 3 56 mm yr respectively the values of mae rmse and b are much lower than the metrics of five et products in table 4 which demonstrates the validity of this spatially distributed grdc dataset over all 19 big basins the second uncertainty source of water balance analysis is related with the assumption that terrestrial water storage change δ s is small enough to be negligible over ten year periods different measures have been taken in previous studies to deal with this assumption for example δ s was assumed to be negligible by velpuri et al 2013 and mao and wang 2017 when they conducted water balance analysis for et evaluation at a multi annual scale by contrast both wan et al 2015 and bai and liu 2018 questioned its validity and used grace measurements to quantify basin scale δ s in this study we adopted the grace derived terrestrial water storage anomaly to account for δ s at both monthly and multi annual scale here we present the annual average δ s from 2003 to 2013 in fig 8 as an example to test the above hypothesis significant and positive δ s is observed in four out of the ten basins including amur river lena river ob river and yenisei river however all the remaining basins present δ s very close to zero the absolute average δ s over these ten basins is 4 26 mm yr compared with et value in table 5 and runoff value in fig 8 δ s is indeed small enough to be negligible over ten year periods 5 2 evaluating current work in light of work done before given the above uncertainties a comparison with previous studies is necessary to find something in common here we only focus on the comparison of different et products at fluxnet site scale because the selected basins for water balance analysis vary significantly in different studies based on ec observations from eight chinaflux stations from 2003 to 2016 li and he 2020 validated mod16 and ssebop products in china their results showed that these two products had overall comparable accuracies at site scale but the et distribution of ssebop product was more reasonable at the basin and national level monthly mod16 and ssebop products were validated over the conterminous united states using ec observations from 2001 to 2007 in velpuri et al 2013 they also found that the accuracy of these two products was overall comparable however ssebop showed higher performance for grassland and forest classes while mod16 showed improved performance in the savanna class the b values in fig 3 confirm the superiority of mod16 over ssebop in savanna and the superiority of ssebop over mod16 in grasslands on a global scale however fig 3 also indicates that the accuracy difference of these two products is dependent on statistical metrics when judged from mae and rmse mod16 is superior to ssebop in all the above three classes across all sites at monthly scale in table 2 mod16 has advantages over ssebop in terms of mae and rmse while ssebop shows its advantages over mod16 in r and b values it is therefore reasonable to conclude that these two modis based products have achieved comparable accuracies at monthly scale however when judged from annual statistics all the above four statistics demonstrate the better performance of ssebop product that explains why the distribution of china s multiyear et pattern obtained from ssebop is more reasonable in li and he 2020 jiang and ryu 2016 compared 8 day bess and mod16 products with in situ observations in fluxnet2015 dataset the rmse and b values of bess were 0 78 and 0 10 mm d while those of mod16 were 0 86 and 0 14 mm d barraza et al 2019 conducted a comparison of bess and mod16 products over a eucalypt forest savanna in northern australia the reported rmse at 8 day temporal scale of mod16 and bess was 31 14 and 41 40 w m2 respectively a similar study was performed by wei et al 2019 to evaluate the performance of these two products across grasslands in northern china their results based on seven flux towers showed that besshad a higher et accuracy across different grassland ecosystems the better performance of bess than mod16 in grasslands is also confirmed in fig 3 however our results show that the superiority of mod16 over bess in savanna on a global scale is only valid in terms of b values across all sites in table 2 bess has the largest absolute bias and lowest mae and rmse among all products at monthly scale suggesting it is a product with low random error and large systematic error gleam is another product that has been evaluated and compared most in previous studies for example khan et al 2020 compared gleam and mod16 products across australia based on five ec based tower observations from 2009 to 2011 the rmse and b values of gleam were 20 23 and 4 52 mm month while those of mod16 were 31 52 and 10 18 mm month the better performance of gleam than mod16 in australia is also proven by baik et al 2018 in which a long term comparison of these two products was conducted during the period of 2005 2014 khan et al 2018 also compared these two products within the extent of asia over nine asiaflux sites in terms of rmse and b the number of sites demonstrating the superiority of gleam was seven and five respectively in addition the studies of moreira et al 2019 based on 16 ec towers in south america and michel et al 2016 based on 24 fluxnet stations worldwide have also demonstrated the higher accuracy of gleam than mod16 product as for our study table 2 shows that the superiority of gleam over mod16 and ssebop holds true on a global scale in terms of mae rmse and b therefore it is safe to say that gleam performs better than mod16 and ssebop based on a combination of the above studies as far as we are concerned few studies have compared avhrr with other global et products at fluxnet site scale but its accuracy has already been evaluated by zhang et al 2010 when they initially developed this et product from 1982 to 2006 across 48 flux tower sites worldwide the monthly and annual rmse was 13 0 15 3 mm month and 186 3 mm yr respectively table 2 shows that the accuracy of avhrr product in our study is not as good as that reported in zhang et al 2010 however all the four statistics show that it has still reached an accuracy comparable with gleam product as a result we suppose that avhrr and gleam perform best among these five rs based et products at fluxnet site scale the good performance of gleam has been explained in previous studies which is summarized as below firstly the extensive use of microwave based measurements makes gleam apply to the cloudy conditions khan et al 2018 secondly the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep dataset adopted in gleam is superior to the precipitation forcing of other et products bai and liu 2018 thirdly the incorporation of a soil moisture constraint in gleam s structural algorithm by taking microwave remote sensing products is also an important contributing factor pan et al 2020 the good performance of avhrr product can be explained by its algorithms specifically the core algorithm of avhrr product is developed based on the penman monteith approach zhang et al 2010 2015 however compared with the penman monteith model adopted in mod16 avhrr has at least three significant modifications firstly a long term avhrr gimms ndvi is used to replace modis lai for determining the bio specific canopy conductance secondly a co2 constraint function is added to improve the canopy conductance estimates so that the influence of increasing co2 can be accounted for thirdly in situ flux tower observations across the global domain are utilized to calibrate its biome specific parameters the above three modifications are enlightening for the further development of rs based et models for example in a recent study of zhang et al 2019 the inclusion of co2 concentration change impact on canopy conductance and model calibration strategy based on in situ flux tower observations had been adopted when they estimated 8 day global et from 2002 to 2017 6 conclusion given the special advantage of remote sensing in global et mapping a comprehensive evaluation focused on five rs based global et products i e bess gleam avhrr mod16 and ssebop was conducted at multi scales in this study we believe that such evaluation is not only helpful for the selection of the most suitable et products for scientific research but also lightening for the further development of these rs based et models the results show that the accuracy difference of these five et products at fluxnet site scale varies with statistical metrics nevertheless avhrr and gleam outperform three other products in overall performance the comparison with previous studies has also confirmed the superiority of these two products in different continents of the world compared with basin wide et estimates from water balance analysis bess becomes the most suitable et proxy for big basins its accuracy has reached a level comparable to the best of the five products in all metrics the superiority of the above three products over two modis based products mod16 and ssebop is also confirmed by the uncertainty analysis the relative uncertainty of these five products on a global scale follows the order bess avhrr gleam mod16 ssebop judged from et variations with latitudes the comparison shows that ssebop and gleam are the two products that agree best with the ensemble mean of these five products gleam also shows the best agreement with the optimized flux estimates of earth s water cycle under the support of gewex project all these demonstrate the advantage of ssebop and gleam in the capture of multiyear et patterns as for the variation trend from 2003 to 2013 the mk test indicates that these five products share few pixels with common significant trend significant trend observed in individual product is mainly located in the north of south america the central and north of africa the high latitudes of russia the west of central asia and parts of eastern europe our analysis implies that it is difficult or even impossible to figure out the best et product in all respects this is not only because the accuracy difference of these et products varies with statistical metrics and spatial scales but also because the evaluation methods involve uncertainty themselves although et observations from flux towers are mismatch with remote sensing images in spatial scale they are still the ground truth benchmark adopted mostly for the evaluation of rs based et products the good performance of avhrr and gleam at fluxnet site scale suggests that they provide a path forward for rs based et models specifically important physical constrains such as precipitation soil moisture and vegetation structure should be incorporated by taking full advantage of multi source remote sensing observations model calibration strategy based on flux tower observations and inclusion of co2 effect is also beneficial to the accuracy of these rs based et models credit authorship contribution statement wenbin zhu

3251,advances in satellite remote sensing rs techniques have greatly prompted the development of large scale evapotranspiration et models yielding several freely available global et products a comprehensive evaluation on these products is necessary for selecting the most suitable et products and developing large scale et models step forward in this study the accuracy and uncertainty of five rs based global et products mod16 ssebop gleam avhrr and bess were evaluated at multi scales at point scale their accuracy was evaluated through a direct comparison with in situ observations from 94 worldwide flux towers results indicate that accuracy differences of these five products vary with statistical metrics and land cover types the combination of all statistics illustrates that gleam and avhrr outperform three other products which is consistent with the findings of most previous continental scale studies the accuracy at basin scale was assessed through water balance analysis across 19 big river basins bess is found to be the product that is superior to four other et products at both monthly and multi annual scale which may be related with its low random error at point scale the uncertainty of these five products at pixel scale was assessed by the three cornered hat tch method and comparison analysis the tch outputs reveal that bess and ssebop are the two products with the lowest and largest relative uncertainty respectively that explains the good performance of bess at basin scale from another perspective as for the two modis based et products mod16 and ssebop their accuracy at fluxnet site scale is comparable in monthly et estimation however ssebop has special advantage in the capture of multiyear et patterns the comparison analysis indicates that ssebop is the product that agrees best with the ensemble mean not only on a global scale but also in four of the six continents our results imply that it is difficult or even impossible to figure out the best et product in all respects the selection of et products for scientific research should consider their performance difference in spatial scale as well as the influence of land cover and climate conditions keywords evapotranspiration satellite remote sensing three cornered hat evaluation accuracy uncertainty 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et composed of plant transpiration soil evaporation and canopy interception evaporation plays a pivotal role in global water cycle and energy exchanges it returns about two thirds of the annual terrestrial precipitation to the atmosphere and consumes more than half of the total solar energy absorbed by land surfaces oki and kanae 2006 jasechko et al 2013 pan et al 2020 besides due to the linkage between carbon uptake and water cycling the information on terrestrial et is useful to analyze ecosystem carbon cycling and climate change vinukollu et al 2011 novick et al 2016 fisher et al 2017 consequently accurate knowledge of et is crucial to understand the budgets of water and energy as well as their effects on ecosystems at different spatial and temporal scales however large scale ground based et measurements are difficult to achieve due to the sparse distribution of gauges heterogeneity of landscapes as well as complexity of controlling factors cleugh et al 2007 wang et al 2015 in order to tackle these difficulties different kinds of models for large scale et estimation have been developed such as machine learning models jung et al 2010 carter and liang 2019 zhao et al 2019 land surface models lsms sun et al 2017 zeng and cai 2018 data assimilation models rodell et al 2004 cui and jia 2021 and satellite remote sensing based models fisher et al 2008 miralles et al 2011a mu et al 2011 chen and liu 2020 specifically the essence of most machine learning algorithms is to upscale flux tower based et observations to regional or global scale the advantage of such algorithms lies in their high accuracy in et estimates however it must be noted that their high accuracy is guaranteed by enough inputs of in situ et observations baldocchi et al 2001 jung et al 2019 another significant disadvantage of such models is their lack of physical mechanisms machine learning models usually contribute little to the knowledge of physical process because of their black box characteristics gentine et al 2018 yuan et al 2020 in contrast the lsms have a clear physical mechanism and explicitly account for various thermodynamic and aerodynamic processes however the focus of lsms is the overall performances of water and energy flux simulations resulting in large uncertainties in et estimates cai et al 2014 bechtold et al 2019 besides their requirements for large amounts of input variables and extensive parameterizations irrelevant to et have limited their applications in et estimates data assimilation is promising to map regional and global et in a spatially and temporally continuous manner this technique has a unique ability on the combination of model simulated et and multi source observations so that the cumulative errors and uncertainty can be reduced jang et al 2013 cui and jia 2021 the main drawback of data assimilation technique lies in its heavy reliance on a numerical model which needs a lot of atmospheric forcing and is computationally demanding li et al 2009 satellite remote sensing rs provides an unprecedented global coverage of critical land surface and atmosphere parameters which enables et mapping at high temporal and spatial resolution with lower cost and less time it is even recognized by some researchers as the only viable means to map reginal patterns of et at the earth s surface in a globally consistent and economically feasible manner tang et al 2010 zhang et al 2016a accordingly a large amount of rs based et models have been developed since the advent of earth observation from space in 1957 chen and liu 2020 fisher et al 2020 several studies have provided comprehensive reviews of these rs based et models li et al 2009 zhang et al 2016b mohan et al 2020 following yan et al 2012 these rs based models can be broadly classified into two types according to their physical mechanisms the first category is energy balance based et model which is represented by the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 and the two source energy balance model tseb kustas and norman 1999 the second category is surface conductance based et models following chen and liu 2020 examples of this category include penman monteith models mu et al 2007 2011 canopy photosynthesis models sprintsin et al 2012 and et models that couple with photosynthesis luo et al 2018 although the above rs based et models have only been applied to regional scale in most studies they hold great potential for mapping et at continental and even global scale accordingly several global et products have been developed and released over the past few decades which provides a foundation for large scale hydro climatological studies however it must be noted that global et mapping is always not easy before these products can be confidently used accuracy evaluation and uncertainty analysis are required in terms of comparing these products with in situ observations and each other khan et al 2018 for example four satellite and model based et datasets were compared with et measurements from five eddy covariance ec based flux towers in khan et al 2020 to evaluate their accuracy over different land cover types across australia based on et observations from eight ec flux stations and water balance analysis over 22 river basins bai and liu 2018 compared and evaluated the accuracy of et products retrieved from three lsms across china xu et al 2019 evaluated the performance of twelve et products retrieved from machine learning remote sensing and lsms over conterminous united states using et observations from 15 ameriflux sites water balance analysis and three corned hat method similarly the performance of eighteen et datasets from machine learning remote sensing and lsms was evaluated by pan et al 2020 but this evaluation was performed at the global scale through the intercomparison of different datasets without the support of ground based observations a close look at the above and other similar studies indicates that current evaluation on global et products is mostly conducted at continental scale based on a limited number of ec based flux towers bai and liu 2018 khan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in addition the accuracy of et products retrieved from machine learning remote sensing and lsms with different mechanisms is usually assessed together chen et al 2014 baik et al 2018 pan et al 2020 under the support of water cycle multi mission observation strategy wacmos project michel et al 2016 and miralles et al 2016 evaluated four and three rs based global et datasets respectively however their evaluations were only performed over a three year period from 2005 to 2007 in view of the special advantage of remote sensing in global et mapping a comprehensive evaluation specialized in rs based et datasets at the global scale is still lacking inspired by this background the main objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and uncertainty of five global rs based et products at multi scales this was achieved through four procedures 1 their accuracy at point scale was evaluated through comparison with in situ observations from 94 flux stations 2 their accuracy at the basin scale was assessed through water balance analysis across 19 big basins 3 their uncertainty at the pixel scale was evaluated by three cornered hat tch method and 4 their uncertainty in quantity and trend at the global scale was assessed through comparison with each other 2 materials the materials used in this study include two parts namely the five rs based et products for evaluation and some ancillary datasets for reference 2 1 global rs based monthly et products this study was designed to evaluate global rs based et products at monthly scale however the application of rs technique is so widely that most machine learning lsms and data assimilation also treat rs observations as indispensable inputs for et estimation liang et al 2010 lettenmaier et al 2015 to be different from these three kinds of models the rs based models here refer to those developed at pixel scale with physical mechanisms by using rs images as the main inputs for et mapping based on this criterion and the popularity of different et products five rs based et products were selected in this study for evaluation details about these et products are summarized in table 1 the bess breathing earth system simulator et dataset is produced by the environmental ecology lab at seoul national university it is a simplified process based model that couples atmosphere and canopy radiative transfer canopy photosynthesis transpiration and energy balance jiang and ryu 2016 uniquely bess quantifies the flux contributions from sunlit shaded canopy through the explicit computation of direct diffuse radiation in the atmosphere and canopy radiative transfer the current bess et dataset is achieved by taking full advantage of modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products and is designed to be most sensitive to the variables that can be retrieved reliably yang et al 2020 the gleam global land evaporation amsterdam model et dataset is generated by a set of algorithms that separately estimate the different components of terrestrial evapotranspiration exclusively from satellite forcing data miralles et al 2011a miralles et al 2011b khan et al 2018 ever since its development in 2011 the model has been regularly revised aiming at the optimal incorporation of new satellite observed geophysical variables and improving the representation of physical processes martens et al 2017 specifically potential evaporation is simulated based on the priestley taylor pt equation evaporative stress factor is retrieved from vegetation optical depth and root zone soil moisture using a semi empirical model and interception loss is estimated with the gash analytical model miralles et al 2010 the avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer et dataset is produced by zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 using avhrr gimms ndvi normalized difference vegetation index ncep ncar reanalysis daily surface meteorology and nasa gewex surface radiation budget as inputs this model separately estimates three different components of land surface et specifically the canopy transpiration and soil evaporation are quantified using a modified penman monteith pm approach with biome specific canopy conductance retrieved from ndvi and open water evaporation is simulated using a pt approach ground based observations from 34 flux towers are utilized to parameterize the ndvi based canopy conductance model the mod16 et dataset is generated through an improved pm algorithm proposed by mu et al 2007 2011 its terrestrial et is calculated as the sum of evaporation from wet and moist soil evaporation from wet canopy and plant transpiration through canopy stomata he et al 2019 the required modis inputs to mod16 product include land cover mod12q1 albedo mcd43b2 and mcd43b3 leaf area index mod15a2 and enhanced vegetation index mod13a2 the meteorological forcing data is the gmao modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra daily meteorological reanalysis data including air temperature specific humidity and shortwave solar radiation in addition ameriflux tower observations have also been adopted for calibration purpose in the parameterization the ssebop et product is generated based on the simplified surface energy balance sseb model which is parameterized by senay et al 2013 for operational applications and renamed as ssebop its algorithms are designed based on sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and metric models allen et al 2007 the innovative aspect is that it applies predefined boundary conditions that are unique to each pixel for the hot and cold reference conditions thus eliminating the need to choose extreme anchoring hot and cold pixels singh et al 2014 chen et al 2016 the key inputs of the global ssebop et product include modis and gdas global data assimilation system data streams 2 2 ancillary datasets for reference in order to evaluate the above five et products six ancillary datasets were adopted for reference which were classified into three categories according to their utilities the first category is for accuracy evaluation at point scale including fluxnet2015 mcd12c1 and aridity index three datasets the fluxnet2015 dataset provides worldwide multiple temporal scale et observations collected at sites from multiple regional flux networks https fluxnet org data fluxnet2015 dataset it consists of two groups of products with different selections of variables for data distribution the fullset data product was adopted in this study which contains 212 sites with monthly et observations ranging discretely from 1991 to 2014 however due to the discontinuity of et observations only 94 flux towers with measurements as long as three consecutive years were adopted in this study the spatial distribution and list of these 94 towers are presented in fig 1 and table a1 respectively these sites cover a wide range of land cover types over all continents except for the antarctica jiang and ryu 2016 the data column labeled with le corr was selected as the reference for et evaluation it represents monthly latent heat flux corrected by energy balance closure correction factor details about this dataset as well as its processing methods are available in pastorello et al 2020 in order to further reduce the uncertainty of this reference dataset we only adopted le corr variables with quality frag filled with high confidence mcd12c1 provides annual land cover types at 0 05 spatial resolution for the entire globe following the igbp international geosphere biosphere programme classification scheme the land cover of the above 94 towers is classified into eight categories according to their vegetation types including evergreen needleleaf forest enf evergreen broadleaf forest ebf deciduous broadleaf forest dbf mixed forest mf shrublands shb savanna sav grasslands gra and croplands cro the aridity index ai is provided online by theconsultative group for international agricultural research cgiar consortium for spatial information csi which is expressed as the ratio of annual average precipitation to potential evapotranspiration this ai dataset is generated using the data available from worldclim global climate data with a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds zomer et al 2008 based on the united nations convention to combat desertification classification four climate zones were defined in this study as arid ai 0 2 semi arid 0 2 ai 0 5 dry sub humid 0 5 ai 0 65 and humid ai greater than 0 65 the second category is for the accuracy evaluation at basin scale which includes four datasets the first one is the basin boundary dataset retrieved from the interactive database of the world s river basins http riverbasins wateractionhub org which features a comprehensive list of river basins worldwide to match the coarse spatial resolution of global et products only 19 big basins with areas larger than 1000000 km2 were selected in this study their spatial distribution and details are presented in fig 1 and table a2 respectively precipitation is always indispensable for water balance analysis monthly precipitation with a spatial resolution of 0 25 produced by the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc was adopted here the gpcc has a unique capacity to collect perform quality control and analyze rain gauge data from across the globe rudolf et al 2010 schneider et al 2014 hence this dataset has commonly been used as reference data for assessing the reliability of other gauge based reanalysis and satellite related precipitation data sets on both regional and global scales sun et al 2018 streamflow datasets were mainly collected from the global runoff data center grdc https www bafg de grdc which has been the largest and mostly extensively used dataset for streamflow analysis at global scale do et al 2018 however due to the unavailability of river discharge observations at global scale grdc only provides monthly streamflow observations for 10 of the 19 big basins the time span of these observations is presented in table a2 in addition grdc archives global maps of mean annual runoff by combing observed river discharge information with a climate driven water balance model fekete et al 2002 which enables us to perform water balance analysis for all 19 big basins at the mean annual time scale the fourth dataset is the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa downloaded from the grace tellus website https grace jpl nasa gov which was used to account for the monthly change in terrestrial water storage the third category of our ancillary datasets is the digital elevation model dem generate by the global land one kilometer base elevation globe project it was utilized to investigate the impact of topography on et estimation on a global scale 3 methodology 3 1 statistical metrics four statistical metrics including pearson s correlation coefficient r bias b mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse were used in our work for accuracy evaluation equations of these metrics are expressed as r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 1 b x i y i 2 mae 1 n i 1 n x i y i 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 4 where n represents the sample size x i and y i represent the modeled and observed et respectively and the subscript i represents the sample number at the i th position the application of the above equations requires that the units of x i and y i should be consistent accordingly the unit of both rs based and in situ et datasets was converted to mm month following allen et al 1998 as 1 w m 2 0 0353 m m d 3 2 water balance analysis the accuracy of global et products at basin scale is usually assessed based on water balance analysis which assumes that the water balance closure across a whole drainage basin is dominated by precipitation p runoff r change in total water storage δ s and et as follows p e t r δ s 5 although δ s is assumed to be negligible over ten year periods in numerous studies the study of rodell et al 2015 suggests that such assumption does not hold true from the perspective of water cycle closure accordingly we derived monthly and annual δ s from grace derived twsa following the numerical differentiation algorithm proposed by xu et al 2019 consequently monthly and annual average et over the whole basin can be approximately estimated as p r δ s which was adopted as the benchmark to evaluate global et products at basin scale senay et al 2011 miralles et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 in consideration of the differences in time span of five et products we selected an 11 year common period from 2003 to 2013 to evaluate their performance at the basin scale the p and r inputs of eq 5 were retrieved from gpcc and grdc respectively 3 3 uncertainty analysis the three cornered hat tch method proposed by tavella and premoli 1994 was used in this paper to quantify the uncertainties of each et product at pixel scale where the true value of et is unknown its basic principles are described as below suppose the time series of monthly et at each pixel from 2003 to 2013 are expressed as x k k 1 2 n the subscript k represents the time series retrieved from the k th et product n stands for the total number of rs based et products to be evaluated and equals to 5 in this study a given set of x k is composed of the true value x t and the error term ε k as follows x k x t ε k k 1 2 n 6 obviously x t is required to obtain the error term of each et time series however due to the lack of x t at pixel scale it is impossible to calculate ε k like we did at point and basin scale in the tch method this problem is solved by defining the differences between the n 1 et products and one reference time series x r as y k m x k x r ε k ε r k 1 2 n 1 7 where x r can be chosen arbitrarily in any one of x k and y k m is an m n 1 matrix defined as y m n 1 y 11 y 12 y 21 y 22 y 1 n 1 y 2 n 1 y m 1 y m 2 y m n 1 8 s c o v y m n 1 9 where s represents the covariance matrix of y m n 1 and m stands for the sample size of x k the study period of our research ranges from 2003 to 2013 and thus m is equal to 11 for each calendar month according to galindo and palacio 2003 the unknown m n covariance matrix of the individual noise r is related to s as s j r j t 10 where the n 1 n matrix of j is expressed as j n 1 n 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 11 according to eq 10 the elements of matrix r r ij can be represented as r ij s ij r nn r in r jn 12 the combination of above equations indicates that the number of unknown elements n n 1 2 is larger than the number of equations n n 1 2 thus eq 12 cannot be directly solved the remaining n free parameters need to be assigned a unique value in a reasonable way in the tch method proposed by tavella and premoli 1994 a constraint d e t r 0 was suggested to keep the validity of the n free parameters in the solution domain then premoli and tavella 1993 proposed an optimal criterion to minimize the global correlation between the noises of time series while maintaining the positive definiteness of r finally galindo and palacio 1999 solved the constrained minimization problem based on the kuhn tucker theorem the objective function is defined as f r 1 n r nn 1 k 2 i j n r ij 2 13 subjecting to a constraint g r 1 n r nn r s k 0 14 where k d e t s n 1 and r s r nn r 1 n r nn r n 1 n r nn s 1 r 1 n r nn r n 1 n r nn t the initial conditions for the iteration are defined as r in 0 0 i n r nn 0 1 2 s s 1 1 s 1 1 1 t 15 the n free parameters can be determined by minimizing the objective function with the constraint conditions through iterative operation then the rest unknown elements can be solved using eq 12 the square root of the diagonal elements in the r matrix represents the uncertainty of the time series x k k 1 2 n and is stored as σ k k 1 2 n accordingly the ratio of σ k to the mean value of x k stands for the relative uncertainty more details about the tch method can be found in xu et al 2018 xu et al 2020 and liu et al 2021 3 4 trend analysis the mann kendall mk trend detection test proposed by mann 1945 and kendall 1975 has been commonly used to assess the significance of monotonic trends in climatological meteorological and hydrological data time series kisi and ay 2014 asoka et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 accordingly it was adopted in this paper to analyze the long term variation characteristics of global et products specifically the nonparametric mk test is based on the correlation between the ranks of time series and their time order for time series x t t 1 2 n with n observations the mk test statistic s is given as follows s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i 16 s g n x j x i 1 x j x i 0 x j x i 1 x j x i 17 where x i and x j are the date values at times i and j respectively obviously s depends only on the ranks of the samples rather than their actual values resulting in a distribution free test statistic in contrast parametric trend tests such as the regression coefficient test usually assume the samples follow the normal distribution consequently the mk test has the advantage that its power and significance are not influenced by the actual distribution of the data hamed 2008 the null hypothesis h0 of the mk test is that the time series are independent and identically distributed under this assumption the above s statistic is approximately normally distributed when the data length n is larger than 10 and its mean and variance are given as e s 0 18 v s n n 1 2 n 5 18 19 accordingly the null hypothesis can be tested by comparing the standard mk test statistic z defined in eq 20 with the standard normal distribution table at the desired significance level α if the calculated z is larger than z 1 α 2 the null hypothesis is invalid positive z values represent increasing trend while negative z values stand for decreasing trend otherwise the h0 hypothesis is accepted significance level of α 1 was applied in this research z s 1 v s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v s s 0 20 4 results 4 1 direct evaluation against flux tower observations the accuracy of global et products at point scale was evaluated through comparison with in situ observations from 94 flux towers this comparison was conducted for each et product at its original spatial resolution monthly et observations of each flux tower with three consecutive years were compared with the pixel values extracted based on site locations directly even if some adjacent sites may be located in the same pixel consequently the sample size of each et product is the same as each other across all sites which is 3384 at monthly scale and 282 at annual scale respectively the results are presented in table 2 which illustrates that the accuracy differences of these five products depend heavily on statistical metrics specifically the r at monthly scale ranges from 0 73 to 0 79 the best and worst agreement with in situ observations is achieved by bess and mod16 respectively the high accuracy of bess is also confirmed by mae and rmse which are 17 35 and 25 66 mm month respectively both are the lowest values among all products in contrast the highest values are achieved by ssebop with mae and rmse as high as 21 84 and 30 96 mm month respectively however when judged from the bias the bess product has achieved the worst accuracy in et estimation the b of bess mod16 ssebop gleam and avhrr is 5 58 4 07 1 12 0 54 and 0 52 mm month respectively obviously bess and mod16 have underestimated monthly et seriously by contrast the low b values of avhrr and gleam indicate that these two products outperform other three products significantly in terms of systematic error annual et was calculated as the sum of monthly values as a result in terms of b values the best and worst accuracy are still achieved by avrhh and bess respectively the b of avhrr is only 6 20 mm yr while the b of bess is as high as 67 01 mm yr however all the other three statistics show that the performance of these five products at annual scale is not the same as that at monthly scale for example the r values indicate that the worst agreement with in situ observations is achieved by gleam rather than mod16 judged from mae and rmse avrhh and mod16 become the two products with the highest and lowest accuracy respectively the above analysis suggests that it is difficult to judge which product is superior in all respects however considering the slight difference in r mae and rmse as well as the significant difference in b among different products we suppose that avhrr and gleam outperform three other products in order to investigate the reasons that contribute to the results displayed in table 2 the accuracy of these five products for each calendar month is shown in fig 2 the boxplots were defined by the difference between modeled and observed monthly et with the outliers removed it must be noted that the calendar month presented here was organized based on meteorological seasons meteorological seasons were reckoned by temperature with summer and winter being the hottest and coldest quarter of the year respectively considering the difference between northern and southern hemispheres the calendar month of the southern hemisphere was transformed to be consistent with the north hemisphere based on its meteorological seasons the median of these boxplots provides a good explanation for the reasons why the accuracy difference of these products is most significant in bias values to be specific monthly et is underestimated by bess in all months which explains why the largest negative bias is produced by this product in table 2 in table 2 significant negative bias is also observed in mod16 and ssebop products however the reasons leading to their underestimation are different fig 2 indicates that the underestimation of mod16 is only observed in warm seasons from april to october while the underestimation of ssebop is only observed in cold seasons from august to next april by comparison the difference between observed and modeled et of avhrr product is remarkably close to zero in all months except for august september october and november the overestimation in these four months makes avhrr have a positive and low bias at annual scale significant overestimation is also observed in some individual months for gleam product such as march april and may however this overestimation has been partly offset by the significant underestimation in august and september as a result gleam also has a positive and low bias at annual scale in table 2 in spite of the above differences there are still some common patterns shared by these five boxplots both the overall and interquartile range of these boxplots indicate that the seasonal variations of the differences in et follow a trend similar to sinusoidal curves with the peak values arising in summer the monthly average interquartile range of bess gleam avhrr mod16 and ssebop is 23 83 26 89 25 51 28 83 and 30 79 mm month respectively the accuracy of these five products over different land cover types is presented in fig 3 as the significance level of pearson s correlation coefficient is dependent on sample size it should be highlighted that the sample size over these five land cover types is different the sample size of forest shrublands savanna grasslands and croplands is 26 14 14 20 and 20 respectively consequently it is reasonable to say that all et products have achieved the highest accuracy over forest in terms of r the low values of mae and rmse over forest have also confirmed this high accuracy in addition the comparison of mae and rmse among different products indicates that the good performance of bess in table 2 also holds true over most land cover types among these five land cover types only avrhh is significantly superior to bess over savanna in this respect however when judged from the bias the situation becomes much more complex none of these five products performs significantly well over all land cover types specifically the et over savanna and grasslands has been underestimated by all products by comparison the lowest bias over these two land cover types is achieved by mod16 and ssebop respectively however mod16 has the largest bias over shrublands and grasslands which is particularly obvious over grasslands as a result its overall bias in table 2 is as high as 4 07 mm month among all products bess is the only one that has underestimated et over all land cover types due to the largest negative bias over forest savanna and croplands as well as the second largest negative bias over the rest two land cover types bess has underestimated et most seriously in table 2 except for bess all products have overestimated the et over forest on the contrary the et over croplands has been underestimated by all products except for avhrr however the same for both forest and croplands is that the lowest bias among all products is achieved by avhrr in addition the bias of avhrr over savanna and grasslands is quite close to the best one the combination of these two aspects makes avhrr outperform other products in table 2 in terms of bias fig 3 also shows the monthly rmse values over different land cover types to investigate the seasonality of these et products the results indicate that these products perform better in cold seasons than in warm seasons which holds true for all land cover types except for forest specifically all products present obvious unimodal curves of rmse in croplands with the peak values observed in july by comparison bimodal patterns of rmse are observed for all products in savanna with another peak values occurring in april the rmse values over shrublands also follow a trend similar to unimodal curves but there is significant difference in peal time of five et products the maximum rmse values over grasslands are also observed in warm seasons for all products except for bess however its seasonal fluctuation range is much smaller than the above three land cover types in addition the rmse of grassland in the first half of a year is much higher than the values in the second half the combination of these two aspects makes the seasonal variations of rmse over grasslands not noticeable similar to grasslands the seasonal variations of rmse over forest are relatively stable in comparison with three other land cover types however its rmse values in the second half of a year are much higher than the values in the first half with the peaks for most et products observed in autumn rather than in summer the performance of these five et products over different climate zones is summarized in table 3 it can be explained from two aspects the performance of certain product over four climate zones and the performance of five products over certain climate zone for the first aspect judging from et accuracy in terms of rmse and r the best performance of all products is observed in humid zone for bess mod16 and ssebop their best performance in humid zone is also confirmed by the mae values by contrast the worst performance over different climate zones is dependent heavily on the statistical metrics uniformity is only observed in r values which suggests that all products achieve the lowest accuracy in arid zone the worst performance of two modis based et products mod16 and ssebop in arid zone is also confirmed by their b values judging from mae and rmse both bess and gleam achieve lowest accuracy in dry sub humid zone and avhrr achieves lowest accuracy in arid zone the values of mae and rmse also demonstrate the similarity in performance of two modis based et products the mae and rmse values show that their lowest accuracy is observed in semi arid and dry sub humid zone respectively for the second aspect the performance of different datasets over certain climate zone is helpful to select the most suitable et product for regional study judging from the values of mae rmse and r bess shows the best performance among these five products in semi arid and humid zones and avhrr achieves the highest accuracy in dry sub humid zone as for the most suitable et product for arid zone it is gleam bess ssebop and avhrr respectively depending on the values of mae rmse r and b in addition the superiority of avhrr in b values among all products is also observed in semi arid and humid zones by comparison mod16 has no advantage over other products in any climate zone and any statistical metric 4 2 accuracy and uncertainty evaluation at basin scale accuracy evaluation at basin scale was conducted based on water balance analysis in order to make sure that the overlapping area of different et products is consistent within the same basin boundary all et products were resampled to 0 25 0 25 grid resolution with nearest neighbor assignment algorithm the center of a grid was used to determine whether this grid is inside or outside a basin boundary it means that only grids whose center is within the arcs of the basin boundary were selected for evaluation the results are summarized in table 4 it should be noted that the water balance analysis at monthly scale was only performed for 10 big basins with monthly streamflow observations while at the mean annual time scale it was performed for all 19 big basins accordingly the sample size for each et product is the same as each other across all basins which is 889 at monthly scale and 11 at the mean annual time scale respectively at monthly scale avhrr and bess are superior to three other products in three out of the four statistical metrics specifically the r mae and rmse of avhrr are 0 89 14 70 mm month and 20 07 mm month and these three metrics of bess are 0 88 15 13 mm month and 20 47 mm month respectively the slight difference in above values suggests that the accuracy of these two products is comparable to each other by comparison the performance of gleam is significantly inferior to these two products although it has advantage over two modis based et products in all these three metrics however when judged from the bias mod16 becomes the product with the best performance followed by bess avhrr ssebop and gleam their b values are 1 19 1 61 5 51 5 69 and 6 66 mm month respectively mod16 and bess have significant advantage over other products in this respect on the whole the accuracy of bess is not the best in any statistical metric but it has reached a level comparable to the best in all metrics therefore it is reasonable to conclude that bess is the most suitable et proxy for big basins at monthly scale in terms of mae and rmse the superiority of bess becomes more obvious at the mean annual time scale it has achieved the lowest mae and rmse values among all products followed subsequently by ssebop avhrr gleam and mod16 however based on the values of b the accuracy of these five products follows the order mod16 bess gleam avhrr ssebop the significant advantage of mod16 and bess in b values still holds true at the mean annual time scale the tch method was adopted in this study for uncertainty evaluation fig 4 shows the uncertainties of these five et products during the period of 2003 2013 at annual scale the lowest uncertainty is achieved by gleam 9 99 mm yr followed subsequently by bess 11 48 mm yr avhrr 14 94 mm yr ssebop 24 65 mm yr and mod16 25 38 mm yr the comparison indicates that uncertainties observed in bess gleam and avhrr are relatively stable over different river basins while those observed in mod16 and ssebop are fluctuated significantly specifically the variation range observed in bess gleam and avhrr is 29 69 18 03 and 28 26 mm yr respectively in contrast mod16 and ssebop have a variation range as high as 90 mm yr in addition the combination of fig 4a and fig 1 shows that the uncertainty of these et products has some common spatial patterns specifically the seven big basins with the highest mean uncertainty are all distributed in the southern hemisphere which are lake eyre basin 41 95 mm yr lake chad basin 27 86 mm yr parana river basin 27 53 mm yr zambezi river basin 24 50 mm yr nile river basin 21 55 mm yr niger river basin 20 57 mm yr and congo river basin 19 18 mm yr respectively the highest uncertainty over the lake eyre basin is mainly attributed to ssebop product the uncertainty of which is as high as 102 40 mm yr in contrast the five basins with the lowest mean uncertainty are all located in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere which are lena river basin 7 05 mm yr mackenzie river basin 7 45 mm yr yenisei river basin 8 43 mm yr amur river basin 9 68 mm yr and ob river basin 9 83 mm yr respectively at monthly scale the average uncertainty of bess gleam avhrr mod16 and ssebop is 1 68 1 83 2 29 3 16 and 3 78 mm month respectively the low uncertainty of bess partly explains why this product is the most suitable et proxy for big basins in table 4 as for temporalandspatial variations the standard deviation sd of these five et products uncertainties is 1 26 1 23 1 55 3 43 and 3 37 mm month respectively by comparison the variations of et uncertainty are the lowest in bess and gleam moderate in avhrr and the highest in mod16 and ssebop nevertheless fig 4b shows that the uncertainty of these five products shares some common temporal patterns the uncertainty in cold seasons is lower than that observed in warm seasons which is particularly obvious for two modis based products it should be noted that the basins labeled with 1 3 4 14 19 are located in the southern hemisphere the seasons of which are opposite to those in the northern hemisphere 4 3 uncertainty quantification at pixel scale the tch method was performed pixel by pixel to quantify the uncertainty of these global et products at annual scale from 2003 to 2013 it was conducted at 0 25 0 25 grid resolution for all et products the same as water balance analysis fig 5 presents the spatial distribution of relative uncertainty ru which is defined as the ratio of uncertainty to the annual average et of the corresponding product compared with uncertainty ru is much more comparable among different et products because all products share the same ru variation range from 0 to 100 in terms of the mean values bess has the lowest relative uncertainty 4 68 followed subsequently by avhrr 5 11 gleam 6 80 mod16 7 57 and ssebop 16 12 judged from its variations with latitudes all products share two obvious peak zones near 15 n and 25 s the first peak zone is mainly caused by the high ru values in saharanafrica while the second is related with the high ru values in australia ssebop presents much higher ru values than other products in all latitudinal zones except for low latitude area where its ru is comparable to that observed in mod16 that explains why the overall ru of ssebop is as high as 16 12 for ssebop low ru values are only observed in latitudinal zones around the equator in comparison other four products present stable and low ru values in all latitudinal zones except for the above two peak zones as for the regional distribution of ru ssebop exhibits the most significant spatial heterogeneity with a sd of 0 15 followed by mod16 0 10 gleam 0 06 avhrr 0 05 and bess 0 04 except for saharanafrica and australia mentioned above the regions with extremely high ru values are both product and continent specific as for ssebop a large number of pixels with high ru values are observed in tibet plateau andes patagonia rocky mountains and namibiaformpartofthe southafrica plateau a close look at mod16 indicates that the ru over the himalaya mountains is also much higher than its surrounding areas obviously the complex terrain in mountain areas has a negative impact on the performance of et products this negative impact observed in andes patagonia rocky mountains and namibia also holds true for gleam in addition both gleam and mod16 have a large number of pixels with high ru in thar desert bordering western indian and southeast pakistan given the high ru values of sahara africa as well as the central and west of australia observed in all products it is obvious that the desert land cover also exerts negative impact on et estimation as for the two products with the lowest ru values the sd of bess is a little lower but avrhh exhibits homogeneous ru distribution in more continents specifically the pixels with high ru values of avhrr are mostly concentrated in the two common high value areas shared by all products namely sahara africa and australia by contrast bess has a large number of pixels with high ru values concentrated in the middle of north america and a sporadicdistribution of high ru in north china and south america 4 4 comparison of et products in terms of annual mean and trend the intercomparison of different et products is essential for increasing our understanding of their uncertainty the focus of this study is the comparison of the five et products listed in table 1 so our comparison was performed over an 11 year common period of these five products to evaluate their performance in terms of annual mean and trend from 2003 to 2013 fig 6 shows the annual average et of these five products with 0 25 0 25 grid resolution due to the absence of et estimation in extremely arid areas such as saharanafrica and taklimakandesert the spatial scope of bess and mod16 is not consistent with three other products accordingly the ensemble mean et of these five products at global scale can only be synthetized by products with valid et value at the target pixel this must be kept in mind when comparison is performed in fig 6 for example the extremely high et values of mod16 and bess in 20 nare mainly caused by the absence of et estimation in saharanafrica in addition due to the small number of pixels with valid et values in high latitudes of the southern hemisphere some obvious outliers are observed to the south of 55 s apart from these two latitudinal zones the variations of all et products with latitudes generally follow the same trend with the peak values arising at the equator the comparison also reveals several significant differences among these five products specifically bess has the lowest et value among all products in the middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere which holds true for all latitudinal zones to the north of 30 n in contrast for most latitudinal zones located from 10 s to 35 s the lowest et is achieved by mod16 product coincidentally avhrr has produced the highest et within the same latitudinal zones and the et of three other products seems to be the average of mod16 and avhrr in terms of rmse the best agreement with the ensemble mean in fig 6f is achieved by gleam 47 60 mm yr followed subsequently by ssebop 61 75 mm yr avhrr 79 37 mm yr bess 90 99 mm yr and mod16 145 86 mm yr however in terms of bias the matching degree of these five products against the ensemble mean follows the order mod16 10 35 mm yr ssebop 20 50 mm yr gleam 23 63 mm yr bess 33 01 mm yr avhrr 37 04 mm yr however it should be noted that the low bias of mod16 product is achieved by the absence of et values in extremely arid areas therefore the combination of these two statistics shows that ssebop and gleam are the two products that agree best with the ensemble mean on a global scale the annual average et of these five products in different continents is summarized in table 5 the results achieved by rodell et al 2015 under the support of global energy and water cycle experiment gewex project are also presented for comparison the ensemble mean et of these five products is 460 60 mm yr at global scale the largest et is achieved by mod16 512 79 mm yr followed subsequently by avhrr 502 69 mm yr gleam 483 40 mm yr ssebop 456 95 mm yr and bess 449 45 mm yr the absence of et estimation in taklimakandesert and saharanafrica contributes most to the overall high et of mod16 product which is confirmed by its highest et value in asia and the second largest value in africa among all products in addition mod16 also achieves the largest et in north america which contributes the rest part to its largest et at the global level the estimation of et in bess product is also absent in parts of saharanafrica and taklimakandesert as a result bess produces the largest et value in africa among all products however contrary to mod16 product the et of bess is lowest both in asia and on a global scale the contrary between mod16 and bess is also observed in australia where mod16 produces the lowest et among all products while bess produces the highest nevertheless the highest et of bess product in australia and africa cannot reverse its lowest value at the global level because it has achieved the lowest et in all the remaining continents the above analysis indicates that bess and mod16 are the two products that have produced global et with the largest spatial heterogeneity it is not only because they have achieved the lowest and largest et on a global scale but also because nine of the twelve extreme values maximum and minimum et of the six continents are achieved by these two products the remaining three extreme values are achieved by gleam and avhrr respectively to be specific gleam has produced the largest et in europe and the lowest in africa among all products and avhrr has produced the largest et in south america in comparison ssebop is theclosestmatch for the ensemble mean of these five products firstly its et on a global scale is 456 95 mm yr which is very close to the ensemble mean 460 60 mm yr secondly this similarity is also observed in four of the six continents including asia australia europe and north america for africa and south america the best agreement with the ensemble mean is achieved by gleam and mod16 respectively based on satellite measurements first and data integrating models second optimized flux estimates of earth s water cycle from 2000 to 2010 were qualified by rodell et al 2015 in a variational framework the similarity in time span makes it possible for us to conduct a direct comparison obviously the best agreement with rodell et al 2015 is achieved by gleam product their similarity is not only confirmed by the global mean value but also the annual average et in north and south america et in asia and europe was optimized together as eurasia in rodell et al 2015 with a value of 422 66 mm yr which is also very close to the et statistics of gleam in these two continents as for africa and australia the best agreement with rodell et al 2015 is achieved by avhrr and ssebop product respectively the mk test was adopted in this study to detect the annual trend of these five et products from 2003 to 2013 at the significance level of α 1 the results are shown in fig 7 none of these products present significant increasing or decreasing trend inmostregionsaroundtheworld this is particularly true for ssebop product which has only a limited number of sporadic pixels with significant trend the number of pixels with significant trend is also relatively small for gleam product however it shows apparently intensive distribution of pixels with increasing trend in the high latitudes of russia and parts of eastern europe mongolian plateau and central asia in contrast a large number of pixels with significant trend are observed in mod16 and avhrr specifically the pixels with significant trend for avhrr are mostly in a state of et increasing and concentrated in the amazonbasin parts of eastern europe the high latitudes in russia and parts of north africa pixels with significant increasing trend in amazon basin are also observed in mod16 product however only a small number of these pixels overlap with the above pixels observed in avhrr product moreover the trend analysis of mod16 product indicates that et is decreasing in some parts of the amazon basin which is opposite to the findings of avhrr product significant increasing trend is also observed in parts of north africa for mod16 product however compared with avhrr product these pixels are more concentrated in the west rather than the central and east another significant difference between mod16 and avhrr is that mod16 has a large number of pixels with significant decreasing trend located in central africa bess product also confirms the decreasing of et in central africa but its spatial scope is very limited and fragmented by contrast it has relatively concentrated distribution of pixels with decreasing trend in the west of central asia alaska of the united states and some parts of south america fig 7f shows the combination results of these five et products in terms of annual trend the intersection indicates that these products share few pixels with common significant trend while the union shows that the pixels with possible significant trend are mostly distributed in the north of south america the central and north of africa the high latitudes of russia the west of central asia and parts of eastern europe 5 discussion five global rs based et products were evaluated at multi scales in this study our original intention was to figure out the best et product in all respects however the results illustrate that it is difficult or even impossible to achieve this purpose it is not only because the accuracy difference of these et products varies with statistical metrics and spatial scales but also because there is significant uncertainty involved in the reference datasets and evaluation methods therefore it is necessary to discuss these issues and evaluate present study in light of work done before 5 1 uncertainty of reference datasets and evaluation methods the uncertainty of et evaluation at point scale mainly arises from the scale mismatch between global et products and eddy covariance ec observations to be specific in this study the spatial resolution of five monthly et products ranges from 1 km to 0 5 however the footprint of ec observations is usually limited to a few kilometers from the flux tower zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2015 therefore a direct comparison of ec based measurements and rs based estimation is always subject to the issue of scale mismatch which is particularly obvious over complex topographical and atmospheric conditions long et al 2014 song et al 2018 et upscaling technique is usually suggested to acquire ground truth et data at the satellite pixel scale however the performance of such technique relies heavily on the density of flux towers which limits its applications on a continent scale liu et al 2016 li et al 2018 consequently a direct comparison between ec observations and model estimates is still adopted in most studies to evaluate rs based et products for large scale areas similarly the accuracy evaluation presented in table 2 was performed for each et product at its original spatial resolution in order to investigate the impact of scale mismatch table 6 shows the accuracy of five et products across all flux towers after they were resampled with nearest neighbor assignment algorithm specifically mod16 and ssebop were resampled from 1 km and avhrr was resampled from 8 km to 0 25 grid resolution consequently these three products are now consistent with the original resolution of gleam bess dataset provides two et products with different spatial resolution by itself in comparison with its performance at 1 km resolution here we present its accuracy at 0 5 grid resolution compared with table 2 all statistical metrics indicate that there is a slight decrease in accuracy for two modis based et products the mae and rmse values of avhrr have also conformed the relatively poor performance of these resampled et products although some superiority in bias is observed for avhrr as for bess significant difference in performance is observed between its 1 km and 0 5 et product in table 2 bess at 1 km resolution has achieved the lowest mae and rmse among all products at monthly scale however all statistical metrics show that its performance at 0 5 grid resolution is much poorer than all other products resampled to 0 25 grid resolution basin wide et estimates from water balance analysis provide benchmark values at regional scale as a result the water balance approach has also been adopted in numerous studies to evaluate the remotely sensed et estimates zeng et al 2012 velpuri et al 2013 wan et al 2015 however this approach also involves significant uncertainty firstly because et is computed as the residual of water balance equation the quality of precipitation and runoff inputs has a direct influence due to the unavailability of runoff observations on a global basis we only performed monthly water balance analysis for 10 of the 19 big basins using monthly streamflow observations as a supplement the global maps of mean annual runoff provided by grdc were adopted to conduct water balance analysis for all 19 big basins at the mean annual time scale the comparison of grdc derived and observed annual average runoff over these ten basins are presented in fig 8 obviously the mean annual runoff provide by the grdc with a spatial resolution of 0 5 agrees well with the observed discharges over these ten basins the r mae rmse and b are 0 97 20 88 mm yr 24 55 mm yr and 3 56 mm yr respectively the values of mae rmse and b are much lower than the metrics of five et products in table 4 which demonstrates the validity of this spatially distributed grdc dataset over all 19 big basins the second uncertainty source of water balance analysis is related with the assumption that terrestrial water storage change δ s is small enough to be negligible over ten year periods different measures have been taken in previous studies to deal with this assumption for example δ s was assumed to be negligible by velpuri et al 2013 and mao and wang 2017 when they conducted water balance analysis for et evaluation at a multi annual scale by contrast both wan et al 2015 and bai and liu 2018 questioned its validity and used grace measurements to quantify basin scale δ s in this study we adopted the grace derived terrestrial water storage anomaly to account for δ s at both monthly and multi annual scale here we present the annual average δ s from 2003 to 2013 in fig 8 as an example to test the above hypothesis significant and positive δ s is observed in four out of the ten basins including amur river lena river ob river and yenisei river however all the remaining basins present δ s very close to zero the absolute average δ s over these ten basins is 4 26 mm yr compared with et value in table 5 and runoff value in fig 8 δ s is indeed small enough to be negligible over ten year periods 5 2 evaluating current work in light of work done before given the above uncertainties a comparison with previous studies is necessary to find something in common here we only focus on the comparison of different et products at fluxnet site scale because the selected basins for water balance analysis vary significantly in different studies based on ec observations from eight chinaflux stations from 2003 to 2016 li and he 2020 validated mod16 and ssebop products in china their results showed that these two products had overall comparable accuracies at site scale but the et distribution of ssebop product was more reasonable at the basin and national level monthly mod16 and ssebop products were validated over the conterminous united states using ec observations from 2001 to 2007 in velpuri et al 2013 they also found that the accuracy of these two products was overall comparable however ssebop showed higher performance for grassland and forest classes while mod16 showed improved performance in the savanna class the b values in fig 3 confirm the superiority of mod16 over ssebop in savanna and the superiority of ssebop over mod16 in grasslands on a global scale however fig 3 also indicates that the accuracy difference of these two products is dependent on statistical metrics when judged from mae and rmse mod16 is superior to ssebop in all the above three classes across all sites at monthly scale in table 2 mod16 has advantages over ssebop in terms of mae and rmse while ssebop shows its advantages over mod16 in r and b values it is therefore reasonable to conclude that these two modis based products have achieved comparable accuracies at monthly scale however when judged from annual statistics all the above four statistics demonstrate the better performance of ssebop product that explains why the distribution of china s multiyear et pattern obtained from ssebop is more reasonable in li and he 2020 jiang and ryu 2016 compared 8 day bess and mod16 products with in situ observations in fluxnet2015 dataset the rmse and b values of bess were 0 78 and 0 10 mm d while those of mod16 were 0 86 and 0 14 mm d barraza et al 2019 conducted a comparison of bess and mod16 products over a eucalypt forest savanna in northern australia the reported rmse at 8 day temporal scale of mod16 and bess was 31 14 and 41 40 w m2 respectively a similar study was performed by wei et al 2019 to evaluate the performance of these two products across grasslands in northern china their results based on seven flux towers showed that besshad a higher et accuracy across different grassland ecosystems the better performance of bess than mod16 in grasslands is also confirmed in fig 3 however our results show that the superiority of mod16 over bess in savanna on a global scale is only valid in terms of b values across all sites in table 2 bess has the largest absolute bias and lowest mae and rmse among all products at monthly scale suggesting it is a product with low random error and large systematic error gleam is another product that has been evaluated and compared most in previous studies for example khan et al 2020 compared gleam and mod16 products across australia based on five ec based tower observations from 2009 to 2011 the rmse and b values of gleam were 20 23 and 4 52 mm month while those of mod16 were 31 52 and 10 18 mm month the better performance of gleam than mod16 in australia is also proven by baik et al 2018 in which a long term comparison of these two products was conducted during the period of 2005 2014 khan et al 2018 also compared these two products within the extent of asia over nine asiaflux sites in terms of rmse and b the number of sites demonstrating the superiority of gleam was seven and five respectively in addition the studies of moreira et al 2019 based on 16 ec towers in south america and michel et al 2016 based on 24 fluxnet stations worldwide have also demonstrated the higher accuracy of gleam than mod16 product as for our study table 2 shows that the superiority of gleam over mod16 and ssebop holds true on a global scale in terms of mae rmse and b therefore it is safe to say that gleam performs better than mod16 and ssebop based on a combination of the above studies as far as we are concerned few studies have compared avhrr with other global et products at fluxnet site scale but its accuracy has already been evaluated by zhang et al 2010 when they initially developed this et product from 1982 to 2006 across 48 flux tower sites worldwide the monthly and annual rmse was 13 0 15 3 mm month and 186 3 mm yr respectively table 2 shows that the accuracy of avhrr product in our study is not as good as that reported in zhang et al 2010 however all the four statistics show that it has still reached an accuracy comparable with gleam product as a result we suppose that avhrr and gleam perform best among these five rs based et products at fluxnet site scale the good performance of gleam has been explained in previous studies which is summarized as below firstly the extensive use of microwave based measurements makes gleam apply to the cloudy conditions khan et al 2018 secondly the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep dataset adopted in gleam is superior to the precipitation forcing of other et products bai and liu 2018 thirdly the incorporation of a soil moisture constraint in gleam s structural algorithm by taking microwave remote sensing products is also an important contributing factor pan et al 2020 the good performance of avhrr product can be explained by its algorithms specifically the core algorithm of avhrr product is developed based on the penman monteith approach zhang et al 2010 2015 however compared with the penman monteith model adopted in mod16 avhrr has at least three significant modifications firstly a long term avhrr gimms ndvi is used to replace modis lai for determining the bio specific canopy conductance secondly a co2 constraint function is added to improve the canopy conductance estimates so that the influence of increasing co2 can be accounted for thirdly in situ flux tower observations across the global domain are utilized to calibrate its biome specific parameters the above three modifications are enlightening for the further development of rs based et models for example in a recent study of zhang et al 2019 the inclusion of co2 concentration change impact on canopy conductance and model calibration strategy based on in situ flux tower observations had been adopted when they estimated 8 day global et from 2002 to 2017 6 conclusion given the special advantage of remote sensing in global et mapping a comprehensive evaluation focused on five rs based global et products i e bess gleam avhrr mod16 and ssebop was conducted at multi scales in this study we believe that such evaluation is not only helpful for the selection of the most suitable et products for scientific research but also lightening for the further development of these rs based et models the results show that the accuracy difference of these five et products at fluxnet site scale varies with statistical metrics nevertheless avhrr and gleam outperform three other products in overall performance the comparison with previous studies has also confirmed the superiority of these two products in different continents of the world compared with basin wide et estimates from water balance analysis bess becomes the most suitable et proxy for big basins its accuracy has reached a level comparable to the best of the five products in all metrics the superiority of the above three products over two modis based products mod16 and ssebop is also confirmed by the uncertainty analysis the relative uncertainty of these five products on a global scale follows the order bess avhrr gleam mod16 ssebop judged from et variations with latitudes the comparison shows that ssebop and gleam are the two products that agree best with the ensemble mean of these five products gleam also shows the best agreement with the optimized flux estimates of earth s water cycle under the support of gewex project all these demonstrate the advantage of ssebop and gleam in the capture of multiyear et patterns as for the variation trend from 2003 to 2013 the mk test indicates that these five products share few pixels with common significant trend significant trend observed in individual product is mainly located in the north of south america the central and north of africa the high latitudes of russia the west of central asia and parts of eastern europe our analysis implies that it is difficult or even impossible to figure out the best et product in all respects this is not only because the accuracy difference of these et products varies with statistical metrics and spatial scales but also because the evaluation methods involve uncertainty themselves although et observations from flux towers are mismatch with remote sensing images in spatial scale they are still the ground truth benchmark adopted mostly for the evaluation of rs based et products the good performance of avhrr and gleam at fluxnet site scale suggests that they provide a path forward for rs based et models specifically important physical constrains such as precipitation soil moisture and vegetation structure should be incorporated by taking full advantage of multi source remote sensing observations model calibration strategy based on flux tower observations and inclusion of co2 effect is also beneficial to the accuracy of these rs based et models credit authorship contribution statement wenbin zhu

3252,reservoirs are the main component of regulation of water resources in basins off stream reservoirs are a particular solution where water is stored in a secondary catchment other than the basin that produces the water resource this under certain conditions can modify the water regime of the downstream secondary catchment although uncommon one of the reservoir management operations is emergency emptying in the event of possible incidents that could put proper reservoir management at risk one of the environmental requirements of the drawdown operation of reservoirs is the study of environmental impacts in the event of a complete discharging event from a full reservoir state given the huge amount of water to be emptied and the duration of the operation which can last for days logically the impact will be greater when it comes to diversion basins it is imperative to evaluate the physical impact of prolonged flooding in downstream areas especially in areas of special ecosystem sensitivity additionally on certain occasions a physicochemical impact can be produced on flooded areas when the chemical composition of the discharged water differs from the usual concentrations exceedance probability curves for conductivity allow identification and assessment of potential impacts of off stream reservoirs this article presents a practical case assessment of the impact of an off stream reservoir located in evaporitic soils with a high content of salts increasing the chemical concentration of stored water that is distributed in different compositional strata the emptying is carried out on a wetland with important ecological value and the impact of extension and duration of the flood on the wetland are studied as well as exposure to the presence of water with different chemical concentrations over the time the incident lasts keywords emergency emptying reservoirs brackish reservoirs off stream reservoirs stratified reservoirs shee software iber software 1 introduction the emergency drawdown from off stream brackish reservoirs with the extension and duration of the induced flood and the change generated by the physicochemical conditions of the circulating water all have meaningful impacts on downstream ecological areas hence carrying out a detailed analysis of the phenomenon may be a clever purpose the regulation of water supply to cities is one of the challenges today s society faces both the form and the time the demand is produced are key factors arnell 2004 bizzi et al 2012 cosgrove and loucks 2015 this is why in places where water resources are not abundant rational management is imperative attenborough 2020 šulyová et al 2021 water body infrastructures such as reservoirs in the case of surface water allow and guarantee regulation and supply in a metered way throughout the year mateo lázaro et al 2018 mateo lázaro et al 2019 galletti et al 2021 and even in inter annual periods where dry and humid periods occur barton and infield 2004 kummu et al 2010 cole and carver 2011 bejarano et al 2019 one reservoir type is the off stream reservoir that stores water in dams located outside the main current that

2016 adamo et al 2017 owen and kemp 2019 ge et al 2020 one of the operations that should guarantee the location of an off stream reservoir is the possibility of handling an emergency drawdown in the event of incorrect operation of the dam which may be due to multiple aspects such as leaks mateo lázaro et al 2016a seismicity sica et al 2019 landslides xue et al 2019 fan et al 2020 and floods

particular often result in wetland degradation pattison williams et al 2018 rushdi et al 2018 another aspect to be analysed in off stream reservoirs is the change in water regime in the affected

et al 2016 rodríguez bachiller et al 2019 in addition it should be noted that the change in the hydro chemical and geochemical characteristics of the water that circulates through secondary streams and through their ecosystems and wetlands which are fragile and sensitive areas can cause significant damage chau 2007 belletti et al 2020 nourani et al 2021 it is necessary to control this in a rational way so that damage is acceptable or null this article analyses the potential impact produced by emergency emptying in an off stream reservoir located in soils of an evaporite nature which increase the salinity of the dammed water the salinity is greater the longer the water stays in the brackish reservoir we analyse a practical case of an off stream reservoir located in ne spain on the right bank of the ebro river and located in a small lateral catchment about 7 km from the main river course it is necessary to cross a fragile wetland that has great ecological value among other aspects the emptying time the volume and circulating streamflow during the discharge the saline concentration of the reservoir water that are analysed through conductivity with real data the stratification of the water quality and the compositional changes throughout the discharging operation the areas that will be affected by the flooding produced by the discharge as well as a period of flow recession that extends beyond the strict period of reservoir emptying exceedance probability curves are established that make it possible to compare the exposure times of different states of chemical concentration of the drawdown water with the surface water of the natural environment and with the groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the la loteta reservoir in spain is an off stream reservoir which stores the water supply for the city of zaragoza the purpose of the reservoir is to constitute the fundamental piece in the regulation of the three great channels of the ebro river axis in the main hydrographic basin of spain especially the canal imperial de aragon avoiding punctual discharges in the ebro reservoir too away from the demand points it also represents an appreciable complement to the regulation of the ebro river allows the development of recreational and tourist uses and makes it more flexible to maintain minimum ecological flows in the axis of the ebro river the reservoir is filled through two sources of flow one of which comes from the yesa reservoir on the aragón river in the pyrenean mountain range with excellent water quality and very little mineralization the second source of water is the canal imperial de aragón which captures water from the ebro river whose quality is lower with greater turbidity and strong mineralization the reservoir is located on miocene evaporitic soils composed mainly of gypsum although the presence of other salts such as chloride type halite and carnalite and sulphates such as anhydrite glauberite thenardite and mirabilite is also significant gutierrez et al 2005 evaporitic lithology produces an increase in the salinity of the dammed water which is greater the longer the residence time fig 1 shows the study area with the ebro river in the central axis whose floodplain presents a multitude of meandering paleo streams that have frequently given rise to various wetlands such as fornazos an emergency emptying channel has been designed for the la loteta reservoir which empties into the fornazos wetland 2 2 available data 2 2 1 general data from la loteta reservoir the main data of the la loteta reservoir that are of interest for this study such as elevation level storage volume water mirror surface and coastline length for different reservoir levels are presented in table 1 a elevation storage curve for la loteta reservoir the la loteta reservoir exploitation rules document contains the elevation vs storage data of the reservoir from which a polynomial fit of degree 2 has been obtained fig 2 with a coefficient of determination r2 close to 1 in the range of interest in the present study with this polynomial equation 1 the reservoir storage volume s can be obtained as a function of the water elevation zw 1 s 0 3125096 z w 2 168 73367 z w 22778 632 as an example when applying the polynomial of equation 1 for the full supply level 288 00 masl a volume of 104 13 hm3 results that coincides with the nominal volume for the level of the emergency drain 273 50 masl the result is 6 40 hm3 this will be the calculation range that will be used later in the different models b elevation discharge curve for the emergency drain as mentioned above the emergency drainage channel from la loteta reservoir empties into the fornazos wetland the discharge into this channel occurs through a bottom drain that acts as an emergency drain the elevation discharge relationship of which is given in the la loteta reservoir exploitation rules document the data of which are represented in fig 3 and they fit a polynomial of degree 2 equation 2 with a coefficient of determination r2 close to 1 in the range of interest for the present study with the polynomial the discharge q can be obtained as a function of the height of the water surface in the reservoir zw 2 q 2 56591 10 3 z w 2 1 792397 z w 277 01 2 2 2 water quality data a water quality from la loteta reservoir the electrical conductivity of an electrolyte is correlated with the amount of dissolved ions and this will be the reference parameter that this study adopts to assess water quality measured in μs cm la loteta reservoir is supplied by two water sources one from the yesa reservoir which has an average conductivity of 400 μs cm and the other from the canal imperial with water of the ebro river with an average conductivity of 1124 μs cm the proportion of supply from each source is dependent on water resources management at basin scale and therefore varies substantially over time fig 4 contains two gauged time series that span from january 1 2010 to january 1 2019 nine years the conductivity series is on the primary vertical axis and on the secondary vertical axis water elevation in the reservoir is represented at first glance it is observed that there is a good agreement between both time series b quality of surface water from fornazos wetland in the web portal of the spanish water administration https www chebro es there is a gauge point on the left bank of the ebro river in the town of pradilla whose coordinates epsg 25830 are x 644 040 and y 4 635 606 fig 1 table 2 shows the conductivity time series whose mean value is 1124 6 μs cm the extreme values are 1660 y 590 μs cm c quality of groundwater from fornazos wetland for groundwater data are available from two inventoried wells in the water registry of the spanish water administration one is located in the town of pradilla 261380016 and the other is in the town of boquiñeni 261370018 fig 1 tables 3 and 4 contain their time series in the well of pradilla the mean of the data is 2126 6 μs cm while in the well of boquiñeni the mean of measurements is 2726 6 μs cm the respective maximum and minimum values are 2691 and 1238 μs cm for the well of pradilla and 4230 and 1925 μs cm for the well of boquiñeni we can conclude a mean of 2426 6 μs cm and extremes of 1238 μs cm to 4230 μs cm 2 3 interpretation of the conductivity of water the specific conductivity of water is its ability to conduct an electrical current the unit of measure in the international system of units is is siemens per meter s m in waters with low electrolyte content the conductivity is usually expressed in μs cm one siemens per meter s m corresponds to 1 104 microsiemens per centimeter μs cm high quality deionized water has a conductivity of about 0 055 µs cm typical drinking water is in the range of 30 to 150 µs cm while seawater is close to 50 000 µs cm conductivity is the inverse of resistivity the is unit for measuring resistivity is the ohm ω 1 µs cm 1 mω cm when the majority of total dissolved solids in water are electrolytes i e dissociated the conductivity of the solution is proportional to its concentration a common parameter used to describe the total amount of dissolved salts in water is tds total dissolved solids tds is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved ions measured in milligrams per liter or ppm parts per million where 1 mg l 1 ppm electrical conductivity is therefore related to tds and is used as a measure of the total amount of dissolved salts generally speaking to higher the concentration of dissolved salts higher the electrical conductivity however above a certain concentration of ions in the solution the electrical conductivity does not increase with the concentration of ions this is the result of the formation of pairs of ions or counter ions which weaken the electrical charge of each other for the range of conductivities measured in this study the tds can be estimated from the conductivity using the following equation tds ppm 0 64 c o n t u c t i v i t y μ s c m this equation only provides an estimate and the actual tds may vary significantly from the calculated value depending on the composition of the water most agricultural conductivity standards are given for readings at 25 c however the conductivity reading may vary depending on temperature higher the temperature higher electrical conductivity is as a general rule the electrical conductivity of water increases by 2 3 for every 1 c rise in temperature 2 4 reservoir drawdown model 2 4 1 emptying hydrograph using the polynomials of the storage curve equation 1 and fig 2 and the discharge curve of the bottom drain equation 2 and fig 3 applying the modified puls method one of the routing methods for reservoirs a nonlinear model of reservoir drawdown can be generated that leads to a discharge hydrograph and other characteristics over the emptying time such as stored and drained volumes water elevation in the reservoir and value of the conductivity of the withdrawn water 2 4 2 conductivity exceedance probability curves exceedance probability curves for conductivity cep curves show the probability that a certain conductivity value is exceeded in addition to showing the conductivity value that is exceeded during a certain percentage of time once all the results of the drawdown model have been obtained exceedance probability curves can be elaborated upon the one corresponding to the conductivity is the one that will be most useful in assessing the duration of the different hydro chemical conditions produced on the downstream environment when emptying the reservoir these conditions can be compared with the exceedance probability curves corresponding to the usual conditions elaborated from the actual data measured in the surface and groundwater gauges 2 5 hydrodynamic routing model through the impact areas the iber computer application is software developed by several spanish institutions specifically the polytechnic university of catalonia the university of a coruña the international center for numerical methods for engineering cimne and the center for studies and experimentation of public works cedex with funding from the general water directorate of the spanish ministry of the environment the iber numerical engine is the fortran code f90 which solves the depth integrated 2d navier stokes equations for shallow waters known as saint venant s or 2d shallow water equations in non steady state equations 3 4 and 5 to solve these equations the numerical method of finite volumes is used iber uses an explicit numerical scheme of the upwind type among the different existing numerical schemes this is the one that best adapts to two dimensional flows in a free surface since without calculation devices it is capable of solving wave front and regime change problems 3 h t h u x x h u y y m s 4 h u x t h u x 2 x h u x u y y g h z

tangential stresses and ms mx my are respectively the sink source terms of mass and of momentum to carry out a simulation with the program it is necessary to have a digital terrain model with the best available accuracy in this case we used a mesh model with 2 m of grid size supplied by the ministry of the environment in this terrain model it was necessary to make two modifications one to introduce the pond located in the south central area of the wetland which is not reflected in the model and the second to introduce a stream drainage channel of the irrigation returns located in the centre of the wetland and which empties into the ebro river with this model a structured mesh with a tolerance of 0 25 m has been generated with a maximum side of 5 m and a minimum side of 0 5 m the second characteristic that must be introduced in the program is the manning roughness coefficient which for simplicity has been used for the entire calculation domain being 0 045 we consider this to be representative for both the central channel with lush vegetation on the slopes and for the virgin area of the wetland with abundant hydrophilic vegetation as well as for the area of alfalfa and corn crops another characteristic to introduce is boundary conditions in the inlet condition an inlet hydrograph must be entered which is defined in the results section and corresponds to the emptying hydrograph of the reservoir as an outlet contour condition already in the ebro river we considered a subcritical regime with the height of the water surface corresponding to the low water channel which is 221 00 masl 2 6 recession model after the reservoir emptying equation 6 represents the recession of a linear deposit combining two linear deposits n 2 for equation 7 and adjusting the parameters αi and qoi from the stretch of the recession curve of the emptying hydrograph an equation is obtained to prolong the time of the recession of said hydrograph equation 8 represents the volume of water that is stored in each reservoir and that little by little feeds the flow produced by the recession curve of the hydrograph for more detail this methodology is developed in depth in mateo lázaro et al 2015 6 q i q oi e α i t 7 q 1 n q i 8 v i q i α i 3 results 3 1 model of reservoir emptying the non linear discharge model begins with the reservoir at elevation 288 00 masl and ends at water elevation 273 50 masl which is reached 46 days after the start of discharge the volume discharged is 97 5 hm3 table 5 presents the results of the la loteta drawdown model on a daily scale at each moment we have the volume stored in la loteta the volume that has been emptied the elevation of the water stratum that is being emptied its depth and the conductivity of the water that has been emptied at that moment from the results of the reservoir drawdown model fig 5 synthesizes the drainage hydrograph that begins with a streamflow of 26 4 m3 s at 288 00 masl and ends with a streamflow of 21 5 m3 s at 273 50 masl in addition this same figure represents the daily volume released 3 2 reservoir stratification and conductivity elevation curve it is assumed that the best estimate for the distribution of conductivity values in the different strata of the reservoir will be obtained using the available data the available data are conductivity measurements on the water surface but made at different levels of reservoir filling the influence of the salt concentration will be proportional to the distance to the bottom of the reservoir a characteristic that is observed in the measurements made and that corroborates the assumption in section 2 2 2 and in the time series of fig 4 we can see an inverse relationship between the water level and the reservoir volume and the measured conductivity in that level as has been said before this inverse relationship can be interpreted under the hypothesis that there is stratification of the water conductivity in the reservoir from here it can be hypothesized that when the reservoir is full there is stratification of the conductivity of the water in the reservoir similar to the conductivities measured at different levels of reservoir filling in this way the relationship between the depth of the water and the conductivity would be such that the greater the depth or lower elevation the greater the conductivity fig 6 represents the elevation conductivity relationship in the range of data handled a polynomial of degree 3 equation 9 is fitted with a coefficient of determination r2 of the order of 0 82 where ec is the electrical conductivity and zw is the water elevation 9 ec 0 5247449 z w 3 453 8185 z w 2 130 803 95 z w 12 565 883 fig 7 shows a graph similar to the previous one with the storage s of the reservoir which is very useful in this case an exponential curve equation 10 is fitted with r2 about 0 83 this curve reveals that of the 98 hm3 of drawdown only 15 hm3 exceeds 1500 μs cm and 20 hm3 exceeds 1300 μs cm it also follows that half the reservoir water is below 800 μs cm 10 ec 4889 01741 s 0 445156 3 3 conductivity time curve the last column in the drawdown model in table 5 shows the results of applying the polynomial of equation 9 so that the conductivity of the outlet flow is calculated for each time interval of the model the primary axis of the graph in fig 8 represents the depth of the water stratum that is discharged in each time interval and the secondary axis represents the conductivity curve over the discharge time when contrasting the conductivity results throughout the discharge with the average conductivities of the analytics measured in surface water and in groundwater described in section 2 2 2 the following observations are deduced 1 the average conductivity data in the surface water of the ebro river is 1 124 6 μs cm and ranges between 590 and 1 660 μs cm therefore the discharged water exceeds the maximum value of surface water in the natural regime for 10 days and the natural mean value for more than 30 days 2 for groundwater the mean conductivity value is 2 426 μs cm with extremes of 1 238 μs cm and 4 231 μs cm therefore the conductivity of the water from la loteta drawdown is lower than the conductivity of the groundwater therefore the impact on groundwater is positive in addition the maximum conductivity values of the groundwater are much higher than the values of the discharged water 3 the decrease in conductivity over time means that there will be a chemical washing of the higher salinity water retained in the wetland by the lower salinity water that circulate later 3 4 conductivity exceedance curves the results of the calculation of the cep curves are shown in fig 9 the cep curve for the discharge of la loteta calculated with the results of the discharge model of table 5 is shown said cep curve can be compared with other curves one corresponding to the surface water of the ebro river and the other two corresponding to groundwater the one with the least conductivity located next to the main channel of the ebro river and the other with the highest conductivity located towards the outside of the valley near the outcrop of the evaporite formations it should be noted that the time of permanence of groundwater in the aquifer is very long or equivalently the renewal of the aquifer is slow the graph also highlights the differences in the temporal distribution of conductivity between surface water in the natural regime and the discharge water the water of the ebro river presents a uniform distribution approximately centred on its mean value the discharge water presents another temporal distribution it stands out that the conductivity remarkably exceeds that of the natural regime almost 50 of the discharge time but with notable differences however during slightly more than half of the discharge time the conductivity of the discharged water is of better quality 3 5 quantitative analysis of flooded areas 3 5 1 hydrographs the iber model is a two dimensional numerical model in a non steady regime so to carry out simulations with the complete drawdown time plus the corresponding recession times a simulation time of the order of 60 days would be necessary which entails a very long time of computing in this case if no measurements were taken the simulation and computing times would be almost the same the discharge hydrograph will be similar to that of fig 10 however most of the discharge time can be assimilated to a quasi steady regime for the simulation with the iber program a temporal shortening of the discharge hydrograph has been carried out fig 10 shows a hydrograph of the input boundary condition outlet of the la loteta emptying channel and another hydrograph in the output boundary condition in the ebro river that comes from the numerical calculation of the program the simulation was carried out for a simulation time of 12 h with an inlet hydrograph that changes from 0 to 26 13 m3 s in one hour it then remains constant until the sixth hour of simulation and changes to 0 m3 s in 15 min the simulation time 6 h represents the maximum flood in the simulation domain the outlet hydrograph shows a slight abatement which if prolonged for a long time would become permanent it also shows a recession curve that in the simulation time of 12 hours has not ended 3 5 2 depth maps fig 11 contains the flood depth at simulation times 6 h and 12 h the simulation time 6 h corresponds to the permanent model of the 46 days of discharge at the simulation time 6 h the average depth in the entire domain is 71 cm with the maximum being 2 7 m in the case of the simulation time 12 h the average depth is 30 cm and the maximum is 1 62 m in the outlet boundary condition for the simulation time 6 h the flow is about 26 m3 s while for the simulation time of 12 h the flow is 1 84 m3 s at this moment we can still observe a significant flooded area that will slowly leave as surface runoff but most of it is retained and will exit through infiltration and evapotranspiration 3 5 3 velocity maps fig 12 shows the stream velocity distribution map at the simulation time 6 h and 12 h truly the simulation time of 6 h would be the steady model of the 46 days of discharge at simulation time 6 h the average velocity of the calculation domain is 0 21 m s and the maximum is 3 97 m s for the simulation time 12 h they are 0 02 and 2 38 m s respectively for the simulation time of 6 h which represents the 46 days of drawdown the main flow runs through the central channel of the wetland and through a strip of flooding at a velocity of 0 25 0 50 m s with the exception of the final part of the channel where the velocity is greater at the simulation time 12 h there is a residual velocity of 0 to 0 1 m s that represents the flooded zone after the emptying 3 5 4 quantitative results of flooded areas at the simulation time 6 h representative of the 46 days of discharge reservoir the flooded area in the simulation domain discounting the area of the main course of the ebro river is 32 65 ha the volume of water accumulated in the simulation domain volume of water that is routing from the upstream boundary condition to the downstream boundary condition is 0 248 hm3 the specific or average water depth is 76 cm at the simulation time 12 h representative of the recession period the flooded area in the simulation domain is 22 23 ha the volume of water stored in the simulation domain volume of water that is routing from the upstream boundary condition to the downstream boundary condition is 0 085 hm3 the specific or average water depth is 36 cm 3 6 recession after the reservoir emptying from the period of the recession curve obtained in the downstream boundary hydrograph in the iber model see fig 13 and through the fit by least squares of the parameters αi and qoi of equations 4 and 5 the recession model that appears in fig 13 is established the parameters of the recession model are those of table 6 at the end of the simulation with iber hour 12 the streamflow rate is 1 84 m3 s with equations 6 and 7 the flow is 10 l s at 51 h with equation 8 the volume stored in the wetland can be calculated specifically for hour 12 it would be 0 055 hm3 as the volume measured in the model is 0 065 hm3 see section 3 5 4 the volume retained in the holes of the ground will be 10 000 m3 which represents an average of 50 mm of retained water logically there are sites with greater amounts and others with nothing 3 7 sensitivity analysis for the flooded areas and the recession period in hydrodynamic modelling the state of the ground and its ability to allow faster or slower flow is controlled by the manning roughness parameter for this reason a sensitivity study has been carried out for this parameter carrying out 5 simulations with different roughness values between 0 025 and 0 065 taking the initially used value 0 045 as a reference fig 14 shows the resulting outlet hydrographs 3 7 1 flooded areas table 7 shows the raw results of flooded areas for the 5 simulations and table 8 shows the variations with respect to the standard case case 3 it is observed that there is a greater sensitivity for the volume of water in transit than for the temporarily flooded area 3 7 2 recession period from the recession stretch of each hydrograph the corresponding model of 2 linear reservoirs has been established whose parameters are those of table 9 the differences between the results of the 5 simulations allow us to assess the degree of sensitivity with respect to the duration of the recession period the volume of waterstored or the routing flow in this way table 10 shows the results of the 5 simulations when the discharge has decreased considerably specifically at 0 5 m3 s it is observed that the sensitivity to the increase in roughness is much higher than the decrease in the roughness parameter also the sensitivity is greater for the volume of water stored than for the time of recession in addition table 11 shows discharge flow and stored volume results for the simulation instants 6 h and 12 h and table 12 shows the variations 4 discussion there is evidence that implementation of off stream reservoirs requires analysis of the impacts on the downstream areas of these reservoirs and especially when there are areas of special sensitivity such as wetlands the proper functioning of the reservoir can be summed up in a process of recharge storage and discharge through controlled conduits however it is necessary to anticipate the possibility of an accidental episode that can occur when the reservoir is full the downstream areas would be affected by an eventual emergency discharge both due to extension of the flooded areas and duration of the emptying in addition other impacts can be produced such as change in the physical chemical conditions of the water about the natural regime the case analysed shows a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the potential impact of an off stream reservoir as outlined in the preceding paragraph based on the characteristic curves of the reservoir and the discharge of the bottom drainage the discharge from a level of 288 masl would last 46 days with a flow that would range between 26 1 m3 s at the beginning of the discharge operation and 21 5 m3 s at the end the total volume discharged would be 98 hm3 the conductivity of surface water in the wetland area has an average value of 1 124 6 μs cm the extreme values are 1 660 μs cm and 590 μs cm as for groundwater we would have an average value of 2 426 μs cm and an oscillation between 1 238 μs cm and 4 230 μs cm from the la loteta reservoir there is a time series of conductivity measurements accompanied by another time series of the water level in the reservoir this article starts from an initial stratification hypothesis that correlates the conductivity measurements with conductivity stratification for a full reservoir from this stratification hypothesis a drawdown reservoir model arises where the discharge occurs in a stratified way first discharging the brackish water from the bottom strata and the water with lower conductivity from the most superficial stratum would discharge at the end of the emptying reservoir operation for a drawdown model we would have 98 hm3 of discharge 15 hm3 exceeding 1 500 μs cm and 20 hm3 exceeding 1 300 μs cm half of the reservoir water would be below 800 μs cm in relation to the conductivity of the water throughout the drawdown time it should be noted that 1 the average conductivity data in the surface water of the ebro river is 1 124 6 and ranges between 590 and 1 660 μs cm therefore the discharged water exceeds the maximum value of surface water in the natural regime for 10 days and the natural mean value for more than 30 days 2 for groundwater the mean conductivity value is 2 426 μs cm with extremes of 1 238 μs cm and 4 231 μs cm therefore the conductivity of the water from la loteta drawdown is lower than the conductivity of the groundwater and the impact on groundwater is positive in addition the maximum conductivity values of the groundwater are much higher than the values of the discharged water 3 the decrease in conductivity over time means that there will be a chemical washing of the higher salinity water retained in the wetland by the lower salinity water that circulates later the conductivity exceedance probability curves show the differences in the temporal distribution of conductivity between surface water in the natural regime and the discharge water the water of the ebro river presents a uniform distribution approximately centred on its mean value the discharge water presents another temporal distribution it stands out that the conductivity significantly exceeds that of the natural regime almost 50 of the discharge time but with notable differences the la loteta reservoir is supplied with water from the ebro river with an average conductivity of 1124 6 μs cm and water from the yesa reservoir with an average conductivity of 400 μs cm it is clear that the high concentrations shown in fig 9 do not come from the water supply but there is enrichment in salts from the evaporite substrate turning la loteta into brackish reservoirs during more than half of the discharge time the conductivity of the discharged water is of better quality regarding the two gauges for groundwater the one with the least conductivity is located next to the main channel of the ebro river and the other with the highest conductivity is located towards the outside of the valley near the outcrop of the evaporite formations it should be noted that the time of permanence of groundwater in the aquifer is very long or equivalently the renewal of the aquifer is slow during the 46 days of unloading the flooded area in the wetland is 32 65 ha the accumulated volume of water volume of water that is transiting from the upstream boundary condition to the downstream condition is 0 248 hm3 the specific water depth is 76 cm during the recession once the discharge emptying operation is finished after about 6 h the flooded area decreases to 22 23 ha the volume of water stored in transit is reduced to 0 085 hm3 the specific depth of water becomes 36 cm regarding the impact after emptying about 50 h after the discharge is finished barely 10 l s circulate the water retained in the study domain 6 h after the end of the unloading is 10 000 m3 which represents an average of 50 mm 5 conclusions this document analyses the impact produced by the drawdown in off stream brackish reservoirs the la loteta reservoir in spain whose main potential impact would be produced by an eventual emergency emptying is taken as a reference the potential impact would occur on a wetland that includes a 1 9 km long strip the identified and evaluated impacts are of several types 1 due to changes in the wetland surface water compositional regime over a long time 2 due to the long lasting of the discharge episode the groundwater of the alluvial aquifer of the wetland is also affected however it is a helpful impact 3 because the long lasting of flooding and that occur of both the lacustrine and marshy areas of the wetland as well as in areas that are usually dry the analytical and numerical investigations carried out have made it possible to obtain several interesting conclusions applicable to the type of hydraulic operations such as the one analyzed in this article 1 the recession curve gives rise to a supply of water that lasts indefinitely but significantly for about 40 h from the end of the emptying operation for the study case 2 exceedance probability curves for conductivity allow identification and assessment of potential impacts of off stream reservoirs 3 it is clear that the high concentrations significantly higher than the normal values of the supply water are caused by the enrichment of salts from the evaporite substrate turning the reservoir into a brackish deposit 4 the temporal distribution of conductivities between surface water in natural regime and discharge water from the reservoir shows significant differences the ebro river water presents a uniform distribution approximately centred on its mean value however the discharge water frol the reservoir presents a temporal distribution with almost 50 of the discharge time with conductivity values significantly higher nevertheless for slightly more than half of the discharge time the conductivity of the discharged water is of better quality 5 regarding groundwater it should be noted that its residence time in the aquifer is very long or equivalently the renewal of the aquifer is slow so the enrichment in salts is higher than for the water stored in the reservoir declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

3252,reservoirs are the main component of regulation of water resources in basins off stream reservoirs are a particular solution where water is stored in a secondary catchment other than the basin that produces the water resource this under certain conditions can modify the water regime of the downstream secondary catchment although uncommon one of the reservoir management operations is emergency emptying in the event of possible incidents that could put proper reservoir management at risk one of the environmental requirements of the drawdown operation of reservoirs is the study of environmental impacts in the event of a complete discharging event from a full reservoir state given the huge amount of water to be emptied and the duration of the operation which can last for days logically the impact will be greater when it comes to diversion basins it is imperative to evaluate the physical impact of prolonged flooding in downstream areas especially in areas of special ecosystem sensitivity additionally on certain occasions a physicochemical impact can be produced on flooded areas when the chemical composition of the discharged water differs from the usual concentrations exceedance probability curves for conductivity allow identification and assessment of potential impacts of off stream reservoirs this article presents a practical case assessment of the impact of an off stream reservoir located in evaporitic soils with a high content of salts increasing the chemical concentration of stored water that is distributed in different compositional strata the emptying is carried out on a wetland with important ecological value and the impact of extension and duration of the flood on the wetland are studied as well as exposure to the presence of water with different chemical concentrations over the time the incident lasts keywords emergency emptying reservoirs brackish reservoirs off stream reservoirs stratified reservoirs shee software iber software 1 introduction the emergency drawdown from off stream brackish reservoirs with the extension and duration of the induced flood and the change generated by the physicochemical conditions of the circulating water all have meaningful impacts on downstream ecological areas hence carrying out a detailed analysis of the phenomenon may be a clever purpose the regulation of water supply to

particular often result in wetland degradation pattison williams et al 2018 rushdi et al 2018 another aspect to be analysed in off stream reservoirs is the change in water regime in the affected

et al 2016 rodríguez bachiller et al 2019 in addition it should be noted that the change in the hydro chemical and geochemical characteristics of the water that circulates through secondary streams and through their ecosystems and wetlands which are fragile and sensitive areas can cause significant damage chau 2007 belletti et al 2020 nourani et al 2021 it is necessary to control this in a rational way so that damage is acceptable or null this article analyses the potential impact produced by emergency emptying in an off stream reservoir located in soils of an evaporite nature which increase the salinity of the dammed water the salinity is greater the longer the water stays in the brackish reservoir we analyse a practical case of an off stream reservoir located in ne spain on the right bank of the ebro river and located in a small lateral catchment about 7 km from the main river course it is necessary to cross a fragile wetland that has great ecological value among other aspects the emptying time the volume and circulating streamflow during the discharge the saline concentration of the reservoir water that are analysed through conductivity with real data the stratification of the water quality and the compositional changes throughout the discharging operation the areas that will be affected by the flooding produced by the discharge as well as a period of flow recession that extends beyond the strict period of reservoir emptying exceedance probability curves are established that make it possible to compare the exposure times of different states of chemical concentration of the drawdown water with the surface water of the natural environment and with the groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the la loteta reservoir in spain is an off stream reservoir which stores the water supply for the city of zaragoza the purpose of the reservoir is to constitute the fundamental piece in the regulation of the three great channels of the ebro river axis in the main hydrographic basin of spain especially the canal imperial de aragon avoiding punctual discharges in the ebro reservoir too away from the demand points it also represents an appreciable complement to the regulation of the ebro river allows the development of recreational and tourist uses and makes it more flexible to maintain minimum ecological flows in the axis of the ebro river the reservoir is filled through two sources of flow one of which comes from the yesa reservoir on the aragón river in the pyrenean mountain range with excellent water quality and very little mineralization the second source of water is the canal imperial de aragón which captures water from the ebro river whose quality is lower with greater turbidity and strong mineralization the reservoir is located on miocene evaporitic soils composed mainly of gypsum although the presence of other salts such as chloride type halite and carnalite and sulphates such as anhydrite glauberite thenardite and mirabilite is also significant gutierrez et al 2005 evaporitic lithology produces an increase in the salinity of the dammed water which is greater the longer the residence time fig 1 shows the study area with the ebro river in the central axis whose floodplain presents a multitude of meandering paleo streams that have frequently given rise to various wetlands such as fornazos an emergency emptying channel has been designed for the la loteta reservoir which empties into the fornazos wetland 2 2 available data 2 2 1 general data from la loteta reservoir the main data of the la loteta reservoir that are of interest for this study such as elevation level storage volume water mirror surface and coastline length for different reservoir levels are presented in table 1 a elevation storage curve for la loteta reservoir the la loteta reservoir exploitation rules document contains the elevation vs storage data of the reservoir from which a polynomial fit of degree 2 has been obtained fig 2 with a coefficient of determination r2 close to 1 in the range of interest in the present study with this polynomial equation 1 the reservoir storage volume s can be obtained as a function of the water elevation zw 1 s 0 3125096 z w 2 168 73367 z w 22778 632 as an example when applying the polynomial of equation 1 for the full supply level 288 00 masl a volume of 104 13 hm3 results that coincides with the nominal volume for the level of the emergency drain 273 50 masl the result is 6 40 hm3 this will be the calculation range that will be used later in the different models b elevation discharge curve for the emergency drain as mentioned above the emergency drainage channel from la loteta reservoir empties into the fornazos wetland the discharge into this channel occurs through a bottom drain that acts as an emergency drain the elevation discharge relationship of which is given in the la loteta reservoir exploitation rules document the data of which are represented in fig 3 and they fit a polynomial of degree 2 equation 2 with a coefficient of determination r2 close to 1 in the range of interest for the present study with the polynomial the discharge q can be obtained as a function of the height of the water surface in the reservoir zw 2 q 2 56591 10 3 z w 2 1 792397 z w 277 01 2 2 2 water quality data a water quality from la loteta reservoir the electrical conductivity of an electrolyte is correlated with the amount of dissolved ions and this will be the reference parameter that this study adopts to assess water quality measured in μs cm la loteta reservoir is supplied by two water sources one from the yesa reservoir which has an average conductivity of 400 μs cm and the other from the canal imperial with water of the ebro river with an average conductivity of 1124 μs cm the proportion of supply from each source is dependent on water resources management at basin scale and therefore varies substantially over time fig 4 contains two gauged time series that span from january 1 2010 to january 1 2019 nine years the conductivity series is on the primary vertical axis and on the secondary vertical axis water elevation in the reservoir is represented at first glance it is observed that there is a good agreement between both time series b quality of surface water from fornazos wetland in the web portal of the spanish water administration https www chebro es there is a gauge point on the left bank of the ebro river in the town of pradilla whose coordinates epsg 25830 are x 644 040 and y 4 635 606 fig 1 table 2 shows the conductivity time series whose mean value is 1124 6 μs cm the extreme values are 1660 y 590 μs cm c quality of groundwater from fornazos wetland for groundwater data are available from two inventoried wells in the water registry of the spanish water administration one is located in the town of pradilla 261380016 and the other is in the town of boquiñeni 261370018 fig 1 tables 3 and 4 contain their time series in the well of pradilla the mean of the data is 2126 6 μs cm while in the well of boquiñeni the mean of measurements is 2726 6 μs cm the respective maximum and minimum values are 2691 and 1238 μs cm for the well of pradilla and 4230 and 1925 μs cm for the well of boquiñeni we can conclude a mean of 2426 6 μs cm and extremes of 1238 μs cm to 4230 μs cm 2 3 interpretation of the conductivity of water the specific conductivity of water is its ability to conduct an electrical current the unit of measure in the international system of units is is siemens per meter s m in waters with low electrolyte content the conductivity is usually expressed in μs cm one siemens per meter s m corresponds to 1 104 microsiemens per centimeter μs cm high quality deionized water has a conductivity of about 0 055 µs cm typical drinking water is in the range of 30 to 150 µs cm while seawater is close to 50 000 µs cm conductivity is the inverse of resistivity the is unit for measuring resistivity is the ohm ω 1 µs cm 1 mω cm when the majority of total dissolved solids in water are electrolytes i e dissociated the conductivity of the solution is proportional to its concentration a common parameter used to describe the total amount of dissolved salts in water is tds total dissolved solids tds is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved ions measured in milligrams per liter or ppm parts per million where 1 mg l 1 ppm electrical conductivity is therefore related to tds and is used as a measure of the total amount of dissolved salts generally speaking to higher the concentration of dissolved salts higher the electrical conductivity however above a certain concentration of ions in the solution the electrical conductivity does not increase with the concentration of ions this is the result of the formation of pairs of ions or counter ions which weaken the electrical charge of each other for the range of conductivities measured in this study the tds can be estimated from the conductivity using the following equation tds ppm 0 64 c o n t u c t i v i t y μ s c m this equation only provides an estimate and the actual tds may vary significantly from the calculated value depending on the composition of the water most agricultural conductivity standards are given for readings at 25 c however the conductivity reading may vary depending on temperature higher the temperature higher electrical conductivity is as a general rule the electrical conductivity of water increases by 2 3 for every 1 c rise in temperature 2 4 reservoir drawdown model 2 4 1 emptying hydrograph using the polynomials of the storage curve equation 1 and fig 2 and the discharge curve of the bottom drain equation 2 and fig 3 applying the modified puls method one of the routing methods for reservoirs a nonlinear model of reservoir drawdown can be generated that leads to a discharge hydrograph and other characteristics over the emptying time such as stored and drained volumes water elevation in the reservoir and value of the conductivity of the withdrawn water 2 4 2 conductivity exceedance probability curves exceedance probability curves for conductivity cep curves show the probability that a certain conductivity value is exceeded in addition to showing the conductivity value that is exceeded during a certain percentage of time once all the results of the drawdown model have been obtained exceedance probability curves can be elaborated upon the one corresponding to the conductivity is the one that will be most useful in assessing the duration of the different hydro chemical conditions produced on the downstream environment when emptying the reservoir these conditions can be compared with the exceedance probability curves corresponding to the usual conditions elaborated from the actual data measured in the surface and groundwater gauges 2 5 hydrodynamic routing model through the impact areas the iber computer application is software developed by several spanish institutions specifically the polytechnic university of catalonia the university of a coruña the international center for numerical methods for engineering cimne and the center for studies and experimentation of public works cedex with funding from the general water directorate of the spanish ministry of the environment the iber numerical engine is the fortran code f90 which solves the depth integrated 2d navier stokes equations for shallow waters known as saint venant s or 2d shallow water equations in non steady state equations 3 4 and 5 to solve these equations the numerical method of finite volumes is used iber uses an explicit numerical scheme of the upwind type among the different existing numerical schemes this is the one that best adapts to two dimensional flows in a free surface since without calculation devices it is capable of solving wave front and regime change problems 3 h t h u x x h u y y m s 4 h u x t h u x 2 x h u x u y y g h z

the pond located in the south central area of the wetland which is not reflected in the model and the second to introduce a stream drainage channel of the irrigation returns located in the centre of the wetland and which empties into the ebro river with this model a structured mesh with a tolerance of 0 25 m has been generated with a maximum side of 5 m and a minimum side of 0 5 m the second characteristic that must be introduced in the program is the manning roughness coefficient which for simplicity has been used for the entire calculation domain being 0 045 we consider this to be representative for both the central channel with lush vegetation on the slopes and for the virgin area of the wetland with abundant hydrophilic vegetation as well as for the area of alfalfa and corn crops another characteristic to introduce is boundary conditions in the inlet condition an inlet hydrograph must be entered which is defined in the results section and corresponds to the emptying hydrograph of the reservoir as an outlet contour condition already in the ebro river we considered a subcritical regime with the height of the water surface corresponding to the low water channel which is 221 00 masl 2 6 recession model after the reservoir emptying equation 6 represents the recession of a linear deposit combining two linear deposits n 2 for equation 7 and adjusting the parameters αi and qoi from the stretch of the recession curve of the emptying hydrograph an equation is obtained to prolong the time of the recession of said hydrograph equation 8 represents the volume of water that is stored in each reservoir and that little by little feeds the flow produced by the recession curve of the hydrograph for more detail this methodology is developed in depth in

ends at water elevation 273 50 masl which is reached 46 days after the start of discharge the volume discharged is 97 5 hm3 table 5 presents the results of the la loteta drawdown model on a daily scale at each moment we have the volume stored in la loteta the volume that has been emptied the elevation of the water stratum that is being emptied its depth and the conductivity of the water that has been emptied at that moment from the results of the reservoir drawdown model fig 5 synthesizes the drainage hydrograph that begins with a streamflow of 26 4 m3 s at 288 00 masl and ends with a streamflow of 21 5 m3 s at 273 50 masl in addition this same figure represents the daily volume released 3 2 reservoir stratification and conductivity elevation curve it is assumed that the best estimate for the distribution of conductivity values in the different strata of the reservoir will be obtained using the available data the available data are conductivity measurements on the water surface but made at different levels of reservoir filling the influence of the salt concentration will be proportional to the distance to the bottom of the reservoir a characteristic that is observed in the measurements made and that corroborates the assumption in section 2 2 2 and in the time series of fig 4 we can see an inverse relationship between the water level and the reservoir volume and the measured conductivity in that level as has been said before this inverse relationship can be interpreted under the hypothesis that there is stratification of the water conductivity in the reservoir from here it can be hypothesized that when the reservoir is full there is stratification of the conductivity of the water in the reservoir similar to the conductivities measured at different levels of reservoir filling in this way the relationship between the depth of the water and the conductivity would be such that the greater the depth or lower elevation the greater the conductivity fig 6 represents the elevation conductivity relationship in the range of data handled a polynomial of degree 3 equation 9 is fitted with a coefficient of determination r2 of the order of 0 82 where ec is the electrical conductivity and zw is the water elevation 9 ec 0 5247449 z w 3 453 8185 z w 2 130 803 95 z w 12 565 883 fig 7 shows a graph similar to the previous one with the storage s of the reservoir which is very useful in this case an exponential curve equation 10 is fitted with r2 about 0 83 this curve reveals that of the 98 hm3 of drawdown only 15 hm3 exceeds 1500 μs cm and 20 hm3 exceeds 1300 μs cm it also follows that half the reservoir water is below 800 μs cm 10 ec 4889 01741 s 0 445156 3 3 conductivity time curve the last column in the drawdown model in table 5 shows the results of applying the polynomial of equation 9 so that the conductivity of the outlet flow is calculated for each time interval of the model the primary axis of the graph in fig 8 represents the depth of the water stratum that is discharged in each time interval and the secondary axis represents the conductivity curve over the discharge time when contrasting the conductivity results throughout the discharge with the average conductivities of the analytics measured in surface water and in groundwater described in section 2 2 2 the following observations are deduced 1 the average conductivity data in the surface water of the ebro river is 1 124 6 μs cm and ranges between 590 and 1 660 μs cm therefore the discharged water exceeds the maximum value of surface water in the natural regime for 10 days and the natural mean value for more than 30 days 2 for groundwater the mean conductivity value is 2 426 μs cm with extremes of 1 238 μs cm and 4 231 μs cm therefore the conductivity of the water from la loteta drawdown is lower than the conductivity of the groundwater therefore the impact on groundwater is positive in addition the maximum conductivity values of the groundwater are much higher than the values of the discharged water 3 the decrease in conductivity over time means that there will be a chemical washing of the higher salinity water retained in the wetland by the lower salinity water that circulate later 3 4 conductivity exceedance curves the results of the calculation of the cep curves are shown in fig 9 the cep curve for the discharge of la loteta calculated with the results of the discharge model of table 5 is shown said cep curve can be compared with other curves one corresponding to the surface water of the ebro river and the other two corresponding to groundwater the one with the least conductivity located next to the main channel of the ebro river and the other with the highest conductivity located towards the outside of the valley near the outcrop of the evaporite formations it should be noted that the time of permanence of groundwater in the aquifer is very long or equivalently the renewal of the aquifer is slow the graph also highlights the differences in the temporal distribution of conductivity between surface water in the natural regime and the discharge water the water of the ebro river presents a uniform distribution approximately centred on its mean value the discharge water presents another temporal distribution it stands out that the conductivity remarkably exceeds that of the natural regime almost 50 of the discharge time but with notable differences however during slightly more than half of the discharge time the conductivity of the discharged water is of better quality 3 5 quantitative analysis of flooded areas 3 5 1 hydrographs the iber model is a two dimensional numerical model in a non steady regime so to carry out simulations with the complete drawdown time plus the corresponding recession times a simulation time of the order of 60 days would be necessary which entails a very long time of computing in this case if no measurements were taken the simulation and computing times would be almost the same the discharge hydrograph will be similar to that of fig 10 however most of the discharge time can be assimilated to a quasi steady regime for the simulation with the iber program a temporal shortening of the discharge hydrograph has been carried out fig 10 shows a hydrograph of the input boundary condition outlet of the la loteta emptying channel and another hydrograph in the output boundary condition in the ebro river that comes from the numerical calculation of the program the simulation was carried out for a simulation time of 12 h with an inlet hydrograph that changes from 0 to 26 13 m3 s in one hour it then remains constant until the sixth hour of simulation and changes to 0 m3 s in 15 min the simulation time 6 h represents the maximum flood in the simulation domain the outlet hydrograph shows a slight abatement which if prolonged for a long time would become permanent it also shows a recession curve that in the simulation time of 12 hours has not ended 3 5 2 depth maps fig 11 contains the flood depth at simulation times 6 h and 12 h the simulation time 6 h corresponds to the permanent model of the 46 days of discharge at the simulation time 6 h the average depth in the entire domain is 71 cm with the maximum being 2 7 m in the case of the simulation time 12 h the average depth is 30 cm and the maximum is 1 62 m in the outlet boundary condition for the simulation time 6 h the flow is about 26 m3 s while for the simulation time of 12 h the flow is 1 84 m3 s at this moment we can still observe a significant flooded area that will slowly leave as surface runoff but most of it is retained and will exit through infiltration and evapotranspiration 3 5 3 velocity maps fig 12 shows the stream velocity distribution map at the simulation time 6 h and 12 h truly the simulation time of 6 h would be the steady model of the 46 days of discharge at simulation time 6 h the average velocity of the calculation domain is 0 21 m s and the maximum is 3 97 m s for the simulation time 12 h they are 0 02 and 2 38 m s respectively for the simulation time of 6 h which represents the 46 days of drawdown the main flow runs through the central channel of the wetland and through a strip of flooding at a velocity of 0 25 0 50 m s with the exception of the final part of the channel where the velocity is greater at the simulation time 12 h there is a residual velocity of 0 to 0 1 m s that represents the flooded zone after the emptying 3 5 4 quantitative results of flooded areas at the simulation time 6 h representative of the 46 days of discharge reservoir the flooded area in the simulation domain discounting the area of the main course of the ebro river is 32 65 ha the volume of water accumulated in the simulation domain volume of water that is routing from the upstream boundary condition to the downstream boundary condition is 0 248 hm3 the specific or average water depth is 76 cm at the simulation time 12 h representative of the recession period the flooded area in the simulation domain is 22 23 ha the volume of water stored in the simulation domain volume of water that is routing from the upstream boundary condition to the downstream boundary condition is 0 085 hm3 the specific or average water depth is 36 cm 3 6 recession after the reservoir emptying from the period of the recession curve obtained in the downstream boundary hydrograph in the iber model see fig 13 and through the fit by least squares of the parameters αi and qoi of equations 4 and 5 the recession model that appears in fig 13 is established the parameters of the recession model are those of table 6 at the end of the simulation with iber hour 12 the streamflow rate is 1 84 m3 s with equations 6 and 7 the flow is 10 l s at 51 h with equation 8 the volume stored in the wetland can be calculated specifically for hour 12 it would be 0 055 hm3 as the volume measured in the model is 0 065 hm3 see section 3 5 4 the volume retained in the holes of the ground will be 10 000 m3 which represents an average of 50 mm of retained water logically there are sites with greater amounts and others with nothing 3 7 sensitivity analysis for the flooded areas and the recession period in hydrodynamic modelling the state of the ground and its ability to allow faster or slower flow is controlled by the manning roughness parameter for this reason a sensitivity study has been carried out for this parameter carrying out 5 simulations with different roughness values between 0 025 and 0 065 taking the initially used value 0 045 as a reference fig 14 shows the resulting outlet hydrographs 3 7 1 flooded areas table 7 shows the raw results of flooded areas for the 5 simulations and table 8 shows the variations with respect to the standard case case 3 it is observed that there is a greater sensitivity for the volume of water in transit than for the temporarily flooded area 3 7 2 recession period from the recession stretch of each hydrograph the corresponding model of 2 linear reservoirs has been established whose parameters are those of table 9 the differences between the results of the 5 simulations allow us to assess the degree of sensitivity with respect to the duration of the recession period the volume of waterstored or the routing flow in this way table 10 shows the results of the 5 simulations when the discharge has decreased considerably specifically at 0 5 m3 s it is observed that the sensitivity to the increase in roughness is much higher than the decrease in the roughness parameter also the sensitivity is greater for the volume of water stored than for the time of recession in addition table 11 shows discharge flow and stored volume results for the simulation instants 6 h and 12 h and table 12 shows the variations 4 discussion there is evidence that implementation of off stream reservoirs requires analysis of the impacts on the downstream areas of these reservoirs and especially when there are areas of special sensitivity such as wetlands the proper functioning of the reservoir can be summed up in a process of recharge storage and discharge through controlled conduits however it is necessary to anticipate the possibility of an accidental episode that can occur when the reservoir is full the downstream areas would be affected by an eventual emergency discharge both due to extension of the flooded areas and duration of the emptying in addition other impacts can be produced such as change in the physical chemical conditions of the water about the natural regime the case analysed shows a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the potential impact of an off stream reservoir as outlined in the preceding paragraph based on the characteristic curves of the reservoir and the discharge of the bottom drainage the discharge from a level of 288 masl would last 46 days with a flow that would range between 26 1 m3 s at the beginning of the discharge operation and 21 5 m3 s at the end the total volume discharged would be 98 hm3 the conductivity of surface water in the wetland area has an average value of 1 124 6 μs cm the extreme values are 1 660 μs cm and 590 μs cm as for groundwater we would have an average value of 2 426 μs cm and an oscillation between 1 238 μs cm and 4 230 μs cm from the la loteta reservoir there is a time series of conductivity measurements accompanied by another time series of the water level in the reservoir this article starts from an initial stratification hypothesis that correlates the conductivity measurements with conductivity stratification for a full reservoir from this stratification hypothesis a drawdown reservoir model arises where the discharge occurs in a stratified way first discharging the brackish water from the bottom strata and the water with lower conductivity from the most superficial stratum would discharge at the end of the emptying reservoir operation for a drawdown model we would have 98 hm3 of discharge 15 hm3 exceeding 1 500 μs cm and 20 hm3 exceeding 1 300 μs cm half of the reservoir water would be below 800 μs cm in relation to the conductivity of the water throughout the drawdown time it should be noted that 1 the average conductivity data in the surface water of the ebro river is 1 124 6 and ranges between 590 and 1 660 μs cm therefore the discharged water exceeds the maximum value of surface water in the natural regime for 10 days and the natural mean value for more than 30 days 2 for groundwater the mean conductivity value is 2 426 μs cm with extremes of 1 238 μs cm and 4 231 μs cm therefore the conductivity of the water from la loteta drawdown is lower than the conductivity of the groundwater and the impact on groundwater is positive in addition the maximum conductivity values of the groundwater are much higher than the values of the discharged water 3 the decrease in conductivity over time means that there will be a chemical washing of the higher salinity water retained in the wetland by the lower salinity water that circulates later the conductivity exceedance probability curves show the differences in the temporal distribution of conductivity between surface water in the natural regime and the discharge water the water of the ebro river presents a uniform distribution approximately centred on its mean value the discharge water presents another temporal distribution it stands out that the conductivity significantly exceeds that of the natural regime almost 50 of the discharge time but with notable differences the la loteta reservoir is supplied with water from the ebro river with an average conductivity of 1124 6 μs cm and water from the yesa reservoir with an average conductivity of 400 μs cm it is clear that the high concentrations shown in fig 9 do not come from the water supply but there is enrichment in salts from the evaporite substrate turning la loteta into brackish reservoirs during more than half of the discharge time the conductivity of the discharged water is of better quality regarding the two gauges for groundwater the one with the least conductivity is located next to the main channel of the ebro river and the other with the highest conductivity is located towards the outside of the valley near the outcrop of the evaporite formations it should be noted that the time of permanence of groundwater in the aquifer is very long or equivalently the renewal of the aquifer is slow during the 46 days of unloading the flooded area in the wetland is 32 65 ha the accumulated volume of water volume of water that is transiting from the upstream boundary condition to the downstream condition is 0 248 hm3 the specific water depth is 76 cm during the recession once the discharge emptying operation is finished after about 6 h the flooded area decreases to 22 23 ha the volume of water stored in transit is reduced to 0 085 hm3 the specific depth of water becomes 36 cm regarding the impact after emptying about 50 h after the discharge is finished barely 10 l s circulate the water retained in the study domain 6 h after the end of the unloading is 10 000 m3 which represents an average of 50 mm 5 conclusions this document analyses the impact produced by the drawdown in off stream brackish reservoirs the la loteta reservoir in spain whose main potential impact would be produced by an eventual emergency emptying is taken as a reference the potential impact would occur on a wetland that includes a 1 9 km long strip the identified and evaluated impacts are of several types 1 due to changes in the wetland surface water compositional regime over a long time 2 due to the long lasting of the discharge episode the groundwater of the alluvial aquifer of the wetland is also affected however it is a helpful impact 3 because the long lasting of flooding and that occur of both the lacustrine and marshy areas of the wetland as well as in areas that are usually dry the analytical and numerical investigations carried out have made it possible to obtain several interesting conclusions applicable to the type of hydraulic operations such as the one analyzed in this article 1 the recession curve gives rise to a supply of water that lasts indefinitely but significantly for about 40 h from the end of the emptying operation for the study case 2 exceedance probability curves for conductivity allow identification and assessment of potential impacts of off stream reservoirs 3 it is clear that the high concentrations significantly higher than the normal values of the supply water are caused by the enrichment of salts from the evaporite substrate turning the reservoir into a brackish deposit 4 the temporal distribution of conductivities between surface water in natural regime and discharge water from the reservoir shows significant differences the ebro river water presents a uniform distribution approximately centred on its mean value however the discharge water frol the reservoir presents a temporal distribution with almost 50 of the discharge time with conductivity values significantly higher nevertheless for slightly more than half of the discharge time the conductivity of the discharged water is of better quality 5 regarding groundwater it should be noted that its residence time in the aquifer is very long or equivalently the renewal of the aquifer is slow so the enrichment in salts is higher than for the water stored in the reservoir declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

3253,in the loess region of northwest china the accumulation of soluble salt in the soil due to the capillary rise of water often damages earthen buildings thus studies on the cutting off of the capillary rise path are vital as a hydrophobicity inducer polyvinyl alcohol pva solution with water as the solvent has the potential to function as a barrier this study mainly aims to evaluate the feasibility of using pva treated soil as a waterproof layer to prevent water salt capillary rise through soil column experiments and the effects of the waterproof layer thickness waterproof layer position pva content ambient temperature and type of salt solution on the capillary action the results indicate that a 1 0 pva treated soil with extreme water repellency i e dried at 20 c can perfectly prevent the water salt from migrating to the top of the sample regardless of the waterproof layer position waterproof layer thickness and type of soluble salt for a 0 5 pva treated soil dried at 20 c the lower waterproof layer prevents the water salt capillary rise while the middle and upper layers exhibit less effectiveness however the pva treated soil that loses its hydrophobicity after a treatment at 100 c cannot prevent the water salt capillary rise confirming that the prevention of capillary rise is due to the soil hydrophobicity the waterproof layer thickness and type of soluble salt are less significant than the waterproof layer position pva content and ambient temperature this study proposes a modified green ampt model to describe the capillary rise and the hydraulic conductivity and pore size are obtained using the modified model these parameters and the interface effect are used to explain the experimental results finally the application of pva treated soil as a waterproof layer to inhibit water salt capillary rise is illustrated keywords waterproof layer hydrophobicity capillary action soil column polyvinyl alcohol 1 introduction loess soil as a foundation or restoration material is widely used in northwest china wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 however the soil structure may suffer serious damage owing to the long term actions of water and salts basal erosion which is caused by salt accumulation at the bottom of the earthen wall due to the capillary rise of water is the most typical example fujii et al 2009 shen et al 2020 talebmorad et al 2021 therefore studies on the cutting off of the capillary rise path are vital previous studies have presented a hydrophobic damp proof course achieved by injecting alkyl and alkoxy siloxanes with volatile organics as a solvent to prevent capillary induced intrusion of pore water into the masonry wall lopez arce et al 2009 ostad ali askar et al 2017 young 2008 however volatile organics may cause environmental pollution and water as a solvent is preferred young 2008 polyvinyl alcohol pva solution which is used in eye drops and cosmetic compositions can induce soil hydrophobicity chakraborty et al 2019 luaces rodríguez et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 it uses water as a solvent and is non toxic harmless and environment friendly therefore the pva solution as an additive has the potential to obtain a waterproof layer and this study evaluates the effectiveness of the pva waterproof layer through a soil column experiment zhang et al 2021 discussed the factors i e pva content temperature water content surface roughness particle size and particle shape influencing the hydrophobicity of the pva treated soil in detail the results indicated that the hydrophobicity of the 1 0 pva treated soil was stronger than that of the 0 5 pva treated soil when the soil samples were dried at 20 c however as the ambient temperature increased to 80 100 c the pva treated soil became hydrophilic thus both pva content and temperature are important factors for controlling the hydrophobicity of the treated soil zhang et al 2020 reported that when the pva treated soil was repeatedly immersed in water the surface hydrophobicity was lost but the interior of the samples was hydrophobic thus the thickness and position of the pva treated soil layer in the soil columns may change the water blocking effect graber et al 2009 found that the type of the salt solution affected the drop penetration time the soil hydrophobicity increased with an increase in the drop penetration time on the soil surface indicating that the capillary rise for different types of salt solutions in the pva treated soil may differ therefore in the present study a soil column experiment was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of pva treated soil as a waterproof layer in preventing water salt capillary rise and the effects of the above mentioned factors on the capillary action several hydrological models have been proposed ostad ali askari and shayan 2021 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021a ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021b the green ampt ga model is widely used for vertical and horizontal infiltrations ali et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 however this model has rarely been reported for the capillary rise of water in soil and our study attempted to apply it to the capillary action for the vertical infiltration the water head caused by gravity and soil suction in the same direction were considered as the driving forces without ponding depth whereas the gravity head and soil suction head were in opposite directions for the capillary rise of water based on this fact the present study modified the traditional ga model and extended the model to the capillary rise in layered soils according to mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 and ma et al 2010 the capillary action in representative samples was described using this modified model and the hydraulic conductivity and pore size of the soil samples were obtained using the modified ga model owing to the difference between soil properties the interface of two soils may change the water infiltration such as in a capillary barrier i e a relatively fine soil layer overlies a relatively coarse soil layer lu and likos 2004 previous studies have focused mainly on the interface effect due to the pore size difference in the soil in contrast our study adopted the contact angle and pore size to interpret the experimental results to address this research gap this study aimed to i examine the feasibility of using pva treated soil as a waterproof layer in preventing water salt capillary rise through a soil column experiment ii evaluate the effects of waterproof layer thickness waterproof layer position pva content ambient temperature and type of salt solution on the capillary action and iii propose a modified ga model to describe the capillary rise of water in layered soil and explain the experimental results using the modified ga model and interface effect 2 materials and methods 2 1 material characterisation 2 1 1 soil properties experimental soil loess was obtained from lanzhou china and its physical and chemical properties are listed in table 1 the specific gravity liquid limit and plasticity limit of the soil were 2 71 28 0 and 17 3 respectively according to the unified soil classification system astm 2017 it was classified as lean clay the main minerals measured through x ray diffraction rigaku d max 2400 included quartz calcite muscovite feldspar kaolinite chlorite and illite the main ions measured through ion chromatography ion chromatograph ics 2500 included na k mg2 ca2 cl no 3 and so 4 2 2 1 2 pva solution pva ch2choh n with a high degree of alcoholysis is composed of a macromolecular main chain with hydrophobic c c bonds and hydrophilic hydroxyl groups solid pva cannot be dissolved in water at room temperature because of the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups xue et al 2015 however it can be dissolved by adjusting the temperature stirring time and solvent solute ratio after this treatment the obtained pva solution is also called an sh solution and its properties have been reported by zhang et al 2021 2 1 3 sodium sulphate and sodium chloride sodium chloride nacl and sodium sulphate na2so4 are the most common soluble salts in northwest china shen et al 2020 thus nacl and na2so4 were the focus in this study they were procured from xilong chemical reagent co ltd and the purity of each was higher than 99 three types of salt solution each having a salt content of 1 wt were used in this study nacl na2so4 and mixed salt i e 0 5 each of nacl and na2so4 solutions ozdemir et al 2009 reported that at 23 c the surface tension of deionised water is 72 72 mn m which is slightly lower than that of 1 nacl solution 72 93 mn m granneman et al 2017 found that the surface tension of pure water at 25 c is 71 50 mn m which is slightly lower than that of 1 na2so4 solution 71 70 mn m the addition of 1 nacl or na2so4 slightly increases the surface tension of water and the effects of these two salts on the surface tension were similar in this study 2 2 experimental design a factorial experiment was conducted to test the effects of the waterproof layer thickness waterproof layer position pva content ambient temperature and type of salt solution on the capillary action the detailed experimental design is presented in table 2 the waterproof layer thickness was considered to be 1 2 and 3 cm the waterproof layer was positioned at the upper middle and lower portions of a 10 cm soil column ambient temperatures were 20 and 100 c the salt solution included distilled water nacl solution na2so4 solution and mixed nacl na2so4 solution furthermore four soil columns without any waterproof layer were designed as a control when the waterproof layer position was considered as a variable its thickness was 2 cm and when the waterproof layer thickness was considered as a variable it was positioned at the middle therefore there were only five cases considering the position and thickness of the waterproof layer as presented in table 2 2 3 specimen preparation the pva treated soil acted as a hydrophobic waterproof layer to eliminate the effect of soluble salts on the soil hydrophobicity the waterproof layer soil was pretreated for desalination dry soil powder was mixed with distilled water in a container to obtained a designed mass ratio of 1 5 and then stirred for 30 min the supernatant was removed from the container after the soil particles settled the desalinization processes were repeated until the measured electrical conductivity of the supernatant was 300 μs cm which indicated that the soluble salt had been removed sufficiently cui et al 2012 the experimental soil including the desalinated and untreated soil was dried in an oven at 105 c and passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove gravel particles the untreated soil was stirred uniformly with distilled water non waterproof layer soil while the desalinated soil was mixed uniformly with the pva solution and distilled water according to the designed ratio waterproof layer soil the designed gravimetric water content was controlled at 16 and the designed pva contents were 0 5 and 1 0 zhang et al 2021 soil columns were prepared through layer by layer compaction according to the position and thickness of the waterproof layer for example a soil column with a middle waterproof layer was divided into three layers of compaction the first layer was the soil below the waterproof layer the second layer was the waterproof layer the third layer was the soil above the waterproof layer a total of 84 soil columns with 50 mm diameter and 100 mm height table 2 were prepared and dried at room temperature approximately 20 c for 28 d subsequently 40 out of 84 specimens were cured at 100 c for 1 d to eliminate the hydrophobicity zhang et al 2021 and cooled to room temperature to be consistent with the remaining after the mass and temperature of all samples were stable at room temperature a water salt capillary rise experiment was conducted as shown in fig 1 a cylindrical samples were placed on a porous stone placed in water or salt solution the water level was controlled to partially submerge the porous stone leaving a gap at the bottom of the soil column a scale marked with an interval of 1 cm was vertically placed along each specimen as a benchmark for the ease of recording the time for the wetting front to rise by 1 cm when the wetting front was not uniform preferential flow the time of reaching the benchmark first was recorded fig 1 b owing to the large difference between the capillary actions in these samples the termination conditions of the experiment were mainly divided into three cases sample collapse top surface wetting and after 3 h or 10 h a few samples exhibited nearly no change after 3 h and thus the experiment was extended to 10 h to confirm the superiority of the hydrophobic waterproof layer the sample mass was weighed before and after the experiment and the water absorption until the experiment termination was calculated according to eq 1 1 p m 2 m 1 m 1 100 where p is the water absorption until the experiment termination m 1 is the sample mass g before the experiment and m 2 is the sample mass g after the experiment finally 84 soil samples were sliced at the calibrated height to measure the water content and conductivity gb t 50123 2019 ostad ali askari 2018 and the measurements were performed at 924 locations furthermore in the four control samples without waterproof layers the main ion contents were measured every 2 cm using ion chromatography to demonstrate the relationship between the conductivity and content of the soluble salt 2 4 modified ga model a modified ga model was proposed to describe the capillary rise of water in the layered soil the hydraulic conductivity and pore size obtained using this modified model were used to explain the experimental results for the vertical infiltration the traditional ga model which is considered as a one dimensional model with a sharp wetting front can be expressed as green and ampt 1911 2 i di dt k s m z h z where i is the infiltration rate m s i is the cumulative infiltration m z is the infiltration depth m t is the infiltration time s h is the ponding depth m sm is the wetting front suction head m and k is the hydraulic conductivity m s for the capillary rise of water the gravity head and soil suction head were in opposite directions and the ponding depth was 0 m therefore the modified ga model can be expressed as 3 i di dt k s m h h where h is the height of capillary rise m based on an assumed sharp wetting front the relationship between the cumulative infiltration and height of capillary rise can be expressed as 4 i δ θ h θ f θ i h where δθ is the change in the volumetric water content m3 m3 θf is the volumetric water content at the end of the experiment m3 m3 obtained from the measured mass water content and θi is the initial volumetric water content approximately equal to 0 m3 m3 in this study substituting eq 4 into eq 3 yields the following expression 5 dh dt k δ θ s m h h at 0 s the height of capillary rise was 0 m therefore eq 5 can be expressed as 6 kt δ θ h δ θ s m l n 1 h s m eq 6 can be used to describe the capillary rise of water in the non layered soil i e the soil samples without waterproof layers for the soil samples with a lower waterproof layer the soil columns had two layers the lower layer i e the first layer can be described using eq 6 7 k 1 t δ θ 1 h δ θ 1 s m 1 ln 1 h s m 1 h d 1 o r t t 1 where d 1 is the thickness m of the first layer measured using a ruler and t 1 is the time s when the wetting front reaches the top surface of the first layer monitored using a timer subscript 1 represents the first layer to be able to distinguish it from the second layer subscript 2 for the second layer the relationship between the cumulative infiltration and height of capillary rise can be expressed as 8 i δ θ 1 d 1 δ θ 2 h d 1 substituting eq 8 into eq 3 yields the following expression 9 dh dt k δ θ 2 s m 2 h h for the second layer k in eq 3 was replaced by the average hydraulic conductivity k according to ma et al 2010 at t 1 the height of capillary rise was d 1 therefore eq 9 can be expressed as 10 k t t 1 δ θ 2 h d 1 δ θ 2 s m 2 ln s m 2 h s m 2 d 1 d 1 h d 2 o r t 1 t t 2 where t 2 is the time s when the wetting front reaches the top surface of the second layer combining eq 7 and eq 10 the relationship between the capillary rise height and time for the soil samples with the lower waterproof layers can be expressed as 11 k 1 t δ θ 1 h δ θ 1 s m 1 ln 1 h s m 1 h d 1 o r t t 1 k t t 1 δ θ 2 h d 1 δ θ 2 s m 2 ln s m 2 h s m 2 d 1 d 1 h d 2 o r t 1 t t 2 in this study the relationship between the capillary rise height and time was monitored as long as sm was known the hydraulic conductivity as the only unknown could be obtained through fitting bouwer 1969 suggested that half of the air entry value can be considered as sm jiang et al 2017 reported that the air entry value fluctuates between 0 9 and 1 2 m with the increase in dry density from 1 43 to 1 66 g cm3 for the loess in lanzhou china and the effect of the dry density on the air entry value may be negligible in this work the air entry value was assumed to be 1 m and the sm value for loess was 0 5 m czachor 2006 reported that with an increase in time the capillary rise in a cylindrical capillary can be expressed as using poiseuille s equation 12 t h b a b 2 l n 1 b a h 13 a t s r c o s θ 4 η 14 b r 2 ρ g 8 η where ts is the water surface tension n m r is the radius of the capillary m η is the viscosity of water 1 01 pa s at 20 c siebold et al 1997 ρ is the water density 1000 kg m3 g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s2 and θ is the contact angle the expressions of eq 6 and eq 12 are equal and exhibit the following relationship 15 s m 2 t s c o s θ r ρ g 16 k δ θ r 2 8 ρ g η therefore the wetting front suction head is equal to the maximum height of capillary rise and the hydraulic conductivity is independent of the contact angle but is related to the pore size lu and likos 2004 reported that the hydraulic conductivity can be expressed as 17 k 4 c r 2 ρ g η where c is a dimensionless constant related to the geometry of the soil pores combining eq 16 and eq 17 the relationship between c and δθ can be expressed as 18 δ θ 32 c 3 results 3 1 capillary rise height samples treated at 100 c the relationship between the capillary rise height and time for the samples treated at 100 c for the na2so4 solution is shown in fig 2 a b u m and l represent the position of the waterproof layer in the upper middle and lower portions of the soil column respectively 0 5 and 1 0 represent the pva percentage contents prefix integers 1 2 and 3 represent the thickness of the middle waterproof layer in centimetres w o represents the soil sample without a waterproof layer the position and thickness of the measured waterproof layer are shown in coloured columns i e green red and blue which may be slightly difference from the experimental design the na2so4 solution reached the top surface of the sample within 3 h and the experiment was terminated because of the top surface wetting because the benchmark was labelled at the surrounding surface of the cylinder some data points could not be recorded as the solution unevenly passed through the waterproof layer through the inner path alone after the wetting front overcame the entire waterproof layer it gradually wetted the outer surface again fig s2 b the na2so4 solution presented a random distribution in the waterproof layer while a sharp wetting front which separated the soil column into wet and dry portions was observed for the soil without the pva i e non waterproof layer different waterproof layer positions affected the capillary rise of the na2so4 solution for the lower waterproof layer the initial capillary rise was rapid however with time the capillary rise became slower than those in the other samples for the middle and upper waterproof layers when the capillary rise reached the position of the waterproof layer the capillary rise velocity i e slope sometimes changed significantly the increase in the waterproof layer thickness had no effect on the capillary rise for the samples with the 0 5 pva treated soil but this delayed the capillary rise in the samples with the 1 0 pva treated soil to reach the top surface the pva content had a significant effect on the capillary rise the capillary rise velocity of the 1 0 pva waterproof layer changed more significantly than that of the 0 5 pva waterproof layer for the results of the distilled water shown in fig 3 a b the difference between the capillary rise velocities was insignificant for the samples with the 0 5 and 1 0 pva except for 3 0 5 and 3 1 0 which were different from the results shown in fig 2 a b for the na2so4 solution for the nacl solution fig s1 a b and mixed nacl na2so4 solution fig s2 a b except for the individual curves the changes in the capillary rise height with time were similar to those for the na2so4 solution a high pva content was a more critical factor when working in a salt solution than that in distilled water to increase the efficiency of inhibiting the capillary rise samples dried at 20 c the relationship between the capillary rise height and time for the samples dried at 20 c for the na2so4 solution is shown in fig 2 c d the sharp wetting front reached the top surface of the samples without the waterproof layers after 6060 s however for the samples with the hydrophobic waterproof layers the na2so4 solution did not reach the top surface of the samples within 3 h and the sample with the lower waterproof layer retained the upper portion dry even after 10 h as shown in fig 2 c the waterproof layer at the different positions could inhibit the capillary rise of the na2so4 solution and the effectiveness of the lower waterproof layer was the best the results for the samples with different waterproof layer thicknesses were similar indicating that the thickness of the waterproof layer was less significant for preventing the capillary rise of the na2so4 solution however the pva content had a significant effect on the capillary rise the na2so4 solution passed through the hydrophobic waterproof layer with the 0 5 pva content through the edge while the waterproof layer with the 1 0 pva content completely blocked the capillary rise of the na2so4 solution for different salt solutions the hindering effect of the hydrophobic waterproof layer on distilled water was significantly weaker than that on the na2so4 solution and distilled water passed through the lower waterproof layer through the edge as shown in fig 3 c for the nacl solution fig s1 c d and mixed nacl na2so4 solution fig s2 c d the changes in the capillary rise height with time were similar to that of the na2so4 solution for the capillary rise velocity the data pattern was not perfect owing to an uneven capillary rise and there were always individual curves that did not meet the general rules the water content and soluble salt content after the termination of the experiment were further analysed 3 2 final water content 3 2 1 final water absorption samples treated at 100 c the total water absorption in the samples treated at 100 c until the termination of the experiment is shown in fig 4 a b as the waterproof layer position moved from top to bottom the water absorption in the samples decreased however as the waterproof layer thickness increased the water absorption in the samples remained unchanged similarly the effects of the pva content and type of salt solution on water absorption were negligibly different for the soil samples treated at 100 c samples dried at 20 c the total water absorption in the samples dried at 20 c until the termination of the experiment is shown in fig 4 c d as the waterproof layer position moved from top to bottom the water absorption in the samples decreased significantly when the waterproof layer was located at the lower portion of the samples the water absorption in the samples approached 0 at 20 c l 0 5 and l 1 0 in fig 4 c which showed a significant effect in inhibiting the capillary rise of the water or salt solution as the waterproof layer thickness increased the water absorption decreased which is different from the results at 100 c the water absorption in the samples with the 0 5 pva content was higher than that in the samples with the 1 0 pva content and this difference was significant for the middle waterproof layer fig 4 d the influence of different salt solutions on the water absorption was negligible 3 2 2 final water content distribution samples treated at 100 c the final water content distributions of the samples treated at 100 c for the na2so4 solution are shown in fig 5 a b the theoretical saturated water content of the soil was 25 6 and the water contents of some positions of the soil samples significantly exceeded this value because of the damage to the soil structure caused by water and the upper load for the upper waterproof layer the entire soil column exhibited a high water content however for the middle and lower waterproof layers a high water content was observed from the bottom of the specimen to the top boundary of the waterproof layer and the water content of the soil above the waterproof layer was relatively low although the hydrophobicity of the waterproof layer was lost after the treatment at 100 c it played a role in reducing the water content of the soil above the waterproof layer however the reduction effect was insufficient and the water content of the soil above the waterproof layer was close to 20 the thickness of the waterproof layer pva content and type of salt solution fig s3 a b fig s4 a b and fig s5 a b exhibited no significant effect on the final water content distribution samples dried at 20 c the final water content distributions of the samples dried at 20 c for the na2so4 solution are shown in fig 5 c d the lower waterproof layer completely prevented the capillary rise of the na2so4 solution regardless of the pva content however the na2so4 solution passed through the waterproof layer in the middle and upper portions of the soil samples with the 0 5 pva content the increase in the waterproof layer thickness decreased the water content above the middle waterproof layer at the experiment termination as shown in fig 5 d which compensated for the insufficient hydrophobicity of the 0 5 pva treated soil to a certain extent the effectiveness of the 1 0 pva waterproof layer was significantly better than that of the 0 5 pva waterproof layer the results of the nacl solution mixed nacl na2so4 solution and distilled water were similar to those of the na2so4 solution as shown in fig s3 c d fig s5 c d and thus are not described in detail 3 3 final conductivity distribution there was a linear relationship between the salt content and conductivity as confirmed in the appendix therefore the conductivity accurately evaluated the soluble salt contents in this study samples treated at 100 c the final conductivity distributions of the samples treated at 100 c for the na2so4 solution are shown in fig 6 a b for the samples with the upper waterproof layer the soluble salt was relatively evenly distributed in the top 7 10 cm while the soluble salt was concentrated at 9 10 cm for the other samples the thickness of the waterproof layer and pva content had little effect on the conductivity distribution for the samples tested in distilled water as shown in fig s9 a b the conductivity of the lower portion of the samples was lower than that of the lower portion of the samples in the na2so4 solution as shown in fig 6 a b the results of the nacl solution and mixed nacl na2so4 solution were similar to those of the na2so4 solution as shown in fig s7 a b fig s8 a b samples dried at 20 c the final conductivity distributions of the samples dried at 20 c for the na2so4 solution as shown in fig 6 c d were different from those of the samples treated at 100 c and the soluble salt did not just accumulate in the upper portion for some samples the soluble salt in the samples with the upper 1 0 pva waterproof layer was mainly concentrated at a height of 5 8 cm which was immediately under the upper waterproof layer for the middle 1 0 pva waterproof layer soluble salt in the samples was mainly distributed in two locations under the waterproof layer and in the upper portion of the sample although the soluble salt in the samples with the lower waterproof layer also accumulated in the upper portion of the samples l 1 0 in fig 6 c the conductivity value was considerably lower than that of the samples treated at 100 c l 1 0 in fig 6 a this indicates that the high salt content in the upper portion of sample l 1 0 in fig 6 c might be caused by evaporation during curing i e drying processes after the samples with the untreated soil were prepared the high salt content under the waterproof layer indicates that the waterproof layer can prevent the soluble salt from migrating to the upper portion of the sample the thickness of the waterproof layer had little effect on the conductivity distribution and the effect of the pva content was more significant the effectiveness of the 1 0 pva waterproof layer was significantly better than that of the 0 5 pva waterproof layer for the 0 5 pva waterproof layer there was no accumulation of soluble salt under the middle waterproof layer which indicated that the soluble salt passed through the waterproof layer however the conductivity at the top of the samples shown in fig 6 d was significantly lower than that shown in fig 6 b indicating that the 0 5 pva waterproof layer dried at 20 c could reduce the capillary rise of the soluble salt to the upper portion of the samples but did not act as a barrier the results of the nacl solution mixed nacl na2so4 solution and distilled water were similar to those of the na2so4 solution as shown in fig s7 c d fig s9 c d and thus are not described in detail again 3 4 modified ga model owing to the serious deformation of the samples with the middle and upper waterproof layers fig 2 b only the soil samples without the waterproof layer w o 20 c and with the lower waterproof layer l 1 0 100 c as representatives shown in fig 3 distilled water were analysed using eqs 6 and 11 for the sample with the lower waterproof layer l 1 0 the preferential flow phenomenon i e not a sharp wetting front occurred in the waterproof layer and a sharp wetting front was observed in the soil above the waterproof layer fig s2 b therefore the second layer i e the soil above the waterproof layer was only analysed for sample l 1 0 by fitting the measured data in fig 3 the adj r2 values of samples w o and l 1 0 for distilled water were 0 96 and 1 00 indicating that the modified ga model accurately described the capillary rise of water in this study the hydraulic conductivity 6 01 10 7 m s of sample w o exceeded the average hydraulic conductivity 3 86 10 7 m s of sample l 1 0 even when the pva treated soil lost its hydrophobicity it could decrease the hydraulic conductivity of the soil using eq 16 the pore radii of the w o and l 1 0 samples were calculated the pore radius 3 476 μm of sample w o exceeded that 3 059 μm of sample l 1 0 thus the addition of pva can decrease the pore radius of the soil 4 discussion 4 1 factor impact analysis ambient temperature waterproof layer position and pva content had significant effects on the capillary action the type of salt solution only affected the height of the capillary rise fig 2 and fig 3 the change in the waterproof layer thickness exhibited a less significant effect on the capillary action samples treated at 100 c the preferential flow phenomenon occurred at the location of the waterproof layer fig 1 indicating that although an ambient temperature of 100 c eliminated the hydrophobicity of the pva treated soil the contact angles of the soil at different positions of the waterproof layer were not the same doerr et al 2000 water or salt solution preferentially passes through locations with small pore sizes and contact angles lu and likos 2004 the results of the modified ga model revealed a decrease in the pore radius with the addition of pva therefore the initial rise velocity in the samples with the lower waterproof layer was higher in fig 2 a however with time the capillary rise in the samples with the lower waterproof layer became slower than those in the other samples as shown in fig 2 a the decrease in the pore size resulted in a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity which may be a significant reason for the slower capillary rise velocity for the samples with the lower waterproof layer the water content suddenly decreased near the top of the waterproof layer and the experimental phenomenon in the samples with the middle waterproof layer was the most significant as shown in fig 5 b it was effortless for liquid water to pass through the lower surface of the waterproof layer indicating that usually μl μw i e cosθl rl cosθw rw rl rw as verified by the modified ga model fig s10 a however μl μw might have hindered the capillary rise of water through the upper surface of the waterproof layer fig s10 b which caused the soil above the waterproof layer to have a relatively low water content soil samples with the 0 5 and 1 0 pva contents exhibited similar results for the distilled water as shown in fig 3 a but the results were different for the na2so4 solution fig 2 a soil wettability depends on water and soil particle surfaces originating from mutual attractive forces adhesion and the attraction between water molecules cohesion doerr et al 2000 when the adhesion between the water and soil particles exceeds the cohesion between the water molecules the soil is hydrophilic in the contrast the soil is hydrophobic when the opposite occurs the soluble salt increased the surface tension of water ozdemir et al 2009 granneman et al 2017 and the surface tension was proportional to the cohesive strength therefore the cohesion between the water molecules increased with the addition of the soluble salt which promoted an increase in the contact angle graber et al 2009 reported a similar phenomenon where the salt solution increased the drop penetration time when the nacl solution concentrate exceeded 0 1 mol l in this work 1 nacl solution was equivalent to 0 17 mol l therefore the salt solutions likely amplified the difference between the contact angles of 0 5 and 1 0 pva treated soils resulting in a significant difference between the capillary rise velocities for the samples tested in distilled water as shown in fig s9 a b the conductivity of the upper portion of the samples was high at the end of the experiment the soil columns were prepared using the desalinated soil waterproof layer and untreated soil non waterproof layer the untreated soil contained some soluble salts table 1 and these soluble salts could migrate to the top of the sample with the capillary rise of the distilled water therefore a high conductivity was observed in the upper portion of the samples even though distilled water was tested samples dried at 20 c for the 0 5 pva content the water content of the soil above the middle waterproof layer increased significantly 1 0 5 2 0 5 and 3 0 5 as shown in fig 5 d while the soil above the lower waterproof layer was dry l 0 5 in fig 5 c the salt solution could pass through the middle waterproof layer fig 2 d but could not easily pass through the lower waterproof layer fig 2 c zhang et al 2020 reported that the pva treated soil can keep the skeleton intact even if immersed in water because of the excellent water resistance whereas the soil without pva loses its strength when the soil is saturated in the lower waterproof layer the capillary action direction of the hydrophobic waterproof layer was the same as that of gravity fig s11 a which was not conducive to the capillary rise therefore it was difficult for the salt solution to pass through the lower waterproof layer however for the middle waterproof layer the soil without pva under the waterproof layer lost its strength due to water absorption and was squeezed by the upper load fig 2 d which caused an upward pore water pressure at the interface the salt solution could pass through the middle waterproof layer as the upward pore water pressure μ0 exceeded the downward capillary action 2ts cosθ r fig s11 b because the liquid water was in a critical position gravity g was negligible for the 1 0 pva content regardless of the thickness and position of the waterproof layer the salt solution could not pass through the waterproof layer indicating that the upward pore water pressure μ0 was always lower than the downward capillary action 2ts cosθ r 4 2 method comparison many methods have been proposed to prevent water salt migration the common theoretical basis is to change the pore size to inhibit the water salt capillary rise such as the clay with a dense structure malusis et al 2003 michette et al 2017 salehi hafshejani et al 2019 polymeric and metallic impermeable sheets a thin layer of plain or lightly reinforced concrete franzoni 2018 and a coarse grained soil layer park and fleming 2006 however these methods have serious limitations for example the dense structure may hinder the migration of water vapour which may cause structural damage to buildings with changes in temperature and relative humidity orlik kożdoń and steidl 2018 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2020 wang et al 2020b polyethylene sheets may cause stability issues when the wall is being loaded laterally assi et al 2021 a thin layer of plain or lightly reinforced concrete may crack and fracture as this layer dose not flex or move with the structure over years owing to its rigidity assi et al 2021 the above methods are frequently used only when the building is being constructed the other idea is to change the soil contact angle and use the hydrophobic properties of the soil to inhibit the water salt capillary rise the advantage of this method is that it does not significantly change the pore size and can be used to repair buildings this study confirms that a 1 0 pva waterproof layer at 20 c can effectively prevent water salt capillary rise from the perspective of capillary rise height water content and conductivity depending mainly on the soil hydrophobicity zhang et al 2021 reported that a 1 0 pva treated soil can maintain extreme water repellency at 20 40 c and thus this temperature range may be the most suitable for the application of this material most importantly as mentioned in the introduction pva adopts water as a solvent and does not pollute the environment it can be also used in a larger area than those for alkyl and alkoxy siloxanes with volatile organics as a solvent lopez arce et al 2009 young 2008 4 3 applicability analysis and study limitations the pva waterproof layer has a wide range of applications in the field when a wall is being built it can be laid under the wall using the mixing method i e mixing the soil and pva solution evenly for wall repairs the pva solution can be injected into the wall to form a waterproof layer chen et al 2019 reported that the viscosity of the 1 0 pva solution i e the ratio of solid pva mass to total mass is 1 0 is 3 18 10 3 pa s at 25 c and this solution can be diluted with water such that the viscosity of the solution can be further decreased to approach that of distilled water this low viscosity is the basis for its injectability the viscosity of distilled water is 0 89 10 3 pa s at 25 c owing to its cheap and environment friendly properties this waterproof layer is particularly suitable for the protection of earthen sites in northwest china the injection method may be appropriate when the earthen sites are repaired according to the results of this study a 1 0 pva content in the soil should be adopted at 20 40 c and a waterproof layer thickness of 1 cm is sufficient the position of the waterproof layer should be set according to the actual situation and the type of salt solution does not need to be considered this work mainly discusses a one dimensional model based on soil columns the water salt capillary rise was mainly upward and water salt migrations in other directions did not exist further research needs to be conducted on the three dimensional model furthermore the longest test time in this study was only 10 h and a longer time needs to be considered in the future 5 conclusion the following conclusions were drawn from this study based on the results of capillary rise height final water content and final conductivity the pva waterproof layer was proved to be effective in preventing the water salt capillary rise through a soil column experiment multiple variables were set in the soil column experiment to evaluate the waterproof effect of pva treated soils when the samples were treated at 100 c the results of the capillary rise height water content and conductivity indicated the ineffectiveness of the waterproof layer regardless of waterproof layer thickness waterproof layer position pva content and type of salt solution for the samples dried at 20 c the lower waterproof layer with a 0 5 pva content prevented the water salt capillary rise while the middle and upper waterproof layers exhibited less effectiveness the effect of the waterproof layer with a 1 0 pva content was significant regardless of the thickness and position and a 1 cm thick waterproof layer was sufficient to prevent the water salt capillary rise the thickness of the waterproof layer and type of soluble salt were less important than the position of the waterproof layer pva content and ambient temperature the contact angle rather than the pore size played a leading role in preventing the capillary rise by contrasting the ambient temperature due to adj r2 value 1 00 the modified ga model based on the fact that the gravity head and soil suction head were in opposite directions could accurately describe the capillary rise the addition of pva decreased the pore size and hydraulic conductivity of the samples which were calculated by the modified ga model for the samples treated at 100 c water content of the soil above the waterproof layer decreased owing to the pore size and contact angle differences at the interface for the samples dried at 20 c salt solution could pass through the middle waterproof layer with 0 5 pva content due to the upward pore water pressure exceeding the downward capillary action at the interface above parameters i e pore size and hydraulic conductivity and interface effect could reasonably

3253,in the loess region of northwest china the accumulation of soluble salt in the soil due to the capillary rise of water often damages earthen buildings thus studies on the cutting off of the capillary rise path are vital as a hydrophobicity inducer polyvinyl alcohol pva solution with water as the solvent has the potential to function as a barrier this study mainly aims to evaluate the feasibility of using pva treated soil as a waterproof layer to prevent water salt capillary rise through soil column experiments and the effects of the waterproof layer thickness waterproof layer position pva content ambient temperature and type of salt solution on the capillary action the results indicate that a 1 0 pva treated soil with extreme water repellency i e dried at 20 c can perfectly prevent the water salt from migrating to the top of the sample regardless of the waterproof layer position waterproof layer thickness and type of soluble salt for a 0 5 pva treated soil dried at 20 c the lower waterproof layer prevents the water salt capillary rise while the middle and upper layers exhibit less effectiveness however the pva treated soil that loses its hydrophobicity after a treatment at 100 c cannot prevent the water salt capillary rise confirming that the prevention of capillary rise is due to the soil hydrophobicity the waterproof layer thickness and type of soluble salt are less significant than the waterproof layer position pva content and ambient temperature this study proposes a modified green ampt model to describe the capillary rise and the hydraulic conductivity and pore size are obtained using the modified model these parameters and the interface effect are used to explain the experimental results finally the application of pva treated soil as a waterproof layer to inhibit water salt capillary rise is illustrated keywords waterproof layer hydrophobicity capillary action soil column polyvinyl alcohol 1 introduction loess soil as a foundation or restoration material is widely used in northwest china wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 however the soil structure may suffer serious damage owing to the long term actions of water and salts basal erosion which is caused by salt accumulation at the bottom of the earthen wall due to the capillary rise of water is the most typical example fujii et al 2009 shen et al 2020 talebmorad et al 2021 therefore studies on the cutting off of the capillary rise path are vital previous studies have presented a hydrophobic damp proof course achieved by injecting alkyl and alkoxy siloxanes with volatile organics as a solvent to prevent capillary induced intrusion of pore water into the masonry wall lopez arce et al 2009 ostad ali askar et al 2017 young 2008 however volatile organics may cause environmental pollution and water as a solvent is preferred young 2008 polyvinyl alcohol pva solution which is used in eye drops and cosmetic compositions can induce soil hydrophobicity chakraborty et al 2019 luaces rodríguez et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 it uses water as a solvent and is non toxic harmless and environment friendly therefore the pva solution as an additive has the potential to obtain a waterproof layer and this study evaluates the effectiveness of the pva waterproof layer through a soil column experiment zhang et al 2021 discussed the factors i e pva content temperature water content surface roughness particle size and particle shape influencing the hydrophobicity of the pva treated soil in detail the results indicated that the hydrophobicity of the 1 0 pva treated soil was stronger than that of the 0 5 pva treated soil when the soil samples were dried at 20 c however as the ambient temperature increased to 80 100 c the pva treated soil became hydrophilic thus both pva content and temperature are important factors for controlling the hydrophobicity of the treated soil zhang et al 2020 reported that when the pva treated soil was repeatedly immersed in water the surface hydrophobicity was lost but the interior of the samples was hydrophobic thus the thickness and position of the pva treated soil layer in the soil columns may change the water blocking effect graber et al 2009 found that the type of the salt solution affected the drop penetration time the soil hydrophobicity increased with an increase in the drop penetration time on the soil surface indicating that the capillary rise for different types of salt solutions in the pva treated soil may differ therefore in the present study a soil column experiment was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of pva treated soil as a waterproof layer in preventing water salt capillary rise and the effects of the above mentioned factors on the capillary action several hydrological models have been proposed ostad ali askari and shayan 2021 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021a ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021b the green ampt ga model is widely used for vertical and horizontal infiltrations ali et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 however this model has rarely been reported for the capillary rise of water in soil and our study attempted to apply it to the capillary action for the vertical infiltration the water head caused by gravity and soil suction in the same direction were considered as the driving forces without ponding depth whereas the gravity head and soil suction head were in opposite directions for the capillary rise of water based on this fact the present study modified the traditional ga model and extended the model to the capillary rise in layered soils according to mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 and ma et al 2010 the capillary action in representative samples was described using this modified model and the hydraulic conductivity and pore size of the soil samples were obtained using the modified ga model owing to the difference between soil properties the interface of two soils may change the water infiltration such as in a capillary barrier i e a relatively fine soil layer overlies a relatively coarse soil layer lu and likos 2004 previous studies have focused mainly on the interface effect due to the pore size difference in the soil in contrast our study adopted the contact angle and pore size to interpret the experimental results to address this research gap this study aimed to i examine the feasibility of using pva treated soil as a waterproof layer in preventing water salt capillary rise through a soil column experiment ii evaluate the effects of waterproof layer thickness waterproof layer position pva content ambient temperature and type of salt solution on the capillary action and iii propose a modified ga model to describe the capillary rise of water in layered soil and explain the experimental results using the modified ga model and interface effect 2 materials and methods 2 1 material characterisation 2 1 1 soil properties experimental soil loess was obtained from lanzhou

composed of a macromolecular main chain with hydrophobic c c bonds and hydrophilic hydroxyl groups solid pva cannot be dissolved in water at room temperature because of the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups xue et al 2015 however it can be dissolved by adjusting the temperature stirring time and solvent solute ratio after this treatment the obtained pva solution is also called an sh solution and its properties have been reported by zhang et al 2021 2 1 3 sodium sulphate and sodium chloride sodium chloride nacl and sodium sulphate na2so4 are the most common soluble salts in northwest china shen et al 2020 thus nacl and na2so4 were the focus in this study they were procured from xilong chemical reagent co ltd and the purity of each was higher than 99 three types of salt solution each having a salt content of 1 wt were used in this study nacl na2so4 and mixed salt i e 0 5 each of nacl and na2so4 solutions ozdemir et al 2009 reported that at 23 c the surface tension of deionised water is 72 72 mn m which is slightly lower than that of 1 nacl solution 72 93 mn m granneman et al 2017 found that the surface tension of pure water at 25 c is 71 50 mn m which is slightly lower than that of 1 na2so4 solution 71 70 mn m the addition of 1 nacl or na2so4 slightly increases the surface tension of water and the effects of these two salts on the surface tension were similar in this study 2 2 experimental design a factorial experiment was conducted to test the effects of the waterproof layer thickness waterproof layer position pva content ambient temperature and type of salt solution on the capillary action the detailed experimental design is presented in table 2 the waterproof layer thickness was considered to be 1 2 and 3 cm the waterproof layer was positioned at the upper middle and lower portions of a 10 cm soil column ambient temperatures were 20 and 100 c the salt solution included distilled water nacl solution na2so4 solution and mixed nacl na2so4 solution furthermore four soil columns without any waterproof layer were designed as a control when the waterproof layer position was considered as a variable its thickness was 2 cm and when the waterproof layer thickness was considered as a variable it was positioned at the middle therefore there were only five cases considering the position and thickness of the waterproof layer as presented in table 2 2 3 specimen preparation the pva treated soil acted as a hydrophobic waterproof layer to eliminate the effect of soluble salts on the soil hydrophobicity the waterproof layer soil was pretreated for desalination dry soil powder was mixed with distilled water in a container to obtained a designed mass ratio of 1 5 and then stirred for 30 min the supernatant was removed from the container after the soil particles settled the desalinization processes were repeated until the measured electrical conductivity of the supernatant was 300 μs cm which indicated that the soluble salt had been removed sufficiently cui et al 2012 the experimental soil including the desalinated and untreated soil was dried in an oven at 105 c and passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove gravel particles the untreated soil was stirred uniformly with distilled water non waterproof layer soil while the desalinated soil was mixed uniformly with the pva solution and distilled water according to the designed ratio waterproof layer soil the designed gravimetric water content was controlled at 16 and the designed pva contents were 0 5 and 1 0 zhang et al 2021 soil columns were prepared through layer by layer compaction according to the position and thickness of the waterproof layer for example a soil column with a middle waterproof layer was divided into three layers of compaction the first layer was the soil below the waterproof layer the second layer was the waterproof layer the third layer was the soil above the waterproof layer a total of 84 soil columns with 50 mm diameter and 100 mm height table 2 were prepared and dried at room temperature approximately 20 c for 28 d subsequently 40 out of 84 specimens were cured at 100 c for 1 d to eliminate the hydrophobicity zhang et al 2021 and cooled to room temperature to be consistent with the remaining after the mass and temperature of all samples were stable at room temperature a water salt capillary rise experiment was conducted as shown in fig 1 a cylindrical samples were placed on a porous stone placed in water or salt solution the water level was controlled to partially submerge the porous stone leaving a gap at the bottom of the soil column a scale marked with an interval of 1 cm was vertically placed along each specimen as a benchmark for the ease of recording the time for the wetting front to rise by 1 cm when the wetting front was not uniform preferential flow the time of reaching the benchmark first was recorded fig 1 b owing to the large difference between the capillary actions in these samples the termination conditions of the experiment were mainly divided into three cases sample collapse top surface wetting and after 3 h or 10 h a few samples exhibited nearly no change after 3 h and thus the experiment was extended to 10 h to confirm the superiority of the hydrophobic waterproof layer the sample mass was weighed before and after the experiment and the water absorption until the experiment termination was calculated according to eq 1 1 p m 2 m 1 m 1 100 where p is the water absorption until the experiment termination m 1 is the sample mass g before the experiment and m 2 is the sample mass g after the experiment finally 84 soil samples were sliced at the calibrated height to measure the water content and conductivity gb t 50123 2019 ostad ali askari 2018 and the measurements were performed at 924 locations furthermore in the four control samples without waterproof layers the main ion contents were measured every 2 cm using ion chromatography to demonstrate the relationship between the conductivity and content of the soluble salt 2 4 modified ga model a modified ga model was proposed to describe the capillary rise of water in the layered soil the hydraulic conductivity and pore size obtained using this modified model were used to explain the experimental results for the vertical infiltration the traditional ga model which is considered as a one dimensional model with a sharp wetting front can be expressed as green and ampt 1911 2 i di dt k s m z h z where i is the infiltration rate m s i is the cumulative infiltration m z is the infiltration depth m t is the infiltration time s h is the ponding depth m sm is the wetting front suction head m and k is the hydraulic conductivity m s for the capillary rise of water the gravity head and soil suction head were in opposite directions and the ponding depth was 0 m therefore the modified ga model can be expressed as 3 i di dt k s m h h where h is the height of capillary rise m based on an assumed sharp wetting front the relationship between the cumulative infiltration and height of capillary rise can be expressed as 4 i δ θ h θ f θ i h where δθ is the change in the volumetric water content m3 m3 θf is the volumetric water content at the end of the experiment m3 m3 obtained from the measured mass water content and θi is the initial volumetric water content approximately equal to 0 m3 m3 in this study substituting eq 4 into eq 3 yields the following expression 5 dh dt k δ θ s m h h at 0 s the height of capillary rise was 0 m therefore eq 5 can be expressed as 6 kt δ θ h δ θ s m l n 1 h s m eq 6 can be used to describe the capillary rise of water in the non layered soil i e the soil samples without waterproof layers for the soil samples with a lower waterproof layer the soil columns had two layers the lower layer i e the first layer can be described using eq 6 7 k 1 t δ θ 1 h δ θ 1 s m 1 ln 1 h s m 1 h d 1 o r t t 1 where d 1 is the thickness m of the first layer measured using a ruler and t 1 is the time s when the wetting front reaches the top surface of the first layer monitored using a timer subscript 1 represents the first layer to be able to distinguish it from the second layer subscript 2 for the second layer the relationship between the cumulative infiltration and height of capillary rise can be expressed as 8 i δ θ 1 d 1 δ θ 2 h d 1 substituting eq 8 into eq 3 yields the following expression 9 dh dt k δ θ 2 s m 2 h h for the second layer k in eq 3 was replaced by the average hydraulic conductivity k according to ma et al 2010 at t 1 the height of capillary rise was d 1 therefore eq 9 can be expressed as 10 k t t 1 δ θ 2 h d 1 δ θ 2 s m 2 ln s m 2 h s m 2 d 1 d 1 h d 2 o r t 1 t t 2 where t 2 is the time s when the wetting front reaches the top surface of the second layer combining eq 7 and eq 10 the relationship between the capillary rise height and time for the soil samples with the lower waterproof layers can be expressed as 11 k 1 t δ θ 1 h δ θ 1 s m 1 ln 1 h s m 1 h d 1 o r t t 1 k t t 1 δ θ 2 h d 1 δ θ 2 s m 2 ln s m 2 h s m 2 d 1 d 1 h d 2 o r t 1 t t 2 in this study the relationship between the capillary rise height and time was monitored as long as sm was known the hydraulic conductivity as the only unknown could be obtained through fitting bouwer 1969 suggested that half of the air entry value can be considered as sm jiang et al 2017 reported that the air entry value fluctuates between 0 9 and 1 2 m with the increase in dry density from 1 43 to 1 66 g cm3 for the loess in lanzhou china and the effect of the dry density on the air entry value may be negligible in this work the air entry value was assumed to be 1 m and the sm value for loess was 0 5 m czachor 2006 reported that with an increase in time the capillary rise in a cylindrical capillary can be expressed as using poiseuille s equation 12 t h b a b 2 l n 1 b a h 13 a t s r c o s θ 4 η 14 b r 2 ρ g 8 η where ts is the water surface tension n m r is the radius of the capillary m η is the viscosity of water 1 01 pa s at 20 c siebold et al 1997 ρ is the water density 1000 kg m3 g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s2 and θ is the contact angle the expressions of eq 6 and eq 12 are equal and exhibit the following relationship 15 s m 2 t s c o s θ r ρ g 16 k δ θ r 2 8 ρ g η therefore the wetting front suction head is equal to the maximum height of capillary rise and the hydraulic conductivity is independent of the contact angle but is related to the pore size lu and likos 2004 reported that the hydraulic conductivity can be expressed as 17 k 4 c r 2 ρ g η where c is a dimensionless constant related to the geometry of the soil pores combining eq 16 and eq 17 the relationship between c and δθ can be expressed as 18 δ θ 32 c 3 results 3 1 capillary rise height samples treated at 100 c the relationship between the capillary rise height and time for the samples treated at 100 c for the na2so4 solution is shown in fig 2 a b u m and l represent the position of the waterproof layer in the upper middle and lower portions of the soil column respectively 0 5 and 1 0 represent the pva percentage contents prefix integers 1 2 and 3 represent the thickness of the middle waterproof layer in centimetres w o represents the soil sample without a waterproof layer the position and thickness of the measured waterproof layer are shown in coloured columns i e green red and blue which may be slightly difference from the experimental design the na2so4 solution reached the top surface of the sample within 3 h and the experiment was terminated because of the top surface wetting because the benchmark was labelled at the surrounding surface of the cylinder some data points could not be recorded as the solution unevenly passed through the waterproof layer through the inner path alone after the wetting front overcame the entire waterproof layer it gradually wetted the outer surface again fig s2 b the na2so4 solution presented a random distribution in the waterproof layer while a sharp wetting front which separated the soil column into wet and dry portions was observed for the soil without the pva i e non waterproof layer different waterproof layer positions affected the capillary rise of the na2so4 solution for the lower waterproof layer the initial capillary rise was rapid however with time the capillary rise became slower than those in the other samples for the middle and upper waterproof layers when the capillary rise reached the position of the waterproof layer the capillary rise velocity i e slope sometimes changed significantly the increase in the waterproof layer thickness had no effect on the capillary rise for the samples with the 0 5 pva treated soil but this delayed the capillary rise in the samples with the 1 0 pva treated soil to reach the top surface the pva content had a significant effect on the capillary rise the capillary rise velocity of the 1 0 pva waterproof layer changed more significantly than that of the 0 5 pva waterproof layer for the results of the distilled water shown in fig 3 a b the difference between the capillary rise velocities was insignificant for the samples with the 0 5 and 1 0 pva except for 3 0 5 and 3 1 0 which were different from the results shown in fig 2 a b for the na2so4 solution for the nacl solution fig s1 a b and mixed nacl na2so4 solution fig s2 a b except for the individual curves the changes in the capillary rise height with time were similar to those for the na2so4 solution a high pva content was a more critical factor when working in a salt solution than that in distilled water to increase the efficiency of inhibiting the capillary rise samples dried at 20 c the relationship between the capillary rise height and time for the samples dried at 20 c for the na2so4 solution is shown in fig 2 c d the sharp wetting front reached the top surface of the samples without the waterproof layers after 6060 s however for the samples with the hydrophobic waterproof layers the na2so4 solution did not reach the top surface of the samples within 3 h and the sample with the lower waterproof layer retained the upper portion dry even after 10 h as shown in fig 2 c the waterproof layer at the different positions could inhibit the capillary rise of the na2so4 solution and the effectiveness of the lower waterproof layer was the best the results for the samples with different waterproof layer thicknesses were similar indicating that the thickness of the waterproof layer was less significant for preventing the capillary rise of the na2so4 solution however the pva content had a significant effect on the capillary rise the na2so4 solution passed through the hydrophobic waterproof layer with the 0 5 pva content through the edge while the waterproof layer with the 1 0 pva content completely blocked the capillary rise of the na2so4 solution for different salt solutions the hindering effect of the hydrophobic waterproof layer on distilled water was significantly weaker than that on the na2so4 solution and distilled water passed through the lower waterproof layer through the edge as shown in fig 3 c for the nacl solution fig s1 c d and mixed nacl na2so4 solution fig s2 c d the changes in the capillary rise height with time were similar to that of the na2so4 solution for the capillary rise velocity the data pattern was not perfect owing to an uneven capillary rise and there were always individual curves that did not meet the general rules the water content and soluble salt content after the termination of the experiment were further analysed 3 2 final water content 3 2 1 final water absorption samples treated at 100 c the total water absorption in the samples treated at 100 c until the termination of the experiment is shown in fig 4 a b as the waterproof layer position moved from top to bottom the water absorption in the samples decreased however as the waterproof layer thickness increased the water absorption in the samples remained unchanged similarly the effects of the pva content and type of salt solution on water absorption were negligibly different for the soil samples treated at 100 c samples dried at 20 c the total water absorption in the samples dried at 20 c until the termination of the experiment is shown in fig 4 c d as the waterproof layer position moved from top to bottom the water absorption in the samples decreased significantly when the waterproof layer was located at the lower portion of the samples the water absorption in the samples approached 0 at 20 c l 0 5 and l 1 0 in fig 4 c which showed a significant effect in inhibiting the capillary rise of the water or salt solution as the waterproof layer thickness increased the water absorption decreased which is different from the results at 100 c the water absorption in the samples with the 0 5 pva content was higher than that in the samples with the 1 0 pva content and this difference was significant for the middle waterproof layer fig 4 d the influence of different salt solutions on the water absorption was negligible 3 2 2 final water content distribution samples treated at 100 c the final water content distributions of the samples treated at 100 c for the na2so4 solution are shown in fig 5 a b the theoretical saturated water content of the soil was 25 6 and the water contents of some positions of the soil samples significantly exceeded this value because of the damage to the soil structure caused by water and the upper load for the upper waterproof layer the entire soil column exhibited a high water content however for the middle and lower waterproof layers a high water content was observed from the bottom of the specimen to the top boundary of the waterproof layer and the water content of the soil above the waterproof layer was relatively low although the hydrophobicity of the waterproof layer was lost after the treatment at 100 c it played a role in reducing the water content of the soil above the waterproof layer however the reduction effect was insufficient and the water content of the soil above the waterproof layer was close to 20 the thickness of the waterproof layer pva content and type of salt solution fig s3 a b fig s4 a b and fig s5 a b exhibited no significant effect on the final water content distribution samples dried at 20 c the final water content distributions of the samples dried at 20 c for the na2so4 solution are shown in fig 5 c d the lower waterproof layer completely prevented the capillary rise of the na2so4 solution regardless of the pva content however the na2so4 solution passed through the waterproof layer in the middle and upper portions of the soil samples with the 0 5 pva content the increase in the waterproof layer thickness decreased the water content above the middle waterproof layer at the experiment termination as shown in fig 5 d which compensated for the insufficient hydrophobicity of the 0 5 pva treated soil to a certain extent the effectiveness of the 1 0 pva waterproof layer was significantly better than that of the 0 5 pva waterproof layer the results of the nacl solution mixed nacl na2so4 solution and distilled water were similar to those of the na2so4 solution as shown in fig s3 c d fig s5 c d and thus are not described in detail 3 3 final conductivity distribution there was a linear relationship between the salt content and conductivity as confirmed in the appendix therefore the conductivity accurately evaluated the soluble salt contents in this study samples treated at 100 c the final conductivity distributions of the samples treated at 100 c for the na2so4 solution are shown in fig 6 a b for the samples with the upper waterproof layer the soluble salt was relatively evenly distributed in the top 7 10 cm while the soluble salt was concentrated at 9 10 cm for the other samples the thickness of the waterproof layer and pva content had little effect on the conductivity distribution for the samples tested in distilled water as shown in fig s9 a b the conductivity of the lower portion of the samples was lower than that of the lower portion of the samples in the na2so4 solution as shown in fig 6 a b the results of the nacl solution and mixed nacl na2so4 solution were similar to those of the na2so4 solution as shown in fig s7 a b fig s8 a b samples dried at 20 c the final conductivity distributions of the samples dried at 20 c for the na2so4 solution as shown in fig 6 c d were different from those of the samples treated at 100 c and the soluble salt did not just accumulate in the upper portion for some samples the soluble salt in the samples with the upper 1 0 pva waterproof layer was mainly concentrated at a height of 5 8 cm which was immediately under the upper waterproof layer for the middle 1 0 pva waterproof layer soluble salt in the samples was mainly distributed in two locations under the waterproof layer and in the upper portion of the sample although the soluble salt in the samples with the lower waterproof layer also accumulated in the upper portion of the samples l 1 0 in fig 6 c the conductivity value was considerably lower than that of the samples treated at 100 c l 1 0 in fig 6 a this indicates that the high salt content in the upper portion of sample l 1 0 in fig 6 c might be caused by evaporation during curing i e drying processes after the samples with the untreated soil were prepared the high salt content under the waterproof layer indicates that the waterproof layer can prevent the soluble salt from migrating to the upper portion of the sample the thickness of the waterproof layer had little effect on the conductivity distribution and the effect of the pva content was more significant the effectiveness of the 1 0 pva waterproof layer was significantly better than that of the 0 5 pva waterproof layer for the 0 5 pva waterproof layer there was no accumulation of soluble salt under the middle waterproof layer which indicated that the soluble salt passed through the waterproof layer however the conductivity at the top of the samples shown in fig 6 d was significantly lower than that shown in fig 6 b indicating that the 0 5 pva waterproof layer dried at 20 c could reduce the capillary rise of the soluble salt to the upper portion of the samples but did not act as a barrier the results of the nacl solution mixed nacl na2so4 solution and distilled water were similar to those of the na2so4 solution as shown in fig s7 c d fig s9 c d and thus are not described in detail again 3 4 modified ga model owing to the serious deformation of the samples with the middle and upper waterproof layers fig 2 b only the soil samples without the waterproof layer w o 20 c and with the lower waterproof layer l 1 0 100 c as representatives shown in fig 3 distilled water were analysed using eqs 6 and 11 for the sample with the lower waterproof layer l 1 0 the preferential flow phenomenon i e not a sharp wetting front occurred in the waterproof layer and a sharp wetting front was observed in the soil above the waterproof layer fig s2 b therefore the second layer i e the soil above the waterproof layer was only analysed for sample l 1 0 by fitting the measured data in fig 3 the adj r2 values of samples w o and l 1 0 for distilled water were 0 96 and 1 00 indicating that the modified ga model accurately described the capillary rise of water in this study the hydraulic conductivity 6 01 10 7 m s of sample w o exceeded the average hydraulic conductivity 3 86 10 7 m s of sample l 1 0 even when the pva treated soil lost its hydrophobicity it could decrease the hydraulic conductivity of the soil using eq 16 the pore radii of the w o and l 1 0 samples were calculated the pore radius 3 476 μm of sample w o exceeded that 3 059 μm of sample l 1 0 thus the addition of pva can decrease the pore radius of the soil 4 discussion 4 1 factor impact analysis ambient temperature waterproof layer position and pva content had significant effects on the capillary action the type of salt solution only affected the height of the capillary rise fig 2 and fig 3 the change in the waterproof layer thickness exhibited a less significant effect on the capillary action samples treated at 100 c the preferential flow phenomenon occurred at the location of the waterproof layer fig 1 indicating that although an ambient temperature of 100 c eliminated the hydrophobicity of the pva treated soil the contact angles of the soil at different positions of the waterproof layer were not the same doerr et al 2000 water or salt solution preferentially passes through locations with small pore sizes and contact angles lu and likos 2004 the results of the modified ga model revealed a decrease in the pore radius with the addition of pva therefore the initial rise velocity in the samples with the lower waterproof layer was higher in fig 2 a however with time the capillary rise in the samples with the lower waterproof layer became slower than those in the other samples as shown in fig 2 a the decrease in the pore size resulted in a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity which may be a significant reason for the slower capillary rise velocity for the samples with the lower waterproof layer the water content suddenly decreased near the top of the waterproof layer and the experimental phenomenon in the samples with the middle waterproof layer was the most significant as shown in fig 5 b it was effortless for liquid water to pass through the lower surface of the waterproof layer indicating that usually μl μw i e cosθl rl cosθw rw rl rw as verified by the modified ga model fig s10 a however μl μw might have hindered the capillary rise of water through the upper surface of the waterproof layer fig s10 b which caused the soil above the waterproof layer to have a relatively low water content soil samples with the 0 5 and 1 0 pva contents exhibited similar results for the distilled water as shown in fig 3 a but the results were different for the na2so4 solution fig 2 a soil wettability depends on water and soil particle surfaces originating from mutual attractive forces adhesion and the attraction between water molecules cohesion doerr et al 2000 when the adhesion between the water and soil particles exceeds the cohesion between the water molecules the soil is hydrophilic in the contrast the soil is hydrophobic when the opposite occurs the soluble salt increased the surface tension of water ozdemir et al 2009 granneman et al 2017 and the surface tension was proportional to the cohesive strength therefore the cohesion between the water molecules increased with the addition of the soluble salt which promoted an increase in the contact angle graber et al 2009 reported a similar phenomenon where the salt solution increased the drop penetration time when the nacl solution concentrate exceeded 0 1 mol l in this work 1 nacl solution was equivalent to 0 17 mol l therefore the salt solutions likely amplified the difference between the contact angles of 0 5 and 1 0 pva treated soils resulting in a significant difference between the capillary rise velocities for the samples tested in distilled water as shown in fig s9 a b the conductivity of the upper portion of the samples was high at the end of the experiment the soil columns were prepared using the desalinated soil waterproof layer and untreated soil non waterproof layer the untreated soil contained some soluble salts table 1 and these soluble salts could migrate to the top of the sample with the capillary rise of the distilled water therefore a high conductivity was observed in the upper portion of the samples even though distilled water was tested samples dried at 20 c for the 0 5 pva content the water content of the soil above the middle waterproof layer increased significantly 1 0 5 2 0 5 and 3 0 5 as shown in fig 5 d while the soil above the lower waterproof layer was dry l 0 5 in fig 5 c the salt solution could pass through the middle waterproof layer fig 2 d but could not easily pass through the lower waterproof layer fig 2 c zhang et al 2020 reported that the pva treated soil can keep the skeleton intact even if immersed in water because of the excellent water resistance whereas the soil without pva loses its strength when the soil is saturated in the lower waterproof layer the capillary action direction of the hydrophobic waterproof layer was the same as that of gravity fig s11 a which was not conducive to the capillary rise therefore it was difficult for the salt solution to pass through the lower waterproof layer however for the middle waterproof layer the soil without pva under the waterproof layer lost its strength due to water absorption and was squeezed by the upper load fig 2 d which caused an upward pore water pressure at the interface the salt solution could pass through the middle waterproof layer as the upward pore water pressure μ0 exceeded the downward capillary action 2ts cosθ r fig s11 b because the liquid water was in a critical position gravity g was negligible for the 1 0 pva content regardless of the thickness and position of the waterproof layer the salt solution could not pass through the waterproof layer indicating that the upward pore water pressure μ0 was always lower than the downward capillary action 2ts cosθ r 4 2 method comparison many methods have been proposed to prevent water salt migration the common theoretical basis is to change the pore size to inhibit the water salt capillary rise such as the clay with a dense structure malusis et al 2003 michette et al 2017 salehi hafshejani et al 2019 polymeric and metallic impermeable sheets a thin layer of plain or lightly reinforced concrete franzoni 2018 and a coarse grained soil layer park and fleming 2006 however these methods have serious limitations for example the dense structure may hinder the migration of water vapour which may cause structural damage to buildings with changes in temperature and relative humidity orlik kożdoń and steidl 2018 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2020 wang et al 2020b polyethylene sheets may cause stability issues when the wall is being loaded laterally assi et al 2021 a thin layer of plain or lightly reinforced concrete may crack and fracture as this layer dose not flex or move with the structure over years owing to its rigidity assi et al 2021 the above methods are frequently used only when the building is being constructed the other idea is to change the soil contact angle and use the hydrophobic properties of the soil to inhibit the water salt capillary rise the advantage of this method is that it does not significantly change the pore size and can be used to repair buildings this study confirms that a 1 0 pva waterproof layer at 20 c can effectively prevent water salt capillary rise from the perspective of capillary rise height water content and conductivity depending mainly on the soil hydrophobicity zhang et al 2021 reported that a 1 0 pva treated soil can maintain extreme water repellency at 20 40 c and thus this temperature range may be the most suitable for the application of this material most importantly as mentioned in the introduction pva adopts water as a solvent and does not pollute the environment it can be also used in a larger area than those for alkyl and alkoxy siloxanes with volatile organics as a solvent lopez arce et al 2009 young 2008 4 3 applicability analysis and study limitations the pva waterproof layer has a wide range of applications in the field when a wall is being built it can be laid under the wall using the mixing method i e mixing the soil and pva solution evenly for wall repairs the pva solution can be injected into the wall to form a waterproof layer chen et al 2019 reported that the viscosity of the 1 0 pva solution i e the ratio of solid pva mass to total mass is 1 0 is 3 18 10 3 pa s at 25 c and this solution can be diluted with water such that the viscosity of the solution can be further decreased to approach that of distilled water this low viscosity is the basis for its injectability the viscosity of distilled water is 0 89 10 3 pa s at 25 c owing to its cheap and environment friendly properties this waterproof layer is particularly suitable for the protection of earthen sites in northwest china the injection method may be appropriate when the earthen sites are repaired according to the results of this study a 1 0 pva content in the soil should be adopted at 20 40 c and a waterproof layer thickness of 1 cm is sufficient the position of the waterproof layer should be set according to the actual situation and the type of salt solution does not need to be considered this work mainly discusses a one dimensional model based on soil columns the water salt capillary rise was mainly upward and water salt migrations in other directions did not exist further research needs to be conducted on the three dimensional model furthermore the longest test time in this study was only 10 h and a longer time needs to be considered in the future 5 conclusion the following conclusions were drawn from this study based on the results of capillary rise height final water content and final conductivity the pva waterproof layer was proved to be effective in preventing the water salt capillary rise through a soil column experiment multiple variables were set in the soil column experiment to evaluate the waterproof effect of pva treated soils when the samples were treated at 100 c the results of the capillary rise height water content and conductivity indicated the ineffectiveness of the waterproof layer regardless of waterproof layer thickness waterproof layer position pva content and type of salt solution for the samples dried at 20 c the lower waterproof layer with a 0 5 pva content prevented the water salt capillary rise while the middle and upper waterproof layers exhibited less effectiveness the effect of the waterproof layer with a 1 0 pva content was significant regardless of the thickness and position and a 1 cm thick waterproof layer was sufficient to prevent the water salt capillary rise the thickness of the waterproof layer and type of soluble salt were less important than the position of the waterproof layer pva content and ambient temperature the contact angle rather than the pore size played a leading role in preventing the capillary rise by contrasting the ambient temperature due to adj r2 value 1 00 the modified ga model based on the fact that the gravity head and soil suction head were in opposite directions could accurately describe the capillary rise the addition of pva decreased the pore size and hydraulic conductivity of the samples which were calculated by the modified ga model for the samples treated at 100 c water content of the soil above the waterproof layer decreased owing to the pore size and contact angle differences at the interface for the samples dried at 20 c salt solution could pass through the middle waterproof layer with 0 5 pva content due to the upward pore water pressure exceeding the downward capillary action at the interface above parameters i e pore size and hydraulic conductivity and interface effect could reasonably

3254,cutoff walls have been widely used to control seawater intrusion swi in coastal regions however previous research mainly focused on the protective effect of cutoff wall on the upstream groundwater system the downstream groundwater deterioration of coastal aquifers between the cutoff wall and sea induced by the installation of cutoff walls was not clarified yet we implemented indoor experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the downstream saltwater behaviors considering the construction of cutoff walls the results revealed that cutoff walls could enable the rise of downstream saltwater wedge widen the mixing zone width mitigate the freshwater discharge and aggravate the seaside groundwater deterioration in coastal aquifers we further found that the wall opening size wall distance to the sea hydraulic gradient and dispersivity could alter both the downstream spatial salt distribution and freshwater discharge while hydraulic conductivity only affected freshwater discharge it needs to be noticed that seawater invades the inland aquifer dramatically when the hydraulic gradient is less than 0 004 in our cases therefore cutoff walls are not suitable for coastal aquifers with low hydraulic gradient with the decrease of the distance between the wall and the sea boundary the cutoff wall remains effective for the swi control thus we found that a cutoff wall closer to the sea can somehow minimize the groundwater salinization of coastal aquifers without increasing the construction cost these results reveal the adverse side effects of the cutoff wall in downstream aquifer and further suggest additional countermeasures keywords seawater intrusion cutoff wall groundwater discharge mixing zone groundwater deterioration 1 introduction groundwater is the main resource of water management and supply in coastal regions especially in islands where rainfall is low and freshwater is scarce lu et al 2009 yang et al 2021 due in part to the over exploitation of groundwater and rise in the sea levels induced by global warming seawater intrusion swi has become a major concern for the groundwater deterioration in coastal aquifers lu et al 2013a b zheng et al 2021 hydraulic barrier is a common approach for preventing swi containing three types negative fig 1 a positve fig 1b and mixed barriers fig 1c negative barriers intercept the intruding saltwater by pumping in coastal aquifers however in certain conditions negative barriers extract more freshwater than saltwater lu and luo 2010 for positive barrier clogging is likely to operate due to the continuous injections thus becoming ineffective masciopinto 2013 adhikari et al 2020 later a mixed hydraulic barrier that combines the positive and negative barriers is proposed to improve the performance of controlling swi ebeling et al 2019 while in many conditions considering the limitation of available water resources the operation of hydraulic barrier system can be hardly maintained and so far the best alternative is physical barriers chang et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 physical barrier including cutoff wall fig 2 a and subsurface dam fig 2b has increasingly been employed in coastal regions to prevent swi hasan basri 2001 zheng et al 2021 a subsurface dam could stem the lower part of the aquifer leaving an opening above chang et al 2020 fang et al 2021 in contrast a cutoff wall is installed at the upper part of the aquifer leaving an opening at the bottom chang et al 2021 there have been a series of researches focusing on the effectiveness of physical barriers for preventing swi luyun et al 2009 ishida et al 2011 luyun et al 2011 investigated the effectiveness of cutoff walls in homogeneous aquifers where the cutoff wall could exhibit comparable performance to the recharge well abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 interpreted that the effectiveness of cutoff walls were seriously influenced by the in multi layered heterogeneity kaleris and ziogas 2013 found that the effectiveness of the cutoff wall was influenced by wall depth flow velocity mixing intensity and aquifer anisotropy abd elaty et al 2019 compared the cutoff wall with the subsurface dam in the biscayne aquifer and reported the cutoff wall was more efficient in that case it was found that a combination of the cutoff wall and freshwater injection further improved the effectiveness of repelling the intruding seawater armanuos et al 2019 gao et al 2021 later wu et al 2020 proposed that finiate length subusrface dams can prevent swi and enhance the safe extraction yan et al 2021 and yang et al 2021 used partially penetrating or impermeable cutoff wall to expand island freshwater lenses nevertheless groundwater deterioration between the cutoff wall and sea induced by the installation of cutoff walls has not been clarified by previous researchers a subsurface wall downstream the dagu river basin was built 20 km from the sea in qingdao china in 1998 zheng et al 2021 as a result of the rise of the downstream saltwater caused by the wall the groundwater pollution downstream the cutoff wall got even more serious therefore a strategy to minimize the downstream groundwater deterioration became an urgent issue in our previous work we have confirmed that cutoff walls rely on the high freshwater head at the bottom opening to prevent swi chang et al 2021 hence the hydraulic gradient of the aquifer could be a key factor in determining the suitability of cutoff walls in coastal regions which has not been discussed sufficiently in previous studies to address the above issues we conducted indoor experiments validated with lab scale numerical simulations to demonstrate the phenomenon of the rising saltwater wedge and broadeningmixing zone induced by cutoff walls then we used field scale numerical simulations to further investigate how the structure and location of cutoff walls and aquifer properties affect the downstream salt distribution and groundwater discharge 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was carried out in the flow tank with internal dimensions of 90 cm length 45 cm height 5 cm width fig 3 which was divided into freshwater tank seawater tank and porous media tank by porous plates the glass beads with uniform diameter of 0 7 mm were filled layer by layer under saturated conditions to avoid air bubbles in the pores the freshwater and seawater were pumped at a constant rate into the tanks from the bottom inlets respectively the constant freshwater and seawater heads were controlled by the top drainage overflow pipes the freshwater head was fixed at 26 1 cm and the seawater head was fixed at 25 2 cm the average hydraulic conductivity kf of the porous media as calculated by darcy s law was 6e 3 m s the porosity measured by the volume method was 0 4 the cutoff wall was represented by impermeable material with the bottom wall opening size of 4 cm nacl solution with a concentration of 36 g l was prepared for seawater a densitometer alfamirage sd 200l was used to evaluate the seawater density ρs 1025 kg m3 red dyes sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd were added to trace the movement of seawater the longitudinal dispersivity αl was determined by fitting the breakthrough curves from the one dimensional column test to the analytical solution and it was measured to be 0 1 cm the transverse dispersivity αt was set to be 1 10 of the longitudinal dispersivity shoemaker 2004 the saltwater wedge was recorded by a digital camera samsung hmx 2 2 numerical models seawat has been widely used to simulate seawater intrusion processes guo langevin 2002 we implemented a two dimensional vertical cross section domain to represent a simplified unconfined aquifer using seawat fig 4 we conducted both the lab scale models and field scale models the lab scale and field scale models domain were discretized into 90 27 and 200 30 quadratic elements respectively the element size and dispersivity satisfied the péclet number requirement to ensure numerical stability voss souza 1987 the aquifer was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic the inland and sea heads were set to be constant the upper boundary was set to be a phreatic surface and the bottom was considered to be a no flow boundary the lab scale model setup and related parameters were determined following the laboratory experiment for the initial condition of the field scale models the freshwater head was set to be 29 m and the seawater head was set to be 28 m constant concentrations of 36 g l and 0 g l were assigned to the seawater and freshwater boundaries respectively the hydraulic conductivity kf of the aquifer was 6e 4 m s and the effective porosity was 0 4 the molecular diffusion coefficient was 1e 9 m2 s the longitudinal dispersivity αl was set to 1 m and the transverse dispersivity αt was 1 10 of αl shoemaker 2004 the cutoff wall width was 1 m and the wall hydraulic conductivity was set to 1e 9 m s all symbols are listed in table 1 a set of field scale scenarios were utilized to investigate the influence of the structure of cutoff walls and the hydraulicproperties of aquifers on the toe length tl mixing zone width mzw freshwater discharge q saltwater pollution area a and the total salt mass m in the entire aquifer all scenarios are listed in table 2 2 3 evaluation indices the saltwater wedge was measured using 10 50 and 90 normalized salinity isohalines fig 3 abarca and prabhakar clement 2009 zhou wang 2009 the toe length of the saltwater wedge tl is the distance between the 50 isohaline and the saltwater boundary along the bottom boundary and is used to measure the extent of seawater intrusion the mixing zone was recognized to significantly impact solute transport chemical and biological processes of coastal aquifers lu luo 2010 at the same time the mixing zone width mzw was considered to be the key index evaluating the extension of mixing zone the mixing zone width mzw is the interface averaged width of the mixing zone which was calculated according to equation 1 lu et al 2009 2013a b mzw a m l where am is the area of the mixing zone which is bounded by 10 and 90 normalized isohalines and l is the length of 90 normalized isohaline the saltwater pollution area a and the total salt mass m were used to assessthe magnitude of groundwater deterioration in the entire aquifer the saltwater pollution area a corresponds to the area of 10 isohaline and the total salt mass m is the sum of the salt mass in the entire aquifer 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of the seawater intrusion affected by a cutoff wall indoor experiments and numerical simulations were carried out to investigate the effect of the cutoff wall on the saltwater wedge the saltwater wedge first advanced quickly then rose up gradually when reaching near to the cutoff wall we considered the setup equilibrated when the saltwater was not advancing or rising up more than 1 mm per 10 min fig 5 indicates that the steady state salt distribution more than 300 min of the saltwater wedge intruded into the aquifer without a cutoff wall the results of numerical simulations and the experiments agree well with each other fig 5a and 5b the mixing zone between the seawater region and freshwater region could be characterized by the 10 and 90 isohalines fig 5b the mixing zone is hardly captured by the dye tracking in laboratory experiments shen et al 2020 we can only observe the gradual change of red color at the interface between seawater and freshwater although the visible light red mixing zone was narrower than the mixing zone in the numerical simulation fig 6 delineates that the steady state of the saltwater wedge are strongly affected by a cutoff wall both the experimental and numerical results demonstrated that the seawater intrusion was restricted and the middle part of the saltwater wedge rose up obviously due to the obstruction of the cutoff wall fig 6a b the numerical results showed that the mixing zone was wider in the middle part and narrower at the front and rear of the saltwater wedge fig 6b in the experimental result a clear interface could be observed at the front and rear due to the narrow mixing zone while a wide and fuzzy red band existed in the middle part representing a wider mixing zone fig 6a compared to the no wall case the toe of the saltwater wedge shortened from 0 43 m to 0 21 m the mixing zone width widened from 0 033 m to 0 054 m the freshwater discharge decreases from 0 0017 m3 h to 0 0007 m3 h the saltwater pollution area mitigates from 0 046 m2 to 0 043 m2 and the salt mass decrease from 67 9 g to 61 1 g in the entire aquifer x 0 90 cm in conclusion the cutoff wall could effectively control swi and alleviated groundwater pollution in the entire aquifer but it also reduced freshwater discharge and increased the width of the mixing zone in the view of the coastal aquifer x 70 90 cm the salt mass of the no wall case mc was 52 8 g and the saltwater pollution area ac was 0 322 m2 for the coastal aquifer the cutoff wall induced a 15 7 increase of the salt mass mc and a 33 3 increase of the saltwater pollution area ac 3 2 effect of cutoff wall structures 3 2 1 wall opening size for the simulated scenarios in this section l αl dh dx and kf were identical and different wall opening sizes s were used fig 7 represents the effect of s on the saltwater wedge and freshwater discharge the grey regions in fig 7c 7d and 7e represent that the toe of the saltwater wedge does not exceed the cutoff wall and the saltwater wedge is effectively controlled downstream of the wall as s increases the freshwater discharge q increases accordingly when s is larger than 20 m q tends to be stable fig 7c as s increases the toe length tl gradually lengthens fig 7d when s reaches 5 m smin the saltwater wedge toe exactly located at position of the cutoff wall and the further reduction of s hardly influences tl when s is larger than 5 m the seawater invades upstream of the cutoff wall and tl increases rapidly with s when s continues to add up to 20 m tl grows slowly up to the tl of no dam case s 30 m in our previous research on subsurface dams we proposed the concept of the minimum effective dam height which was the critical height to prevent seawater intrusion chang et al 2019 when the dam is lower than the minimum effective height the function of preventing swi is completely disabled the saltwater crosses beyond the subsurface dam and invaded the inland aquifer unlike the subsurface dam when s is larger than smin 5 m the cutoff wall still shortens the invasion length effectively when s is less than 16 m the mixing zone width mzw decreases with the increase of s when s is greater than 16 m the mzw tends to be stable and finally reaches the mzw of the no wall case fig 7a shows that when s is 5 m the increase in mzw is indicated by the rise of 10 isohaline while at the same time the toe is limited to the wall location meaning that the toe length tl decreases for the case that s increases to 10 m the cutoff wall has minor effect on the saltwater wedge the rise of 10 isohaline becomes moderate and the toe length tl exceeds the wall distance to the sea fig 7b the total salt mass m and saltwater pollution area a first mitigates and then increases with the growth of s reaching a minimum value near s 10 12 m fig 7e this is because when s is less than 10 m the reduction of s leads to a significant rise of salt concentration in the whole domain which causes an entire increase in m and a when s is larger than 12 m the saltwater wedge elevates more mildly while the saltwater advances with the growth of s which finally leads to the growth of m and a thus when s is 2 2 4 times of smin s 10 m 12 m the salt pollution of the entire aquifer can be minimized the mixing zone is reduced and freshwater discharge is enhanced fig 7e 3 2 2 wall distance to the sea in this section s αl dh dx and kf were identical and cases with different wall distances to the sea l were simulated in scenario b fig 8 shows the effect of l on the saltwater wedge and freshwater discharge fig 8c interprets that the freshwater discharge q increases with the growth of l a closer wall leads to smaller freshwater discharge which benefits storing freshwater resources in inland aquifers nevertheless the small discharge will induce the accumulation of land sources pollutants kang xu 2017 with the increase of l the toe length of the saltwater wedge tl lengthens gradually fig 8d when l is less than 40 m the toe of the saltwater wedge exceeds the bottom of the cutoff wall but the majority of the seawater remains downstream of the wall fig 8a when l is greater than 40 m the cutoff wall can restrict the saltwater wedge downstream of the wall fig 8b with the increase of l the mixing zone width mzw increases gradually l less than 40 m and then tends to stabilize l 40 m after installation a further cutoff wall to the sea the extension of the invading saltwater wedge causes a increment of the total salt mass m and the saltwater pollution area a fig 8e with the same wall opening size s a cutoff wall near the sea can reduce the saltwater intrusion length width of the mixing zone and finally mitigate the groundwater deterioration of the entire aquifer but decrease the freshwater discharge 3 3 effects of aquifer properties 3 3 1 hydrodynamic dispersion the model with identical values of s l dh dx kf and different dispersivities αl were simulated in scenario c fig 9 presents the effect of the dispersivity on the saltwater wedge and freshwater discharge fig 9c indicates that the growth of the dispersivity increases the freshwater discharge q abarca et al 2007 found that the water flux in the low salinity mixing zone 60 isohaline is much larger than that in the high salinity mixing zone 60 isohaline fig 9a and 9b show that the high dispersivity case has a wider low salinity mixing zone at the wall opening than that in the case of the low dispersivity thus more freshwater can flow through the wall opening and discharge seaward in the high dispersivity case with an increase of the dispersivity the toe length tl decreases gradually while the mixing zone widens gradually fig 9d the total salt mass m decreases as the dispersivity increases due to the retreat of seawater 90 isohaline the saltwater pollution area a decreases first and then increases with increasing dispersivity and the inflection point is αl 2 m fig 9e fig 9a shows that when αl is less than 2 m the middle of the 10 isohaline near the cutoff wall rises more severely with the reduction of αl the rise of the low concentration saltwater 10 isohaline leads to an increment in a furthermore when αl is equal to 6 m the 10 isohaline becomes almost vertical fig 9b the low concentration saltwater occupies the top of the coastal aquifer and a increases compared with the case of αl 2 m 3 3 2 hydraulic gradient the scenarios with same values of s l αl kf and different hydraulic gradients dh dx were simulated in scenario d fig 10 delineates the effect of the hydraulic gradient on the saltwater wedge and freshwater discharge the toe length tl decreases as the hydraulic gradient dh dx increases fig 10d tl proliferates when dh dx is less than 0 004 the saltwater passes through the wall opening and completely occupies the lower part of the inland aquifer at dh dx 0 003 fig 10a when dh dx is greater than 0 004 tl changes gently fig 10b as dh dx increases the saltwater wedge moves downward vertically and retreats longitudinally this was because that the growth of dh dx promotes freshwater discharge q fig 10c moreover larger q can repel more saltwater in both the vertical and longitude directions chang et al 2021 the shrink of 10 isohaline is more serious than that of other cases resulting in a decrease in the mixing zone width mzw a large dh dx induces a short saltwater wedge and a narrow mixing zone thus reducing both the salt mass intruding into the aquifer m and the saltwater pollution area a fig 10e 3 3 3 aquifer permeability in this section cases with identical values of s l αl dh dx and different hydraulic conductivities kf were simulated in scenario e fig 11 delineates the effect of the hydraulic conductivity on the saltwater wedge and freshwater discharge the freshwater discharge q increases linearly as the hydraulic conductivity kf rises fig 11c larger kf results in a higher freshwater velocity which creates a larger freshwater discharge the comparison of fig 11a and 11b shows that the change in kf does not affect the salinity distribution downstream the cutoff wall therefore the toe length tl mixing zone width mzw total salt mass m and saltwater pollution area a do not vary with kf 3 4 discussion our results indicate that the cutoff wall could cause a significant rise of saltwater wedge between the cutoff wall and ocean this phenomenon will increase the salt mass and salt pollution area of coastal aquifers previous researchers and decision makers only paid attention to the protection of groundwater in inland aquifers but ignored the aggravation of groundwater deterioration in coastal aquifers by cutoff walls abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 kaleris and ziogas 2013 among all the cutoff wall structures the effectiveness of cutoff walls is not sensitive to the wall distance to sea without reducing the wall opening size s a cutoff wall near to the sea can reduce groundwater pollution of the entire aquifer while decrease the freshwater discharge the reduction of the freshwater discharge due to cutoff walls may prolong the renewal period of the inland groundwater and result in the accumulation of land source pollutants in the inland aquifer kang xu 2017 sun et al 2019 sun et al 2021 while this problem may be mitigated by artificial extraction of groundwater according to our previous researches on the subsurface dam the closer the subsurface dam is to the sea the higher the dam is required chang et al 2019 when the dam height is lower than the minimum efficient height the subsurface becomes disabled and the saltwater will dramatically invade inland aquifers beyond the dam however when the cutoff wall is closer to the sea the wall still can effectively control seawater intrusion maintaining the same opening size when the hydraulic gradient is less than 0 004 in our cases the saltwater advances through the bottom opening of the cutoff wall compared with the mild variation of other parameters the intense saltwater intrusion induced by low hydraulic gradient leads to the failure of cutoff walls in our previous research on subsurface dams the rise of the saltwater wedge which will aggravate the salinization of coastal aquifer was also observed in laboratory experiments chang et al 2020 therefore the downstream groundwater deterioration is the universal feature for physical barriers both cutoff walls and subsurface dams the decision makers better choose the location closer to the sea to build the cutoff wall which is more conducive in protecting the coastal environment with the same construction costs in coastal aquifers with very low hydraulic gradient the decision makers should choose other types of physical barriers such as subsurface dams or newly developed physical barriers zheng et al 2020 gao et al 2021 4 summary and conclusions according to our results it was found that the toe length freshwater discharge mixing zone width and magnitude of downstream groundwater pollution are strongly impacted by various factors including the wall opening size wall distance to the sea hydraulic gradient and dispersivity change of hydraulic conductivities only influences the freshwater discharge and does not alter the salt distribution in the aquifers our principal conclusions are as follows cutoff wall could rise up the downstream saltwater wedge and widen the mixing zone resulting in an increment of the downstream saltwater pollution area and the total salt mass in the coastal aquifer a cutoff wall near the sea can minimize the saltwater intrusion length width of the mixing zone saltwater pollution area and salt mass of the entire aquifer without increasing construction costs therefore when constructing cutoff walls the decision makers should choose the location as close to the sea as possible when the hydraulic gradient is very low less than 0 004 in our case the saltwater sharply intrudes inland in our cases which disables the cutoff wall thus cutoff walls are not suitable for the aquifers with low hydraulic gradient these results reveal the adverse side effects of the cutoff wall and suggest the potential countermeasures in this work we focused on a constant sea boundary out of simplicity however the temporal fluctuations of seawater levels induced by tides may impact the salt distribution and freshwater discharge in the coastal aquifer which will be

validation of the seawater intrusion affected by a cutoff wall indoor experiments and numerical simulations were carried out to investigate the effect of the cutoff wall on the saltwater wedge the

b the numerical results showed that the mixing zone was wider in the middle part and narrower at the front and rear of the saltwater wedge fig 6b in the experimental result a clear interface could be observed at the front and rear due to the narrow mixing zone while a wide and fuzzy red band existed in the middle part representing a wider mixing zone fig 6a compared to the no wall case the toe of the saltwater wedge shortened from 0 43 m to 0 21 m the mixing zone width widened from 0 033 m to 0 054 m the freshwater discharge decreases from 0 0017 m3 h to 0 0007 m3 h the saltwater pollution area mitigates from 0 046 m2 to 0 043 m2 and the salt mass decrease from 67 9 g to 61 1 g in the entire aquifer x 0 90 cm in conclusion the cutoff wall could effectively control swi and alleviated groundwater pollution in the entire aquifer but it also reduced freshwater discharge and increased the width of the mixing zone in the view of the coastal aquifer x 70 90 cm the salt mass of the no wall case mc was 52 8 g and the saltwater pollution area ac was 0 322 m2 for the coastal aquifer the cutoff wall induced a 15 7 increase of the salt mass mc and a 33 3 increase of the saltwater pollution area ac 3 2 effect of cutoff wall structures 3 2 1 wall opening size for the simulated scenarios in this section l αl dh dx and kf were identical and different wall opening sizes s were used fig 7 represents the effect of s on the saltwater wedge and freshwater discharge the grey regions in fig 7c 7d and 7e represent that the toe of the saltwater wedge does not exceed the cutoff wall and the saltwater wedge is effectively controlled downstream of the wall as s increases the freshwater discharge q increases accordingly when s is larger than 20 m q tends to be stable fig 7c as s increases the toe length tl gradually lengthens fig 7d when s reaches 5 m smin the saltwater wedge toe exactly located at position of the cutoff wall and the further reduction of s hardly influences tl when s is larger than 5 m the seawater invades upstream of the cutoff wall and tl increases rapidly with s when s continues to add up to 20 m tl grows slowly up to the tl of no dam case s 30 m in our previous research on subsurface dams we proposed the concept of the minimum effective dam height which was the critical height to prevent seawater intrusion chang et al 2019 when the dam is lower than the minimum effective height the function of preventing swi is completely disabled the saltwater crosses beyond the subsurface dam and invaded the inland aquifer unlike the subsurface dam when s is larger than smin 5 m the cutoff wall still shortens the invasion length effectively when s is less than 16 m the mixing zone width mzw decreases with the increase of s when s is greater than 16 m the mzw tends to be stable and finally reaches the mzw of the no wall case fig 7a shows that when s is 5 m the increase in mzw is indicated by the rise of 10 isohaline while at the same time the toe is limited to the wall location meaning that the toe length tl decreases for the case that s increases to 10 m the cutoff wall has minor effect on the saltwater wedge the rise of 10 isohaline becomes moderate and the toe length tl exceeds the wall distance to the sea fig 7b the total salt mass m and saltwater pollution area a first mitigates and then increases with the growth of s reaching a minimum value near s 10 12 m fig 7e this is because when s is less than 10 m the reduction of s leads to a significant rise of salt concentration in the whole domain which causes an entire increase in m and a when s is larger than 12 m the saltwater wedge elevates more mildly while the saltwater advances with the growth of s which finally leads to the growth of m and a thus when s is 2 2 4 times of smin s 10 m 12 m the salt pollution of the entire aquifer can be minimized the mixing zone is reduced and freshwater discharge is enhanced fig 7e 3 2 2 wall distance to the sea in this section s αl dh dx and kf were identical and cases with different wall distances to the sea l were simulated in scenario b fig 8 shows the effect of l on the saltwater wedge and freshwater discharge fig 8c interprets that the freshwater discharge q increases with the growth of l a closer wall leads to smaller freshwater discharge which benefits storing freshwater resources in inland aquifers nevertheless the small discharge will induce the accumulation of land sources pollutants kang xu 2017 with the increase of l the toe length of the saltwater wedge tl lengthens gradually fig 8d when l is less than 40 m the toe of the saltwater wedge exceeds the bottom of the cutoff wall but the majority of the seawater remains downstream of the wall fig 8a when l is greater than 40 m the cutoff wall can restrict the saltwater wedge downstream of the wall fig 8b with the increase of l the mixing zone width mzw increases gradually l less than 40 m and then tends to stabilize l 40 m after installation a further cutoff wall to the sea the extension of the invading saltwater wedge causes a increment of the total salt mass m and the saltwater pollution area a fig 8e with the same wall opening size s a cutoff wall near the sea can reduce the saltwater intrusion length width of the mixing zone and finally mitigate the groundwater deterioration of the entire aquifer but decrease the freshwater discharge 3 3 effects of aquifer properties 3 3 1 hydrodynamic dispersion the model with identical values of s l dh dx kf and different dispersivities αl were simulated in scenario c fig 9 presents the effect of the dispersivity on the saltwater wedge and freshwater discharge fig 9c indicates that the growth of the dispersivity increases the freshwater discharge q abarca et al 2007 found that the water flux in the low salinity mixing zone 60 isohaline is much larger than that in the high salinity mixing zone 60 isohaline fig 9a and 9b show that the high dispersivity case has a wider low salinity mixing zone at the wall opening than that in the case of the low dispersivity thus more freshwater can flow through the wall opening and discharge seaward in the high dispersivity case with an increase of the dispersivity the toe length tl decreases gradually while the mixing zone widens gradually fig 9d the total salt mass m decreases as the dispersivity increases due to the retreat of seawater 90 isohaline the saltwater pollution area a decreases first and then increases with increasing dispersivity and the inflection point is αl 2 m fig 9e fig 9a shows that when αl is less than 2 m the middle of the 10 isohaline near the cutoff wall rises more severely with the reduction of αl the rise of the low concentration saltwater 10 isohaline leads to an increment in a furthermore when αl is equal to 6 m the 10 isohaline becomes almost vertical fig 9b the low concentration saltwater occupies the top of the coastal aquifer and a increases compared with the case of αl 2 m 3 3 2 hydraulic gradient the scenarios with same values of s l αl kf and different hydraulic gradients dh dx were simulated in scenario d fig 10 delineates the effect of the hydraulic gradient on the saltwater wedge and freshwater discharge the toe length tl decreases as the hydraulic gradient dh dx increases fig 10d tl proliferates when dh dx is less than 0 004 the saltwater passes through the wall opening and completely occupies the lower part of the inland aquifer at dh dx 0 003 fig 10a when dh dx is greater than 0 004 tl changes gently fig 10b as dh dx increases the saltwater wedge moves downward vertically and retreats longitudinally this was because that the growth of dh dx promotes freshwater discharge q fig 10c moreover larger q can repel more saltwater in both the vertical and longitude directions chang et al 2021 the shrink of 10 isohaline is more serious than that of other cases resulting in a decrease in the mixing zone width mzw a large dh dx induces a short saltwater wedge and a narrow mixing zone thus reducing both the salt mass intruding into the aquifer m and the saltwater pollution area a fig 10e 3 3 3 aquifer permeability in this section cases with identical values of s l αl dh dx and different hydraulic conductivities kf were simulated in scenario e fig 11 delineates the effect of the hydraulic conductivity on the saltwater wedge and freshwater discharge the freshwater discharge q increases linearly as the hydraulic conductivity kf rises fig 11c larger kf results in a higher freshwater velocity which creates a larger freshwater discharge the comparison of fig 11a and 11b shows that the change in kf does not affect the salinity distribution downstream the cutoff wall therefore the toe length tl mixing zone width mzw total salt mass m and saltwater pollution area a do not vary with kf 3 4 discussion our results indicate that the cutoff wall could cause a significant rise of saltwater wedge between the cutoff wall and ocean this phenomenon will increase the salt mass and salt pollution area of coastal aquifers previous researchers and decision makers only paid attention to the protection of groundwater in inland aquifers but ignored the aggravation of groundwater deterioration in coastal aquifers by cutoff walls abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 kaleris and ziogas 2013 among all the cutoff wall structures the effectiveness of cutoff walls is not sensitive to the wall distance to sea without reducing the wall opening size s a cutoff wall near to the sea can reduce groundwater pollution of the entire aquifer while decrease the freshwater discharge the reduction of the freshwater discharge due to cutoff walls may prolong the renewal period of the inland groundwater and result in the accumulation of land source pollutants in the inland aquifer kang xu 2017 sun et al 2019 sun et al 2021 while this problem may be mitigated by artificial extraction of groundwater according to our previous researches on the subsurface dam the closer the subsurface dam is to the sea the higher the dam is required chang et al 2019 when the dam height is lower than the minimum efficient height the subsurface becomes disabled and the saltwater will dramatically invade inland aquifers beyond the dam however when the cutoff wall is closer to the sea the wall still can effectively control seawater intrusion maintaining the same opening size when the hydraulic gradient is less than 0 004 in our cases the saltwater advances through the bottom opening of the cutoff wall compared with the mild variation of other parameters the intense saltwater intrusion induced by low hydraulic gradient leads to the failure of cutoff walls in our previous research on subsurface dams the rise of the saltwater wedge which will aggravate the salinization of coastal aquifer was also observed in laboratory experiments chang et al 2020 therefore the downstream groundwater deterioration is the universal feature for physical barriers both cutoff walls and subsurface dams the decision makers better choose the location closer to the sea to build the cutoff wall which is more conducive in protecting the coastal environment with the same construction costs in coastal aquifers with very low hydraulic gradient the decision makers should choose other types of physical barriers such as subsurface dams or newly developed physical barriers zheng et al 2020 gao et al 2021 4 summary and conclusions according to our results it was found that the toe length freshwater discharge mixing zone width and magnitude of downstream groundwater pollution are strongly impacted by various factors including the wall opening size wall distance to the sea hydraulic gradient and dispersivity change of hydraulic conductivities only influences the freshwater discharge and does not alter the salt distribution in the aquifers our principal conclusions are as follows cutoff wall could rise up the downstream saltwater wedge and widen the mixing zone resulting in an increment of the downstream saltwater pollution area and the total salt mass in the coastal aquifer a cutoff wall near the sea can minimize the saltwater intrusion length width of the mixing zone saltwater pollution area and salt mass of the entire aquifer without increasing construction costs therefore when constructing cutoff walls the decision makers should choose the location as close to the sea as possible when the hydraulic gradient is very low less than 0 004 in our case the saltwater sharply intrudes inland in our cases which disables the cutoff wall thus cutoff walls are not suitable for the aquifers with low hydraulic gradient these results reveal the adverse side effects of the cutoff wall and suggest the potential countermeasures in this work we focused on a constant sea boundary out of simplicity however the temporal fluctuations of seawater levels induced by tides may impact the salt distribution and freshwater discharge in the coastal aquifer which will be investigated in further work credit authorship contribution statement qinpeng chang investigation methodology conceptualization writing original draft writing review editing tianyuan zheng
