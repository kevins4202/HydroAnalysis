19740,excess nitrogen n export from lowland artificial watersheds polders is often assumed to be a major contributor to the cultural eutrophication of downstream aquatic ecosystems however the complex transport processes characterizing lowland areas pose significant challenges in accurately quantifying their actual role in this study we developed a dynamic model to track n sources and transport pathways in lowland polders the model is able to accommodate all the unique characteristics of polder dynamics including artificial drainage and interactions among surface water groundwater and soil water our model was calibrated and validated against water level data and nitrogen concentrations measured in a lowland polder polder jian in china during the 2014 2016 period model performance was satisfactory with an r 2 value of 0 55 and an ns value of 0 53 for total n concentrations the characterization of the various components of water budget and n cycle derived by the model was on par with local empirical estimates n export from polder jian was approximately 57 kg ha 1 yr 1 and was distinctly higher than values reported from nearby non polder areas the largest fraction of n export stemmed from seepage to our knowledge this is the first dynamic model to quantify n export from a watershed with artificial drainage network and can be used to design remedial measures of ecosystem degradation graphical abstract image 1 keywords polders nitrogen dynamics water budget best management practices paddy land 1 introduction polder is a reclaimed lowland area with manual control of runoff and water levels using pumping systems segeren 1983 it is widely constructed at the lowland areas of large aquatic systems around the world such as 60 of netherlands land surface van der grift et al 2016 the lower reach of yangtze river huang et al 2016 the upper rhine river and elbe river lindenschmidt et al 2009 polders functionally resemble to artificial watersheds characterized by significantly different water transport dynamics compared with free drainage watersheds runoff water is freely flowed through the river network within the watershed polders are enclosed by dikes with artificial drainage systems e g culverts and pumping stations during rainfall events runoff water flows into the surface water area ditches and ponds and may be exported into surrounding rivers through culverts or pumping stations to reduce flood risk compared with free drainage watersheds polders are characterized by a strong interplay among surface water groundwater and soil water in farmlands brauer et al 2014 yan et al 2016 water transport within a polder is predominantly driven by water level difference which could result in a changing flow direction through time nitrogen n export from lowland polders is a thorny issue due to their ability to modulate the nature and severity of eutrophication problems in adjacent aquatic ecosystems van der grift et al 2016 tracking n dynamics in polders can thus be helpful to pinpoint the major n sources to their surrounding lakes and rivers however the unique n transport pathways in polders pose significant challenges in accurately characterizing all the major sources and sinks of the n cycle in particular polder n transport is significantly affected by artificial drainage during rainfall events runoff water may be manually retained in the surface water area e g ponds and ditches rather than exported into their surrounding rivers huang et al 2016 such water retention within polders can profoundly change n dynamics through sedimentation and or other biogeochemical processes polder n transport is also significantly affected by strong interactions among surface water groundwater and soil water in farmlands many process based watershed models have been developed to simulate watershed n dynamics such as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 integrated nitrogen in catchments model inca wade et al 2002 and annualized agricultural non point source pollution annagnps model li et al 2015 these watershed models cannot be directly applied to simulate polder n dynamics for two basic reasons first none of these models is structurally equipped to determine flow direction in lowland polders one of their fundamental assumptions is that the watershed is spatially divided into hydrologic response units hrus or grid cells whereby flow direction is determined based on elevation differences among these hrus cells however flow direction in lowland polders is generally determined by water level rather than elevation differences second the commonly used watershed models do not include the process of artificial drainage such as culvert and pumping stations although there is ample evidence in the literature that they can play a significant role in n transport within polders in this context our study aims to address a major knowledge gap in the modelling literature by presenting the nitrogen dynamic polder ndp model to characterize n sources sinks and transport reaction pathways the model aims to accommodate both conceptually and operationally the unique processes underlying polder water balance and n transport our case study to illustrate the key features of the ndp model is the polder jian located in the lowland area of lake taihu basin china our analysis involves all the major methodological steps during model development including a sensitivity analysis exercise and model optimization with genetic algorithms our model is then used to shed light on all the major components of the water budget and n cycle and our derived projections are compared against existing empirical and or modeling estimates in the area we conclude by discussing the prospect of the model to guide management decisions as well as the potential directions for future model augmentations 2 model description ndp included five water balance modules and three n dynamic modules using a daily time step compared with existing watershed models e g swat ndp includes specific mechanisms to describe water balance and n transport in lowland polders these mechanisms considered the artificial drainage and water exchange processes among surface water groundwater and soil water in farmlands mathematical equations for the processes in ndp can be found in table a1 based on the equation numbers in fig 1 ndp comprises three n forms i e oxidized or nitrate nitrite nitrogen no reduced nitrogen nh and particulate nitrogen pn dissolved nitrogen dn is the sum of no and nh total nitrogen tn is the sum of no nh and pn ndp consists of 10 state variables 31 input variables 82 intermediate variables and 53 parameters tables a2 and a3 details regarding the model implementation can be found in the supporting information section 2 1 water balance modules five water balance modules are used to describe the hydrological processes of polders these modules were originally developed by huang et al 2016 in a phosphorus dynamic model for polders pdp four water balance modules aim to simulate the water balance in four land use types residential area surface water area paddy and dry lands a fifth water management module is also included aiming to describe the artificial drainage in polders such as irrigation culvert and flood drainage to better describe water balance in polders three improvements on the water balance modules were made 2 1 1 interaction between groundwater and surface water previous studies identified a strong interaction between farmland groundwater and surface water brauer et al 2014 yan et al 2016 the interaction resulted in quick water flow among different water layers that significantly influenced polder water balance the interaction process was added into the water balance modules using the following exponential equation 1 k e x c h a n g e k 1 h x u g t h x t λ 1 h x u g t h x t k 2 h x t h x u g t λ 2 h x u g t h x t where k exchange is the water exchange rate between farmland groundwater and surface water m d 1 h x u g t and h x t are the water storage m of the farmland groundwater and surface water k 1 and k 2 are the maximum water exchange rate m d 1 affected by the hydraulic conductivity of soil layers λ 1 and λ 2 are the exponential order to estimate water exchange rate this equation describes the water exchange rate between surface water and farmland groundwater based on their water head differences and is an application of darcy s law sophocleous 2002 a larger difference of water head would result in a larger water exchange rate fig 2 spatial variability of groundwater level was not considered 2 1 2 interaction between groundwater and soil water in lowland areas groundwater level is generally high and showed significant fluctuations over time cheng et al 2006 indicative of a strong interaction between groundwater and soil water in farmlands the water exchange rate between groundwater and soil water in paddy and dry lands is estimated using equation 1 a higher difference between groundwater level m and soil water storage m would result in greater water exchange rate 2 1 3 artificial drainage artificial drainage e g irrigation culvert and flood drainage was described in the water management module developed by huang et al 2016 the improvement of this study is the development of two approaches to describe the irrigation and pumping processes one approach used five thresholds for water levels to describe the artificial drainage huang et al 2016 this approach can be used in case that irrigation and pumping data are unavailable more details can be found in the supporting information section the second approach directly uses the measured irrigation and pumping water amount as model inputs the present study used the latter approach as both irrigation and pumping data were available section 3 2 2 paddy and dry land nitrogen modules two nitrogen modules were developed to describe the chemical and biological processes related to n dynamics in the paddy and dry lands these nitrogen modules were developed based on the farmland n cycle as depicted in the integrated nitrogen in catchments inca model and soil erosion quantification as approximated by the universal soil loss equation usle inca is a process based model that was originally developed by wade et al 2002 in this study it was selected due to its detailed mechanisms for describing no and nh dynamics in the soil zone of agricultural farmlands lazar et al 2010 wade et al 2006 whitehead et al 2016 no concentrations in soil water are determined by fertilization deposition atmospheric nitrogen n2 fixation nitrification denitrification and crop uptake nh concentrations in soil water are driven by fertilization deposition mineralization organic n to nh nitrification and crop uptake no and nh dynamics in the soil water of the dry and paddy lands can be described using the following equations 2 n

paddy lands due to mineralization at time t usle was used to estimate the annual sediment yield kg ha 1 yr 1 from paddy and dry lands as a function of rainfall soil erodibility topography cropping and soil conservation practices equation 6 15 in table a1 pn concentrations in the dry and paddy land runoff were then estimated using the annual sediment yield equation 6 14 in table a1 usle was chosen because its capacity to predict soil erosion has been examined in watersheds worldwide kinnell 2010 and is integrated into many watershed models such as swat neitsch et al 2005 and agnps young et al 1989 detailed description of the associated equations can be found in neitsch et al 2005 2 3 water area nitrogen module polders included a large area of surface water ponds and ditches for retention and therefore a water area nitrogen module is necessary to describe n sedimentation and other biogeochemical processes in polder surface waters the water area nitrogen module aimed to describe n dynamics in the surface water and was developed based on two existing aquatic models environmental fluid dynamics code efdc tetra tech 2007 and the eutrophication model for lake washington arhonditsis and brett 2005 the water area nitrogen module included the processes of atmospheric deposition nitrification denitrification decomposition pn settling and resuspension n release from sediments n uptake by plants fig 1 limitations imposed by ambient temperature do and n concentrations on nitrification denitrification and plant uptake were described postulating michaelis menten kinetics with half saturation constants provided by the vast body of literature available arhonditsis and brett 2005 park et al 2008 tetra tech 2007 compared with existing complex aquatic models the water area nitrogen module has two simplifications of n biogeochemical processes i we considered only three n forms no nh and pn while existing lake models generally include more forms of n e g five n forms in efdc ii we did not explicitly include a dynamic representation of the nutrient phytoplankton interface e g nutrient uptake phytoplankton growth basal metabolism settling which is generally an important component in existing lake models these structural simplifications had the advantage of reducing input data and parameters and were deemed defensible because this study involved polder n export rather than surface water eutrophication 3 model application 3 1 study area polder jian 10 6 ha is located in the lowland area of lake taihu basin china it is a typical lowland polder enclosed by dikes with artificial drainage and complex ditch pond network the main difference with free drainage watersheds is that the polder uses artificial drainage systems one culvert and three pumping stations for water exchange with surrounding rivers during heavy rainfall events the culvert and flood pumping stations fig 3 are used to control surface water level to minimize flood risk another two pumping stations are used for irrigation during rice season a complex ditch pond network has been developed by local farmers for water transport and retention purposes the ditch network transports irrigation water to agricultural farmlands for crop water requirements during the dry periods and receives runoff from different land uses to ponds during heavy rainfall events the polder has a diversity of land use types including paddy land 50 1 dry land 21 7 residential areas 19 2 and surface water 9 the paddy land has a double cropping system of rice in summer and wheat in winter inorganic fertilizers including urea 46 4 n and compound fertilizers 16 n and 16 p has been used for crops in dry and paddy lands organic fertilizers are scarcely used for crops 3 2 data collection to investigate the polder nutrient dynamics an intensive monitoring program has been conducted since 2014 within the study area polder jian based on the monitoring program a three year 2014 2016 dataset was collected to calibrate and validate the ndp model this dataset included land use fertilization rates meteorological hydrological and water quality data with their detailed information in table 1 the land use and meteorological data were used as model inputs while the hydrological and water quality data were mainly used for model calibration and validation the land use data were based on satellite images the fertilization data were collected from local farmers the meteorological data were measured using an automatic rain gauge hobo rg3 m at polder jian and the national weather station liyang near the polder the hydrological data included water level irrigation and flood drainage water level data were collected during 2015 2016 using a water level logger hobo u20 at polder jian there were several data gaps in 2015 due to some instability issues with the water level logger irrigation and flood drainage data were derived based on the recorded pumping time all the meteorological and hydrological data were averaged to a daily time scale the water quality data were collected by water and sediment sampling at w1 4 and s1 3 fig 3 respectively 3 3 model calibration and validation ndp included two parameter sets consisting of 28 parameters for the water balance modules and 25 parameters for the n dynamic modules these two parameter sets were sequentially calibrated using the time series water level and water quality data table 1 the parameter set for the water balance module was calibrated and validated against the 2015 and 2016 water level data respectively the parameter set for the n dynamic module was calibrated against a two year 2014 2015 dataset and was subsequently validated against water quality data from 2016 model implementation in polder jian involved four critical steps preliminary calibration sensitivity analysis model optimization and model validation fig 4 preliminary calibration aimed to obtain an initial parameter set resulting in an acceptable model performance which formed the basis for the rest three methodological steps sensitivity analysis identified the ten most sensitive parameters for the water balance and n dynamic modules these twenty sensitive parameters were further used for model optimization model validation evaluated model agreement with an independent dataset reflecting different conditions from those used during our calibration exercise 3 3 1 preliminary calibration our goal with the preliminary model calibration was to identify a parameter vector resulting in an acceptable model fit to the observed data which formed the basis for the subsequent model sensitivity analysis and optimization we used latin hypercube to efficiently sample the multidimensional parameter space and generate 1000 parameter vectors table a2 the selection of the single best parameter set was not based solely on model fit but also on the plausibility of the water and n balance budgets relative to reported ranges from previous studies within the lake taihu basin see supporting information section in doing so we ensured that each component of the water and n dynamics e g farmland evapotranspiration and crop n uptake was comparable with literature values and thus our local sensitivity analysis was based upon a plausible base process characterization 3 3 2 3 3 2 sensitivity analysis to reduce the ndp calibration parameter vector influential parameters in the water balance and n dynamic modules were identified using a local sensitivity analysis one at a time oat method we identified the top ten most influential parameters in the water balance and n dynamic modules using the water storage of surface water h pond and tn concentrations in surface water as the targeted variables respectively each parameter value was increased or decreased by 10 while all other parameters were kept fixed a total of 2m m is the number of the testing parameter simulations were compared against the base simulation the sensitivity value s x of the tested parameter x was calculated by the relative change of the simulated h pond and tn induced by its 10 change 4 s x i 1 n f i p 1 p x δ p m f i p 1 p x p m 2 n f i p 1 p 2 p x p m δ p x i 1 n f i p 1 p x δ p m f i p 1 p x p m 2 n f i p 1 p 2 p x p m δ p x where p x is the value of the testing parameter x f i p 1 p x p m is the simulation h pond on i th i 1 2 n day from the base simulation f i p 1 p x δ p m and f i p 1 p x δ p m are the simulation h pond or tn on i th day from the test simulations by increasing decreasing by δ δ 0 1 p x m a x p x m i n respectively p xmax and p xmin are the maximum and minimum values of the tested parameter x a larger value of s x implies a higher sensitivity of parameter x further implementation details of the oat method could be found in cariboni et al 2007 3 3 3 parameter optimization using genetic algorithms genetic algorithms ga originally proposed by goldberg 1989 are increasingly used in environmental modeling practice for parameter estimation due to their ability to achieve global optimization kim et al 2007 liu et al 2007 following our sensitivity analysis exercise two parameter sets top ten influential parameters in water balance and n dynamic modules were subsequently optimized using ga with water level and water quality data table 1 ga optimization of each parameter set required the following steps 1 population initialization 200 initial parameter sets population were generated for the first generation of ga runs in each parameter set parameter values were randomly generated within their literature based ranges see supporting information section 2 fitness evaluation during the training period the fitness f of each individual was evaluated based upon the corresponding coefficient of determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency ns values 5 f r 2 n s an individual with a higher f value implied a higher fitness r 2 is expressed as the squared ratio between the covariance and the multiplied standard deviations of the observed and simulated values as such it estimates the combined dispersion against the single dispersion of the observed and simulated series however the fact that only the dispersion is quantified is one of the major drawbacks of r 2 as a model that systematically over or under predicts will still result in good r 2 values krause et al 2005 on the other hand ns is defined as one minus the sum of the absolute squared differences between predicted and observed values normalized by the variance of the observed values during the period under investigation although a popular goodness of fit measure in hydrology that accounts for linear bias of the model examined the nash sutcliffe efficiency is prone to overestimate model performance with large values e g peak flows in a time series whereas the impact of lower values e g low flow conditions tends to be downplayed legates and mccabe 1999 additional insights into the model fitness function values against parameter variations along with the covariance patterns of the two measures of fit r 2 versus ns are provided in the supporting information section 3 reproduction reproduction aiming to select the individuals with higher fitness values to create the next generation an individual with a higher fitness f value i e higher r 2 and ns value had a higher chance for reproduction thus the overall model fit of the individuals would be gradually improved over the course of 100 generations 4 crossover and mutation for each generation crossover was used to generate new individuals by exchanging parameter values 80 of the individuals were used in the crossover processes mutation was a randomly induced change of an individual s parameter value s with a low probability 5 both crossover and mutation processes were expected to generate dissimilar individuals parameter sets with high model fit 5 optimization repeat steps 2 4 until the generation number reached its maximum value of 100 the individual with highest fitness in the 100th generation was the best parameter set in this run 6 repeated run repeat steps 1 5 for 100 times the best parameter set from these 100 runs was compared to evaluate the ga s stability 7 mass balance evaluation the plausibility of the characterization of the water cycle and n budget was evaluated by comparing the associated fluxes with literature reported values this step aimed to settle for a calibration parameter set that effectively balances between optimal model performance and realistic representation of the water cycle and n dynamics in polder jian 3 3 4 calibration and validation results identification of the top ten most influential parameters in the water balance modules and the n dynamic modules can be found in the supporting information section the calibrated parameters are given in table a2 the water balance modules in ndp were well calibrated with an r 2 value of 0 75 and an ns value of 0 73 during the validation period 2016 the model captured the general water level trends several peak values were also closely reproduced however model fit during the validation period declined relative to that derived from model calibration fig 5 the inferior performance was due to the occurrence of several extremely high low values e g jul 21 2016 and sep 27 2016 that were not well predicted there were also instances of over estimated water level peaks during both calibrated and validation periods during the calibrated period tn in surface waters was accurately simulated with an r 2 value of 0 46 and the resulting ns value of 0 46 measured tn showed a decreasing trend from february to june and an increasing trend from october to december these trends were also closely reproduced by the model fig 5 interestingly model fit for tn concentrations during the validation period was slightly better than that for the calibration period the ndp model also accounted for dn and pn dynamics in the polder fig 5c the agreement between simulated and measured dn data was slightly better than with the tn data whereas pn was characterized by higher discrepancies which also reflected in an ns value less than 0 1 during the calibration and validation periods 3 4 water balance in polder jian the main water sources were precipitation and irrigation precipitation mainly occurred in summer and autumn fig 5 and showed a large year to year variability ranging from 1376 8 to 1506 5 mm yr 1 the annual precipitation in 2016 1506 5 mm was the highest over the past twenty years 1996 2015 with an average annual precipitation of 1139 9 mm the annual irrigation was 536 0 mm for the polder i e 1069 8 mm yr 1 for paddy land in previous studies of double cropping rice and wheat farmlands in lake taihu basin xu et al 2012 reported an irrigation rate of 878 mm yr 1 while zhao et al 2012 reported an irrigation level of 507 9 572 6 mm yr 1 without considering the water loss through ditches during irrigation period the large use of irrigation water for the polder was mainly due to the large water surface area 9 of polder jian and low elevation of dry land that caused a disproportionally high movement of irrigation water downstream the water in polder jian is lost through surface water evaporation farmland evapotranspiration seepage culvert and flood drainage fig 6 the annual farmland evapotranspiration was 491 5 mm for the polder or 679 2 mm yr 1 for paddy and dry lands this estimate was very close to reported value 632 mm yr 1 from an experimental study in lake taihu basin xu et al 2012 flood drainage had a value of 118 3 mm yr 1 and mostly occurred during extreme precipitation period as shown in fig 6 flood drainage was high 251 4 mm in 2016 due to several extreme precipitation events culvert drainage and seepage were responsible for a large proportion of water export out of polder jian with values of 703 0 and 556 2 mm yr 1 respectively culvert was closed during the rice season and thus the associated drainage occurred only during the rest of the year seepage had a large value in the summer mainly due to the large water level differences between surface water and surrounding rivers fig 5 3 5 nitrogen balance our modeling analysis showed that fertilization and mineralization were the major n sources for polder jian fig 7 fertilization contributed 73 3 450 kg ha 1 yr 1 of total n sources to the polder the inter annual variability was negligible based on the survey from local farmers over the course of the study mineralization had an estimated contribution of 116 1 kg ha 1 yr 1 for agricultural farmlands this estimate lies within the reported range from previous studies in lake taihu basin table 2 deposition irrigation and n2 fixation represented a small fraction 8 0 of n input in the polder it is also worth noting that although irrigation is a major source of water fig 6 its contribution as n source appears to be fairly low 2 0 the major n sinks for polder jian were crop uptake volatilization and denitrification fig 7 crop n uptake was the largest n sink with an estimated value of 365 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 previous studies provided evidence of large variability associated with crop n uptake rate ranging from 246 to 375 kg ha 1 yr 1 in lake taihu basin table 2 volatilization and denitrification had an estimated rate of 117 7 and 89 7 kg ha 1 yr 1 seepage mostly occurred in summer and had an n export rate of 40 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 culvert and flood drainage accounted for a small proportion 5 of total n sinks from a management perspective n export into surrounding rivers is a critical facet of the polder functioning that could be used to determine the appropriate remedial measures for alleviating the eutrophication severity downstream based on the n balance in polder jian n export rates from polder jian were estimated by subtracting n import through irrigation from the sum of n export through seepage culvert and flood drainage the resulting value could be used as a proxy for the polder n contribution to surrounding rivers our estimated n export coefficient 56 7 kg ha 1 yr 1 in polder jian was distinctly higher than n export coefficients 6 0 20 4 kg ha 1 yr 1 reported for lake taihu basin from past studies lai et al 2006 li et al 2015 see also table 2 seepage was characterized by a larger n export than surface discharge culvert and flood drainage polder n export mainly occurred in the summer and displayed greater year to year variability 4 discussion despite decades of research on nutrient export dynamics from watersheds non point sources of excess nutrients continue to be primarily responsible for the impairment of the quality of receiving water bodies the recognition of this problem invites the development of watershed models that can support water quality management goals such as the estimation of non point source nutrient loads and the examination of alternative land use scenarios nonetheless the field of process based distributed watershed modeling is dominated by a handful of models swat inca agnps annagnps hspf and hbv which have fairly similar representations of spatial variability relevant flow paths and nutrient biogeochemistry wellen et al 2015 it is thus argued that existing model structures fail to accommodate contemporary ideas of observational hydrology biogeochemistry and have an unproven ability to reproduce the complex interplay among hydrological factors morphological features and mechanisms that modulate nutrient and contaminant attenuation rates in artificial watersheds e g polders being subjected to significantly different water transport dynamics compared with free drainage systems the latter issue provided the motivation for the application of our n dynamic model in the polder jian in lake taihu basin china 4 1 model performance the key augmentations of our dynamic model involved the representation of artificial drainage as well as the water interactions among surface water groundwater and soil water in farmlands section 2 1 these two mechanisms were particularly important due to their significant impact on polder water balance and our results rendered support to our strategy fig 5 in particular the water level was decreased by 0 55 m within 6 days during june 3 8 2015 suggestive of flood pumping and or water exchange between surface water and other layers of water i e groundwater and soil water on the other hand although no major rainfall events had occurred the water level was increased by 0 69 m within 5 days during june 20 24 2016 which likely stemmed from artificial irrigation we implemented standard methodological steps i e sensitivity analysis parameter optimization and validation during the application of our model in order to identify the most influential parameters to maximize model fit to the calibration dataset and to examine its reliability in drawing predictions in the extrapolation domain arhonditsis and brett 2004 nonetheless this methodological consistency does not appear to be the norm in the contemporary watershed modeling practice for example based on a sample of 257 watershed models published in the peer reviewed literature wellen et al 2015 found that 57 of the studies conducted model validation while only 17 implemented parameter optimization compared with these 257 surveyed models the ns value of our tn simulations 0 53 was indicative of model performance that is better than more than half of the published body of watershed modeling work wellen et al 2015 we also found that dn matched closely the observed data relative to pn pn was not well predicted especially during the validation period fig 5 we hypothesize that the limited capacity of our model to capture the pn concentrations stems from the highly dynamic nature of the settling minus resuspension processes and consequently the inherent unpredictability of their net effect on the particulate matter in the surface waters of polder jian however the inferior model performance with pn concentrations is not particularly troublesome in this study because dn accounted for 80 of the ambient tn levels thus the satisfactory model fit to tn predominantly reflects its ability in predicting dn counter to many previous studies that evaluated model reliability only on the basis of model fit to observed data our study explicitly recognized the fact that complex overparameterized models can give good results for the wrong reasons arhonditsis et al 2007 and we thus evaluated the plausibility of the water and n cycle characterization in polder jian see sections 3 4 and 3 5 the values of critical processes e g irrigation and fertilization assigned during our model calibration were comparable with estimates reported from previous studies in lake taihu basin table 2 see also following section in a similar manner our model performance was also on par with the results presented by previous n modeling work within the lake taihu basin an earlier study by lai et al 2006 used the swat model to provide preliminary estimates of n export from the entire lake taihu basin and reported model fit with r 2 values varying from 0 40 to 0 85 and ns values within the 0 53 0 78 range zhao et al 2011b simulated tn loading from six monitoring sites in the xitiaoxi catchment in lake taihu basin using a pcraster based model of nutrient mobilization and transport founded upon the integration of the xinanjiang rainfall runoff model with the integrated nitrogen catchment model and the modified universal soil loss equation the model displayed satisfactory agreement to the tn concentrations at the downstream sites with a ns range of 0 38 0 59 and a r 2 range of 0 52 0 62 although the measured data were characterized by a broader range 0 5 5 2 mg l 1 relative to the upstream locations interestingly model performance declined at the latter sites with a ns range of 0 25 0 27 and a r 2 range of 0 42 0 54 the same analysis indicated that the fertilizer implementation 425 635 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and the atmospheric deposition 22 25 8 kg n ha 1 yr 1 were the dominant n input processes whereas n removal from the catchment was mainly attributed to plant uptake ammonium volatilization denitrification and leaching through runoff 4 2 polder nitrogen sources and sinks implications for management during the past decade a significant body of literature has attempted to establish causal linkages between severe algal blooms in lake taihu and nutrient loading from the surrounding watershed huang et al 2012 qin et al 2010 the simulated results of polder jian using ndp revealed that fertilization and bacteria mediated mineralization were the major n sources whereas crop uptake volatilization and denitrification were the major n sinks fig 7 n fertilizer implementation in farmlands in polder jian was 450 kg ha 1 yr 1 during 2014 2016 n plant uptake rate demonstrated substantial variability ranging from 246 to 375 kg ha 1 yr 1 table 2 after the harvest when grain and chaff have been removed the dry stalks of cereal plants partly remain within the farmlands where they are subjected to mineralization and replenish the soil n pool available for crop uptake n volatilization mostly occurs after fertilization with a particularly high rate when conditions of low soil water high air temperature wind speed and radiation prevail xu et al 2012 although volatilization does not directly pose threats to the adjacent water bodies increased n emissions are likely to elevate the atmospheric concentrations which in turn could conceivably lead to enhanced n deposition in the long run liu et al 2013 conversion of nitrate into n2 via denitrification is another major n sink pathway from the polder jian and typically occurs under flooded water conditions wang et al 2017 by comparing the characterization of n cycle relative to reports of previous studies in lake taihu basin table 2 two unique patterns of n dynamics were found in this study annual n export 56 7 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the polder jian was higher than existing estimates 6 0 20 4 kg ha 1 yr 1 from the rest of the lake taihu basin table 2 the elevated polder n export likely accentuates the severity of eutrophication in the downstream waterbodies and can be attributed to large farmland areas and intensive farming with excessive n fertilizer application hofmeier et al 2015 interestingly n fertilizer application rates in polder jian 450 kg ha 1 yr 1 were at the lower end of those typically reported in lake taihu basin during the 1990s 465 635 kg ha 1 yr 1 see richter and roelcke 2000 in the same context it is also worth noting that a recent study by hofmeier et al 2015 argued in favour of a reduction in n fertilizer application rates by 15 25 for summer rice and by 20 25 for winter wheat without significant decrease in mean grain yields seepage had the largest n export among the major pathways seepage culvert and flood drainage from the studied polder system the high seepage rate in polder jian was probably due to the large water level differences between polder surface water and the streams surrounding the system this pattern was particularly pronounced during the dry summer period when polder surface water levels were fairly high due to irrigation and stream water levels reached their seasonal minima the high seepage rate also implied that n removal from polder surface water is critical for mitigating excessive n export 4 3 potential uses of the nitrogen dynamic polder model compared with existing watershed models our ndp model effectively described the processes underlying water balance and n fate and transport in lowland areas with artificial drainage and can thus be used in other lowland polders with strong interactions among surface water groundwater and soil water after the characterization of the water budget and n cycle including the quantitative description of the relationship between polder n balance and environmental conditions e g weather irrigation and fertilization conditions the model can be used to answer important management questions such as what is a realistic reduction target of polder n export given the increasing demand for a higher crop production from an ever growing population what are the best management practices to mitigate n export based on the current characterization of the water and n cycles in polder jian or how effective can these remedial measures be given the presence of an active nutrient regeneration feedback loop in the polder such investigation will not only help water managers to identify the important factors controlling polder n export but can also assist with the design of the optimal management strategies for protecting our precious water resources to implement ndp in a new case study model users can simply specify their input data based on the template prepared for the case study in polder jian china sensitivity analysis calibration and validation for the new case study are strongly encouraged in order to establish a reliable modelling tool that can effectively guide environmental management sensitivity analysis will allow identifying the most sensitive parameters for the new case while model calibration and validation based on time series data collected from the targeted polder are critical for obtaining an optimal parameter set and ideally achieving a defensible process characterization arhonditsis and brett 2004 4 4 model uncertainty in the context of model based environmental management there are several compelling reasons to rigorously quantify model uncertainty and effectively communicate the robustness of predictive statements in policy analysis frameworks arhonditsis et al 2007 n balance analysis section 3 5 showed that fertilization mineralization crop uptake volatilization and denitrification were the main n sources and sinks for polder jian interestingly a post hoc exercise revealed that fertilization and crop uptake contribute more to the overall model uncertainty relative to the rest of the processes considered section 5 1 in supporting information this result provides evidence of the importance to further improve our estimates of fertilization rates in the studied basin as well as to design field experimentation that will causally connect crop uptake rates with soil characteristics e g texture porosity organic matter or nutrient content and weather conditions typically prevailing in the area we also conducted another post hoc exercise to connect the model fitness function f with the variations in the values of the twenty most influential parameters section 5 2 in supporting information the corresponding panels in fig si 5 offer proxies of the marginal parameter distributions and their fairly uninformative flat patterns are reflective of the well known equifinality poor model identifiability problem where several distinct choices of model inputs lead to the same model outputs many sets of parameters fit the data about equally well beven 2006 a main reason for the equifinality problem is that the ecological processes causal mechanisms used for understanding how the system works internally is of substantially higher order than what can be externally observed in fact our exercise was able to narrow down the behavioural range associated with acceptable model performance for only three parameters i e maximum water storage of the surface water controlled by the culver h c u l v e r t m a x maximum water export rate through culvert k c u l v e r t m a x coefficient of temperature influence on the processes related to n dynamics in the dry and paddy lands θ x a thorough uncertainty analysis was so far not implemented as is the case with the majority of the studies presenting complex over parameterized models like ndp that tend to overlook the issue of equifinality instead they usually strive for the identification of a global optimum in the parameter space that will maximize model fit to the observed data reflecting the popular stance that any scientific endeavour should aspire to achieve a single correct description of the reality issues related to model parametric uncertainty or even to the adequacy of a model structure are typically downplayed beven 2006 although the present analysis was conceptually consistent with the latter practice we must emphasize that our optimization exercise identified multiple local optima and led to moderate model fit improvement after 100 generations see fig si 3 in our supporting information section to overcome this problem we opted for an examination of the plausibility of the water and n cycle specifications as depicted by the optimum calibration vector but the credibility of the model in guiding management decisions about future investments to the environment can be significant leveraged by conducting a more comprehensive uncertainty analysis to this end recognizing that complex models may not be easily subjected to uncertainty analysis there is a growing field of research aiming to develop methods that effectively overcome their large computational demands e g advanced numerical methods adaptive markov chain monte carlo techniques statistical emulators thereby enabling rigorous uncertainty assessment on even the most complex environmental models castelletti et al 2012 kim et al 2014 reichert et al 2011 5 conclusions we presented the ndp model specifically designed to characterize n sources sinks and transport reaction pathways in lowland artificial watersheds polders the model was applied to a typical lowland polder polder jian in china and achieved a satisfactory model fit along with a realistic characterization of the water budget and n cycle our modeling exercise revealed that polders have higher n export potential than non polder areas and seepage may have the largest contribution among the pathways considered in our model our study highlighted the significant impact of artificial drainage practices on water balance which are manually controlled and thus can be easily recorded for example the culvert is generally closed during the rice season to keep the water inside the polder but culvert managers may export some water out of the polder to minimize the risk of flooding before a heavy rainfall event a systematic record of such external interventions will be beneficial for our model as these knowledge gaps may rectify some of the discrepancies between empirical and simulated patterns reported in our study human disturbances such as land use changes and aquatic plant harvest at ditches can also significantly influence polder n dynamics improving our understanding of the impact of these processes will also bolster the predictive capacity of our model by reducing both structural and parametric uncertainty conceptually the present modeling exercise draw parallels with viewpoints that render support to the use of complex over parameterized models even though their structure could be an impediment for rigorous and complete error analysis complex models offer excellent heuristic tools allowing insights into the direct indirect and synergistic effects of a multitude of ecological mechanisms that form the foundation of system behaviour the nitrogen dynamic polder model can be particularly useful in this direction acknowledgments we would like to thank editor and reviewers for their helpful comments

19740,excess nitrogen n export from lowland artificial watersheds polders is often assumed to be a major contributor to the cultural eutrophication of downstream aquatic ecosystems however the complex transport processes characterizing lowland areas pose significant challenges in accurately quantifying their actual role in this study we developed a dynamic model to track n sources and transport pathways in lowland polders the model is able to accommodate all the unique characteristics of polder dynamics including artificial drainage and interactions among surface water groundwater and soil water our model was calibrated and validated against water level data and nitrogen concentrations measured in a lowland polder polder jian in china during the 2014 2016 period model performance was satisfactory with an r 2 value of 0 55 and an ns value of 0 53 for total n concentrations the characterization of the various components of water budget and n cycle derived by the model was on par with local empirical estimates n export from polder jian was approximately 57 kg ha 1 yr 1 and was distinctly higher than values reported from nearby non polder areas the largest fraction of n export stemmed from seepage to our knowledge this is the first dynamic model to quantify n export from a watershed with artificial drainage network and can be used to design remedial measures of ecosystem degradation graphical abstract image 1 keywords polders nitrogen dynamics water budget best management practices paddy land 1 introduction polder is a reclaimed lowland area with manual control of runoff and water levels using pumping systems segeren 1983 it is widely constructed at the lowland areas of large aquatic systems around the world such as 60 of netherlands land surface van der grift et al 2016 the lower reach of yangtze river huang et al 2016 the upper rhine river and elbe river lindenschmidt et al 2009 polders functionally resemble to artificial watersheds characterized by significantly different water transport dynamics compared with free drainage watersheds runoff water is freely flowed through the river network within the watershed polders are enclosed by dikes with artificial drainage systems e g culverts and pumping stations during rainfall events runoff water flows into the surface water area ditches and ponds and may be exported into surrounding rivers through culverts or pumping stations to reduce flood risk compared with free drainage watersheds polders are characterized by a strong interplay among surface water groundwater and soil water in farmlands brauer et al 2014 yan et al 2016 water transport within a polder is predominantly driven by water level difference which could result in a changing flow direction through time nitrogen n export from lowland polders is a thorny issue due to their ability to modulate the nature and severity of eutrophication problems in adjacent aquatic ecosystems van der grift et al 2016 tracking n dynamics in polders can thus be helpful to pinpoint the major n sources to their surrounding lakes and rivers however the unique n transport pathways in polders pose significant challenges in accurately characterizing all the major sources and sinks of the n cycle in particular polder n transport is significantly affected by artificial drainage during rainfall events runoff water may be manually retained in the surface water area e g ponds and ditches rather than exported into their surrounding rivers huang et al 2016 such water retention within polders can profoundly change n dynamics through sedimentation and or other biogeochemical processes polder n transport is also significantly affected by strong interactions among surface water groundwater and soil water in farmlands many process based watershed models have been developed to simulate watershed n dynamics such as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 integrated nitrogen in catchments model inca wade et al 2002 and annualized agricultural non point source pollution annagnps model li et al 2015 these watershed models cannot be directly applied to simulate polder n dynamics for two basic reasons first none of these models is structurally equipped to determine flow direction in lowland polders one of their fundamental assumptions is that the watershed is spatially divided into hydrologic response units hrus or grid cells whereby flow direction is determined based on elevation differences among these hrus cells however flow direction in lowland polders is generally determined by water level rather than elevation differences second the commonly used watershed models do not include the process of artificial drainage such as culvert and pumping stations although there is ample evidence in the literature that they can play a significant role in n transport within polders in this context our study aims to address a major knowledge gap in the modelling literature by presenting the nitrogen dynamic polder ndp model to characterize n sources sinks and transport reaction pathways the model aims to accommodate both conceptually and operationally the unique processes underlying polder water balance and n transport our case study to illustrate the key features of the ndp model is the polder jian located in the lowland area of lake taihu basin china our analysis involves all the major methodological steps during model development including a sensitivity analysis exercise and model optimization with genetic algorithms our model is then used to shed light on all the major components of the water budget and n cycle and our derived projections are compared against existing empirical and or modeling estimates in the area we conclude by discussing the prospect of the model to guide management decisions as well as the potential directions for future model augmentations 2 model description ndp included five water balance modules and three n dynamic modules using a daily time step compared with existing watershed models e g swat ndp includes specific mechanisms to describe water balance and n transport in lowland polders these mechanisms considered the artificial drainage and water exchange processes among surface water groundwater and soil water in farmlands mathematical equations for the processes in ndp can be found in table a1 based on the equation numbers in fig 1 ndp comprises three n forms i e oxidized or nitrate nitrite nitrogen no reduced nitrogen nh and particulate nitrogen pn dissolved nitrogen dn is the sum of no and nh total nitrogen tn is the sum of no nh and pn ndp consists of 10 state variables 31 input variables 82 intermediate variables and 53 parameters tables a2 and a3 details regarding the model implementation can be found in the supporting information section 2 1 water balance modules five water balance modules are used to describe the hydrological processes of polders these modules were originally developed by huang et al 2016 in a phosphorus dynamic model for polders pdp four water balance modules aim to simulate the water balance in four land use types residential area surface water area paddy and dry lands a fifth water management module is also included aiming to describe the artificial drainage in polders such as irrigation culvert and flood drainage to better describe water balance in polders three improvements on the water balance modules were made 2 1 1 interaction between groundwater and surface water previous studies identified a strong interaction between farmland groundwater and surface water brauer et al 2014 yan et al 2016 the interaction resulted in quick water flow among different water layers that significantly influenced polder water balance the interaction process was added into the water balance modules using the following exponential equation 1 k e x c h a n g e k 1 h x u g t h x t λ 1 h x u g t h x t k 2 h x t h x u g t λ 2 h x u g t h x t where k exchange is the water exchange rate between farmland groundwater and surface water m d 1 h x u g t and h x t are the water storage m of the farmland groundwater and surface water k 1 and k 2 are the maximum water exchange rate m d 1 affected by the hydraulic conductivity of soil layers λ 1 and λ 2 are the exponential order to estimate water exchange rate this equation describes the water exchange rate between surface water and farmland groundwater based on their water head differences and is an application of darcy s law sophocleous 2002 a larger difference of water head would result in a larger water exchange rate fig 2 spatial variability of groundwater level was not considered 2 1 2 interaction between groundwater and soil water in lowland areas groundwater level is generally high and showed significant fluctuations over time cheng et al 2006 indicative of a strong interaction between groundwater and soil water in farmlands the water exchange rate between groundwater and soil water in paddy and dry lands is estimated using equation 1 a higher difference between groundwater level m and soil water storage m would result in greater water exchange rate 2 1 3 artificial drainage artificial drainage e g irrigation culvert and flood drainage was described in the water management module developed by huang et al 2016 the improvement of this study is the development of two approaches to describe the irrigation and pumping processes one approach used five thresholds for water levels to describe the artificial drainage huang et al 2016 this approach can be used in case that irrigation and pumping data are unavailable more details can be found in the supporting information section the second approach directly uses the measured irrigation and pumping water amount as model inputs the present study used the latter approach as both irrigation and pumping data were available section 3 2 2 paddy and dry land nitrogen modules two nitrogen modules were developed to describe the chemical and biological processes related to n dynamics in the paddy and dry lands these nitrogen modules were developed based on the farmland n cycle as depicted in the integrated nitrogen in catchments inca model and soil erosion quantification as approximated by the universal soil loss equation usle inca is a process based model that was originally developed by wade et al 2002 in this study it was selected due to its detailed mechanisms for describing no and nh dynamics in the soil zone of agricultural farmlands lazar et al 2010 wade et al 2006 whitehead et al 2016 no concentrations in soil water are determined by fertilization deposition atmospheric nitrogen n2 fixation nitrification denitrification and crop uptake nh concentrations in soil water are driven by fertilization deposition mineralization organic n to nh nitrification and crop uptake no and nh dynamics in the soil water of the dry and paddy lands can be described using the following equations 2 n

soil conservation practices equation 6 15 in table a1 pn concentrations in the dry and paddy land runoff were then estimated using the annual sediment yield equation 6 14 in table a1 usle was chosen because its capacity to predict soil erosion has been examined in watersheds worldwide kinnell 2010 and is integrated into many watershed models such as swat neitsch et al 2005 and agnps young et al 1989 detailed description of the associated equations can be found in neitsch et al 2005 2 3 water area nitrogen module polders included a large area of surface water ponds and ditches for retention and therefore a water area nitrogen module is necessary to describe n sedimentation and other biogeochemical processes in polder surface waters the water area nitrogen module aimed to describe n dynamics in the surface water and was developed based on two existing aquatic models environmental fluid dynamics code efdc tetra tech 2007 and the eutrophication model for lake washington arhonditsis and brett 2005 the water area nitrogen module included the processes of atmospheric deposition nitrification denitrification decomposition pn settling and resuspension n release from sediments n uptake by plants fig 1 limitations imposed by ambient temperature do and n concentrations on nitrification denitrification and plant uptake were described postulating michaelis menten kinetics with half saturation constants provided by the vast body of literature available arhonditsis and brett 2005 park et al 2008 tetra tech 2007 compared with existing complex aquatic models the water area nitrogen module has two simplifications of n biogeochemical processes i we considered only three n forms no nh and pn while existing lake models generally include more forms of n e g five n forms in efdc ii we did not explicitly include a dynamic representation of the nutrient phytoplankton interface e g nutrient uptake phytoplankton growth basal metabolism settling which is generally an important component in existing lake models these structural simplifications had the advantage of reducing input data and parameters and were deemed defensible because this study involved polder n export rather than surface water eutrophication 3 model application 3 1 study area polder jian 10 6 ha is located in the lowland area of lake taihu basin china it is a typical lowland polder enclosed by dikes with artificial drainage and complex ditch pond network the main difference with free drainage watersheds is that the polder uses artificial drainage systems one culvert and three pumping stations for water exchange with surrounding rivers during heavy rainfall events the culvert and flood pumping stations fig 3 are used to control surface water level to minimize flood risk another two pumping stations are used for irrigation during rice season a complex ditch pond network has been developed by local farmers for water transport and retention purposes the ditch network transports irrigation water to agricultural farmlands for crop water requirements during the dry periods and receives runoff from different land uses to ponds during heavy rainfall events the polder has a diversity of land use types including paddy land 50 1 dry land 21 7 residential areas 19 2 and surface water 9 the paddy land has a double cropping system of rice in summer and wheat in winter inorganic fertilizers including urea 46 4 n and compound fertilizers 16 n and 16 p has been used for crops in dry and paddy lands organic fertilizers are scarcely used for crops 3 2 data collection to investigate the polder nutrient dynamics an intensive monitoring program has been conducted since 2014 within the study area polder jian based on the monitoring program a three year 2014 2016 dataset was collected to calibrate and validate the ndp model this dataset included land use fertilization rates meteorological hydrological and water quality data with their detailed information in table 1 the land use and meteorological data were used as model inputs while the hydrological and water quality data were mainly used for model calibration and validation the land use data were based on satellite images the fertilization data were collected from local farmers the meteorological data were measured using an automatic rain gauge hobo rg3 m at polder jian and the national weather station liyang near the polder the hydrological data included water level irrigation and flood drainage water level data were collected during 2015 2016 using a water level logger hobo u20 at polder jian there were several data gaps in 2015 due to some instability issues with the water level logger irrigation and flood drainage data were derived based on the recorded pumping time all the meteorological and hydrological data were averaged to a daily time scale the water quality data were collected by water and sediment sampling at w1 4 and s1 3 fig 3 respectively 3 3 model calibration and validation ndp included two parameter sets consisting of 28 parameters for the water balance modules and 25 parameters for the n dynamic modules these two parameter sets were sequentially calibrated using the time series water level and water quality data table 1 the parameter set for the water balance module was calibrated and validated against the 2015 and 2016 water level data respectively the parameter set for the n dynamic module was calibrated against a two year 2014 2015 dataset and was subsequently validated against water quality data from 2016 model implementation in polder jian involved four critical steps preliminary calibration sensitivity analysis model optimization and model validation fig 4 preliminary calibration aimed to obtain an initial parameter set resulting in an acceptable model performance which formed the basis for the rest three methodological steps sensitivity analysis identified the ten most sensitive parameters for the water balance and n dynamic modules these twenty sensitive parameters were further used for model optimization model validation evaluated model agreement with an independent dataset reflecting different conditions from those used during our calibration exercise 3 3 1 preliminary calibration our goal with the preliminary model calibration was to identify a parameter vector resulting in an acceptable model fit to the observed data which formed the basis for the subsequent model sensitivity analysis and optimization we used latin hypercube to efficiently sample the multidimensional parameter space and generate 1000 parameter vectors table a2 the selection of the single best parameter set was not based solely on model fit but also on the plausibility of the water and n balance budgets relative to reported ranges from previous studies within the lake taihu basin see supporting information section in doing so we ensured that each component of the water and n dynamics e g farmland evapotranspiration and crop n uptake was comparable with literature values and thus our local sensitivity analysis was based upon a plausible base process characterization 3 3 2 3 3 2 sensitivity analysis to reduce the ndp calibration parameter vector influential parameters in the water balance and n dynamic modules were identified using a local sensitivity analysis one at a time oat method we identified the top ten most influential parameters in the water balance and n dynamic modules using the water storage of surface water h pond and tn concentrations in surface water as the targeted variables respectively each parameter value was increased or decreased by 10 while all other parameters were kept fixed a total of 2m m is the number of the testing parameter simulations were compared against the base simulation the sensitivity value s x of the tested parameter x was calculated by the relative change of the simulated h pond and tn induced by its 10 change 4 s x i 1 n f i p 1 p x δ p m f i p 1 p x p m 2 n f i p 1 p 2 p x p m δ p x i 1 n f i p 1 p x δ p m f i p 1 p x p m 2 n f i p 1 p 2 p x p m δ p x where p x is the value of the testing parameter x f i p 1 p x p m is the simulation h pond on i th

n respectively p xmax and p xmin are the maximum and minimum values of the tested parameter x a larger value of s x implies a higher sensitivity of parameter x further implementation details of the oat method could be found in cariboni et al 2007 3 3 3 parameter optimization using genetic algorithms genetic algorithms ga originally proposed by goldberg 1989 are increasingly used in environmental modeling practice for parameter estimation due to their ability to achieve global optimization kim et al 2007 liu et al 2007 following our sensitivity analysis exercise two parameter sets top ten influential parameters in water balance and n dynamic modules were subsequently optimized using ga with water level and water quality data table 1 ga optimization of each parameter set required the following steps 1 population initialization 200 initial parameter sets population were generated for the first generation of ga runs in each parameter set parameter values were randomly generated within their literature based ranges see supporting information section 2 fitness evaluation during the training period the fitness f of each individual was evaluated based upon the corresponding coefficient of determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency ns values 5 f r 2 n s an individual with a higher f value implied a higher fitness r 2 is expressed as the squared ratio between the covariance and the multiplied standard deviations of the observed and simulated values as such it estimates the combined dispersion against the single dispersion of the observed and simulated series however the fact that only the dispersion is quantified is one of the major drawbacks of r 2 as a model that systematically over or under predicts will still result in good r 2 values krause et al 2005 on the other hand ns is defined as one minus the sum of the absolute squared differences between predicted and observed values normalized by the variance of the observed values during the period under investigation although a popular goodness of fit measure in hydrology that accounts for linear bias of the model examined the nash sutcliffe efficiency is prone to overestimate model performance with large values e g peak flows in a time series whereas the impact of lower values e g low flow conditions tends to be downplayed legates and mccabe 1999 additional insights into the model fitness function values against parameter variations along with the covariance patterns of the two measures of fit r 2 versus ns are provided in the supporting information section 3 reproduction reproduction aiming to select the individuals with higher fitness values to create the next generation an individual with a higher fitness f value i e higher r 2 and ns value had a higher chance for reproduction thus the overall model fit of the individuals would be gradually improved over the course of 100 generations 4 crossover and mutation for each generation crossover was used to generate new individuals by exchanging parameter values 80 of the individuals were used in the crossover processes mutation was a randomly induced change of an individual s parameter value s with a low probability 5 both crossover and mutation processes were expected to generate dissimilar individuals parameter sets with high model fit 5 optimization repeat steps 2 4 until the generation number reached its maximum value of 100 the individual with highest fitness in the 100th generation was the best parameter set in this run 6 repeated run repeat steps 1 5 for 100 times the best parameter set from these 100 runs was compared to evaluate the ga s stability 7 mass balance evaluation the plausibility of the characterization of the water cycle and n budget was evaluated by comparing the associated fluxes with literature reported values this step aimed to settle for a calibration parameter set that effectively balances between optimal model performance and realistic representation of the water cycle and n dynamics in polder jian 3 3 4 calibration and validation results identification of the top ten most influential parameters in the water balance modules and the n dynamic modules can be found in the supporting information section the calibrated parameters are given in table a2 the water balance modules in ndp were well calibrated with an r 2 value of 0 75 and an ns value of 0 73 during the validation period 2016 the model captured the general water level trends several peak values were also closely reproduced however model fit during the validation period declined relative to that derived from model calibration fig 5 the inferior performance was due to the occurrence of several extremely high low values e g jul 21 2016 and sep 27 2016 that were not well predicted there were also instances of over estimated water level peaks during both calibrated and validation periods during the calibrated period tn in surface waters was accurately simulated with an r 2 value of 0 46 and the resulting ns value of 0 46 measured tn showed a decreasing trend from february to june and an increasing trend from october to december these trends were also closely reproduced by the model fig 5 interestingly model fit for tn concentrations during the validation period was slightly better than that for the calibration period the ndp model also accounted for dn and pn dynamics in the polder fig 5c the agreement between simulated and measured dn data was slightly better than with the tn data whereas pn was characterized by higher discrepancies which also reflected in an ns value less than 0 1 during the calibration and validation periods 3 4 water balance in polder jian the main water sources were precipitation and irrigation precipitation mainly occurred in summer and autumn fig 5 and showed a large year to year variability ranging from 1376 8 to 1506 5 mm yr 1 the annual precipitation in 2016 1506 5 mm was the highest over the past twenty years 1996 2015 with an average annual precipitation of 1139 9 mm the annual irrigation was 536 0 mm for the polder i e 1069 8 mm yr 1 for paddy land in previous studies of double cropping rice and wheat farmlands in lake taihu basin xu et al 2012 reported an irrigation rate of 878 mm yr 1 while zhao et al 2012 reported an irrigation level of 507 9 572 6 mm yr 1 without considering the water loss through ditches during irrigation period the large use of irrigation water for the polder was mainly due to the large water surface area 9 of polder jian and low elevation of dry land that caused a disproportionally high movement of irrigation water downstream the water in polder jian is lost through surface water evaporation farmland evapotranspiration seepage culvert and flood drainage fig 6 the annual farmland evapotranspiration was 491 5 mm for the polder or 679 2 mm yr 1 for paddy and dry lands this estimate was very close to reported value 632 mm yr 1 from an experimental study in lake taihu basin xu et al 2012 flood drainage had a value of 118 3 mm yr 1 and mostly occurred during extreme precipitation period as shown in fig 6 flood drainage was high 251 4 mm in 2016 due to several extreme precipitation events culvert drainage and seepage were responsible for a large proportion of water export out of polder jian with values of 703 0 and 556 2 mm yr 1 respectively culvert was closed during the rice season and thus the associated drainage occurred only during the rest of the year seepage had a large value in the summer mainly due to the large water level differences between surface water and surrounding rivers fig 5 3 5 nitrogen balance our modeling analysis showed that fertilization and mineralization were the major n sources for polder jian fig 7 fertilization contributed 73 3 450 kg ha 1 yr 1 of total n sources to the polder the inter annual variability was negligible based on the survey from local farmers over the course of the study mineralization had an estimated contribution of 116 1 kg ha 1 yr 1 for agricultural farmlands this estimate lies within the reported range from previous studies in lake taihu basin table 2 deposition irrigation and n2 fixation represented a small fraction 8 0 of n input in the polder it is also worth noting that although irrigation is a major source of water fig 6 its contribution as n source appears to be fairly low 2 0 the major n sinks for polder jian were crop uptake volatilization and denitrification fig 7 crop n uptake was the largest n sink with an estimated value of 365 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 previous studies provided evidence of large variability associated with crop n uptake rate ranging from 246 to 375 kg ha 1 yr 1 in lake taihu basin table 2 volatilization and denitrification had an estimated rate of 117 7 and 89 7 kg ha 1 yr 1 seepage mostly occurred in summer and had an n export rate of 40 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 culvert and flood drainage accounted for a small proportion 5 of total n sinks from a management perspective n export into surrounding rivers is a critical facet of the polder functioning that could be used to determine the appropriate remedial measures for alleviating the eutrophication severity downstream based on the n balance in polder jian n export rates from polder jian were estimated by subtracting n import through irrigation from the sum of n export through seepage culvert and flood drainage the resulting value could be used as a proxy for the polder n contribution to surrounding rivers our estimated n export coefficient 56 7 kg ha 1 yr 1 in polder jian was distinctly higher than n export coefficients 6 0 20 4 kg ha 1 yr 1 reported for lake taihu basin from past studies lai et al 2006 li et al 2015 see also table 2 seepage was characterized by a larger n export than surface discharge culvert and flood drainage polder n export mainly occurred in the summer and displayed greater year to year variability 4 discussion despite decades of research on nutrient export dynamics from watersheds non point sources of excess nutrients continue to be primarily responsible for the impairment of the quality of receiving water bodies the recognition of this problem invites the development of watershed models that can support water quality management goals such as the estimation of non point source nutrient loads and the examination of alternative land use scenarios nonetheless the field of process based distributed watershed modeling is dominated by a handful of models swat inca agnps annagnps hspf and hbv which have fairly similar representations of spatial variability relevant flow paths and nutrient biogeochemistry wellen et al 2015 it is thus argued that existing model structures fail to accommodate contemporary ideas of observational hydrology biogeochemistry and have an unproven ability to reproduce the complex interplay among hydrological factors morphological features and mechanisms that modulate nutrient and contaminant attenuation rates in artificial watersheds e g polders being subjected to significantly different water transport dynamics compared with free drainage systems the latter issue provided the motivation for the application of our n dynamic model in the polder jian in lake taihu basin china 4 1 model performance the key augmentations of our dynamic model involved the representation of artificial drainage as well as the water interactions among surface water groundwater and soil water in farmlands section 2 1 these two mechanisms were particularly important due to their significant impact on polder water balance and our results rendered support to our strategy fig 5 in particular the water level was decreased by 0 55 m within 6 days during june 3 8 2015 suggestive of flood pumping and or water exchange between surface water and other layers of water i e groundwater and soil water on the other hand although no major rainfall events had occurred the water level was increased by 0 69 m within 5 days during june 20 24 2016 which likely stemmed from artificial irrigation we implemented standard methodological steps i e sensitivity analysis parameter optimization and validation during the application of our model in order to identify the most influential parameters to maximize model fit to the calibration dataset and to examine its reliability in drawing predictions in the extrapolation domain arhonditsis and brett 2004 nonetheless this methodological consistency does not appear to be the norm in the contemporary watershed modeling practice for example based on a sample of 257 watershed models published in the peer reviewed literature wellen et al 2015 found that 57 of the studies conducted model validation while only 17 implemented parameter optimization compared with these 257 surveyed models the ns value of our tn simulations 0 53 was indicative of model performance that is better than more than half of the published body of watershed modeling work wellen et al 2015 we also found that dn matched closely the observed data relative to pn pn was not well predicted especially during the validation period fig 5 we hypothesize that the limited capacity of our model to capture the pn concentrations stems from the highly dynamic nature of the settling minus resuspension processes and consequently the inherent unpredictability of their net effect on the particulate matter in the surface waters of polder jian however the inferior model performance with pn concentrations is not particularly troublesome in this study because dn accounted for 80 of the ambient tn levels thus the satisfactory model fit to tn predominantly reflects its ability in predicting dn counter to many previous studies that evaluated model reliability only on the basis of model fit to observed data our study explicitly recognized the fact that complex overparameterized models can give good results for the wrong reasons arhonditsis et al 2007 and we thus evaluated the plausibility of the water and n cycle characterization in polder jian see sections 3 4 and 3 5 the values of critical processes e g irrigation and fertilization assigned during our model calibration were comparable with estimates reported from previous studies in lake taihu basin table 2 see also following section in a similar manner our model performance was also on par with the results presented by previous n modeling work within the lake taihu basin an earlier study by lai et al 2006 used the swat model to provide preliminary estimates of n export from the entire lake taihu basin and reported model fit with r 2 values varying from 0 40 to 0 85 and ns values within the 0 53 0 78 range zhao et al 2011b simulated tn loading from six monitoring sites in the xitiaoxi catchment in lake taihu basin using a pcraster based model of nutrient mobilization and transport founded upon the integration of the xinanjiang rainfall runoff model with the integrated nitrogen catchment model and the modified universal soil loss equation the model displayed satisfactory agreement to the tn concentrations at the downstream sites with a ns range of 0 38 0 59 and a r 2 range of 0 52 0 62 although the measured data were characterized by a broader range 0 5 5 2 mg l 1 relative to the upstream locations interestingly model performance declined at the latter sites with a ns range of 0 25 0 27 and a r 2 range of 0 42 0 54 the same analysis indicated that the fertilizer implementation 425 635 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and the atmospheric deposition 22 25 8 kg n ha 1 yr 1 were the dominant n input processes whereas n removal from the catchment was mainly attributed to plant uptake ammonium volatilization denitrification and leaching through runoff 4 2 polder nitrogen sources and sinks implications for management during the past decade a significant body of literature has attempted to establish causal linkages between severe algal blooms in lake taihu and nutrient loading from the surrounding watershed huang et al 2012 qin et al 2010 the simulated results of polder jian using ndp revealed that fertilization and bacteria mediated mineralization were the major n sources whereas crop uptake volatilization and denitrification were the major n sinks fig 7 n fertilizer implementation in farmlands in polder jian was 450 kg ha 1 yr 1 during 2014 2016 n plant uptake rate demonstrated substantial variability ranging from 246 to 375 kg ha 1 yr 1 table 2 after the harvest when grain and chaff have been removed the dry stalks of cereal plants partly remain within the farmlands where they are subjected to mineralization and replenish the soil n pool available for crop uptake n volatilization mostly occurs after fertilization with a particularly high rate when conditions of low soil water high air temperature wind speed and radiation prevail xu et al 2012 although volatilization does not directly pose threats to the adjacent water bodies increased n emissions are likely to elevate the atmospheric concentrations which in turn could conceivably lead to enhanced n deposition in the long run liu et al 2013 conversion of nitrate into n2 via denitrification is another major n sink pathway from the polder jian and typically occurs under flooded water conditions wang et al 2017 by comparing the characterization of n cycle relative to reports of previous studies in lake taihu basin table 2 two unique patterns of n dynamics were found in this study annual n export 56 7 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the polder jian was higher than existing estimates 6 0 20 4 kg ha 1 yr 1 from the rest of the lake taihu basin table 2 the elevated polder n export likely accentuates the severity of eutrophication in the downstream waterbodies and can be attributed to large farmland areas and intensive farming with excessive n fertilizer application hofmeier et al 2015 interestingly n fertilizer application rates in polder jian 450 kg ha 1 yr 1 were at the lower end of those typically reported in lake taihu basin during the 1990s 465 635 kg ha 1 yr 1 see richter and roelcke 2000 in the same context it is also worth noting that a recent study by hofmeier et al 2015 argued in favour of a reduction in n fertilizer application rates by 15 25 for summer rice and by 20 25 for winter wheat without significant decrease in mean grain yields seepage had the largest n export among the major pathways seepage culvert and flood drainage from the studied polder system the high seepage rate in polder jian was probably due to the large water level differences between polder surface water and the streams surrounding the system this pattern was particularly pronounced during the dry summer period when polder surface water levels were fairly high due to irrigation and stream water levels reached their seasonal minima the high seepage rate also implied that n removal from polder surface water is critical for mitigating excessive n export 4 3 potential uses of the nitrogen dynamic polder model compared with existing watershed models our ndp model effectively described the processes underlying water balance and n fate and transport in lowland areas with artificial drainage and can thus be used in other lowland polders with strong interactions among surface water groundwater and soil water after the characterization of the water budget and n cycle including the quantitative description of the relationship between polder n balance and environmental conditions e g weather irrigation and fertilization conditions the model can be used to answer important management questions such as what is a realistic reduction target of polder n export given the increasing demand for a higher crop production from an ever growing population what are the best management practices to mitigate n export based on the current characterization of the water and n cycles in polder jian or how effective can these remedial measures be given the presence of an active nutrient regeneration feedback loop in the polder such investigation will not only help water managers to identify the important factors controlling polder n export but can also assist with the design of the optimal management strategies for protecting our precious water resources to implement ndp in a new case study model users can simply specify their input data based on the template prepared for the case study in polder jian china sensitivity analysis calibration and validation for the new case study are strongly encouraged in order to establish a reliable modelling tool that can effectively guide environmental management sensitivity analysis will allow identifying the most sensitive parameters for the new case while model calibration and validation based on time series data collected from the targeted polder are critical for obtaining an optimal parameter set and ideally achieving a defensible process characterization arhonditsis and brett 2004 4 4 model uncertainty in the context of model based environmental management there are several compelling reasons to rigorously quantify model uncertainty and effectively communicate the robustness of predictive statements in policy analysis frameworks arhonditsis et al 2007 n balance analysis section 3 5 showed that fertilization mineralization crop uptake volatilization and denitrification were the main n sources and sinks for polder jian interestingly a post hoc exercise revealed that fertilization and crop uptake contribute more to the overall model uncertainty relative to the rest of the processes considered section 5 1 in supporting information this result provides evidence of the importance to further improve our estimates of fertilization rates in the studied basin as well as to design field experimentation that will causally connect crop uptake rates with soil characteristics e g texture porosity organic matter or nutrient content and weather conditions typically prevailing in the area we also conducted another post hoc exercise to connect the model fitness function f with the variations in the values of the twenty most influential parameters section 5 2 in supporting information the corresponding panels in fig si 5 offer proxies of the marginal parameter distributions and their fairly uninformative flat patterns are reflective of the well known equifinality poor model identifiability problem where several distinct choices of model inputs lead to the same model outputs many sets of parameters fit the data about equally well beven 2006 a main reason for the equifinality problem is that the ecological processes causal mechanisms used for understanding how the system works internally is of substantially higher order than what can be externally observed in fact our exercise was able to narrow down the behavioural range associated with acceptable model performance for only three parameters i e maximum water storage of the surface water controlled by the culver h c u l v e r t m a x maximum water export rate through culvert k c u l v e r t m a x coefficient of temperature influence on the processes related to n dynamics in the dry and paddy lands θ x a thorough uncertainty analysis was so far not implemented as is the case with the majority of the studies presenting complex over parameterized models like ndp that tend to overlook the issue of equifinality instead they usually strive for the identification of a global optimum in the parameter space that will maximize model fit to the observed data reflecting the popular stance that any scientific endeavour should aspire to achieve a single correct description of the reality issues related to model parametric uncertainty or even to the adequacy of a model structure are typically downplayed beven 2006 although the present analysis was conceptually consistent with the latter practice we must emphasize that our optimization exercise identified multiple local optima and led to moderate model fit improvement after 100 generations see fig si 3 in our supporting information section to overcome this problem we opted for an examination of the plausibility of the water and n cycle specifications as depicted by the optimum calibration vector but the credibility of the model in guiding management decisions about future investments to the environment can be significant leveraged by conducting a more comprehensive uncertainty analysis to this end recognizing that complex models may not be easily subjected to uncertainty analysis there is a growing field of research aiming to develop methods that effectively overcome their large computational demands e g advanced numerical methods adaptive markov chain monte carlo techniques statistical emulators thereby enabling rigorous uncertainty assessment on even the most complex environmental models castelletti et al 2012 kim et al 2014 reichert et al 2011 5 conclusions we presented the ndp model specifically designed to characterize n sources sinks and transport reaction pathways in lowland artificial watersheds polders the model was applied to a typical lowland polder polder jian in china and achieved a satisfactory model fit along with a realistic characterization of the water budget and n cycle our modeling exercise revealed that polders have higher n export potential than non polder areas and seepage may have the largest contribution among the pathways considered in our model our study highlighted the significant impact of artificial drainage practices on water balance which are manually controlled and thus can be easily recorded for example the culvert is generally closed during the rice season to keep the water inside the polder but culvert managers may export some water out of the polder to minimize the risk of flooding before a heavy rainfall event a systematic record of such external interventions will be beneficial for our model as these knowledge gaps may rectify some of the discrepancies between empirical and simulated patterns reported in our study human disturbances such as land use changes and aquatic plant harvest at ditches can also significantly influence polder n dynamics improving our understanding of the impact of these processes will also bolster the predictive capacity of our model by reducing both structural and parametric uncertainty conceptually the present modeling exercise draw parallels with viewpoints that render support to the use of complex over parameterized models even though their structure could be an impediment for rigorous and complete error analysis complex models offer excellent heuristic tools allowing insights into the direct indirect and synergistic effects of a multitude of ecological mechanisms that form the foundation of system behaviour the nitrogen dynamic polder model can be particularly useful in this direction acknowledgments we would like to thank editor and reviewers for their helpful comments

19741,carbon based engineered nanoparticles enps are widely used in consumer products due to their small size and unique physicochemical properties therefore their release and distribution into the surface and subsurface environment is a subject of concern several studies have evaluated the transport and retention of carbon nanotubes and fullerenes but none investigated the transport and retention of carbon dots cds the aim of this research is to fill this knowledge gap by evaluating the transport and retention of cds in saturated and unsaturated porous medium here we investigate the effects of solution ionic strength is 1 700 mm nacl and ph 4 9 the initial concentration of cds 50 200 mg l 1 and porous media grain size 0 20 0 50 mm 0 50 1 mm 1 1 5 mm and 1 5 2 mm grain diameters on the transport and retention of cds in saturated upward flow and unsaturated downward flow quartz porous media a mathematical model based on the advection dispersion equation coupled with the second order kinetics was used to fit the breakthrough curves and to calculate the attachment and straining rates under the different experimental conditions these analyses were underpinned by characterization of cd surface functional groups surface charge and aggregation under the different experimental conditions calculation of cd cd and cd quartz sand interaction potential according to dlvo theory transport and retention of cds in quartz porous media are consistent with those observed for other types of carbon based enps such as fullerenes and carbon nanotubes mobility of cds in both saturated and unsaturated porous media increases with the decrease in ionic strength increase in ph and increase in collector grain size retention of cds increases with the increase in is decrease in ph and decrease in grain size generally cds mobility was higher under saturated than under unsaturated flow conditions for the same experimental conditions overall cds tend to be highly mobile and could travel for long distances at a wide range of environmental conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbon dot nanoparticle transport retention saturated sand column unsaturated sand column dlvo theory 1 introduction the application of engineered nanoparticles enps in consumer products is widespread and continues to increase rapidly nrc 2012 enps constitute the fundamental building block in nanotechnological applications and are categorized according to their composition as carbonaceous e g carbon black fullerene c60 carbon nanotubes cnts graphene oxide and carbon dots cds and non carbonaceous e g metal oxide nps like tio2 zno sio2 and dendrimers hedayati et al 2016 carbon based nps have been the focus of much interest due to their unique physicochemical properties they have been proposed for numerous applications and implemented in various fields including among others medical devices and pharmaceuticals energy conversion environmental monitoring and waste water treatment and in numerous consumer products because of their extensive use their disposal is expected to increase dramatically in the near future cds are a new class of zero dimensional enps in the carbon family with sizes below 10 nm first obtained during purification of carbon nanotubes through preparative electrophoresis in 2004 xu et al 2004 li et al 2012 cds have important properties such as small size high specific surface area high hydrophobicity zhang et al 2014 relatively low hamaker constant hedayati et al 2016 low toxicity and high sorption capacity due to the abundance of surface functional groups ding et al 2014 cds possess negative surface charges under relatively wide ranges of environmental conditions and disperse easily in aqueous solution without requiring the addition of stabilizing reagents wang and hu 2014 several studies investigated the transport and retention of carbon based enps such as single wall and multi wall cnts mwcnts tian et al 2012 and fullerenes chen and elimelech 2006 however the transport and retention of cds still not reported in the literature in general it is well established that environmental physicochemical conditions such as ionic strength and ph enp physicochemical properties such as size shape and surface charge and porous media properties such as grain size play key roles in determining the mobility and retention of carbon based enps in saturated and unsaturated quartz columns liu et al 2013 hedayati et al 2016 qi et al 2014 lanphere et al 2014 for instance hedayati et al 2016 demonstrated that at low ionic strength c60 and mwcnts have similar behavior in silica sand column that the mobility of mwcnts and c60 decreased with the increase in ionic strength due to decreased zeta potential increased aggregate size decreased energy barrier between cd and mwcnts as well as other straining due to large aggregate size and that the mobility of mwcnts became significantly higher than c60 at high ionic strength due to the higher aggregate size of c60 compared to mwcnts tian et al 2012 found that the retention and transport of functionalized cnts in saturated quartz media were controlled by strong surface deposition through electrostatic and or hydrogen bonding attractions between surface functional groups of the cnts and positive metal oxyhydroxide impurities on the sand surfaces kasel et al 2013 concluded that increasing input concentration led to increased mobility of mwcnts which was attributed to increased blocking filling of retention sites qi et al 2014 demonstrated that graphene oxide exhibited high mobility in saturated quartz sand due to limited aggregation under the studied experimental conditions feriancikova and xu 2012 demonstrated that the retention of graphene oxide in saturated quartz sand increased with the increase in ionic strength due to increased deposition rate with increase in ionic strength studies on other types of carbon based enps confirmed increased deposition of cnts and fullerenes with increased ionic strength mekonen et al 2014 due to the increase in the attractive force van der waals force between colloids and collector surfaces as well as an increase in deposition in secondary energy minimum which is consistent with dlvo theory other studies revealed that the retention of mwcnts increases with the decrease in grain size of the collector as the specific surface area for particle deposition increased with decrease in grain size mattison et al 2011 despite the increased interest in cds the transport and retention of cds in saturated and unsaturated quartz sand columns have not been reported yet thus the overarching objective of this work is to investigate the effects of solution chemistry ph and ionic strength quartz sand grain size and initial cd concentration on the transport and retention of cds in quartz sand media under saturated and unsaturated conditions to the authors knowledge this is the first study that investigates the environmental fate and transport behavior of cds in quartz sand column 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis and characterization of cds carbone dots cds were synthesized via a bottom up approach based on the polymerization reaction for small molecules to form nanoscale cds in a typical procedure 35 mg of citric acid acs merck chemical company was mixed with 35 ml deionized water in 100 ml beaker the solution was hydrolyzed at constant temperature of 250 c for 60 min resulting in the formation of a dark brown dense suspension the resulting suspension was diluted with 50 ml deionized water and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 30 min to remove large particles produced during the synthesis procedure the water soluble cd suspension was then dialyzed against millipore water using a dialysis membrane mwco of 3 kd for 30 min by the centrifuge at 6000 rpm to remove ultrafine particles 1 nm the concentration of water soluble cd was measured by uv vis spectra unico 2100uv spectrophotometer usa cd size and morphology were measured by transmission electron microscopy philipps cm 30 tem 300 kv for tem analyses 5 μl of cd suspension was pipetted onto a tem grid and allowed to dry under vacuum size and morphology was determined using image j software the electrophoretic mobility of the cds under different ph and is conditions were measured by laser doppler velocimetry zetaplus brookhaven usa and the corresponding zeta potential was calculated using henrys function and applying smoluchowski approximation baalousha et al 2012 z average hydrodynamic diameter of cds under different ph and is conditions was measured by dynamic light scattering dls zetaplus brookhaven usa using cumulant analysis surface functional groups were measured by ft ir perkin elmer rx1 kbr disks waltham usa for ft ir analysis small amount of cd powder was mixed with the kbr powder 2 100 and the powder was pressed to form a thin and transparent pellet uv vis spectra of cds were measured at 25 c in a glass cuvette with a 1 cm optical path length at different cd concentrations the correlation between cd concentration and absorbance at peak maximum λ max 335 nm was used to establish a calibration curve to enable cd concentration measurement by uv vis 2 2 porous medium quartz with 99 38 sio2 and 0 27 fe2o3 based on xrf analysis was obtained from the top quartzite formation north of karaj iran the quartzite was crushed with a jaw crusher and then sieved to obtain quartz grains of different sizes 0 20 0 50 mm 0 50 1 mm 1 1 5 mm and 1 5 2 mm the presence of metal e g ca mg fe al s p ti and cr and organic impurities on the quartz sand surface could cause surface charge variation of the porous medium and result in colloid deposition on the quartz surface litton and olson 1996 saberinasr et al 2016 thus the quartz sand was soaked in 10 h2so4 acs merck chemical company for 24 h to remove any impurities finally the quartz sand was thoroughly rinsed with di water followed by five 10 min cycles of sonication in a water bath and then oven dried for 18 h at 150 c the electrophoretic mobility of the whole and each of the sieved quartz sand grains at different ionic strength and ph conditions were determined using zeta sizer bi eka brookhaven usa and the corresponding zeta potential was calculated as described above the zeta potentials of quartz grains decreased with the increased grain size fig s2e the specific surface area ssa of the quartz sand grains was determined using eq 1 assuming spherical grain shape and using the average grain size the ssa values are reported in table 1 1 s s a a ρ r where r is radius of the particle ρ is the density of the solid and a is a geometric parameter 6 for a cube 3 for a sphere brantley 1998 2 3 column transport experiments treated quartz sand was wet packed into an acrylic organic glass column 25 cm length 4 cm inner diameter with 0 1 mm stainless mesh screens on both ends each column contained 540 10 g of quartz sand and had an average total bed porosity of 0 34 0 40 0 01 water was introduced to the column using a peristaltic pump shenchen pump bt100k china in the upward direction for saturated and downward direction for unsaturated porous media at a constant darcy s velocity of 0 489 cm min 1 2 rpm which is a representative value for groundwater flow the total duration of each experiment was approximately 200 min and a column residence time one pore volume of 13 25 min for upward flow direction and 4 10 min for downward flow direction all column experiments were conducted in 3 steps step1 the packed column was first flushed with more than 3 pore volumes pv of the background electrolyte solution 1 mm nahco3 1 mm nacl to equilibrate the chemical conditions and to establish steady state water flow conditions jin et al 1997 additionally turbidity and background absorbance were monitored at λ335 and there was no detectable background absorbance after 3 pore volumes step 2 the background solution 1 mm nahco3 1 mm nacl containing cds was injected at a constant flow rate for about 1 8 pvs raychoudhury et al 2014 step 3 a background solution 1 mm nahco3 1 mm nacl was fed to the column until no cds were detected in the effluent in all column experiments the column effluent was collected in 5 ml tubes at regular time intervals 3 min for saturated and 2 min for unsaturated conditions for total cd concentration measurement cds concentration in the influent c0 and effluent c were measured using the uv absorbance at 335 nm shanghai selon science instrument co ltd model no s22pc no baseline adjustment was required as the background solution effluent absorbance at 335 nm was negligible the normalized effluent cds concentration c c0 for each transport experiment was plotted as a function of pore volumes the area under the breakthrough curve was integrated to calculate cd concentration in the effluent which was then used to calculate the cd eluting from the column the cds attached to the quartz were detached by adding 0 01 m hcl to the quartz sand under gentle shaking for 20 min to obtain a homogeneous concentration of cds in the supernatant which was then measured by uv vis and was used to calculated the cd retained in the column no absorbance at λ 335 nm for quartz treated with 0 01 m hcl in the absence of cds the sum of the effluent and retained cd mass was calculated and was generally within the range of 92 99 of the influent cd mass tables s3 to s6 suggesting that the experimental approach used to recover cd in the effluent and from the soil column are quantitative and accurate to assess flow and hydrodynamic dispersion in the column a tracer 50 mm nacl was injected to the column the breakthrough curve of the tracer was measured by monitoring the effluent conductivity using electric conductivity meter dispersivity an empirical property of a porous medium that determines the characteristic dispersion of the medium was estimated according to the analytical method proposed by singh 2002 this analytical method is based on advective dispersive transport of a tracer in homogeneous and isotropic porous media dispersivity values obtained from tracer breakthrough curves are summarized in the table 1 for saturated and unsaturated column experiments column experiments were performed by varying one experimental condition at a time e g ionic strength ph cd concentration quartz grain size while maintaining all other parameters constant 2 4 mathematical modeling cd transport experiments were analyzed using hydrus 1d code a finite element model for simulating one dimensional movement of water heat and multiple solutes in variably saturated media šimůnek et al 2008 the transport parameters attachment straining rates solid phase concentration of attached cds katt kstr and smax were calculated by inversely fitting the experimental cd breakthrough curves as described by kasel et al 2013 bradford et al 2003 supplementary information detachment rate kdet of deposited particles for saturated and unsaturated experiments were not taken into account as no tailing in the btc was observed figs 2 and 3 the use of numerical simulator for parameter estimation made use of the entire cd effluent concentration breakthrough curve and eliminated the need for steady state effluent concentration liu et al 2009 2 5 interaction energy between cd cd and cd quartz particles derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek dlvo theory is the most widely used theory to explain particle aggregation transport and retention under different experimental conditions borgnino 2013 dlvo calculations are presented and discussed in detail in the supplementary information section 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of pristine cds tem micrographs fig 1a of cds show nearly spherical particles within the size range of 2 10 nm with an average core diameter of 5 5 0 1 nm fig 1b the hydrodynamic diameter of cds measured by dls is 20 5 nm the hydrodynamic diameter is generally larger than the core size due to the surrounding electrical double layer additionally the large diameter measured by dls compared to the core size measured by tem can be attributed to cd size polydispersity or to the formation of small cd aggregates baalousha and lead 2012 the ft ir spectra fig 1c suggests that cd surface was rich with functional groups such as coh hydroxyl ch3 ch2 coc ether co carbonyl the dissociation of these functional groups imparts charge on the surface of cds the degree of dissociation of the surface functional groups and thus cd surface charge depends on the suspension ph table 2 uv vis spectra of the synthesized cds are presented in fig 1d which shows a peak centered on a wavelength of 335 nm the absorption band below 300 nm is attributed to the π π transition of the conjugated cc moieties corresponding to carbon core whereas the absorption band 335 nm is assigned to the n π transition corresponding to the carbonyl amine functional groups on cd surfaces li et al 2012 wang and hu 2014 uv vis spectra of cds at 1 24 48 and 72 h after mixing in di water is presented in fig 1d during the first 24 h after cd synthesis absorption decreased and remained constant afterward the decrease in absorbance over the first 24 h are likely attributable to the sedimentation of some large particles formed during the synthesis process the maximum absorbance at 335 nm correlates linearly with cd concentration with an r2 of 0 984 fig 1e this correlation was then used to convert the measured absorbance in the transport experiment to cd concentration the change in uv vis absorbance at λ 335 nm as a function of solution ionic strength at ph 6 and constant cd concentration of 200 mg l 1 and as function of ph at constant ionic strength 1 mm nahco3 1 mm nacl and constant cd concentration of 200 mg l 1 are presented in fig 1f and g respectively the uv absorbance at λ 335 varies slightly by approximately 3 7 with the change in ionic strength and ph range used in this study demonstrating that the use of absorbance at λ 335 to estimate cd concentration is acceptable 3 2 effect of ph and ionic strength on cd stability and interaction with quartz the magnitude of zeta potential of cds increases with the increase in ph from 15 5 at ph 4 38 2 mv at ph 9 table 2 consistent with the increased dissociation of hydroxyl and carboxylic functional groups with the increase in ph wang et al 2016 the magnitude of zeta potential decreases with increasing is under the same ph condition e g from 21 2 in the absence of electrolyte to 2 3 mv at 700 mm nacl all at ph 6 table 2 due to charge screening by counter ions cd hydrodynamic diameter increases with the decrease in ph and with the increase in ionic strength table 2 which can be attributed to cd aggregation due to the decrease in zeta potential under these conditions this is in good agreement with the decrease in the interaction energy barrier between cd nps calculated according to dlvo theory with the decrease in ph fig s2a and the increase in ionic strength fig s2c similarly the interaction energy barrier between cd nps and quartz grains decrease with the decrease in ph fig s2b and the increase in ionic strength fig s2d which may result in increased cd attachment to the quartz grains as discussed below 3 3 effects of experimental condition on cd transport and retention fig 2 presents the observed and fitted btcs of cds in columns packed with the same quartz grains under 1 different ionic strength and constant ph and cd concentration fig 2a and b 2 different ph and constant ionic strength and cd concentration fig 2c and d and 3 different cd concentrations and constant ionic strength and ph conditions fig 2e and f fig 2a c and e presents btcs under saturated flow conditions and fig 2b d and f presents btcs under unsaturated flow conditions fig 3 presents the observed and simulated btcs of cds in columns packed with different quartz grain sizes under constant ionic strengths ph and cd concentration in these figures the relative effluent concentrations c c0 are plotted versus the number of pore volumes that have been flushed through the column the relative cd concentration did not reach steady state conditions under the majority of the experimental conditions thus the use of numerical simulation model hydrus 1d to fit the experimental breakthrough curves which permits the use of the entire breakthrough curve and eliminates the need for steady state effluent concentration at the termination of the experiments cds were not detected in the effluent suggesting that a fraction of the cds was retained irreversibly in the columns this behavior was reported for other types of carbon based nanomaterials such as fullerenes and cnts liu et al 2009 the effects of experimental conditions on cd elution time cd mass retained in the column smax attachment rate katt and straining rate kstr are presented in fig 4 and tables s3 s6 and are discussed below colloid filtration theory cft has been widely used to explain the flow and transport of colloids nanoparticles in subsurface systems according to cft the nanoparticle transport in porous media is governed by interception brownian diffusion and gravitational sedimentation liu et al 2009 however cft does not account for all cd removal mechanisms such as site blocking retention due to primary minimum straining porous media charge heterogeneities colloid surface charge variation and secondary energy minimum bradford et al 2003 3 3 1 ionic strength is at 1 mm nacl cds started eluting at 1 1 and 0 94 pv under saturated and unsaturated conditions respectively fig 2a and b cds elution is delayed compared with the conservative tracer due to cd attachment to the quartz grains the earlier elution of cds under unsaturated conditions can be attributed to the higher flow rate and the shorter residence time in macro pore in the unsaturated columns alvarez et al 2007 the cd starting elution time increased with the increase in is under saturated and unsaturated conditions fig 2a and b possibly due to cd aggregation and increased retention of cds in the quartz sand column relative effluent cd concentration was 1 at different is conditions indicating that available sites for deposition were not fully filled by previously deposited cds under the experimental conditions used in this study the maximum relative effluent cd concentration decreased with increasing is suggesting increased retention of cds in the quartz sand column with the increase in is table s3 this trend of decreasing effluent cd relative concentration with increasing is is in agreement with the decrease in cd quartz interaction energy barrier calculated according to dlvo theory fig s2d suggesting that electrostatic interactions were an important mechanisms controlling cds behavior in the quartz sand column the area under the btcs was calculated and considered as the total mass of cds in the effluent table s3 the amount of cds retained in the column were released by acid treatment and were quantified using uv vis the sum of the cd mass in the effluent and those retained in the column represented approximately 92 of the influent cd concentration only 22 25 of the total injected cds were retained in the column at 1 mm nacl ionic strength the retention of cds at 1 mm nahco3 1 mm nacl may be attributed to heterogeneity in surface charge of quartz sand surface based on xrf analysis the acid washed quartz sand used in this study was composed 99 38 sio2 with a small proportion 0 27 fe2o3 of different metals oxides although the average zeta potential is negative the quartz sand surface may have positively charged sites due to metal oxides like iron oxyhydroxides which leads to favorable retention of cds onto this positively charged sites typically iron oxide particles have an isoelectric point of 8 5 8 8 eggleston and jordan 1998 thus at ph 6 iron oxide nps are positively charged and can act as retention sites for negatively charged cds the retention of cds in the column increased with the increase in ionic strength up to 36 40 at 700 mm nacl resulting in a sharper sorption front in the btcs at higher ionic strengths fig 2a cd retention in the column can be attributed to the interaction forces between cds and quartz sand surface solid water interface air water interface under unsaturated conditions cd aggregation primary minima deposition or straining due to large aggregates tong et al 2008 based on dlvo theory increased ionic strength reduces the size of the electrostatic double layer and repulsive forces which leads to higher retention in the media at high ionic strength additionally secondary energy minimum became deeper and located at shorter separation distance between cds and collector at higher is ca at 500 mm nacl fig s2cd this trend is consistent with the observed increased retention of cds under saturated and unsaturated column at higher is table s3 additionally the increase in the ionic strength reduces the interaction energy barrier between cds and results in the cd cd aggregation and the increase in the cd hydrodynamic diameter table 2 which may contribute to cd deposition by gravitational sedimentation and straining in order to investigate the effect of the straining on cd transport the mathematical model with without straining parameter was used to fit the btc fig s1 shows that two deposition sites model attachment straining fits the btcs of cds saturated and unsaturated quartz sand columns better higher r2 table s1 than the one deposition site attachment only model the attachment and straining rates katt and kstr and deposited cd smax under different ionic strength were estimated using inverse fitting of cd btc using hydrus 1d model table s2 and fig 4 the cd transport parameters katt smax and kstr increase with the increase in ionic strength from 1 to 700 mm nacl in saturated and unsaturated columns which can be attributed to the decrease in interaction potential between quartz and cds fig s2 this is in good agreement with the increased retention observed for other type of carbon based enps such as fullerenes hedayati et al 2016 and cnts espinasse et al 2007 the attachment rate was higher than the straining rate indicating that dlvo forces are the dominant mechanism of retention under the current experimental conditions in the quartz column in addition under the same ionic strength condition the deposited cds smax in unsaturated quartz column was higher than that in saturated quartz columns table s2 which can be attributed to cd deposition sites at the air water and air water soil interfaces in unsaturated porous media additionally in sum the transport of cds exhibited high mobility with a recovery 55 in the column effluent even at very high ionic strength table s3 3 3 2 ph the mobility of cds increased with the increase in ph fig 2c and d the starting elution time of cds decreased with the increase in ph under saturated and unsaturated flow conditions the relative cd concentration c co increases from 0 72 to 1 07 in saturated and from 0 69 to 0 96 in unsaturated porous media with the increase in ph from 4 to 9 the increased mobility of cds with the increase in ph can be attributed to the increased zeta potential of cd and quartz grains table 2 the increased zeta potential increases the energy barrier increase repulsive forces between cd cd fig s2a and cd quartz sand grains fig s2b and thus decreases the probability of cd aggregation and attachment to the quartz sand grains the cd mass retained in the column decrease from 18 08 to 2 65 mg under saturated flow conditions and from 16 46 to 1 05 mg under unsaturated flow conditions with the increase in ph from 4 to 9 fig 4d due to decreased attachment of cds to the quartz grains the best fit values of katt kstr and smax were obtained from the inverse fitting of the btcs at different ph conditions table s2 the attachment and straining rates decreased with the increase in ph fig 4e and f the decrease in the attachment rate can be attributed to the increase in the interaction energy barrier between the quartz cd with the increase in ph the decreased straining rate is likely due to the decrease in cd aggregate size with the increase in ph table 2 the attachment and straining rates are higher under unsaturated conditions compared to unsaturated conditions which can be attributed to retention of cds at the air water interface and air quartz water interface under unsaturated conditions fig 4 3 3 3 initial cd concentration the mobility of cds increased with the increase in initial cd concentration fig 2e and f the starting elution time of cds decreased with the increase in initial cd concentration under saturated and unsaturated flow conditions the relative cd concentration c c0 increases from 0 78 to 0 90 under saturated and from 0 85 to 0 90 under unsaturated flow conditions with the increase in initial cd concentration cd deposition was concentration dependent and the mass of cds retained in the columns increased with increased initial cd concentration in saturated 11 48 31 3 mg and unsaturated 10 05 24 85 mg columns fig 4g table s5 however the fraction retained cd in the column tend to decrease with the increase in the initial cd concentration table s5 these observations can be attributed to the occupation of the limited retention sites by cds and subsequent blocking of additional attachment by electrostatic repulsion of like charged particles ko and elimelech 2000 resulting in increased cd transported in the effluent and decrease in elution time jaisi et al 2008 the attachment and straining rates increase with the increase in the effluent cd concentration the increased attachment rate can be attributed to the increased collision rate with the increase in cd concentration the increase in straining rate is likely due to the increased cd aggregate size with the increase in cd concentration these results are in agreement with the increase in attachment and straining rates with the increase in graphene oxide concentration sun et al 2014 these results indicate that influent cd concentration can have a large impact on the transport and retention behavior of cds the influent concentration effect should be considered in models that are used to predict cd fate and risks otherwise these models may overestimate underestimate cd transport potential and groundwater concentrations 3 3 4 quartz grain size to explore the effect of grain size and thus specific surface area on cd transport experiments were conducted with four quartz sand grain sizes 0 20 0 50 mm 0 50 1 mm 1 1 5 mm and 1 5 2 mm compared to tracer cds elution time increased with the decrease in quartz diameter in saturated and unsaturated conditions fig 3a and b the relative cd effluent concentration cmax c0 decreased with the decrease in quartz grain diameter this can partially be explained by an increasing rate of mass transfer to the collector surface with a decrease in quartz sand grain size as predicted by filtration theory tufenkji and elimelech 2004 cd residence time decrease with the increase in grain size table s6 resulting in less contact with the retention sites on the quartz grains and thus high cd mobility in the columns the mass of cd retained in the column increases with the decrease in grain size table s6 which can be attributed to the increased attachment and straining rates with the decrease in quartz grain size or alternatively increase in specific surface area the specific surface area of quartz grains increases with the decrease in grain size resulting in an increased number of available sorption sites and thus increased cd mass retained in the quartz columns fig 4j and increased attachment rate fig 4k the increased straining rate with the decrease in grain size can be explained by the decreased effective porosity of the porous media with the decrease in grain size due to the increase in dead end pores table 1 this trend is in agreement with the increased retention of other type of carbon enps such as mwcnts and fullerenes li et al 2008 with the decrease in collector grain size 4 conclusions transport and retention of cds in quartz porous media are consistent with those observed in other colloidal systems and in particular that of other types of carbon based enps cd retention in quartz porous media depends on intricate interplays of solution chemistry hydrodynamics and properties of porous media and cds mobility of cds in both saturated and unsaturated porous media increases with the decrease in ionic strength increase in ph and increase in collector grain size retention of cds increases with the increase in is decrease in ph and decrease in grain size generally cds mobility was higher under saturated than under unsaturated flow conditions for the same experimental conditions the overall results of this study suggest that cds tend to be highly mobile and could be transported for long distances at a wide range of environmental conditions thus the risks of their transport to a greater depth and contamination of aquifers are considerably high even at normally unfavorable conditions for particle transport such as high ionic strength in groundwater additionally this study has important implications related to the mobility of cds in sand filtration drinking water treatment systems the high mobility of cds in quartz media suggest that traditional filtration systems may not adequately remove cds and associated contaminants appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data related to this article appendix a

19741,carbon based engineered nanoparticles enps are widely used in consumer products due to their small size and unique physicochemical properties therefore their release and distribution into the surface and subsurface environment is a subject of concern several studies have evaluated the transport and retention of carbon nanotubes and fullerenes but none investigated the transport and retention of carbon dots cds the aim of this research is to fill this knowledge gap by evaluating the transport and retention of cds in saturated and unsaturated porous medium here we investigate the effects of solution ionic strength is 1 700 mm nacl and ph 4 9 the initial concentration of cds 50 200 mg l 1 and porous media grain size 0 20 0 50 mm 0 50 1 mm 1 1 5 mm and 1 5 2 mm grain diameters on the transport and retention of cds in saturated upward flow and unsaturated downward flow quartz porous media a mathematical model based on the advection dispersion equation coupled with the second order kinetics was used to fit the breakthrough curves and to calculate the attachment and straining rates under the different experimental conditions these analyses were underpinned by characterization of cd surface functional groups surface charge and aggregation under the different experimental conditions calculation of cd cd and cd quartz sand interaction potential according to dlvo theory transport and retention of cds in quartz porous media are consistent with those observed for other types of carbon based enps such as fullerenes and carbon nanotubes mobility of cds in both saturated and unsaturated porous media increases with the decrease in ionic strength increase in ph and increase in collector grain size retention of cds increases with the increase in is decrease in ph and decrease in grain size generally cds mobility was higher under saturated than under unsaturated flow conditions for the same experimental conditions overall cds tend to be highly mobile and could travel for long distances at a wide range of environmental conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbon dot nanoparticle transport retention saturated sand column unsaturated sand column dlvo theory 1 introduction the application of engineered nanoparticles enps in consumer products is widespread and continues to increase rapidly nrc 2012 enps constitute the fundamental building block in nanotechnological applications and are categorized according to their composition as carbonaceous e g carbon black fullerene c60 carbon nanotubes cnts graphene oxide and carbon dots cds and non carbonaceous e g metal oxide nps like tio2 zno sio2 and dendrimers hedayati et al 2016 carbon based nps have been the focus of much interest due to their unique physicochemical properties they have been proposed for numerous applications and implemented in various fields including among others medical devices and pharmaceuticals energy conversion environmental monitoring and waste water treatment and in numerous consumer products because of their extensive use their disposal is expected to increase dramatically in the near future cds are a new class of zero dimensional enps in the carbon family with sizes below 10 nm first obtained during purification of carbon nanotubes through preparative electrophoresis in 2004 xu et al 2004 li et al 2012 cds have important properties such as small size high specific surface area high hydrophobicity zhang et al 2014 relatively low hamaker constant hedayati et al 2016 low toxicity and high sorption capacity due to the abundance of surface functional groups ding et al 2014 cds possess negative surface charges under relatively wide ranges of environmental conditions and disperse easily in aqueous solution without requiring the addition of stabilizing reagents wang and hu 2014 several studies investigated the transport and retention of carbon based enps such as single wall and multi wall cnts mwcnts tian et al 2012 and fullerenes chen and elimelech 2006 however the transport and retention of cds still not reported in the literature in general it is well established that environmental physicochemical conditions such as ionic strength and ph enp physicochemical properties such as size shape and surface charge and porous media properties such as grain size play key roles in determining the mobility and retention of carbon based enps in saturated and unsaturated quartz columns liu et al 2013 hedayati et al 2016 qi et al 2014 lanphere et al 2014 for instance hedayati et al 2016 demonstrated that at low ionic strength c60 and mwcnts have similar behavior in silica sand column that the mobility of mwcnts and c60 decreased with the increase in ionic strength due to decreased zeta potential increased aggregate size decreased energy barrier between cd and mwcnts as well as other straining due to large aggregate size and that the mobility of mwcnts became significantly higher than c60 at high ionic strength due to the higher aggregate size of c60 compared to mwcnts tian et al 2012 found that the retention and transport of functionalized cnts in saturated quartz media were controlled by strong surface deposition through electrostatic and or hydrogen bonding attractions between surface functional groups of the cnts and positive metal oxyhydroxide impurities on the sand surfaces kasel et al 2013 concluded that increasing input concentration led to increased mobility of mwcnts which was attributed to increased blocking filling of retention sites qi et al 2014 demonstrated that graphene oxide exhibited high mobility in saturated quartz sand due to limited aggregation under the studied experimental conditions feriancikova and xu 2012 demonstrated that the retention of graphene oxide in saturated quartz sand increased with the increase in ionic strength due to increased deposition rate with increase in ionic strength studies on other types of carbon based enps confirmed increased deposition of cnts and fullerenes with increased ionic strength mekonen et al 2014 due to the increase in the attractive force van der waals force between colloids and collector surfaces as well as an increase in deposition in secondary energy minimum which is consistent with dlvo theory other studies revealed that the retention of mwcnts increases with the decrease in grain size of the collector as the specific surface area for particle deposition increased with decrease in grain size mattison et al 2011 despite the increased interest in cds the transport and retention of cds in saturated and unsaturated quartz sand columns have not been reported yet thus the overarching objective of this work is to investigate the effects of solution chemistry ph and ionic strength quartz sand grain size and initial cd concentration on the transport and retention of cds in quartz sand media under saturated and unsaturated conditions to the authors knowledge this is the first study that investigates the environmental fate and transport behavior of cds in quartz sand column 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis and characterization of cds carbone dots cds were synthesized via a bottom up approach based on the polymerization reaction for small molecules to form nanoscale cds in a typical procedure 35 mg of citric acid acs merck chemical company was mixed with 35 ml deionized water in 100 ml beaker the solution was hydrolyzed at constant temperature of 250 c for 60 min resulting in the formation of a dark brown dense suspension the resulting suspension was diluted with 50 ml deionized water and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 30 min to remove large particles produced during the synthesis procedure the water soluble cd suspension was then dialyzed against millipore water using a dialysis membrane mwco of 3 kd for 30 min by the centrifuge at 6000 rpm to remove ultrafine particles 1 nm the concentration of water soluble cd was measured by uv vis spectra unico 2100uv

at 25 c in a glass cuvette with a 1 cm optical path length at different cd concentrations the correlation between cd concentration and absorbance at peak maximum λ max 335 nm was used to establish a calibration curve to enable cd concentration measurement by uv vis 2 2 porous medium quartz with 99 38 sio2 and 0 27 fe2o3 based on xrf analysis was obtained from the top quartzite formation north of karaj iran the quartzite was crushed with a jaw crusher and then sieved to obtain quartz grains of different sizes 0 20 0 50 mm 0 50 1 mm 1 1 5 mm and 1 5 2 mm the presence of metal e g ca mg fe al s p ti and cr and organic impurities on the quartz sand surface could cause surface charge variation of the porous medium and result in colloid deposition on the quartz surface litton and olson 1996 saberinasr et al 2016 thus the quartz sand was soaked in 10 h2so4 acs merck chemical company for 24 h to remove any impurities finally the quartz sand was thoroughly rinsed with di water followed by five 10 min cycles of sonication in a water bath and then oven dried for 18 h at 150 c the electrophoretic mobility of the whole and each of the sieved quartz sand grains at different ionic strength and ph conditions were determined using zeta sizer bi eka brookhaven usa and the corresponding zeta potential was calculated as described above the zeta potentials of quartz grains decreased with the increased grain size fig s2e the specific surface area ssa of the quartz sand grains was determined using eq 1 assuming spherical grain shape and using the average grain size the ssa values are reported in table 1 1 s s a a ρ r where r is radius of the particle ρ is the density of the solid and a is a geometric parameter 6 for a cube 3 for a sphere brantley 1998 2 3 column transport experiments treated quartz sand was wet packed into an acrylic organic glass column 25 cm length 4 cm inner diameter with 0 1 mm stainless mesh screens on both ends each column contained 540 10 g of quartz sand and had an average total bed porosity of 0 34 0 40 0 01 water was introduced to the column using a peristaltic pump shenchen pump bt100k china in the upward direction for saturated and downward direction for unsaturated porous media at a constant darcy s velocity of 0 489 cm min 1 2 rpm which is a representative value for groundwater flow the total duration of each experiment was approximately 200 min and a column residence time one pore volume of 13 25 min for upward flow direction and 4 10 min for downward flow direction all column experiments were conducted in 3 steps step1 the packed column was first flushed with more than 3 pore volumes pv of the background electrolyte solution 1 mm nahco3 1 mm nacl to equilibrate the chemical conditions and to establish steady state water flow conditions jin et al 1997 additionally turbidity and background absorbance were monitored at λ335 and there was no detectable background absorbance after 3 pore volumes step 2 the background solution 1 mm nahco3 1 mm nacl containing cds was injected at a constant flow rate for about 1 8 pvs raychoudhury et al 2014 step 3 a background solution 1 mm nahco3 1 mm nacl was fed to the column until no cds were detected in the effluent in all column experiments the column effluent was collected in 5 ml tubes at regular time intervals 3 min for saturated and 2 min for unsaturated conditions for total cd concentration measurement cds concentration in the influent c0 and effluent c were measured using the uv absorbance at 335 nm shanghai selon science instrument co ltd model no s22pc no baseline adjustment was required as the background solution effluent absorbance at 335 nm was negligible the normalized effluent cds concentration c c0 for each transport experiment was plotted as a function of pore volumes the area under the breakthrough curve was integrated to calculate cd concentration in the effluent which was then used to calculate the cd eluting from the column the cds attached to the quartz were detached by adding 0 01 m hcl to the quartz sand under gentle shaking for 20 min to obtain a homogeneous concentration of cds in the supernatant which was then measured by uv vis and was used to calculated the cd retained in the column no absorbance at λ 335 nm for quartz treated with 0 01 m hcl in the absence of cds the sum of the effluent and retained cd mass was calculated and was generally within the range of 92 99 of the influent cd mass tables s3 to s6 suggesting that the experimental approach used to recover cd in the effluent and from the soil column are quantitative and accurate to assess flow and hydrodynamic dispersion in the column a tracer 50 mm nacl was injected to the column the breakthrough curve of the tracer was measured by monitoring the effluent conductivity using electric conductivity meter dispersivity an empirical property of a porous medium that determines the characteristic dispersion of the medium was estimated according to the analytical method proposed by singh 2002 this analytical method is based on advective dispersive transport of a tracer in homogeneous and isotropic porous media dispersivity values obtained from tracer breakthrough curves are summarized in the table 1 for saturated and unsaturated column experiments column experiments were performed by varying one experimental condition at a time e g ionic strength ph cd concentration quartz grain size while maintaining all other parameters constant 2 4 mathematical modeling cd transport experiments were analyzed using hydrus 1d code a finite element model for simulating one dimensional movement of water heat and multiple solutes in variably saturated media šimůnek et al 2008 the transport parameters attachment straining rates solid phase concentration of attached cds katt kstr and smax were calculated by inversely fitting the experimental cd breakthrough curves as described by kasel et al 2013 bradford et al 2003 supplementary information detachment rate kdet of deposited particles for saturated and unsaturated experiments were not taken into account as no tailing in the btc was observed figs 2 and 3 the use of numerical simulator for parameter estimation made use of the entire cd effluent concentration breakthrough curve and eliminated the need for steady state effluent concentration liu et al 2009 2 5 interaction energy between cd cd and cd quartz particles derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek dlvo theory is the most widely used theory to explain particle aggregation transport and retention under different experimental conditions borgnino 2013 dlvo calculations are presented and discussed in detail in the supplementary information section 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of pristine cds tem micrographs fig 1a of cds show nearly spherical particles within the size range of 2 10 nm with an average core diameter of 5 5 0 1 nm fig 1b the hydrodynamic diameter of cds measured by dls is 20 5 nm the hydrodynamic diameter is generally larger than the core size due to the surrounding electrical double layer additionally the large diameter measured by dls compared to the core size measured by tem can be attributed to cd size polydispersity or to the formation of small cd aggregates baalousha and lead 2012 the ft ir spectra fig 1c suggests that cd surface was rich with functional groups such as coh hydroxyl ch3 ch2 coc ether co carbonyl the dissociation of these functional groups imparts charge on the surface of cds the degree of dissociation of the surface functional groups and thus cd surface charge depends on the suspension ph table 2 uv vis spectra of the synthesized cds are presented in fig 1d which shows a peak centered on a wavelength of 335 nm the absorption band below 300 nm is attributed to the π π transition of the conjugated cc moieties corresponding to carbon core whereas the absorption band 335 nm is assigned to the n π transition corresponding to the carbonyl amine functional groups on cd surfaces li et al 2012 wang and hu 2014 uv vis spectra of cds at 1 24 48 and 72 h after mixing in di water is presented in fig 1d during the first 24 h after cd synthesis absorption decreased and remained constant afterward the decrease in absorbance over the first 24 h are likely attributable to the sedimentation of some large particles formed during the synthesis process the maximum absorbance at 335 nm correlates linearly with cd concentration with an r2 of 0 984 fig 1e this correlation was then used to convert the measured absorbance in the transport experiment to cd concentration the change in uv vis absorbance at λ 335 nm as a function of solution ionic strength at ph 6 and constant cd concentration of 200 mg l 1 and as function of ph at constant ionic strength 1 mm nahco3 1 mm nacl and constant cd concentration of 200 mg l 1 are presented in fig 1f and g respectively the uv absorbance at λ 335 varies slightly by approximately 3 7 with the change in ionic strength and ph range used in this study demonstrating that the use of absorbance at λ 335 to estimate cd concentration is acceptable 3 2 effect of ph and ionic strength on cd stability and interaction with quartz the magnitude of zeta potential of cds increases with the increase in ph from 15 5 at ph 4 38 2 mv at ph 9 table 2 consistent with the increased dissociation of hydroxyl and carboxylic functional groups with the increase in ph wang et al 2016 the magnitude of zeta potential decreases with increasing is under the same ph condition e g from 21 2 in the absence of electrolyte to 2 3 mv at 700 mm nacl all at ph 6 table 2 due to charge screening by counter ions cd hydrodynamic diameter increases with the decrease in ph and with the increase in ionic strength table 2 which can be attributed to cd aggregation due to the decrease in zeta potential under these conditions this is in good agreement with the decrease in the interaction energy barrier between cd nps calculated according to dlvo theory with the decrease in ph fig s2a and the increase in ionic strength fig s2c similarly the interaction energy barrier between cd nps and quartz grains decrease with the decrease in ph fig s2b and the increase in ionic strength fig s2d which may result in increased cd attachment to the quartz grains as discussed below 3 3 effects of experimental condition on cd transport and retention fig 2 presents the observed and fitted btcs of cds in columns packed with the same quartz grains under 1 different ionic strength and constant ph and cd concentration fig 2a and b 2 different ph and constant ionic strength and cd concentration fig 2c and d and 3 different cd concentrations and constant ionic strength and ph conditions fig 2e and f fig 2a c and e presents btcs under saturated flow conditions and fig 2b d and f presents btcs under unsaturated flow conditions fig 3 presents the observed and simulated btcs of cds in columns packed with different quartz grain sizes under constant ionic strengths ph and cd concentration in these figures the relative effluent concentrations c c0 are plotted versus the number of pore volumes that have been flushed through the column the relative cd concentration did not reach steady state conditions under the majority of the experimental conditions thus the use of numerical simulation model hydrus 1d to fit the experimental breakthrough curves which permits the use of the entire breakthrough curve and eliminates the need for steady state effluent concentration at the termination of the experiments cds were not detected in the effluent suggesting that a fraction of the cds was retained irreversibly in the columns this behavior was reported for other types of carbon based nanomaterials such as fullerenes and cnts liu et al 2009 the effects of experimental conditions on cd elution time cd mass retained in the column smax attachment rate katt and straining rate kstr are presented in fig 4 and tables s3 s6 and are discussed below colloid filtration theory cft has been widely used to explain the flow and transport of colloids nanoparticles in subsurface systems according to cft the nanoparticle transport in porous media is governed by interception brownian diffusion and gravitational sedimentation liu et al 2009 however cft does not account for all cd removal mechanisms such as site blocking retention due to primary minimum straining porous media charge heterogeneities colloid surface charge variation and secondary energy minimum bradford et al 2003 3 3 1 ionic strength is at 1 mm nacl cds started eluting at 1 1 and 0 94 pv under saturated and unsaturated conditions respectively fig 2a and b cds elution is delayed compared with the conservative tracer due to cd attachment to the quartz grains the earlier elution of cds under unsaturated conditions can be attributed to the higher flow rate and the shorter residence time in macro pore in the unsaturated columns alvarez et al 2007 the cd starting elution time increased with the increase in is under saturated and unsaturated conditions fig 2a and b possibly due to cd aggregation and increased retention of cds in the quartz sand column relative effluent cd concentration was 1 at different is conditions indicating that available sites for deposition were not fully filled by previously deposited cds under the experimental conditions used in this study the maximum relative effluent cd concentration decreased with increasing is suggesting increased retention of cds in the quartz sand column with the increase in is table s3 this trend of decreasing effluent cd relative concentration with increasing is is in agreement with the decrease in cd quartz interaction energy barrier calculated according to dlvo theory fig s2d suggesting that electrostatic interactions were an important mechanisms controlling cds behavior in the quartz sand column the area under the btcs was calculated and considered as the total mass of cds in the effluent table s3 the amount of cds retained in the column were released by acid treatment and were quantified using uv vis the sum of the cd mass in the effluent and those retained in the column represented approximately 92 of the influent cd concentration only 22 25 of the total injected cds were retained in the column at 1 mm nacl ionic strength the retention of cds at 1 mm nahco3 1 mm nacl may be attributed to heterogeneity in surface charge of quartz sand surface based on xrf analysis the acid washed quartz sand used in this study was composed 99 38 sio2 with a small proportion 0 27 fe2o3 of different metals oxides although the average zeta potential is negative the quartz sand surface may have positively charged sites due to metal oxides like iron oxyhydroxides which leads to favorable retention of cds onto this positively charged sites typically iron oxide particles have an isoelectric point of 8 5 8 8 eggleston and jordan 1998 thus at ph 6 iron oxide nps are positively charged and can act as retention sites for negatively charged cds the retention of cds in the column increased with the increase in ionic strength up to 36 40 at 700 mm nacl resulting in a sharper sorption front in the btcs at higher ionic strengths fig 2a cd retention in the column can be attributed to the interaction forces between cds and quartz sand surface solid water interface air water interface under unsaturated conditions cd aggregation primary minima deposition or straining due to large aggregates tong et al 2008 based on dlvo theory increased ionic strength reduces the size of the electrostatic double layer and repulsive forces which leads to higher retention in the media at high ionic strength additionally secondary energy minimum became deeper and located at shorter separation distance between cds and collector at higher is ca at 500 mm nacl fig s2cd this trend is consistent with the observed increased retention of cds under saturated and unsaturated column at higher is table s3 additionally the increase in the ionic strength reduces the interaction energy barrier between cds and results in the cd cd aggregation and the increase in the cd hydrodynamic diameter table 2 which may contribute to cd deposition by gravitational sedimentation and straining in order to investigate the effect of the straining on cd transport the mathematical model with without straining parameter was used to fit the btc fig s1 shows that two deposition sites model attachment straining fits the btcs of cds saturated and unsaturated quartz sand columns better higher r2 table s1 than the one deposition site attachment only model the attachment and straining rates katt and kstr and deposited cd smax under different ionic strength were estimated using inverse fitting of cd btc using hydrus 1d model table s2 and fig 4 the cd transport parameters katt smax and kstr increase with the increase in ionic strength from 1 to 700 mm nacl in saturated and unsaturated columns which can be attributed to the decrease in interaction potential between quartz and cds fig s2 this is in good agreement with the increased retention observed for other type of carbon based enps such as fullerenes hedayati et al 2016 and cnts espinasse et al 2007 the attachment rate was higher than the straining rate indicating that dlvo forces are the dominant mechanism of retention under the current experimental conditions in the quartz column in addition under the same ionic strength condition the deposited cds smax in unsaturated quartz column was higher than that in saturated quartz columns table s2 which can be attributed to cd deposition sites at the air water and air water soil interfaces in unsaturated porous media additionally in sum the transport of cds exhibited high mobility with a recovery 55 in the column effluent even at very high ionic strength table s3 3 3 2 ph the mobility of cds increased with the increase in ph fig 2c and d the starting elution time of cds decreased with the increase in ph under saturated and unsaturated flow conditions the relative cd concentration c co increases from 0 72 to 1 07 in saturated and from 0 69 to 0 96 in unsaturated porous media with the increase in ph from 4 to 9 the increased mobility of cds with the increase in ph can be attributed to the increased zeta potential of cd and quartz grains table 2 the increased zeta potential increases the energy barrier increase repulsive forces between cd cd fig s2a and cd quartz sand grains fig s2b and thus decreases the probability of cd aggregation and attachment to the quartz sand grains the cd mass retained in the column decrease from 18 08 to 2 65 mg under saturated flow conditions and from 16 46 to 1 05 mg under unsaturated flow conditions with the increase in ph from 4 to 9 fig 4d due to decreased attachment of cds to the quartz grains the best fit values of katt kstr and smax were obtained from the inverse fitting of the btcs at different ph conditions table s2 the attachment and straining rates decreased with the increase in ph fig 4e and f the decrease in the attachment rate can be attributed to the increase in the interaction energy barrier between the quartz cd with the increase in ph the decreased straining rate is likely due to the decrease in cd aggregate size with the increase in ph table 2 the attachment and straining rates are higher under unsaturated conditions compared to unsaturated conditions which can be attributed to retention of cds at the air water interface and air quartz water interface under unsaturated conditions fig 4 3 3 3 initial cd concentration the mobility of cds increased with the increase in initial cd concentration fig 2e and f the starting elution time of cds decreased with the increase in initial cd concentration under saturated and unsaturated flow conditions the relative cd concentration c c0 increases from 0 78 to 0 90 under saturated and from 0 85 to 0 90 under unsaturated flow conditions with the increase in initial cd concentration cd deposition was concentration dependent and the mass of cds retained in the columns increased with increased initial cd concentration in saturated 11 48 31 3 mg and unsaturated 10 05 24 85 mg columns fig 4g table s5 however the fraction retained cd in the column tend to decrease with the increase in the initial cd concentration table s5 these observations can be attributed to the occupation of the limited retention sites by cds and subsequent blocking of additional attachment by electrostatic repulsion of like charged particles ko and elimelech 2000 resulting in increased cd transported in the effluent and decrease in elution time jaisi et al 2008 the attachment and straining rates increase with the increase in the effluent cd concentration the increased attachment rate can be attributed to the increased collision rate with the increase in cd concentration the increase in straining rate is likely due to the increased cd aggregate size with the increase in cd concentration these results are in agreement with the increase in attachment and straining rates with the increase in graphene oxide concentration sun et al 2014 these results indicate that influent cd concentration can have a large impact on the transport and retention behavior of cds the influent concentration effect should be considered in models that are used to predict cd fate and risks otherwise these models may overestimate underestimate cd transport potential and groundwater concentrations 3 3 4 quartz grain size to explore the effect of grain size and thus specific surface area on cd transport experiments were conducted with four quartz sand grain sizes 0 20 0 50 mm 0 50 1 mm 1 1 5 mm and 1 5 2 mm compared to tracer cds elution time increased with the decrease in quartz diameter in saturated and unsaturated conditions fig 3a and b the relative cd effluent concentration cmax c0 decreased with the decrease in quartz grain diameter this can partially be explained by an increasing rate of mass transfer to the collector surface with a decrease in quartz sand grain size as predicted by filtration theory tufenkji and elimelech 2004 cd residence time decrease with the increase in grain size table s6 resulting in less contact with the retention sites on the quartz grains and thus high cd mobility in the columns the mass of cd retained in the column increases with the decrease in grain size table s6 which can be attributed to the increased attachment and straining rates with the decrease in quartz grain size or alternatively increase in specific surface area the specific surface area of quartz grains increases with the decrease in grain size resulting in an increased number of available sorption sites and thus increased cd mass retained in the quartz columns fig 4j and increased attachment rate fig 4k the increased straining rate with the decrease in grain size can be explained by the decreased effective porosity of the porous media with the decrease in grain size due to the increase in dead end pores table 1 this trend is in agreement with the increased retention of other type of carbon enps such as mwcnts and fullerenes li et al 2008 with the decrease in collector grain size 4 conclusions transport and retention of cds in quartz porous media are consistent with those observed in other colloidal systems and in particular that of other types of carbon based enps cd retention in quartz porous media depends on intricate interplays of solution chemistry hydrodynamics and properties of porous media and cds mobility of cds in both saturated and unsaturated porous media increases with the decrease in ionic strength increase in ph and increase in collector grain size retention of cds increases with the increase in is decrease in ph and decrease in grain size generally cds mobility was higher under saturated than under unsaturated flow conditions for the same experimental conditions the overall results of this study suggest that cds tend to be highly mobile and could be transported for long distances at a wide range of environmental conditions thus the risks of their transport to a greater depth and contamination of aquifers are considerably high even at normally unfavorable conditions for particle transport such as high ionic strength in groundwater additionally this study has important implications related to the mobility of cds in sand filtration drinking water treatment systems the high mobility of cds in quartz media suggest that traditional filtration systems may not adequately remove cds and associated contaminants appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data related to this article appendix a

19742,having worked with biofilms since the 1970s i know that they are ubiquitous in nature of great value in water technology and scientifically fascinating biofilms are naturally able to remove bod transform n generate methane and biodegrade micropollutants what i also discovered is that biofilms can do a lot more for us in terms of providing environmental services if we give them a bit of help here i explore how we can use active substrata to enable our biofilm partners to provide particularly challenging environmental services in particular i delve into three examples in which an active substratum makes it possible for a biofilm to accomplish a task that otherwise seems impossible the first example is the delivery of hydrogen gas h2 as an electron donor to drive the reduction and detoxification of the rising number of oxidized contaminant e g perchlorate selenate chromate chlorinated solvents and more the active substratum is a gas transfer membrane that delivers h2 directly to the biofilm in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr which makes it possible to deliver a low solubility gaseous substrate with 100 efficiency the second example is the biofilm anode of a microbial electrochemical cell mxc here the anode is the electron acceptor for anode respiring bacteria which liberate electrons from organic compounds and send them ultimately to a cathode where we can harvest valuable products or services the anode s potential is a sensitive tool for managing the microbial ecology and reaction kinetics of the biofilm anode the third example is intimately coupled photobiocatalysis icpb in which we use photocatalysis to enable the biodegradation of intrinsically recalcitrant organic pollutants photocatalysis transforms the recalcitrant organics just enough so that the products are rapidly biodegradable substrates for bacteria in a nearby biofilm the macroporous substratum which houses the photocatalyst on its exterior actively provides donor substrate and protects the biofilm from uv light and free radicals in its interior these three well developed topics illustrate how and why an active substratum expands the scope of what biofilms can do to enhance water sustainability graphical abstract image keywords biofilm active substrata membrane biofilm anode respiration photobiocatalysis 1 biofilms are ubiquitous and advantageous a biofilm is an accumulation of microorganisms attached to a solid surface called a substratum characklis and wilderer 1989 characklis and marshall 1990 rittmann and mccarty 2001 wanner et al 2006 biofilms are ubiquitous in nature comprising 90 or more of all naturally occurring microorganisms biofilms also are widely used in technologies to improve the quality of water and to generate renewable resources rittmann and mccarty 2001 metcalf eddy aecom 2003 well known examples include trickling filters biological towers fixed and moving bed biofilters integrated fixed film and activated sludge ifas membrane biofilm reactors anaerobic filters fluidized bed anaerobic reactors and anodes of microbial electrochemical cells rittmann and mccarty 2001 metcalf eddy aecom 2003 rittmann 2007 yoo et al 2012 martin and nerenberg 2012 boltz et al 2016 why is it that biofilms are so prevalent and so useful to be both the biofilm lifestyle must be beneficial to the microorganisms whether in a natural setting or in a technology three factors explain why biofilms work so well for the microorganisms and for us in environmental biotechnologies the first factor is that a biofilm is an excellent means to retain microorganisms for treatment technology retention is of the utmost importance when critically important microorganisms are slow growers environmental biotechnologies depend on many intrinsically slow growing microorganisms e g methanogenic archaea nitrifying bacteria anammox bacteria and dechlorinating bacteria furthermore pollutant concentrations usually must be driven to low levels which slow growth kinetics for any microorganism the second factor is that biofilms establish stable gradients of substrate concentrations and microbial types substrate refers to an electron donor or electron acceptor that the microorganism oxidizes or reduces to gain energy rittmann and mccarty 2001 this is illustrated in fig 1 which shows how fast growing heterotrophs live on the outside of a biofilm while slow growing nitrifiers live on the inside these gradients of microbial types contribute to the substrate gradients that help us achieve a complex treatment goal in the case of fig 1 the goal is simultaneous removal of biochemical oxygen demand organic substrate and nitrogen through combined and spatially organized reactions aerobic oxidation of biochemical oxygen demand bod by heterotrophic bacteria nitrification of ammonium nh4 to nitrate no3 by aerobic nitrifying bacteria and n removal by denitrification of no3 to n2 gas by heterotrophic bacteria that also oxidize bod both types of gradients can be stable over time the gradients of microbial types are stabilized by the cementing action of extracellular polymeric substances eps that the microorganisms produce eps are comprised primarily of proteins and carbohydrates that form glue like linkages among the cells and to the substratum the linkages hold the biofilm to the substratum and keep the different types of microorganisms in locations favorable to them the substrate gradients are stabilized because diffusion is required to move the substrate to the microorganisms that biodegrade them third a biofilm can protect sensitive microorganisms from mechanisms that cause their loss or inhibition for example the slow growing nitrifiers of fig 1 being inside the biofilm are protected against losses from surface detachment and predation when a substrate is inhibitory to microorganisms that can biodegrade it being located deep inside the biofilm offers the microorganisms protection from a high concentration as the concentration must decrease in order to transport the substrate into the biofilm by diffusion this protection mechanism is active for any attacking material that originates outside the biofilm and reacts within the biofilm 2 biofilms cannot always do it by themselves even though biofilms offer great advantages for environmental biotechnologies they cannot automatically achieve every task we lay out for them some tasks are inherently difficult for microorganisms those difficult tasks are ones that we truly would like the biofilm to be able to do one difficult task is to biodegrade substrates that have very low water solubility microorganisms exist in water and require that their substrates be delivered to them in a water soluble form the low solubility substrates include very hydrophobic organics that we consider pollutants such as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and residual petroleum hydrocarbons after weathering rittmann et al 1994 seagren et al 1994 rittmann and mccarty 2001 chen et al 2016a 2016b other low solubility materials could serve as electron donors or acceptors if they could be made available to the microorganism examples include hydrogen gas h2 methane gas ch4 elemental sulfur s and ferric oxide solids e g fe2o3 in each of these cases poor water solubility slows biodegradation kinetics making an environmental biotechnology impractical another difficult task for microorganisms is to biodegrade organic chemicals whose structures make them intrinsically recalcitrant to biodegradation complex branching and xenobiotic substituents are common causes for recalcitrance rittmann et al 1994 rittmann and mccarty 2001 fig 2 shows some examples of organic structures that are recalcitrant the enzymes needed to initiate biodegradation have trouble gaining access to these difficult structures the result is no or very slow biotransformation recalcitrance is exacerbated when the compound also has an inhibitory or toxic effect on the microorganisms that might otherwise be able to biodegrade it 3 active substrata giving a little help to our microbial partners the response to the challenge of low solubility and recalcitrant substrates is not to give up on microorganisms instead a constructive strategy is to give the microorganisms a little help so that they can overcome the roadblock once again biofilms offer us an advantage when it comes to helping our microbial partners the advantage comes about because we can grow the biofilms on active substrata or surfaces that provide an essential service to the microorganisms traditional biofilm substrata are inert examples include rocks gravel sand ceramics and plastic rittmann and mccarty 2001 wanner et al 2006 rittmann et al 2012 they are widely available and inexpensive means to provide a surface for colonization and accumulation in traditional applications an inert substratum is sufficient for creating an effective biofilm reactor but it is not sufficient when it comes to low solubility or recalcitrant substrates the rest of this article describes three types of active substrata that provide different services to a biofilm s microorganisms the first two involve low solubility substrates the first is h2 gas a low solubility electron donor the second is the anode of an electrochemical cell the anode is a solid that can be an electron acceptor if it interfaces properly with a biofilm the third example addresses recalcitrant organics and a surface that transforms the recalcitrant molecules to ones that are biodegradable by the biofilm 4 using h2 gas as an electron donor to reduce oxidized contaminants 4 1 so many oxidized contaminants to reduce one of the emerging challenges to water quality is a suite of chemicals that share a common chemical characteristic being chemically oxidized being oxidized simply means that the compound has the ability to accept electrons which reduces the compound table 1 lists prominent oxidized contaminants and information on their sources hazards and reduced products many are inorganic oxyanions but a few of them are organics with xenobiotic substitutions although the sources and negative impacts of oxidized contaminants vary widely a common strategy to detoxify them is reduction through bacterial respiration fortunately all of the oxidized contaminants in table 1 can be respired by bacteria to produce reduced products that are harmless or easily removed from the water in some cases the reduced product is economically valuable such as elemental se and pd nanoparticles 4 2 supplying a bioavailable and inexpensive electron donor when an oxidized contaminant is to be a respiratory electron acceptor its reduction becomes possible only when the bacteria oxidize an electron donor substrate the electron donor substrate has to be supplied as part of the treatment technology three criteria determine if a potential electron donor is a viable option the first criterion is that the potential donor is bioavailable for the bacteria able to reduce the oxidized contaminant bioavailable means that the bacteria have the enzymes to oxidize the substrate and use the electrons to reduce the target oxidized contaminant bioavailable electron donors can be organic or inorganic many simple organic compounds can serve as electron donor substrates e g acetate ethanol and glucose among the inorganic donors the universally bioavailable donor is h2 gas bacteria are able to utilize h2 to reduce every known electron acceptor nerenberg and rittmann 2004 rittmann 2007 rittmann et al 2012 in some cases such as some reductive dehalogenations h2 is the only bioavailable electron donor the second criterion is that the donor be relatively inexpensive since it has to be supplied among the simple electron donors that are widely bioavailable h2 typically is much less expensive than acetate ethanol and glucose per electron equivalent particularly if it is generated on site by reforming natural gas methanol can be cost competitive with h2 but it is not bioavailable to the bacteria that respire many of the oxidized contaminants and it also presents severe handling and human toxicity risks third the electron donor has to be delivered accurately and reliably under dosing and over dosing create serious problems under dosing means that the oxidized contaminant persists in the effluent obviously thwarting the treatment goal over dosing leaves residual donor in the effluent residual donor is biochemical oxygen demand bod which is a regulated pollutant in wastewater and a serious liability in drinking water treatment m e aecom 2003 rittmann et al 2012 while it is easy to add an organic donor it is difficult to dose an organic donor at exactly the right rate variations in flow rate influent concentration temperature and ph change the demand for donor in ways that are not readily predicted or monitored thus attempts to achieve precise delivery of organic donor fail under or over dosing are inevitable problems 4 3 the h2 based membrane biofilm reactor the practical way to meet all three criteria is to use h2 gas as the electron donor and deliver it directly to a biofilm by diffusion through a gas transfer membrane this approach is achieved with a h2 based membrane biofilm reactor or mbfr rittmann 2007 martin and nerenberg 2012 as illustrated in fig 3 h2 gas is delivered to the lumen of a non porous hollow fiber membrane at a controlled pressure h2 gas diffuses through the membrane in response to a h2 concentration gradient set up by h2 oxidation in the biofilm that accumulates on the outside substratum of the membrane the oxidized contaminant diffuses into the biofilm from the bulk liquid creating counter diffusional gradients of donor and acceptor biofilms form readily on the membrane substratum since the substratum is the source of the bacteria s donor substrate delivering h2 directly into the biofilm also circumvents the problem that h2 has a very low water solubility 1 6 mg l in equilibrium with 1 atm of pure h2 h2 does not need to dissolve in water that is then moved to the bacteria the h2 delivery capacity is controlled by the h2 pressure in the lumen ziv el and rittmann 2009 tang et al 2012c the delivery capacity needs to be larger than the stoichiometric demand from reduction of the electron acceptor eqn 1 illustrates the stoichiometry for reducing nitrate with a small synthesis of biomass c5h7o2n 1 1 018no3 2 75h2 0 090hco3 0 5n2 0 018c5h7o2n 1 108oh 2 18h2o for example removal of 10 mg n l of no3 requires delivery of 3 9 mg l of h2 through the substratum a simple mass balance gives the needed h2 flux jh2 g h2 m2 d 2 jh2 q δh2 a in which q the liquid flow rate m3 d δh2 is the needed h2 delivery rate to the water flow rate g h2 m3 mg h2 l and a is the membrane substratum area m2 eqn 2 is rearranged to solve for the necessary substratum area 3 a q δh2 jh2 the design value of jh2 depends on the acceptor substrate and treatment goals it can be established by experimental testing e g ziv el and rittmann 2009 rittmann et al 2012 or by mechanistic modeling e g tang et al 2012a 2012b tang et al 2012c did mass transport studies to relate h2 pressure to the maximum jh2 for the membranes commonly used in mbfrs simple polyethylene membranes that are inexpensive and composite membranes that offer faster mass transport kinetics but at a higher cost h2 should never be over or under dosed because its delivery to the biofilm is on demand based on the acceptor loading and stoichiometry it is essential that the maximum jh2 i e the h2 delivery capacity slightly exceed the stoichiometric demand i e the design jh2 because a too low jh2 will lead to under dosing as long as the h2 pressure is not far in excess of that needed to provide the design jh2 all of the h2 is consumed inside the biofilm and the effluent contains almost no h2 the lack of h2 diffusion out of the biofilm is illustrated by model based results in fig 4 and it has been experimentally verified e g lee and rittmann 2002 ziv el and rittmann 2009 an important aspect of oxidized contaminants is that they often occur in mixtures nitrate and perchlorate form a prominent pair but many others occur routinely e g chung et al 2006 2007 chung and rittmann 2008 zhao et al 2013a 2013b the presence of multiple electron acceptors creates the potential for complex microbial ecologies to develop and stabilize inside the biofilm particularly when different bacteria are required to reduce the range of electron acceptors the distribution of different microbial types in fig 4 is a good example the denitrifying bacteria respiring no3 are the fastest growing and gain the most favorable position near the substratum perchlorate reducing bacteria tend to be just outside the denitifiers as they cannot compete as well for h2 eps is everywhere but it dominates the center of the biofilm with inert biomass concentration towards the outside of the biofilm the h2 based mbfr has reached the commercial scale and has been approved for drinking water treatment in the state of california the commercial units employ woven sheets of polyethylene fibers that are spiral wound inside a cylindrical module http aptwater com aronite technology overview the commercial units have automated control of ph and biofilm management using sparging and backwashing large scale applications have focused on reductions of nitrate and perchlorate but on going research is extending the applicability of the h2 based mbfr to reductions of selenate chromate chlorinated solvents uranium and palladium chung et al 2006 chung et al 2007 2008a 2008b chung and rittmann 2008 zhao et al 2013a 2013b zhou et al 2014 2016a 2016b 2017 the mbfr concept also can be used to deliver other gaseous substrates delivering oxygen o2 directly to a biofilm has a long history e g timberlake et al 1988 pankhania et al 1994 1999 more recently the o2 based mbfr often called a membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr has been commercialized syron and casey 2008 martin and nerenberg 2012 a very new development for the mbfr involves delivery of methane ch4 as a gaseous electron donor lai et al 2016 chen et al 2016c 5 biofilm anodes for extracellular electron transport a biofilm substratum can be a respiratory electron acceptor for bacteria able to carry out extracellular electron transport that some bacteria are able to reduce and respire metal oxide solids has been recognized for decades e g lovley 1991 what has propelled interest in solid phase electron acceptors is the discovery that anode respiring bacteria can act as living catalysts at the anode of an electrochemical cell this creates a set of microbial electrochemical cells or devises that remove electrons from organic substrate and channel the electron flow to produce valuable products and services rabaey and verstrate 2005 rittmann et al 2008 rabaey and logan 2012 rittmann 2017 5 1 anode respiring bacteria and mechanisms of extracellular electron transport anode respiring bacteria arb are able to oxidize an electron donor substrate and respire the electrons to a conducive solid anode respiration is a relatively newly discovered type of catabolism rabaey and verstrate 2005 torres et al 2010 popat and torres 2016 rittmann 2017 that depends on the arb being able to perform extracellular electron transport eet thus arb comprise a function based group of bacteria the functional group sometimes is given different names such as exoelectricigens anode respiration became widely recognized by the mid 2000s rabaey and verstrate 2005 marcus et al 2007 rittmann et al 2008 popat and torres 2016 famous arb such as geobacter sulfurreducens and shewanella oneidensis have been extensively studied e g heidelberg et al 2002 bond and lovley 2003 shi et al 2009 butler et al 2012 however continued research is showing that anode respiration is a functional capability that is widespread among bacteria particularly within the β and ε proteobacteria eet enables anode respiration in two inter connected ways first eet is a means to transport electrons from the arb s cytochromes to the anode s surface which necessarily cannot be transported into a bacterium s cytoplasm the case for most soluble electron acceptors very important to eet is that the electrons do not get lost or diverted while they are en route to the anode second the arb are able to capture energy during eet thus eet is a form of respiration an energy conserving mechanism similar to respiration of soluble electron acceptors neither the means of eet nor how the energy is conserved is fully understood but we know that both occur eet can occur by three characteristic mechanisms that are illustrated in fig 5 the simplest mechanism is direct contact of outer membrane cytochromes with the anode direct contact extends the normal mechanisms involved in electron flow and respiratory energy capture electron flow through an electron transport chain extrusion of protons h and creation of the proton motive force pmf across the membrane to a juxtaposed conductive substratum the second eet mechanism involves soluble electron shuttles such as quinones and flavins that the arb produce the shuttles pickup electrons from an outer membrane cytochrome diffuse to the anode and discharge the electrons there soluble shuttles also extend the usual respirator mechanisms to an anode this time an anode located away from the arb from the arb s point of view the direct contact and soluble shuttle mechanisms are advantageous because they can expand upon well established means of catabolism from our point of view however these pathways have a distinct disadvantage torres et al 2010 popat and torres 2016 rittmann 2017 a slow rate of eet direct transfer is severely limited by the amount of outer cytochome that can come into contact with the anode the eet kinetics for soluble shuttles is constrained by their slow diffusion rate to the anode realistic electron fluxes to the anode called the current density cannot exceed 0 1 a m2 a value too low to support a viable technology the third mechanism eet via a conductive biofilm matrix overcomes the kinetic limitations some arb are able to produce a matrix that has electrically conductivity of 10 3 ms cm or greater marcus et al 2007 lee et al 2016 such high conductivity means that the current density to the anode substratum can be 10 a m2 or higher thick biofilms 50 μm or more are achieved with conductive biofilms what causes the biofilm to be conductive is an intense research topic today even though we cannot explain exactly how arb make conductive biofilms we are certain that they produce conductive biofilms able to achieve current density 10 a m2 the reality of conductive biofilms has led to the term biofilm anode which signifies that the arb de facto expand the conductive substratum from the anode to include the biofilm itself the biofilm becomes part of a living conductive substratum the current density from an arb biofilm depends on a number of factors lee et al 2016 popat and torres 2016 rittmann 2017 the concentration and diffusion rate of the donor substrate the conductivity of the biofilm matrix the anode potential and the concentration of acid base buffer the effects of the donor are represented well by classical biofilm kinetics rittmann and mccarty 2001 wanner et al 2006 and the conductivity of a good biofilm anode is large enough that it has minimal impact on current density thus the true controls come from the anode potential and acid base buffering the impacts of buffering are thoroughly discussed in the literature e g torres et al 2008b marcus et al 2010 marcus et al 2011 rittmann 2017 the focus here is on the anode potential as it is what characterizes this active substratum fig 6 illustrate how anode potential controls current density when other factors are not limiting the current density j begins to rise for an anode potential ean slightly more positive than the half reaction potential of the donor substrate acetate in the example over an ean span of approximately 0 2 v the current density increases to its maximum value jmax and j equals one half of jmax for ean eka this s shaped response is called the nernst monod model marcus et al 2007 torres et al 2010 rittmann 2017 because the nersnt equation is used to relate ean to an imaginary electron acceptor concentration the nernst monod model repeatedly has been documented to be an excellent representation of a wide range of conductive biofilms torres et al 2008 lee et al 2016 yoho et al 2014 2015 the anode potential is a tool we use to manipulate the active substratum desired performance of the biofilm depends on balancing the pros and cons of increasing ean on the one hand making ean more positive increases the current density for a given biofilm in general having a large current density is desirable in order to decrease the amount of anode surface area and volume of the electrochemical cell which lower capital costs on the other hand keeping ean low offers two advantages the first advantage is to minimize the loss of potential at the anode known as the anode over potential a high ean means that more energy is given to the arb and this means less energy for us to harvest a second ecological advantage can be associated with a low ean torres et al 2009 selection of only the most efficient arb which makes the given biofilm more effective at eet and energy capture 5 2 microbial electrochemical cells mxcs microbial electrochemical cells comprise a suite of technologies based on a common platform that is given the acronym mxc c stand for cell which means that the system is an electrochemical cell that has an anode and a cathode m stands for microbial which means that arb are microbial catalysts present at the anode substratum the letter x represents that the platform can be manifested in different ways that yield a range of valuable outputs the x letter is replaced by a letter or letters that characterize the output other names include bio electrochemical system bes bio electrochemical technology bet and microbial electrochemical technology met what is essential to understand about the mxc manifestations is that each is determined by reactions at the cathode since the anode reactions are essentially the same e g for acetate as the donor ch3coo 4h2o 2hco3 9h 8e table 2 summarizes several mxc manifestations it lists the name the acronym the valuable output and the cathode reaction the outputs can be electrical power an mfc hydrogen gas an mec hydrogen peroxide mppc organic chemicals mesc and desalinated water mdc other possibilities exist rabaey and logan 2012 thus the active anode substratum enables a wide range of valuable outputs from the cathode while it also controls performance of the biofilm anode 6 intimately coupled photobiocatalysis to biodegrade recalcitrant organics 6 1 recalcitrant organic pollutants one of the long standing challenges for environmental biotechnology is biodegrading intrinsically recalcitrant organic pollutants recalcitrant means that their chemical structures resist attach by catabolic enzymes another term used for the same concept is refractory examples of recalcitrant structures are those with multiple aromatic rings complex branching heterocylces and large or oxidized substituents they include pesticides halogen and nitro substituted aromatics polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons asphaltenes chlorinated solvents dyes pharmaceuticals and humic like substances the problem for biodegrading the recalcitrant organics is that the microorganisms are unable to initiate the first step of biotransformation the organic structure simply persists due to their structures recalcitrant pollutants do not biodegrade in traditional wastewater treatment processes instead they exit the processes in the liquid effluent or adsorbed to biosolids both of which lead to major environmental and human health risks lee et al 1998 clearly the superior situation is to biodegrade them however their recalcitrant chemical structures stand in the way of the desirable outcome 6 2 making them biodegradable with advanced oxidation advanced oxidation is a suite of technologies that rely of the formation of the hydroxyl free radical oh which is a powerful and indiscriminant reactant with many types of organic molecules including many of those recalcitrant to biodegradation hong et al 2002 sarria et al 2002 parra et al 2002 marsolek et al 2014 chen et al 2015 the hydroxyl radical is especially adept at attacking double bonds and resonance bonds in aromatics it also attacks well where strongly electron withdrawing groups such as halogens and the nitro group weaken nearby bonding free radical reactions do not require a catalyst they are highly reactive with the range of organic structures that contain susceptible features while a free radical attack could lead to either a reduction or an oxidation of the organic target the more likely reaction is an oxidation that inserts oxygen often as the hydroxyl group oh this is analogous to microbial activation reactions catalyzed by mono and di oxygenase enzymes whether formed by free radical attack or by an oxygenase reaction the hydroxylated organics normally are readily attacked by microbial enzymes once able to initiate biotransformation the microorganisms can oxidize the downstream products using the usual dehydrogenation and hydroxylation reactions which yield electrons and energy to fuel biomass growth and maintenance rittmann and mccarty 2001 rittmann et al 1994 bai et al 2015 chen et al 2016a 2016b while advanced oxidation is a logical pre treatment before biodegradation for recalcitrant organic pollutants its realization has turned out to difficult due to two complications first generating free radicals is an energy intensive process that incurs important economic cost thus it is desirable to limit the amount of free radical attack to the minimum needed to transform the recalcitrant organic to one that can initiate biotransformation since oh is such a powerful and indiscriminant reactant limiting attack to the introduction of say only one or two oh groups has proven to be impractical too much advanced oxidation occurs and this leads to high costs and the second complication second excessive free radical attack can lead to the formation of undesired compounds ones that are themselves toxic to the microorganisms or that combine to form insoluble precipitates that are even more resistant to biodegradation marsolek et al 2014 these complications have thwarted commercial scale the development of advanced oxidation followed by biodegradation 6 3 intimately coupled photobiocatalysis enabling and protecting at the same time sequencing advanced oxidation with biodegradation has proven to be difficult because the free radical attack cannot be controlled well enough on its own what is needed is microorganism based control the concept is that the microorganisms biodegrade a biodegradable product as soon as it is generated by free radical attack this avoids over attack that leads to production of toxic or non available products and to excessive energy and money costs microorganisms based control requires that the microorganisms be present at the point of advanced oxidation how can that be possible advanced oxidation is used to kill microorganisms since oh also attacks the microorganisms marsolek et al 2008 despite the apparent contradiction of having advanced oxidation and biodegradation occur together at the same time and in the same reactor it is possible by exploiting an active biofilm substratum through the strategy of intimately coupled photobiocatalysis or icpb in icpb a photocatalyst usually titanium dioxide tio2 is bonded to the outside of special macroporous biofilm substrata fig 7 a shows how intimate coupling works the exterior of the substratum is illuminated with ultra violet uv light which is absorbed by the tio2 to generate oh the free radicals then react with recalcitrant organic molecules in the bulk liquid when biodegradable products are generated they diffuse immediately into the interior of the macroporous substratum where biofilm bacteria are present to biodegrade the biodegradable products by being inside the macroporous susbstratum the biofilm is protected from the biocidal effects of the uv light and the oh radicals icpb has been demonstrated in a photocatalytic circulating bed biofilm reactor pcbbr marsolek et al 2008 li et al 2011 2012a 2012b for the biodegradation of trichlorophenols and dyes fig 7b summarizes sample results that show almost total loss of reactive black 5 a dye and 60 removal of chemical oxygen demand cod during illumination of the macroporous substratum in the pcbbr photocatalysis was responsible for the loss of the dye but biodegradation brought about most of the cod removal all of the pcbbr results document that icpb makes it possible to use photocatalysis to promote a small degree of advanced oxidation that makes recalcitrant organic pollutants readily biodegradable icpb also has been documented in other reactor configurations that protect the biofilm yan et al 2012 wen et al 2012 yang et al 2015 pan et al 2015 chen et al 2015 tang et al 2015 bai et al 2015 xiong et al 2017 recalcitrant compounds successfully removed and mineralized by icpb include sulfamethoxazole dinitrotoluene nitrobenzene sulfadiazine dimethyl phthalate pyridine quinoline and tetracycline while details of the reactor configuration can vary the key is having a biofilm substratum that is doubly active it enables photocatalysis to generate donor substrate and protects the bacteria at the same time 7 concluding remarks the inherent advantages of biofilm processes can be expanded even further when the biofilm s substratum is active three examples demonstrate the concept and the benefits of using actives substrata the mbfr makes it possible to deliver a low solubility electron donor h2 gas directly to a biofilm active in reducing one or several oxidized water pollutants multiple reduction reactions and 100 donor utilization efficiency are made possible by the on demand delivery of h2 by its diffusion through bubbleless gas transfer membranes the biofilm anode in an mxc creates a versatile platform for oxidizing organic pollutants and using the electrons to generate valuable products including electrical power h2 gas and h2o2 the anode potential provides a sensitive tool for controlling the microbial ecology and the current density of the biofilm anode icpb can overcome intrinsic recalcitrance of organic pollutants by using an active substratum that simultaneously enables biodegradation and protects the biofilm the macroporous substratum is doubly active because it houses the photocatalyst on its exterior and protects the biofilm from uv light and free radicals in its interior acknowledgements dr rittmann acknowledges the invaluable contributions of many colleagues they are too many to list here but they can be identified as co authors of

19742,having worked with biofilms since the 1970s i know that they are ubiquitous in nature of great value in water technology and scientifically fascinating biofilms are naturally able to remove bod transform n generate methane and biodegrade micropollutants what i also discovered is that biofilms can do a lot more for us in terms of providing environmental services if we give them a bit of help here i explore how we can use active substrata to enable our biofilm partners to provide particularly challenging environmental services in particular i delve into three examples in which an active substratum makes it possible for a biofilm to accomplish a task that otherwise seems impossible the first example is the delivery of hydrogen gas h2 as an electron donor to drive the reduction and detoxification of the rising number of oxidized contaminant e g perchlorate selenate chromate chlorinated solvents and more the active substratum is a gas transfer membrane that delivers h2 directly to the biofilm in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr which makes it possible to deliver a low solubility gaseous substrate with 100 efficiency the second example is the biofilm anode of a microbial electrochemical cell mxc here the anode is the electron acceptor for anode respiring bacteria which liberate electrons from organic compounds and send them ultimately to a cathode where we can harvest valuable products or services the anode s potential is a sensitive tool for managing the microbial ecology and reaction kinetics of the biofilm anode the third example is intimately coupled photobiocatalysis icpb in which we use photocatalysis to enable the biodegradation of intrinsically recalcitrant organic pollutants photocatalysis transforms the recalcitrant organics just enough so that the products are rapidly biodegradable substrates for bacteria in a nearby biofilm the macroporous substratum which houses the photocatalyst on its exterior actively provides donor substrate and protects the biofilm from uv light and free radicals in its interior these three well developed topics illustrate how and why an active substratum expands the scope of what biofilms can do to enhance water sustainability graphical abstract image keywords biofilm active substrata membrane biofilm anode respiration photobiocatalysis 1 biofilms are ubiquitous and advantageous a biofilm is an accumulation of microorganisms attached to a solid surface called a substratum characklis and wilderer 1989 characklis and marshall 1990 rittmann and mccarty 2001 wanner et al 2006 biofilms are ubiquitous in nature comprising 90 or more of all naturally occurring microorganisms biofilms also are widely used in technologies to improve the quality of water and to generate renewable resources rittmann and mccarty 2001 metcalf eddy aecom 2003 well known examples include trickling filters biological towers fixed and moving bed biofilters integrated fixed film and activated sludge ifas membrane biofilm reactors anaerobic filters fluidized bed anaerobic reactors and anodes of microbial electrochemical cells rittmann and mccarty 2001 metcalf eddy aecom 2003 rittmann 2007 yoo et al 2012 martin and nerenberg 2012 boltz et al 2016 why is it that biofilms are so prevalent and so useful to be both the biofilm lifestyle must be beneficial to the microorganisms whether in a natural setting or in a technology three factors explain why biofilms work so well for the microorganisms and for us in environmental biotechnologies the first factor is that a biofilm is an excellent means to retain microorganisms for treatment technology retention is of the utmost importance when critically important microorganisms are slow growers environmental biotechnologies depend on many intrinsically slow growing microorganisms e g methanogenic archaea nitrifying bacteria anammox bacteria and dechlorinating bacteria furthermore pollutant concentrations usually must be driven to low levels which slow growth kinetics for any microorganism the second factor is that biofilms establish stable gradients of substrate concentrations and microbial types substrate refers to an electron donor or electron acceptor that the microorganism oxidizes or reduces to gain energy rittmann and mccarty 2001 this is illustrated in fig 1 which shows how fast growing heterotrophs live on the outside of a biofilm while slow growing nitrifiers live on the inside these gradients of microbial types contribute to the substrate gradients that help us achieve a complex treatment goal in the case of fig 1 the goal is simultaneous removal of biochemical oxygen demand organic substrate and nitrogen through combined and spatially organized reactions aerobic oxidation of biochemical oxygen demand bod by heterotrophic bacteria nitrification of ammonium nh4 to nitrate no3 by aerobic nitrifying bacteria and n removal by denitrification of no3 to n2 gas by heterotrophic bacteria that also oxidize bod both types of gradients can be stable over time the gradients of microbial types are stabilized by the cementing action of extracellular polymeric substances eps that the microorganisms produce eps are comprised primarily of proteins and carbohydrates that form glue like linkages among the cells and to the substratum the linkages hold the biofilm to the substratum and keep the different types of microorganisms in locations favorable to them the substrate gradients are stabilized because diffusion is required to move the substrate to the microorganisms that biodegrade them third a biofilm can protect sensitive microorganisms from mechanisms that cause their loss or inhibition for example the slow growing nitrifiers of fig 1 being inside the biofilm are protected against losses from surface detachment and predation when a substrate is inhibitory to microorganisms that can biodegrade it being located deep inside the biofilm offers the microorganisms protection from a high concentration as the concentration must decrease in order to transport the substrate into the biofilm by diffusion this protection mechanism is active for any attacking material that originates outside the biofilm and reacts within the biofilm 2 biofilms cannot always do it by themselves even though biofilms offer great advantages for environmental biotechnologies they cannot automatically achieve every task we lay out for them some tasks are inherently difficult for microorganisms those difficult tasks are ones that we truly would like the biofilm to be able to do one difficult task is to biodegrade substrates that have very low water solubility microorganisms exist in water and require that their substrates be delivered to them in a water soluble form the low solubility substrates include very hydrophobic organics that we consider pollutants such as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and residual petroleum hydrocarbons after weathering rittmann et al 1994 seagren et al 1994 rittmann and mccarty 2001 chen et al 2016a 2016b other low solubility materials could serve as electron donors or acceptors if they could be made available to the microorganism examples include hydrogen gas h2 methane gas ch4 elemental sulfur s and ferric oxide solids e g fe2o3 in each of these cases poor water solubility slows biodegradation kinetics making an environmental biotechnology impractical another difficult task for microorganisms is to biodegrade organic chemicals whose structures make them intrinsically recalcitrant to biodegradation complex branching and xenobiotic substituents are common causes for recalcitrance rittmann et al 1994 rittmann and mccarty 2001 fig 2 shows some examples of organic structures that are recalcitrant the enzymes needed to initiate biodegradation have trouble gaining access to these difficult structures the result is no or very slow biotransformation recalcitrance is exacerbated when the compound also has an inhibitory or toxic effect on the microorganisms that might otherwise be able to biodegrade it 3 active substrata giving a little help to our microbial partners the response to the challenge of low solubility and recalcitrant substrates is not to give up on microorganisms instead a constructive strategy is to give the microorganisms a little help so that they can overcome the roadblock once again biofilms offer us an advantage when it comes to helping our microbial partners the advantage comes about because we can grow the biofilms on active substrata or surfaces that provide an essential service to the microorganisms traditional biofilm substrata are inert examples include rocks gravel sand ceramics and plastic rittmann and mccarty 2001 wanner et al 2006 rittmann et al 2012 they are widely available and inexpensive means to provide a surface for colonization and accumulation in traditional applications an inert substratum is sufficient for creating an effective biofilm reactor but it is not sufficient when it comes to low solubility or recalcitrant substrates the rest of this article describes three types of active substrata that provide different services to a biofilm s microorganisms the first two involve low solubility substrates the first is h2 gas a low solubility electron donor the second is the anode of an electrochemical cell the anode is a solid that can be an electron acceptor if it interfaces properly with a biofilm the third example addresses recalcitrant organics and a surface that transforms the recalcitrant molecules to ones that are biodegradable by the biofilm 4 using h2 gas as an electron donor to reduce oxidized contaminants 4 1 so many oxidized contaminants to reduce one of the emerging challenges to water quality is a suite of chemicals that share a common chemical characteristic being chemically oxidized being oxidized simply means that the compound has the ability to accept electrons which reduces the compound table 1 lists prominent oxidized contaminants and information on their sources hazards and reduced products many are inorganic oxyanions but a few of them are organics with xenobiotic substitutions although the sources and negative impacts of oxidized contaminants vary widely a common strategy to detoxify them is reduction through bacterial respiration fortunately all of the oxidized contaminants in table 1 can be respired by bacteria to produce reduced products that are harmless or easily removed from the water in some cases the reduced product is economically valuable such as elemental se and pd nanoparticles 4 2 supplying a bioavailable and inexpensive electron donor when an oxidized contaminant is to be a respiratory electron acceptor its reduction becomes possible only when the bacteria oxidize an electron donor substrate the electron donor substrate has to be supplied as part of the treatment technology three criteria determine if a potential electron donor is a viable option the first criterion is that the potential donor is bioavailable for the bacteria able to reduce the oxidized contaminant bioavailable means that the bacteria have the enzymes to oxidize the substrate and use the electrons to reduce the target oxidized contaminant bioavailable electron donors can be organic or inorganic many simple organic compounds can serve as electron donor substrates e g acetate ethanol and glucose among the inorganic donors the universally bioavailable donor is h2 gas bacteria are able to utilize h2 to reduce every known electron acceptor nerenberg and rittmann 2004 rittmann 2007 rittmann et al 2012 in some cases such as some reductive dehalogenations h2 is the only bioavailable electron donor the second criterion is that the donor be relatively inexpensive since it has to be supplied among the simple electron donors that are widely bioavailable h2 typically is much less expensive than acetate ethanol and glucose per electron equivalent particularly if it is generated on site by reforming natural gas methanol can be cost competitive with h2 but it is not bioavailable to the bacteria that respire many of the oxidized contaminants and it also presents severe handling and human toxicity risks third the electron donor has to be delivered accurately and reliably under dosing and over dosing create serious problems under dosing means that the oxidized contaminant persists in the effluent obviously thwarting the treatment goal over dosing leaves residual donor in the effluent residual donor is biochemical oxygen demand bod which is a regulated pollutant in wastewater and a serious liability in drinking water treatment m e aecom 2003 rittmann et al 2012 while it is easy to add an organic donor it is difficult to dose an organic donor at exactly the right rate variations in flow rate influent concentration temperature and ph change the demand for donor in ways that are not readily predicted or monitored thus attempts to achieve precise delivery of organic donor fail under or over dosing are inevitable problems 4 3 the h2 based membrane biofilm reactor the practical way to meet all three criteria is to use h2 gas as the electron donor and deliver it directly to a biofilm by diffusion through a gas transfer membrane this approach is achieved with a h2 based membrane biofilm reactor or mbfr rittmann 2007 martin and nerenberg 2012 as illustrated in fig 3 h2 gas is delivered to the lumen of a non porous hollow fiber membrane at a controlled pressure h2 gas diffuses through the membrane in response to a h2 concentration gradient set up by h2 oxidation in the biofilm that accumulates on the outside substratum of the membrane the oxidized contaminant diffuses into the biofilm from the bulk liquid creating counter diffusional gradients of donor and acceptor biofilms form readily on the membrane substratum since the substratum is the source of the bacteria s donor substrate delivering h2 directly into the biofilm also circumvents the problem that h2 has a very low water solubility 1 6 mg l in equilibrium with 1 atm of pure h2 h2 does not need to dissolve in water that is then moved to the bacteria the h2 delivery capacity is controlled by the h2 pressure in the lumen ziv el and rittmann 2009 tang et al 2012c the delivery capacity needs to be larger than the stoichiometric demand from reduction of the electron acceptor eqn 1 illustrates the stoichiometry for reducing nitrate with a small synthesis of biomass c5h7o2n 1 1 018no3 2 75h2 0 090hco3 0 5n2 0 018c5h7o2n 1 108oh 2 18h2o for example removal of 10 mg n l of no3 requires delivery of 3 9 mg l of h2 through the substratum a simple mass balance gives the needed h2 flux jh2 g h2 m2 d 2 jh2 q δh2 a in which q the liquid flow rate m3 d δh2 is the needed h2 delivery rate to the water flow rate g h2 m3 mg h2 l and a is the membrane substratum area m2 eqn 2 is rearranged to solve for the necessary substratum area 3 a q δh2 jh2 the design value of jh2 depends on the acceptor substrate and treatment goals it can be established by experimental testing e g ziv el and rittmann 2009 rittmann et al 2012 or by mechanistic modeling e g tang et al 2012a 2012b tang et al 2012c did mass transport studies to relate h2 pressure to the maximum jh2 for the membranes commonly used in mbfrs simple polyethylene membranes that are inexpensive and composite membranes that offer faster mass transport kinetics but at a higher cost h2 should never be over or under dosed because its delivery to the biofilm is on demand based on the acceptor loading and stoichiometry it is essential that the maximum jh2 i e the h2 delivery capacity slightly exceed the stoichiometric demand i e the design jh2 because a too low jh2 will lead to under dosing as long as the h2 pressure is not far in excess of that needed to provide the design jh2 all of the h2 is consumed inside the biofilm and the effluent contains almost no h2 the lack of h2 diffusion out of the biofilm is illustrated by model based results in fig 4 and it has been experimentally verified e g lee and rittmann 2002 ziv el and rittmann 2009 an important aspect of oxidized contaminants is that they often occur in mixtures nitrate and perchlorate form a prominent pair but many others occur routinely e g chung et al 2006 2007 chung and rittmann 2008 zhao et al 2013a 2013b the presence of multiple electron acceptors creates the potential for complex microbial ecologies to develop and stabilize inside the biofilm particularly when different bacteria are required to reduce the range of electron acceptors the distribution of different microbial types in fig 4 is a good example the denitrifying bacteria respiring no3 are the fastest growing and gain the most favorable position near the substratum perchlorate reducing bacteria tend to be just outside the denitifiers as they cannot compete as well for h2 eps is everywhere but it dominates the center of the biofilm with inert biomass concentration towards the outside of the biofilm the h2 based mbfr has reached the commercial scale and has been approved for drinking water treatment in the state of california the commercial units employ woven sheets of polyethylene fibers that are spiral wound inside a cylindrical module http aptwater com aronite technology overview the commercial units have automated control of ph and biofilm management using sparging and backwashing large scale applications have focused on reductions of nitrate and perchlorate but on going research is extending the applicability of the h2 based mbfr to reductions of selenate chromate chlorinated solvents uranium and palladium chung et al 2006 chung et al 2007 2008a 2008b chung and rittmann 2008 zhao et al 2013a 2013b zhou et al 2014 2016a 2016b 2017 the mbfr concept also can be used to deliver other gaseous substrates delivering oxygen o2 directly to a biofilm has a long history e g timberlake et al 1988 pankhania et al 1994 1999 more recently the o2 based mbfr often called a membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr has been commercialized syron and casey 2008 martin and nerenberg 2012 a very new development for the mbfr involves delivery of methane ch4 as a gaseous electron donor lai et al 2016 chen et al 2016c 5 biofilm anodes for extracellular electron transport a biofilm substratum can be a respiratory electron acceptor for bacteria able to carry out extracellular electron transport that some bacteria are able to reduce and respire metal oxide solids has been recognized for decades e g lovley 1991 what has propelled interest in solid phase electron acceptors is the discovery that anode respiring bacteria can act as living catalysts at the anode of an electrochemical cell this creates a set of microbial electrochemical cells or devises that remove electrons from organic substrate and channel the electron flow to produce valuable products and services rabaey and verstrate 2005 rittmann et al 2008 rabaey and logan 2012 rittmann 2017 5 1 anode respiring bacteria and mechanisms of extracellular electron transport anode respiring bacteria arb are able to oxidize an electron donor substrate and respire the electrons to a conducive solid anode respiration is a relatively newly discovered type of catabolism rabaey and verstrate 2005 torres et al 2010 popat and torres 2016 rittmann 2017 that depends on the arb being able to perform extracellular electron transport eet thus arb comprise a function based group of bacteria the functional group sometimes is given different names such as exoelectricigens anode respiration became widely recognized by the mid 2000s rabaey and verstrate 2005 marcus et al 2007 rittmann et al 2008 popat and torres 2016 famous arb such as geobacter sulfurreducens and shewanella oneidensis have been extensively studied e g heidelberg et al 2002 bond and lovley 2003 shi et al 2009 butler et al 2012 however continued research is showing that anode respiration is a functional capability that is widespread among bacteria particularly within the β and ε proteobacteria eet enables anode respiration in two inter connected ways first eet is a means to transport electrons from the arb s cytochromes to the anode s surface which necessarily cannot be transported into a bacterium s cytoplasm the case for most soluble electron acceptors very important to eet is that the electrons do not get lost or diverted while they are en route to the anode second the arb are able to capture energy during eet thus eet is a form of respiration an energy conserving mechanism similar to respiration of soluble electron acceptors neither the means of eet nor how the energy is conserved is fully understood but we know that both occur eet can occur by three characteristic mechanisms that are illustrated in fig 5 the simplest mechanism is direct contact of outer membrane cytochromes with the anode direct contact extends the normal mechanisms involved in electron flow and respiratory energy capture electron flow through an electron transport chain extrusion of protons h and creation of the proton motive force pmf across the membrane to a juxtaposed conductive substratum the second eet mechanism involves soluble electron shuttles such as quinones and flavins that the arb produce the shuttles pickup electrons from an outer membrane cytochrome diffuse to the anode and discharge the electrons there soluble shuttles also extend the usual respirator mechanisms to an anode this time an anode located away from the arb from the arb s point of view the direct contact and soluble shuttle mechanisms are advantageous because they can expand upon well established means of catabolism from our point of view however these pathways have a distinct disadvantage torres et al 2010 popat and torres 2016 rittmann 2017 a slow rate of eet direct transfer is severely limited by the amount of outer cytochome that can come into contact with the anode the eet kinetics for soluble shuttles is constrained by their slow diffusion rate to the anode realistic electron fluxes to the anode called the current density cannot exceed 0 1 a m2 a value too low to support a viable technology the third mechanism eet via a conductive biofilm matrix overcomes the kinetic limitations some arb are able to produce a matrix that has electrically conductivity of 10 3 ms cm or greater marcus et al 2007 lee et al 2016 such high conductivity means that the current density to the anode substratum can be 10 a m2 or higher thick biofilms 50 μm or more are achieved with conductive biofilms what causes the biofilm to be conductive is an intense research topic today even though we cannot explain exactly how arb make conductive biofilms we are certain that they produce conductive biofilms able to achieve current density 10 a m2 the reality of conductive biofilms has led to the term biofilm anode which signifies that the arb de facto expand the conductive substratum from the anode to include the biofilm itself the biofilm becomes part of a living conductive substratum the current density from an arb biofilm depends on a number of factors lee et al 2016 popat and torres 2016 rittmann 2017 the concentration and diffusion rate of the donor substrate the conductivity of the biofilm matrix the anode potential and the concentration of acid base buffer the effects of the donor are represented well by classical biofilm kinetics rittmann and mccarty 2001 wanner et al 2006 and the conductivity of a good biofilm anode is large enough that it has minimal impact on current density thus the true controls come from the anode potential and acid base buffering the impacts of buffering are thoroughly discussed in the literature e g torres et al 2008b marcus et al 2010 marcus et al 2011 rittmann 2017 the focus here is on the anode potential as it is what characterizes this active substratum fig 6 illustrate how anode potential controls current density when other factors are not limiting the current density j begins to rise for an anode potential ean slightly more positive than the half reaction potential of the donor substrate acetate in the example over an ean span of approximately 0 2 v the current density increases to its maximum value jmax and j equals one half of jmax for ean eka this s shaped response is called the nernst monod model marcus et al 2007 torres et al 2010 rittmann 2017 because the nersnt equation is used to relate ean to an imaginary electron acceptor concentration the nernst monod model repeatedly has been documented to be an excellent representation of a wide range of conductive biofilms torres et al 2008 lee et al 2016 yoho et al 2014 2015 the anode potential is a tool we use to manipulate the active substratum desired performance of the biofilm depends on balancing the pros and cons of increasing ean on the one hand making ean more positive increases the current density for a given biofilm in general having a large current density is desirable in order to decrease the amount of anode surface area and volume of the electrochemical cell which lower capital costs on the other hand keeping ean low offers two advantages the first advantage is to minimize the loss of potential at the anode known as the anode over potential a high ean means that more energy is given to the arb and this means less energy for us to harvest a second ecological advantage can be associated with a low ean torres et al 2009 selection of only the most efficient arb which makes the given biofilm more effective at eet and energy capture 5 2 microbial electrochemical cells mxcs microbial electrochemical cells comprise a suite of technologies based on a common platform that is given the acronym mxc c stand for cell which means that the system is an electrochemical cell that has an anode and a cathode m stands for microbial which means that arb are microbial catalysts present at the anode substratum the letter x represents that the platform can be manifested in different ways that yield a range of valuable outputs the x letter is replaced by a letter or letters that characterize the output other names include bio electrochemical system bes bio electrochemical technology bet and microbial electrochemical technology met what is essential to understand about the mxc manifestations is that each is determined by reactions at the cathode since the anode reactions are essentially the same e g for acetate as the donor ch3coo 4h2o 2hco3 9h 8e table 2 summarizes several mxc manifestations it lists the name the acronym the valuable output and the cathode reaction the outputs can be electrical power an mfc hydrogen gas an mec hydrogen peroxide mppc organic chemicals mesc and desalinated water mdc other possibilities exist rabaey and logan 2012 thus the active anode substratum enables a wide range of valuable outputs from the cathode while it also controls performance of the biofilm anode 6 intimately coupled photobiocatalysis to biodegrade recalcitrant organics 6 1 recalcitrant organic pollutants one of the long standing challenges for environmental biotechnology is biodegrading intrinsically recalcitrant organic pollutants recalcitrant means that their chemical structures resist attach by catabolic enzymes another term used for the same concept is refractory examples of recalcitrant structures are those with multiple aromatic rings complex branching heterocylces and large or oxidized substituents they include pesticides halogen and nitro substituted aromatics polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons asphaltenes chlorinated solvents dyes pharmaceuticals and humic like substances the problem for biodegrading the recalcitrant organics is that the microorganisms are unable to initiate the first step of biotransformation the organic structure simply persists due to their structures recalcitrant pollutants do not biodegrade in traditional wastewater treatment processes instead they exit the processes in the liquid effluent or adsorbed to biosolids both of which lead to major environmental and human health risks lee et al 1998 clearly the superior situation is to biodegrade them however their recalcitrant chemical structures stand in the way of the desirable outcome 6 2 making them biodegradable with advanced oxidation advanced oxidation is a suite of technologies that rely of the formation of the hydroxyl free radical oh which is a powerful and indiscriminant reactant with many types of organic molecules including many of those recalcitrant to biodegradation hong et al 2002 sarria et al 2002 parra et al 2002 marsolek et al 2014 chen et al 2015 the hydroxyl radical is especially adept at attacking double bonds and resonance bonds in aromatics it also attacks well where strongly electron withdrawing groups such as halogens and the nitro group weaken nearby bonding free radical reactions do not require a catalyst they are highly reactive with the range of organic structures that contain susceptible features while a free radical attack could lead to either a reduction or an oxidation of the organic target the more likely reaction is an oxidation that inserts oxygen often as the hydroxyl group oh this is analogous to microbial activation reactions catalyzed by mono and di oxygenase enzymes whether formed by free radical attack or by an oxygenase reaction the hydroxylated organics normally are readily attacked by microbial enzymes once able to initiate biotransformation the microorganisms can oxidize the downstream products using the usual dehydrogenation and hydroxylation reactions which yield electrons and energy to fuel biomass growth and maintenance rittmann and mccarty 2001 rittmann et al 1994 bai et al 2015 chen et al 2016a 2016b while advanced oxidation is a logical pre treatment before biodegradation for recalcitrant organic pollutants its realization has turned out to difficult due to two complications first generating free radicals is an energy intensive process that incurs important economic cost thus it is desirable to limit the amount of free radical attack to the minimum needed to transform the recalcitrant organic to one that can initiate biotransformation since oh is such a powerful and indiscriminant reactant limiting attack to the introduction of say only one or two oh groups has proven to be impractical too much advanced oxidation occurs and this leads to high costs and the second complication second excessive free radical attack can lead to the formation of undesired compounds ones that are themselves toxic to the microorganisms or that combine to form insoluble precipitates that are even more resistant to biodegradation marsolek et al 2014 these complications have thwarted commercial scale the development of advanced oxidation followed by biodegradation 6 3 intimately coupled photobiocatalysis enabling and protecting at the same time sequencing advanced oxidation with biodegradation has proven to be difficult because the free radical attack cannot be controlled well enough on its own what is needed is microorganism based control the concept is that the microorganisms biodegrade a biodegradable product as soon as it is generated by free radical attack this avoids over attack that leads to production of toxic or non available products and to excessive energy and money costs microorganisms based control requires that the microorganisms be present at the point of advanced oxidation how can that be possible advanced oxidation is used to kill microorganisms since oh also attacks the microorganisms marsolek et al 2008 despite the apparent contradiction of having advanced oxidation and biodegradation occur together at the same time and in the same reactor it is possible by exploiting an active biofilm substratum through the strategy of intimately coupled photobiocatalysis or icpb in icpb a photocatalyst usually titanium dioxide tio2 is bonded to the outside of special macroporous biofilm substrata fig 7 a shows how intimate coupling works the exterior of the substratum is illuminated with ultra violet uv light which is absorbed by the tio2 to generate oh the free radicals then react with recalcitrant organic molecules in the bulk liquid when biodegradable products are generated they diffuse immediately into the interior of the macroporous substratum where biofilm bacteria are present to biodegrade the biodegradable products by being inside the macroporous susbstratum the biofilm is protected from the biocidal effects of the uv light and the oh radicals icpb has been demonstrated in a photocatalytic circulating bed biofilm reactor pcbbr marsolek et al 2008 li et al 2011 2012a 2012b for the biodegradation of trichlorophenols and dyes fig 7b summarizes sample results that show almost total loss of reactive black 5 a dye and 60 removal of chemical oxygen demand cod during illumination of the macroporous substratum in the pcbbr photocatalysis was responsible for the loss of the dye but biodegradation brought about most of the cod removal all of the pcbbr results document that icpb makes it possible to use photocatalysis to promote a small degree of advanced oxidation that makes recalcitrant organic pollutants readily biodegradable icpb also has been documented in other reactor configurations that protect the biofilm yan et al 2012 wen et al 2012 yang et al 2015 pan et al 2015 chen et al 2015 tang et al 2015 bai et al 2015 xiong et al 2017 recalcitrant compounds successfully removed and mineralized by icpb include sulfamethoxazole dinitrotoluene nitrobenzene sulfadiazine dimethyl phthalate pyridine quinoline and tetracycline while details of the reactor configuration can vary the key is having a biofilm substratum that is doubly active it enables photocatalysis to generate donor substrate and protects the bacteria at the same time 7 concluding remarks the inherent advantages of biofilm processes can be expanded even further when the biofilm s substratum is active three examples demonstrate the concept and the benefits of using actives substrata the mbfr makes it possible to deliver a low solubility electron donor h2 gas directly to a biofilm active in reducing one or several oxidized water pollutants multiple reduction reactions and 100 donor utilization efficiency are made possible by the on demand delivery of h2 by its diffusion through bubbleless gas transfer membranes the biofilm anode in an mxc creates a versatile platform for oxidizing organic pollutants and using the electrons to generate valuable products including electrical power h2 gas and h2o2 the anode potential provides a sensitive tool for controlling the microbial ecology and the current density of the biofilm anode icpb can overcome intrinsic recalcitrance of organic pollutants by using an active substratum that simultaneously enables biodegradation and protects the biofilm the macroporous substratum is doubly active because it houses the photocatalyst on its exterior and protects the biofilm from uv light

19743,over the last decade ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds have attracted considerable attention as alternative mercury free uv sources for water treatment purposes this review is a comprehensive analysis of data reported in recent years mostly post 2014 on the application of uv led induced advanced oxidation processes aops to degrade organic pollutants primarily dyes phenols pharmaceuticals insecticides estrogens and cyanotoxins in aqueous media heterogeneous tio2 based photocatalysis in lab grade water using uva leds is the most frequently applied method for treating organic contaminants the effects of controlled periodic illumination different tio2 based nanostructures and reactor types on degradation kinetics and mineralization are discussed uvb and uvc leds have been used for photo fenton photo fenton like and uv h2o2 treatment of pollutants primarily in model aqueous solutions notably uv led activated persulfate peroxymonosulfate processes were capable of providing degradation in doc containing waters wall plug efficiency energy efficiency of uv leds and the energy requirements in terms of electrical energy per order e eo are discussed and compared despite the overall high degradation efficiency of the uv led based aops practical implementation is still limited and at lab scale more research on real water matrices at more environmentally relevant concentrations as well as an estimation of energy requirements providing fluence based kinetic data are required graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation processes ultraviolet light emitting diodes water treatment degradation organic pollutants wall plug efficiency 1 introduction over the last two decades ultraviolet uv induced advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely studied and applied for water and wastewater treatment low and medium pressure mercury lamps are typical radiation sources in uv induced aops meanwhile at the time of writing 128 countries have signed the minamata convention on mercury which was adopted in 2013 aimed at providing the gradual phase out of mercury use in a number of products and processes by 2020 in this regard alternative mercury free uv sources such as pulsed xe kr lamps exciplex and excimer lamps microwave electrodeless discharge lamps and light emitting diodes leds are up to date and being applied in aops research vilhunen and sillanpää 2010 matafonova and batoev 2012 jo and tayade 2014a a led represents a semiconductor p n junction device that converts direct current into radiation at a wavelength depending on the semiconductor s bandgap uv led materials are based on diamond 235 nm and iii nitride semiconductors such as ingan 365 410 nm bn 215 nm aln 210 nm algan gan and alingan down to 210 nm generally uv leds are divided by development engineers into near uv nuv and deep uv duv leds emitting in the range of 300 400 and 200 300 nm respectively hirayama et al 2009 muramoto et al 2014 however when focusing on uv led application in aops it is critical to follow the traditional classification of uv wavelength ranges and identify uva uvb and uvc leds table 1 the emitting central wavelength of gan is 365 nm and longer uv wavelengths use ingan the ingan based diodes emit uva light whereas algan and alingan based diodes have the primary uvb and uvc output wavelengths depending on the ratio of al ga and in by using al instead of in in the nitrides shorter uv wavelengths can be produced fig 1 the advantages of uv leds over conventional mercury lamps are as follows absence of gas fill and toxic mercury no warm up time and rapid power on time reactor design flexibility due to small unit chip size 1 mm2 much longer lifetime 3000 h at 250 nm 26 000 h at 365 nm more durable shell material metal or ceramic monochromatic emission in a range of wavelengths for targeted performance 210 400 nm and low voltage requirements of 6 30 v dc chen et al 2017 the latter enable uv leds to be driven by battery or solar cell which allows constructing mobile devices e g point of use systems for water disinfection small chip sizes provide a flexible variability of led array design line plane surface three dimensional models which in turn produces two conceptual reactor designs with encased or covered led arrays chen et al 2017 the encased reactor employs arrays of uv leds placed inside a quartz tube which is immersed in the water flow the covered reactor has external ring shaped arrays of uv leds and the water flows inside the tube these reactor types were applied under both batch chen et al 2007a 2007b natarajan et al 2011a b dominguez et al 2015 and flow through conditions natarajan et al 2011a b dominguez et al 2016 ku et al 2017 martín sómer et al 2017 2018 a detailed review of uv led fundamentals types performance array and reactor designs problems of material technology was recently published by chen et al 2017 therefore we focus on the energy efficiency as an important metric which is rarely addressed in the aops literature currently uv leds having emission peaks from 210 nm taniyasu et al 2006 to near ultraviolet nuv 405 nm leds tadatomo et al 2003 are available on the market but typically high power diodes emit at 365 405 nm and represent a multidiode array the latter is due to passive heat dissipation that limits geometrical dimensions of the diode shatskiy 2016 and the forced cooling increases the cost and reduces the reliability to date high powers were also obtained for uv leds for instance the power per led of high power products at 365 nm gan has reached 12 w at 14 a muramoto et al 2014 these achievements can be assessed in terms of external quantum efficiency eqe and wall plug efficiency wpe the highest eqe values were reported for 375 nm uv leds 43 2 output power 28 7 mw at 20 ma and 400 nm nuv leds 58 2 output power 36 1 mw at 20 ma muramoto et al 2014 meanwhile wpe is a key parameter for applications by ultimate users comparing the energy efficiency of leds in terms of eqe and wpe one can see that the wpes of uv leds is on average one order of magnitude lower than those of the violet and blue leds table 2 however the wpes of uv leds have progressed during the last decade reaching 22 1 for uva leds tien et al 2017 which is substantially higher than the wpes reported for uvb and uvc leds significant ohmic losses in the semitransparent p layers and high density of dislocations in the uvc led structure reduce the wpe shatalov et al 2017 making it comparable to that of excilamps sosnin et al 2015 thus the considerable limitations of uv leds for technological applications can be recognized as low wpe values and relatively high costs the shorter the wavelength the lower the wpe and the higher the cost as well as the increased temperatures and need for forced cooling to date the research on aops using uv leds as a radiation source in water treatment has intensified first a protocol has been developed to control and measure output power and radiation profile of uv leds when constructing photoreactors for water treatment kheyrandish et al 2017 second the hydroxyl radical ho formation has been quantitatively shown from no2 no3 and h2o2 photolysis with high power 365 nm leds takeda et al 2017 and in the photocatalytic system with 375 380 nm leds using dimethyl sulfoxide as a probe compound dominguez et al 2015 takeda et al 2017 showed the applicability of uv leds no2 system as a method of determining the reaction rate constants between ho and selected compounds third jo and tayade 2014a reviewed the literature data focusing on the semiconductor photocatalysis mostly tio2 based for degradation of organic compounds and inactivation of microorganisms in water as well as for volatile organic compounds in the air in the second review they addressed the photocatalytic degradation of dyes in water under led light irradiation jo and tayade 2014b two other reviews focused on time and dose response data of uv leds for microbial inactivation song et al 2016 and on key aspects of leds construction and disinfection applications chen et al 2017 herein we review the current research progress on the application of uv leds in aops for degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous media publications since 2014 are considered with a few exceptions detailed in sections specifically tio2 based photocatalysis uv fenton uv activated persulfate ps peroxymonosulfate pms in the absence and presence of a catalyst and uv h2o2 processes were defined as currently employed uv leds based aops 2 tio2 based photocatalysis in 2006 nuv leds with a peak wavelength of 405 nm were first applied as the uv light source for degradation of an organic pollutant dye reactive red 22 in aqueous solution this was the tio2 based photocatalytic process wang and ku 2006 since then there have been a number of publications on photocatalytic removal of organic contaminants from water using uv leds reviewed by jo and tayade 2014a 2014b in later studies uva leds and p25 degussa tio2 were mostly employed in degrading dyes and pharmaceuticals in pure aqueous solutions table 3 presents the studies that have been conducted in this field since except for autin et al 2013 and xiong and hu 2012 in addition to degrading the dye methylene blue autin et al 2013 degraded metaldehyde and showed its partial mineralization in surface and synthetic water by uv tio2 and uv h2o2 at high doses of 3000 mj cm2 xiong and hu 2012 not mentioned in the previous reviews investigated kinetics of uva tio2 degradation of acetaminophen as a function of catalyst loading initial concentration of compound and light intensity to determine the optimal conditions it was found that the apparent reaction rate constant k app was the highest at 0 06 g l tio2 200 ppb acetaminophen and 2 mw cm2 and increased 2 5 times with increasing light intensity from 1 to 4 mw cm2 furthermore the same authors studied the effect of controlled periodic illumination cpi which was first applied with 405 nm nuv leds for water treatment by wang and ku 2006 on the degradation rate and photonic efficiency of photocatalytic process xiong and hu 2017 they demonstrated that cpi under a small duty cycle and short cycle time exhibited better performance compared to continuous illumination this result is in agreement with the previous finding on the inverse relationship between photonic efficiency and duty cycle tokode et al 2012 this research group later reported that at low duty cycles the photonic efficiency of photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange also depended on ph and was the greatest at ph 4 tokode et al 2014 higher removal and photonic efficiencies for dimethyl phthalate under cpi were also observed using immobilized tio2 ku et al 2017 jo and tayade continued research on photocatalytic degradation of dyes developing photoreactors and applying different tio2 nanostructures they compared the performance of uv and blue leds in a flow through spiral shaped reactor for degradation of malachite green using suspended tio2 particles jo et al 2015 a synergetic effect of dye adsorption on catalyst particles provided their photocatalytic activity under blue led irradiation 450 475 nm and nearly the same degradation efficiency as compared to uv leds however in this case the practical application of blue leds at lower cost is limited by the need for tio2 slurry another comparative study was focused on synthesis and characterization of morphologically different tio2 nanostructures nanoflowers nanotubes and nanospheres and evaluation of their photocatalytic activity in a slurry reactor jo and tayade 2016a specifically the nanoflowers were found to be the most efficient in degrading dye direct blue 15 furthermore the same authors demonstrated a novel high performance photoreactor with a nano tio2 coated mosquito net and uva leds for degradation of methylene blue malachite green direct blue and amaranth jo and tayade 2016b methylene blue was also used as a model pollutant to be degraded in a tio2 slurry reactor by zulmajdi et al 2017 and kuipers et al 2015 in the latter study up to 32 wireless powered uv leds per 500 ml solution were employed to increase the photon transfer by distributing the diodes inside the slurry reactor such distribution of small leds by up flow of air resulted in 30 higher degradation rate than one observed with a fixed diode array in turn martín sómer et al 2017 compared the performance of three uva sources a mercury fluorescent lamp an 8 led based system and a 40 led based system with different light distribution in terms of photocatalytic oxidation of methanol and bacterial inactivation higher methanol reaction rates per kwh were observed using the 40 led reactor with improved light homogeneity and energy efficiency suggesting the critical role of light distribution in designing led reactors in order to be more efficient than traditional uv reactors rodríguez chueca et al 2015 compared the efficiency of natural solar radiation and two uv a leds systems in discolouring aqueous solutions of reactive black 5 by uv tio2 and uv tio2 h2o2 processes in batch and continuous modes table 3 time based kinetic data showed that the dye was degraded considerably faster by solar photocatalysis than by a first uv tio2 system 23 w m2 the addition of optimal h2o2 concentration increased the degradation rates in both cases a treatment efficiency similar to solar process was attained when using the second and more powerful uv tio2 system 85 w m2 being more energy intensive in continuous mode zhu et al 2017 used photovoltaics to power uv leds emitting in the range of 380 385 nm in a water purification system sol pid where uv solar light directly activates photocatalytic processes but visible and near infrared solar radiation is used to drive the uv leds to emit more uv as a result this hybrid system exhibited better performance than solwat without diodes in terms of uv tio2 degradation of acid red 26 and 4 chlorophenol several studies have recently reported on photocatalytic degradation of emerging contaminants including the insecticide diazinon hossaini et al 2014 estrogens arlos et al 2016 the surfactant sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate dominguez et al 2015 2016 and pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen diclofenac ibuprofen sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim eskandarian et al 2016 cai and hu 2017 hossaini et al 2014 prepared and characterized novel tio2 based catalysts doped using n ns fens and fefns for activation with 385 nm leds in a slurry reactor the results showed the highest photocatalytic activity of fefns doped tio2 for degradation and mineralization of diazinon making it a promising material for practical use regarding pharmaceuticals the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were decomposed in milli q water under flow through uva led tio2 conditions resulting in significant chronic toxicity with reduced residual antibacterial activity and a lack of acute toxicity cai and hu 2017 so far with the exception of autin et al 2013 all of the above cited studies were carried out in purified lab grade water as a background aqueous matrix recently li and hu 2016 studied the effect of humic acid on the kinetics and mechanisms of tetracycline after both direct uva led photolysis and photocatalytic degradation the results indicated that the photolysis rates were slightly accelerated by photosensitized humic acid and generated reactive oxygen species however the rates dramatically decreased during photocatalytic treatment due to tio2 surface deactivation and ho scavenging this implies the possible limitations of this method and the need of further research using dom containing water matrices izadifard et al 2013 attempted to degrade suwannee river fulvic acid srfa 4 chlorophenol and sulfamethoxazole as individual components in milli q water presenting the data in terms of energy doses per unit of volume kj l using degussa p25 tio2 nanofibers ni oh 2 tio2 and mesoporous tio2 target compounds were degraded at doses within 10 kj l however the degradation kinetics with simultaneously present srfa was not presented in this paper in addition to uva leds uvb and uvc leds were also explored for the decomposition of pharmaceuticals and cyanobacterial toxin microcystin lr in pure water by direct irradiation and in the presence of suspended tio2 eskandarian et al 2016 as anticipated the shortest wavelength at 265 nm was the most effective for both treatments attaining complete removal and 60 mineralization of sulfamethoxazole the most degradable compound amongst selected pharmaceuticals and microcystin lr by uvc tio2 table 3 to increase the feasibility for practical application tio2 has been immobilized via an environmentally safe h2o2 assisted thermal oxidation of porous titania sheets and examined for degradation of estrogens under 365 nm leds irradiation as a function of ph arlos et al 2016 the obtained material was capable of removing target estrogens but 17β estradiol as well as their total estrogenicity in a mixture at ph 4 moreira et al 2016 employed the immobilized tio2 on glass raschig rings for photocatalytic ozonation of urban wastewater and surface water with 382 nm leds in this study the parent organic micropollutants at ng l level were determined in both water matrices before treatment and subsequently degraded using o3 uv tio2 technology however fluoxetine clarithromycin erythromycin and 17 alpha ethinylestradiol among 22 compounds identified in wastewater were still detected after wastewater treatment whereas all seven compounds identified in surface water for drinking purpose were completely removed from surface water furthermore the photocatalytic ozonation removed different groups of potentially pathogenic microorganisms antibiotic resistant bacteria and their genes which were present in wastewater and surface water another method for re collecting a photocatalyst in aqueous media is with the application of magnetic separable catalysts such as tio2 doped with fe3o4 zazouli et al 2017 in this work the photocatalytic activity of fe3o4 tio2 nanoparticles ftns was studied for dye degradation by irradiation with uva and uvc lp mercury lamps and leds in the presence of pms pms has been used as electron acceptor in order to limit the undesired recombination reactions and yield more radicals through activation by both uv and conduction electron the ftns pms uvc leds system exhibited the highest efficiency attaining the fastest degradation for 30 min and highest toc removal 72 2 for 2 h under optimum experimental conditions however unlike uva lp lamps the performance of uvc leds for photocatalytic treatment of real water matrices was not evaluated escudero et al 2017 compared the kinetics and energy requirements for p cresol elimination by electrochemical and uva led tio2 treatments in flow through reactors the photocatalytic treatment resulted in complete p cresol degradation and high mineralization 80 under optimal conditions being more energy intensive than electrochemical technology overall the discussed photocatalytic studies were primarily conducted using uva leds in ultrapure water in the presence of suspended tio2 based particles meanwhile the slurry technique is technologically irrelevant and the optimal conditions for effective degradation of target pollutants in a matrix free water could not be extrapolated to environmental samples a recent study by jallouli et al 2018 showed that tio2 photocatalysis with 382 nm uva leds in a slurry batch reactor was less efficient at removing ibuprofen from wastewater effluents than from ultrapure water accordingly there is a need to investigate in depth the kinetic fundamentals of degradation of different organic pollutants in real water matrices using the immobilized photocatalysts and uva or nuv leds as the best energy efficient alternative for photocatalytic water treatment 3 uv ps pms photo fenton and photo fenton like processes table 4 provides an overview of recent studies focused on uv leds driven ps pms photo fenton and photo fenton like processes for organic degradation using ferrous iron as a catalyst the photo fenton process has been exploited to degrade the insecticide acetamiprid at a μg l level using uvc and uva leds carra et al 2015 de la obra et al 2017 in this case the experiments were carried out using synthetic water with doc 10 mg l to simulate a secondary effluent from an urban wastewater treatment plant comparing 365 385 and 400 nm treatment with the shortest wavelength showed the fastest degradation but the highest energy consumption at different liquid depths and incident irradiances de la obra et al 2017 in a separate study carra et al 2015 a high intensity uvc led 20 w m2 256 nm was also shown to be efficient in the removal of acetamiprid in synthetic water at acidic and natural ph using sequential iron additions table 4 at acidic ph the led system exhibited slower degradation kinetics than the lp uv low pressure 254 nm system for complete removal of a pollutant at the same irradiances and effective ratios of h2o2 and fe 4 1 2 and 3 mg fe l and 2 1 3 mg fe l based on the volumetric photon absorption coefficients the authors explained that h2o2 had a higher contribution than fe2 to radical generation due to its strong absorption in a broader emission bandwidth of lp uv than led at natural ph the observed degradation rates were similar for both uv systems however energy requirements for the uv led and lp uv systems and ho exposure are not compared in this study a few studies that explored the application of uv led activated ps or pms and photo fenton like processes based on these oxidants are also presented in table 4 it should be emphasized that the sulfate radical based aops sr aops using peroxy sulfur compounds have received a great attention during last decade for enhanced removal of organic pollutants in water oh et al 2016 matzek and carter 2016 the 280 nm uv leds ps treatment provided a high degradation efficiency of antibiotic ciprofloxacin but a low mineralization ye et al 2016 nevertheless the microbial analysis of escherichia coli proteome exposed to treated and untreated ciprofloxacin revealed a decrease of the toxicity of its intermediates rasoulifard et al 2015 continued their research on dye degradation using uv leds and applied the uv leds ps system for the continuous photoreactor with 72 diodes it is important to note that increasing the current intensity from 80 to 100 did not change the removal efficiency in this work the effect of various parameters including water matrix constituents on the performance of uv c leds pms and photo fenton like systems with fe3 cu2 for the degradation of anatoxin a was studied by verma et al 2016 yielding fluence based kinetic data the uv pms experiments showed the 260 nm to be the most effective wavelength with the highest apparent pseudo first order rate constant k app of 1 1 10 3 m2 j the presence of humic acid 10 mg l carbonate and bicarbonate ions as a background synthetic matrix inhibited the degradation whereas lower concentrations of humic acid 0 2 and 2 mg l increased the degradation rates implying a photosensitization effect the activation of pms by addition of fe3 was also efficient increasing k app values up to 1 9 10 3 m2 j however the anatoxin a degradation was less energy intensive with cu2 testing tap and lake water showed the enhanced degradation in lake water suggesting the synergistic effect of humic substances and transition metal ions verma et al 2016 as an alternative fe3 oxalate complexes formed in situ were used to intensify the degradation of 50 mg l antipyrine by using a uva led photo fenton reaction involving h2o2 and ps davididou et al 2017 the results established the optimum conditions under which a complete degradation and 93 mineralization were achieved and showed an unnecessary use of ps in this system additionally a heterogeneous photo fenton like system with fe iii carboxylate complexes has been included in this section zhou et al 2016 synthesized a low cost recyclable fe catalyst wps fe 350 from waste paper sludge and tested it for dye degradation in the presence of oxalic acid under 385 nm led illumination the catalyst exhibited a good reusability in pure water representing a potential technique for water treatment generally application of uv leds in photo fenton and photo fenton like processes on the lab scale confirmed that a ph of 3 was beneficial for rapid degradation of contaminants in ultrapure and synthetic waters however the efficiency of these aops including uv activated ps and pms for treatment of real waters has not been explored yet challenges remain to optimize degradation for efficient and cost effective pollutant removal in natural waters and wastewaters under flow through conditions and at elevated ph values 4 uv h2o2 table 5 refers to uv h2o2 processes for degradation of organic pollutants namely phenol ciprofloxacin anatoxin a tartrazine microcystin lr brilliant blue and methylene blue uvc leds have been used in most of studies herein which is ascribed to strong h2o2 absorption in this range yielding more ho particularly a continuation of studies on phenol degradation by vilhunen et al 2011 not cited in earlier reviews showed that the central wavelength of leds was the critical parameter when evaluating the photon absorption by h2o2 and ho production in uv h2o2 system using 257 269 and 277 nm accordingly the highest degradation efficiency and photon absorption were observed under advanced oxidation at 257 nm however the shortest wavelength 255 nm was the least effective in degrading ciprofloxacin by both direct uv and uv h2o2 using leds emitting at 255 265 280 310 and 365 nm ou et al 2016 the authors suggest that the fastest degradation at 280 nm may be attributed to the maximum absorbance of ciprofloxacin at 275 nm for direct uv whereas for uv h2o2 this result lacks an explanation despite the low toc removal 23 incomplete mineralization reduced its antibacterial activity performance of uvc leds was also elucidated for uv h2o2 degradation of cyanotoxins such as anatoxin a verma and sillanpää 2015 and microcystin lr liu et al 2017b similarly the results on uv pms verma et al 2016 fluence based data on direct photolysis of anatoxin a showed the highest degradation rates at 260 nm among 270 280 and 290 nm wavelengths si file verma and sillanpää 2015 and uv h2o2 experiments were further conducted at 260 nm only in milli q water they observed increased degradation in the presence of h2o2 as compared to direct photolysis with k app ranging from 3 6 to 9 10 4 m2 j the uv h2o2 degradation rates were not severely decreased upon humic acid addition nor the treatment of natural water with k app values of 3 7 10 4 and 4 10 4 m2 j respectively verma and sillanpää 2015 microcystin lr also underwent almost complete degradation in uv h2o2 system using 265 nm leds liu et al 2017b as observed previously by eskandarian et al 2016 for photocatalytic treatment in the same concentration range a low mineralization was observed in both studies reaching 24 toc reduction 60 min in a uv h2o2 system and 44 9 24 h in a uv tio2 system at 5 mg l mc lr however the required uv fluences were unspecified therein umar et al 2015 reported the fluence based data on toc degradation in a saline high doc loaded municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate roc using uvc h2o2 scheme it was found that only the uv h2o2 treatment at a fluence of 36 103 mj cm2 reduced toc by 27 while the sequential coagulation uv h2o2 and biological treatment at ph 5 enhanced the overall mineralization to 67 pulsed uvc leds emitting at 240 nm were also employed for uv h2o2 process for the degradation of dyes under flow through conditions duckworth et al 2015 scott et al 2017 cpi coupled with h2o2 at low duty cycles provided higher normalized first order degradation rate constants k app duty cycle for methylene blue while the initial k app values increased linearly with the increase of duty cycle duckworth et al 2015 scott et al 2017 confirmed these results for the degradation of tartrazine and brilliant blue in the same led reactor along with deionized water as a matrix almquist et al 2017 tested a tap water for methylene blue elimination in a plug flow reactor with 245 nm leds alkalinity and hardness had an inhibitory effect on the degradation rate in uv h2o2 system that is consistent with the literature data wang et al 2017 focused on uv chlorine degradation of carbamazepine using 280 and 310 nm uv leds found that this scheme is much more effective that uv h2o2 process at the same oxidant dosage meanwhile photo chlorination increased the cytotoxicity and the content of adsorbable organochlorines aocl and high fluences 1233 mj cm2 were required to decrease the acute toxicity of the treated solution the available literature indicates the feasibility of uvc leds h2o2 as an environmentally safe technology for water treatment however most research was also conducted in pure water and on a batch scale the uvc leds h2o2 technology seems to be economically inapplicable for real water treatment due to the current high costs and low energy efficiencies of uvc leds moreover the treatment of turbid and high doc loaded water with short wavelength uvc light significantly decreases the actual delivered uv doses due to high scattering and absorbance additionally the combination of photo induced aops and ultrasound to enhance the ros production and improve the degradation process has also received much interest from the environmental researchers sathishkumar et al 2016 panda and manickam 2017 particularly sonolysis coupled with photocatalysis sonophotocatalysis using blue leds as a light source was shown to be applicable to degrade methylene blue zhang et al 2011 trypan blue and vesuvine mosleh et al 2016 however ultrasound enhanced photocatalysis using uv leds for pollutant degradation has not been exploited yet and represents a potentially effective hybrid technique 5 energy considerations energy consumption is an essential parameter for the assessment of efficiency and feasibility of a water treatment technology table 6 presents the energy requirements for degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous solution including earlier studies in terms of electrical energy per order e eo introduced by j r bolton as the electrical energy in kwh required to reduce the concentration of a contaminant by one order of magnitude in a m3 of contaminated water bolton and cater 1994 bolton et al 1996 2001 up to five orders of magnitude of e eo can be found in different reports for 90 removal of compounds in the wide concentration range of 0 1 50 mg l as can be seen in table 6 the energy requirements for o and p cresol elimination by uv tio2 were similar regardless of initial concentration moreover cpi provided somewhat lower e eo values chen et al 2007a b rasoulifard et al 2014 different classes of dyes required the electrical energy of order 102 103 kwh m3 whereas the highest energy demands up to 104 kwh m3 were obtained for dimethyl phthalate in uv tio2 system even under cpi conditions ku et al 2017 meanwhile up to 5 fold lower e eo values were obtained for elimination of ciprofloxacin ye et al 2016 ou et al 2016 and microcystin lr liu et al 2017b the authors of these papers concluded that these values were significantly lower than the values in the previous studies using lp uv for degradation of antipyrine uv h2o2 0 0109 kwh m3 uv ps 0 0234 kwh m3 tan et al 2013 or acetaminophen uv h2o2 0 0146 kwh m3 uv ps 0 0184 kwh m3 tan et al 2014 in fact the above indicated e eo values with hg lamps are comparable with those reported for uv ps degradation of ciprofloxacin ye et al 2016 lower energy requirements with uv leds compared to traditional uv lamps 1 7 4 8 times were demonstrated for uv ps treatment of basic red 46 rasoulifard et al 2011 in contrast substantially higher energy requirements 50 1200 kwh m3 for direct red 23 degradation than observed with 254 nm lamp lpl for basic yellow 2 degradation by uv ps scheme 4 2 68 9 kwh m3 salari et al 2009 were illustrated by rasoulifard et al 2015 nevertheless for uv tio2 process dominguez et al 2016 reported e eo values that were comparable with the previous similar studies with commercial lamps and concluded about the competitiveness of the led reactor in terms of energy efficiency rodríguez chueca et al 2015 and ferreira et al 2016 obtained close energy requirements for degradation of reactive black under similar experimental conditions table 6 in addition the e eo values with uva leds lamps were generally lower than that obtained with a mp mercury lamp 877 kwh m3 under the same conditions rodríguez chueca et al 2015 it is remarkable that all above studies with e eo estimations excluding umar et al 2015 de la obra et al 2017 were carried out in pure solutions or relatively high initial concentrations of target compounds in this regard the evaluation of energy requirements and operating costs for treatment of real matrices and low concentrations e g micropollutants at μg l level is desired in general given the high energy requirement of 2 65 kwh m3 or more bolton and cater 1994 using uv leds based aops under the conditions mentioned still remain an uncompetitive alternative in terms of e eo 6 future research assessing the potential application of uv leds for aops in water treatment we have the following recommendations for future research 1 simultaneous degradation of organic micro pollutants and microbial inactivation in aqueous media seems to be the focus of additional research since the same ros are responsible for oxidation and inactivation processes integrating these processes moreira et al 2016 garkusheva et al 2017 would allow reducing the energy requirements and treatment costs 2 developing uv led based advanced oxidation technologies for water treatment requires the selection of a led with an appropriate emission wavelength a long lifetime and a passive cooling for high power leds the preferable emission wavelength should be as long as possible uva nuv or even visible range due to considerably higher wpe values and lower costs of leds with longer wavelengths from this standpoint uva led based photocatalysis using the immobilized catalysts represents the best alternative aop for future investigations and practical applications 3 uva and nuv leds also represent an advantageous option for treating turbid waters natural and wastewater due to the lower light scattering effects in this regard more detailed studies on pollutant degradation in real water matrices at more environmentally relevant concentrations as well as an estimation of energy requirements and operating costs under real conditions are required in the near future 4 research on flow through encased reactors with easily adjustable width of the water layer is encouraged in general the higher the absorbance and turbidity of the water the thinner the layer of irradiated water that should flow through and the longer the wavelength that should be applied to reduce the light scattering flow rate and irradiance can be considered as key parameters to achieve the required uv doses for reasonable treatment times 5 hybrid oxidation methods based on the integrated use of uv leds and ultrasound without and in the presence of a photocatalyst sonophotocatalysis have not been explored and could represent a prospective research line and a powerful tool for water treatment 7 conclusions since 2014 uv leds have received extensive application for degrading organic pollutants in aqueous media by means of photo induced aops due to their advantageous size lifetime wavelength and light distribution control as well as environmental safety most previous work has been done on heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation in pure aqueous solutions using uva leds 360 nm and tio2 based nanostructures however practical implementation is still limited and at lab scale the latter is also related to uv h2o2 photo fenton and fenton like processes where uvb and uvc wavelengths have become frequently employed the high cost low output power and wpe of uvc diodes limits their applicability for water treatment to point of use systems however at this step of development uv leds as an alternative source of uv radiation to mercury lamps have proven to be effective for degradation and mineralization of various organic pollutants improvements in radiant efficiency and output power would increase the energy efficiency of uv leds making this technology cost competitive with traditional uv systems acknowledgments this work was conducted under the program of basic research of sb ras project no 0339 2016 0005 we thank

19743,over the last decade ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds have attracted considerable attention as alternative mercury free uv sources for water treatment purposes this review is a comprehensive analysis of data reported in recent years mostly post 2014 on the application of uv led induced advanced oxidation processes aops to degrade organic pollutants primarily dyes phenols pharmaceuticals insecticides estrogens and cyanotoxins in aqueous media heterogeneous tio2 based photocatalysis in lab grade water using uva leds is the most frequently applied method for treating organic contaminants the effects of controlled periodic illumination different tio2 based nanostructures and reactor types on degradation kinetics and mineralization are discussed uvb and uvc leds have been used for photo fenton photo fenton like and uv h2o2 treatment of pollutants primarily in model aqueous solutions notably uv led activated persulfate peroxymonosulfate processes were capable of providing degradation in doc containing waters wall plug efficiency energy efficiency of uv leds and the energy requirements in terms of electrical energy per order e eo are discussed and compared despite the overall high degradation efficiency of the uv led based aops practical implementation is still limited and at lab scale more research on real water matrices at more environmentally relevant concentrations as well as an estimation of energy requirements providing fluence based kinetic data are required graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation processes ultraviolet light emitting diodes water treatment degradation organic pollutants wall plug efficiency 1 introduction over the last two decades ultraviolet uv induced advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely studied and applied for water and wastewater treatment low and medium pressure mercury lamps are typical radiation sources in uv induced aops meanwhile at the time of writing 128 countries have signed the minamata convention on mercury which was adopted in 2013 aimed at providing the gradual phase out of mercury use in a number of products and processes by 2020 in this regard alternative mercury free uv sources such as pulsed xe kr lamps exciplex and excimer lamps microwave electrodeless discharge lamps and light emitting diodes leds are up to date and being applied in aops research vilhunen and sillanpää 2010 matafonova and batoev 2012 jo and tayade 2014a a led represents a semiconductor p n junction device that converts direct current into radiation at a wavelength depending on the semiconductor s bandgap uv led materials are based on diamond 235 nm and iii nitride semiconductors such as ingan 365 410 nm bn 215 nm aln 210 nm algan gan and alingan down to 210 nm generally uv leds are divided by development engineers into near uv nuv and deep uv duv leds emitting in the range of 300 400 and 200 300 nm respectively hirayama et al 2009 muramoto et al 2014 however when focusing on uv led application in aops it is critical to follow the traditional classification of uv wavelength ranges and identify uva uvb and uvc leds table 1 the emitting central wavelength of gan is 365 nm and longer uv wavelengths use ingan the ingan based diodes emit uva light whereas algan and alingan based diodes have the primary uvb and uvc output wavelengths depending on the ratio of al ga and in by using al instead of in in the nitrides shorter uv wavelengths can be produced fig 1 the advantages of uv leds over conventional mercury lamps are as follows absence of gas fill and toxic mercury no warm up time and rapid power on time reactor design flexibility due to small unit chip size 1 mm2 much longer lifetime 3000 h at 250 nm 26 000 h at 365 nm more durable shell material metal or ceramic monochromatic emission in a range of wavelengths for targeted performance 210 400 nm and low voltage requirements of 6 30 v dc chen et al 2017 the latter enable uv leds to be driven by battery or solar cell which allows constructing mobile devices e g point of use systems for water disinfection small chip sizes provide a flexible variability of led array design line plane surface three dimensional models which in turn produces two conceptual reactor designs with encased or covered led arrays chen et al 2017 the encased reactor employs arrays of uv leds placed inside a quartz tube which is immersed in the water flow the covered reactor has external ring shaped arrays of uv leds and the water flows inside the tube these reactor types were applied under both batch chen et al 2007a 2007b natarajan et al 2011a b dominguez et al 2015 and flow through conditions natarajan et al 2011a b dominguez et al 2016 ku et al 2017 martín sómer et al 2017 2018 a detailed review of uv led fundamentals types performance array and reactor designs problems of material technology was recently published by chen et al 2017 therefore we focus on the energy efficiency as an important metric which is rarely addressed in the aops literature currently uv leds having emission peaks from 210 nm taniyasu et al 2006 to near ultraviolet nuv 405 nm leds tadatomo et al 2003 are available on the market but typically high power diodes emit at 365 405 nm and represent a multidiode array the latter is due to passive heat dissipation that limits geometrical dimensions of the diode shatskiy 2016 and the forced cooling increases the cost and reduces the reliability to date high powers were also obtained for uv leds for instance the power per led of high power products at 365 nm gan has reached 12 w at 14 a muramoto et al 2014 these achievements can be assessed in terms of external quantum efficiency eqe and wall plug efficiency wpe the highest eqe values were reported for 375 nm uv leds 43 2 output power 28 7 mw at 20 ma and 400 nm nuv leds 58 2 output power 36 1 mw at 20 ma muramoto et al 2014 meanwhile wpe is a key parameter for applications by ultimate users comparing the energy efficiency of leds in terms of eqe and wpe one can see that the wpes of uv leds is on average one order of magnitude lower than those of the violet and blue leds table 2 however the wpes of uv leds have progressed during the last decade reaching 22 1 for uva leds tien et al 2017 which is substantially higher than the wpes reported for uvb and uvc leds significant ohmic losses in the semitransparent p layers and high density of dislocations in the uvc led structure reduce the wpe shatalov et al 2017 making it comparable to that of excilamps sosnin et al 2015 thus the considerable limitations of uv leds for technological applications can be recognized as low wpe values and relatively high costs the shorter the wavelength the lower the wpe and the higher the cost as well as the increased temperatures and need for forced cooling to date the research on aops using uv leds as a radiation source in water treatment has intensified first a protocol has been developed to control and measure output power and radiation profile of uv leds when constructing photoreactors for water treatment kheyrandish et al 2017 second the hydroxyl radical ho formation has been quantitatively shown from no2 no3 and h2o2 photolysis with high power 365 nm leds takeda et al 2017 and in the photocatalytic system with 375 380 nm leds using dimethyl sulfoxide as a probe compound dominguez et al 2015 takeda et al 2017 showed the applicability of uv leds no2 system as a method of determining the reaction rate constants between ho and selected compounds third jo and tayade 2014a reviewed the literature data focusing on the semiconductor photocatalysis mostly tio2 based for degradation of organic compounds and inactivation of microorganisms in water as well as for volatile organic compounds in the air in the second review they addressed the photocatalytic degradation of dyes in water under led light irradiation jo and tayade 2014b two other reviews focused on time and dose response data of uv leds for microbial inactivation song et al 2016 and on key aspects of leds construction and disinfection applications chen et al 2017 herein we review the current research progress on the application of uv leds in aops for degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous media publications since 2014 are considered with a few exceptions detailed in sections specifically tio2 based photocatalysis uv fenton uv activated persulfate ps peroxymonosulfate pms in the absence and presence of a catalyst and uv h2o2 processes were defined as currently employed uv leds based aops 2 tio2 based photocatalysis in 2006 nuv leds with a peak wavelength of 405 nm were first applied as the uv light source for degradation of an organic pollutant dye reactive red 22 in aqueous solution this was the tio2 based photocatalytic process wang and ku 2006 since then there have been a number of publications on photocatalytic removal of organic contaminants from water using uv leds reviewed by jo and tayade 2014a 2014b in later studies uva leds and p25 degussa tio2 were mostly employed in degrading dyes and pharmaceuticals in pure aqueous solutions table 3 presents the studies that have been conducted in this field since except for autin et al 2013 and xiong and hu 2012 in addition to degrading the dye methylene blue autin et al 2013 degraded metaldehyde and showed its partial mineralization in surface and synthetic water by uv tio2 and uv h2o2 at high doses of 3000 mj cm2 xiong and hu 2012 not mentioned in the previous reviews investigated kinetics of uva tio2 degradation of acetaminophen as a function of catalyst loading initial concentration of compound and light intensity to determine the optimal conditions it was found that the apparent reaction rate constant k app was the highest at 0 06 g l tio2 200 ppb acetaminophen and 2 mw cm2 and increased 2 5 times with increasing light intensity from 1 to 4 mw cm2 furthermore the same authors studied the effect of controlled periodic illumination cpi which was first applied with 405 nm nuv leds for water treatment by wang and ku 2006 on the degradation rate and photonic efficiency of photocatalytic process xiong and hu 2017 they demonstrated that cpi under a small duty cycle and short cycle time exhibited better performance compared to continuous illumination this result is in agreement with the previous finding on the inverse relationship between photonic efficiency and duty cycle tokode et al 2012 this research group later reported that at low duty cycles the photonic efficiency of photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange also depended on ph and was the greatest at ph 4 tokode et al 2014 higher removal and photonic efficiencies for dimethyl phthalate under cpi were also observed using immobilized tio2 ku et al 2017 jo and tayade continued research on photocatalytic degradation of dyes developing photoreactors and applying different tio2 nanostructures they compared the performance of uv and blue leds in a flow through spiral shaped reactor for degradation of malachite green using suspended tio2 particles jo et al 2015 a synergetic effect of dye adsorption on catalyst particles provided their photocatalytic activity under blue led irradiation 450 475 nm and nearly the same degradation efficiency as compared to uv leds however in this case the practical application of blue leds at lower cost is limited by the need for tio2 slurry another comparative study was focused on synthesis and characterization of morphologically different tio2 nanostructures nanoflowers nanotubes and nanospheres and evaluation of their photocatalytic activity in a slurry reactor jo and tayade 2016a specifically the nanoflowers were found to be the most efficient in degrading dye direct blue 15 furthermore the same authors demonstrated a novel high performance photoreactor with a nano tio2 coated mosquito net and uva leds for degradation of methylene blue malachite green direct blue and amaranth jo and tayade 2016b methylene blue was also used as a model pollutant to be degraded in a tio2 slurry reactor by zulmajdi et al 2017 and kuipers et al 2015 in the latter study up to 32 wireless powered uv leds per 500 ml solution were employed to increase the photon transfer by distributing the diodes inside the slurry reactor such distribution of small leds by up flow of air resulted in 30 higher degradation rate than one observed with a fixed diode array in turn martín sómer et al 2017 compared the performance of three uva sources a mercury fluorescent lamp an 8 led based system and a 40 led based system with different light distribution in terms of photocatalytic oxidation of methanol and bacterial inactivation higher methanol reaction rates per kwh were observed using the 40 led reactor with improved light homogeneity and energy efficiency suggesting the critical role of light distribution in designing led reactors in order to be more efficient than traditional uv reactors rodríguez chueca et al 2015 compared the efficiency of natural solar radiation and two uv a leds systems in discolouring aqueous solutions of reactive black 5 by uv tio2 and uv tio2 h2o2 processes in batch and continuous modes table 3 time based kinetic data showed that the dye was degraded considerably faster by solar photocatalysis than by a first uv tio2 system 23 w m2 the addition of optimal h2o2 concentration increased the degradation rates in both cases a treatment efficiency similar to solar process was attained when using the second and more powerful uv tio2 system 85 w m2 being more energy intensive in continuous mode zhu et al 2017 used photovoltaics to power uv leds emitting in the range of 380 385 nm in a water purification system sol pid where uv solar light directly activates photocatalytic processes but visible and near infrared solar radiation is used to drive the uv leds to emit more uv as a result this hybrid system exhibited better performance than solwat without diodes in terms of uv tio2 degradation of acid red 26 and 4 chlorophenol several studies have recently reported on photocatalytic degradation of emerging contaminants including the insecticide diazinon hossaini et al 2014 estrogens arlos et al 2016 the surfactant sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate dominguez et al 2015 2016 and pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen diclofenac ibuprofen sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim eskandarian et al 2016 cai and hu 2017 hossaini et al 2014 prepared and characterized novel tio2 based catalysts doped using n ns fens and fefns for activation with 385 nm leds in a slurry reactor the results showed the highest photocatalytic activity of fefns doped tio2 for degradation and mineralization of diazinon making it a promising material for practical use regarding pharmaceuticals the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were decomposed in milli q water under flow through uva led tio2 conditions resulting in significant chronic toxicity with reduced residual antibacterial activity and a lack of acute toxicity cai and hu 2017 so far with the exception of autin et al 2013 all of the above cited studies were carried out in purified lab grade water as a background aqueous matrix recently li and hu 2016 studied the effect of humic acid on the kinetics and mechanisms of tetracycline after both direct uva led photolysis and photocatalytic degradation the results indicated that the photolysis rates were slightly accelerated by photosensitized humic acid and generated reactive oxygen species however the rates dramatically decreased during photocatalytic treatment due to tio2 surface deactivation and ho scavenging this implies the possible limitations of this method and the need of further research using dom containing water matrices izadifard et al 2013 attempted to degrade suwannee river fulvic acid srfa 4 chlorophenol and sulfamethoxazole as individual components in milli q water presenting the data in terms of energy doses per unit of volume kj l using degussa p25 tio2 nanofibers ni oh 2 tio2 and mesoporous tio2 target compounds were degraded at doses within 10 kj l however the degradation kinetics with simultaneously present srfa was not presented in this paper in addition to uva leds uvb and uvc leds were also explored for the decomposition of pharmaceuticals and cyanobacterial toxin microcystin lr in pure water by direct irradiation and in the presence of suspended tio2 eskandarian et al 2016 as anticipated the shortest wavelength at 265 nm was the most effective for both treatments attaining complete removal and 60 mineralization of sulfamethoxazole the most degradable compound amongst selected pharmaceuticals and microcystin lr by uvc tio2 table 3 to increase the feasibility for practical application tio2 has been immobilized via an environmentally safe h2o2 assisted thermal oxidation of porous titania sheets and examined for degradation of estrogens under 365 nm leds irradiation as a function of ph arlos et al 2016 the obtained material was capable of removing target estrogens but 17β estradiol as well as their total estrogenicity in a mixture at ph 4 moreira et al 2016 employed the immobilized tio2 on glass raschig rings for photocatalytic ozonation of urban wastewater and surface water with 382 nm leds in this study the parent organic micropollutants at ng l level were determined in both water matrices before treatment and subsequently degraded using o3 uv tio2 technology however fluoxetine clarithromycin erythromycin and 17 alpha ethinylestradiol among 22 compounds identified in wastewater were still detected after wastewater treatment whereas all seven compounds identified in surface water for drinking purpose were completely removed from surface water furthermore the photocatalytic ozonation removed different groups of potentially pathogenic microorganisms antibiotic resistant bacteria and their genes which were present in wastewater and surface water another method for re collecting a photocatalyst in aqueous media is with the application of magnetic separable catalysts such as tio2 doped with fe3o4 zazouli et al 2017 in this work the photocatalytic activity of fe3o4 tio2 nanoparticles ftns was studied for dye degradation by irradiation with uva and uvc lp mercury lamps and leds in the presence of pms pms has been used as electron acceptor in order to limit the undesired recombination reactions and yield more radicals through activation by both uv and conduction electron the ftns pms uvc leds system exhibited the highest efficiency attaining the fastest degradation for 30 min and highest toc removal 72 2 for 2 h under optimum experimental conditions however unlike uva lp lamps the performance of uvc leds for photocatalytic treatment of real water matrices was not evaluated escudero et al 2017 compared the kinetics and energy requirements for p cresol elimination by electrochemical and uva led tio2 treatments in flow through reactors the photocatalytic treatment resulted in complete p cresol degradation and high mineralization 80 under optimal conditions being more energy intensive than electrochemical technology overall the discussed photocatalytic studies were primarily conducted using uva leds in ultrapure water in the presence of suspended tio2 based particles meanwhile the slurry technique is technologically irrelevant and the optimal conditions for effective degradation of target pollutants in a matrix free water could not be extrapolated to environmental samples a recent study by jallouli et al 2018 showed that tio2 photocatalysis with 382 nm uva leds in a slurry batch reactor was less efficient at removing ibuprofen from wastewater effluents than from ultrapure water accordingly there is a need to investigate in depth the kinetic fundamentals of degradation of different organic pollutants in real water matrices using the immobilized photocatalysts and uva or nuv leds as the best energy efficient alternative for photocatalytic water treatment 3 uv ps pms photo fenton and photo fenton like processes table 4 provides an overview of recent studies focused on uv leds driven ps pms photo fenton and photo fenton like processes for organic degradation using ferrous iron as a catalyst the photo fenton process has been exploited to degrade the insecticide acetamiprid at a μg l level using uvc and uva leds carra et al 2015 de la obra et al 2017 in this case the experiments were carried out using synthetic water with doc 10 mg l to simulate a secondary effluent from an urban wastewater treatment plant comparing 365 385 and 400 nm treatment with the shortest wavelength showed the fastest degradation but the highest energy consumption at different liquid depths and incident irradiances de la obra et al 2017 in a separate study carra et al 2015 a high intensity uvc led 20 w m2 256 nm was also shown to be efficient in the removal of acetamiprid in synthetic water at acidic and natural ph using sequential iron additions table 4 at acidic ph the led system exhibited slower degradation kinetics than the lp uv low pressure 254 nm system for complete removal of a pollutant at the same irradiances and effective ratios of h2o2 and fe 4 1 2 and 3 mg fe l and 2 1 3 mg fe l based on the volumetric photon absorption coefficients the authors explained that h2o2 had a higher contribution than fe2 to radical generation due to its strong absorption in a broader emission bandwidth of lp uv than led at natural ph the observed degradation rates were similar for both uv systems however energy requirements for the uv led and lp uv systems and ho exposure are not compared in this study a few studies that explored the application of uv led activated ps or pms and photo fenton like processes based on these oxidants are also presented in table 4 it should be emphasized that the sulfate radical based aops sr aops using peroxy sulfur compounds have received a great attention during last decade for enhanced removal of organic pollutants in water oh et al 2016 matzek and carter 2016 the 280 nm uv leds ps treatment provided a high degradation efficiency of antibiotic ciprofloxacin but a low mineralization ye et al 2016 nevertheless the microbial analysis of escherichia coli proteome exposed to treated and untreated ciprofloxacin revealed a decrease of the toxicity of its intermediates rasoulifard et al 2015 continued their research on dye degradation using uv leds and applied the uv leds ps system for the continuous photoreactor with 72 diodes it is important to note that increasing the current intensity from 80 to 100 did not change the removal efficiency in this work the effect of various parameters including water matrix constituents on the performance of uv c leds pms and photo fenton like systems with fe3 cu2 for the degradation of anatoxin a was studied by verma et al 2016 yielding fluence based kinetic data the uv pms experiments showed the 260 nm to be the most effective wavelength with the highest apparent pseudo first order rate constant k app of 1 1 10 3 m2 j the presence of humic acid 10 mg l carbonate and bicarbonate ions as a background synthetic matrix inhibited the degradation whereas lower concentrations of humic acid 0 2 and 2 mg l increased the degradation rates implying a photosensitization effect the activation of pms by addition of fe3 was also efficient increasing k app values up to 1 9 10 3 m2 j however the anatoxin a degradation was less energy intensive with cu2 testing tap and lake water showed the enhanced degradation in lake water suggesting the synergistic effect of humic substances and transition metal ions verma et al 2016 as an alternative fe3 oxalate complexes formed in situ were used to intensify the degradation of 50 mg l antipyrine by using a uva led photo fenton reaction involving h2o2 and ps davididou et al 2017 the results established the optimum conditions under which a complete degradation and 93 mineralization were achieved and showed an unnecessary use of ps in this system additionally a heterogeneous photo fenton like system with fe iii carboxylate complexes has been included in this section zhou et al 2016 synthesized a low cost recyclable fe catalyst wps fe 350 from waste paper sludge and tested it for dye degradation in the presence of oxalic acid under 385 nm led illumination the catalyst exhibited a good reusability in pure water representing a potential technique for water treatment generally application of uv leds in photo fenton and photo fenton like processes on the lab scale confirmed that a ph of 3 was beneficial for rapid degradation of contaminants in ultrapure and synthetic waters however the efficiency of these aops including uv activated ps and pms for treatment of real waters has not been explored yet challenges remain to optimize degradation for efficient and cost effective pollutant removal in natural waters and wastewaters under flow through conditions and at elevated ph values 4 uv h2o2 table 5 refers to uv h2o2 processes for degradation of organic pollutants namely phenol ciprofloxacin anatoxin a tartrazine microcystin lr brilliant blue and methylene blue uvc leds have been used in most of studies herein which is ascribed to strong h2o2 absorption in this range yielding more ho particularly a continuation of studies on phenol degradation by vilhunen et al 2011 not cited in earlier reviews showed that the central wavelength of leds was the critical parameter when evaluating the photon absorption by h2o2 and ho production in uv h2o2 system using 257 269 and 277 nm accordingly the highest degradation efficiency and photon absorption were observed under advanced oxidation at 257 nm however the shortest wavelength 255 nm was the least effective in degrading ciprofloxacin by both direct uv and uv h2o2 using leds emitting at 255 265 280 310 and 365 nm ou et al 2016 the authors suggest that the fastest degradation at 280 nm may be attributed to the maximum absorbance of ciprofloxacin at 275 nm for direct uv whereas for uv h2o2 this result lacks an explanation despite the low toc removal 23 incomplete mineralization reduced its antibacterial activity performance of uvc leds was also elucidated for uv h2o2 degradation of cyanotoxins such as anatoxin a verma and sillanpää 2015 and microcystin lr liu et al 2017b similarly the results on uv pms verma et al 2016 fluence based data on direct photolysis of anatoxin a showed the highest degradation rates at 260 nm among 270 280 and 290 nm wavelengths si file verma and sillanpää 2015 and uv h2o2 experiments were further conducted at 260 nm only in milli q water they observed increased degradation in the presence of h2o2 as compared to direct photolysis with k app ranging from 3 6 to 9 10 4 m2 j the uv h2o2 degradation rates were not severely decreased upon humic acid addition nor the treatment of natural water with k app values of 3 7 10 4 and 4 10 4 m2 j respectively verma and sillanpää 2015 microcystin lr also underwent almost complete degradation in uv h2o2 system using 265 nm leds liu et al 2017b as observed previously by eskandarian et al 2016 for photocatalytic treatment in the same concentration range a low mineralization was observed in both studies reaching 24 toc reduction 60 min in a uv h2o2 system and 44 9 24 h in a uv tio2 system at 5 mg l mc lr however the required uv fluences were unspecified therein umar et al 2015 reported the fluence based data on toc degradation in a saline high doc loaded municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate roc using uvc h2o2 scheme it was found that only the uv h2o2 treatment at a fluence of 36 103 mj cm2 reduced toc by 27 while the sequential coagulation uv h2o2 and biological treatment at ph 5 enhanced the overall mineralization to 67 pulsed uvc leds emitting at 240 nm were also employed for uv h2o2 process for the degradation of dyes under flow through conditions duckworth et al 2015 scott et al 2017 cpi coupled with h2o2 at low duty cycles provided higher normalized first order degradation rate constants k app duty cycle for methylene blue while the initial k app values increased linearly with the increase of duty cycle duckworth et al 2015 scott et al 2017 confirmed these results for the degradation of tartrazine and brilliant blue in the same led reactor along with deionized water as a matrix almquist et al 2017 tested a tap water for methylene blue elimination in a plug flow reactor with 245 nm leds alkalinity and hardness had an inhibitory effect on the degradation rate in uv h2o2 system that is consistent with the literature data wang et al 2017 focused on uv chlorine degradation of carbamazepine using 280 and 310 nm uv leds found that this scheme is much more effective that uv h2o2 process at the same oxidant dosage meanwhile photo chlorination increased the cytotoxicity and the content of adsorbable organochlorines aocl and high fluences 1233 mj cm2 were required to decrease the acute toxicity of the treated solution the available literature indicates the feasibility of uvc leds h2o2 as an environmentally safe technology for water treatment however most research was also conducted in pure water and on a batch scale the uvc leds h2o2 technology seems to be economically inapplicable for real water treatment due to the current high costs and low energy efficiencies of uvc leds moreover the treatment of turbid and high doc loaded water with short wavelength uvc light significantly decreases the actual delivered uv doses due to high scattering and absorbance additionally the combination of photo induced aops and ultrasound to enhance the ros production and improve the degradation process has also received much interest from the environmental researchers sathishkumar et al 2016 panda and manickam 2017 particularly sonolysis coupled with photocatalysis sonophotocatalysis using blue leds as a light source was shown to be applicable to degrade methylene blue zhang et al 2011 trypan blue and vesuvine mosleh et al 2016 however ultrasound enhanced photocatalysis using uv leds for pollutant degradation has not been exploited yet and represents a potentially effective hybrid technique 5 energy considerations energy consumption is an essential parameter for the assessment of efficiency and feasibility of a water treatment technology table 6 presents the energy requirements for degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous solution including earlier studies in terms of electrical energy per order e eo introduced by j r bolton as the electrical energy in kwh required to reduce the concentration of a contaminant by one order of magnitude in a m3 of contaminated water bolton and cater 1994 bolton et al 1996 2001 up to five orders of magnitude of e eo can be found in different reports for 90 removal of compounds in the wide concentration range of 0 1 50 mg l as can be seen in table 6 the energy requirements for o and p cresol elimination by uv tio2 were similar regardless of initial concentration moreover cpi provided somewhat lower e eo values chen et al 2007a b rasoulifard et al 2014 different classes of dyes required the electrical energy of order 102 103 kwh m3 whereas the highest energy demands up to 104 kwh m3 were obtained for dimethyl phthalate in uv tio2 system even under cpi conditions ku et al 2017 meanwhile up to 5 fold lower e eo values were obtained for elimination of ciprofloxacin ye et al 2016 ou et al 2016 and microcystin lr liu et al 2017b the authors of these papers concluded that these values were significantly lower than the values in the previous studies using lp uv for degradation of antipyrine uv h2o2 0 0109 kwh m3 uv ps 0 0234 kwh m3 tan et al 2013 or acetaminophen uv h2o2 0 0146 kwh m3 uv ps 0 0184 kwh m3 tan et al 2014 in fact the above indicated e eo values with hg lamps are comparable with those reported for uv ps degradation of ciprofloxacin ye et al 2016 lower energy requirements with uv leds compared to traditional uv lamps 1 7 4 8 times were demonstrated for uv ps treatment of basic red 46 rasoulifard et al 2011 in contrast substantially higher energy requirements 50 1200 kwh m3 for direct red 23 degradation than observed with 254 nm lamp lpl for basic yellow 2 degradation by uv ps scheme 4 2 68 9 kwh m3 salari et al 2009 were illustrated by rasoulifard et al 2015 nevertheless for uv tio2 process dominguez et al 2016 reported e eo values that were comparable with the previous similar studies with commercial lamps and concluded about the competitiveness of the led reactor in terms of energy efficiency rodríguez chueca et al 2015 and ferreira et al 2016 obtained close energy requirements for degradation of reactive black under similar experimental conditions table 6 in addition the e eo values with uva leds lamps were generally lower than that obtained with a mp mercury lamp 877 kwh m3 under the same conditions rodríguez chueca et al 2015 it is remarkable that all above studies with e eo estimations excluding umar et al 2015 de la obra et al 2017 were carried out in pure solutions or relatively high initial concentrations of target compounds in this regard the evaluation of energy requirements and operating costs for treatment of real matrices and low concentrations e g micropollutants at μg l level is desired in general given the high energy requirement of 2 65 kwh m3 or more bolton and cater 1994 using uv leds based aops under the conditions mentioned still remain an uncompetitive alternative in terms of e eo 6 future research assessing the potential application of uv leds for aops in water treatment we have the following recommendations for future research 1 simultaneous degradation of organic micro pollutants and microbial inactivation in aqueous media seems to be the focus of additional research since the same ros are responsible for oxidation and inactivation processes integrating these processes moreira et al 2016 garkusheva et al 2017 would allow reducing the energy requirements and treatment costs 2 developing uv led based advanced oxidation technologies for water treatment requires the selection of a led with an appropriate emission wavelength a long lifetime and a passive cooling for high power leds the preferable emission wavelength should be as long as possible uva nuv or even visible range due to considerably higher wpe values and lower costs of leds with longer wavelengths from this standpoint uva led based photocatalysis using the immobilized catalysts represents the best alternative aop for future investigations and practical applications 3 uva and nuv leds also represent an advantageous option for treating turbid waters natural and wastewater due to the lower light scattering effects in this regard more detailed studies on pollutant degradation in real water matrices at more environmentally relevant concentrations as well as an estimation of energy requirements and operating costs under real conditions are required in the near future 4 research on flow through encased reactors with easily adjustable width of the water layer is encouraged in general the higher the absorbance and turbidity of the water the thinner the layer of irradiated water that should flow through and the longer the wavelength that should be applied to reduce the light scattering flow rate and irradiance can be considered as key parameters to achieve the required uv doses for reasonable treatment times 5 hybrid oxidation methods based on the integrated use of uv leds and ultrasound without and in the presence of a photocatalyst sonophotocatalysis have not been explored and could represent a prospective research line and a powerful tool for water treatment 7 conclusions since 2014 uv leds have received extensive application for degrading organic pollutants in aqueous media by means of photo induced aops due to their advantageous size lifetime wavelength and light distribution control as well as environmental safety most previous work has been done on heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation in pure aqueous solutions using uva leds 360 nm and tio2 based nanostructures however practical implementation is still limited and at lab scale the latter is also related to uv h2o2 photo fenton and fenton like processes where uvb and uvc wavelengths have become frequently employed the high cost low output power and wpe of uvc diodes limits their applicability for water treatment to point of use systems however at this step of development uv leds as an alternative source of uv radiation to mercury lamps have proven to be effective for degradation and mineralization of various organic pollutants improvements in radiant efficiency and output power would increase the energy efficiency of uv leds making this technology cost competitive with traditional uv systems acknowledgments this work was conducted under the program of basic research of sb ras project no 0339 2016 0005 we thank

19744,the biological pump plays a critical role in the occurrence and fate of hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs mostly in temperate and frigid oligotrophic waters however the factors for the long term occurrence and fate of hocs in subtropical eutrophic waters remain largely unknown this study provides novel insights into biogeochemical and physical factors on the annual occurrence bioaccumulation and biomagnification of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in the plankton food webs of four chinese subtropical eutrophic lakes by one year simultaneous field observations for five compartments the annual mean σpah16 in the water columns ranged from 359 69 31 52 ng l 1 to 682 69 65 41 ng l 1 and increased with the annual mean trophic state index and phytoplankton biomass of these lakes but was independent on the proximity of the lakes to urban areas biodilution effect played an important role in the occurrence of the pahs in both phytoplankton and zooplankton in contrast to previous studies in oligotrophic waters not only the biological pump but also the equilibrium partitioning and the indirect influence of eutrophication high ph induced by phytoplankton and phytoplankton life cycling modulated the annual occurrence of the pahs in the water columns of these eutrophic lakes biphasic correlations were found between the bioaccumulation factors of the pahs by plankton and the temperature n 97 136 r2 0 06 0 24 p 008 and were related to plankton phenology bioaccumulation factors by plankton were dependent on the hydrophobicity of the pahs n 16 r2 0 27 0 31 p

temperature n 102 135 r2 0 06 0 13 p 004 but decreased with lake trophic state index biomagnification only occurred during phytoplankton bloom periods graphical abstract image 1 keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons plankton food webs bioaccumulation biomagnification eutrophic lake biological pump 1 introduction hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and organochlorine pesticides ocps are ubiquitous in aquatic environments posing great risks to organisms and humans due to their toxicity persistence and bioaccumulation potential berglund et al 2000 dachs et al 2002 jeremiason et al 1999 tao et al 2017a phytoplankton and zooplankton are the primary producer and primary predator in aquatic environments bioaccumulation and trophic transfer in plankton food webs are the first two steps for hocs to enter food webs elucidating and quantifying the factors for the occurrence and fate of hocs in plankton food webs will be of great help to understand and eliminate their risks in waters nizzetto et al 2012 one of the underlying mechanisms for the occurrence and fate of hocs in aquatic environments is uptake by phytoplankton and subsequently transferred to higher trophic level organisms or to deeper water and sediment by phytoplankton derived organic matter when phytoplankton bloom phytoplankton deplete the dissolved hocs in the water column reduce their concentrations in aquatic organisms and enhance their air water exchange fluxes sinking fluxes and sequestration in sediments dachs et al 2002 everaert et al 2015 jeremiason et al 1999 nizzetto et al 2012 the role of this biogeochemical process known as the biological pump in the sequestration of hocs has been intensively examined on the spatial scale in oceans in one growth season along the navigational route of a research vessel berrojalbiz et al 2011a 2011b casal et al 2017 dachs et al 2002 everaert et al 2015 morales et al 2015 in contrast empirical evidence of the working of the biological pump has been less studied on the temporal scale nizzetto et al 2012 investigated the coupling between phytoplankton biomass dynamics and the distribution and fate of pcbs in italian lake maggiore in the time frame of a few weeks berglund et al 2001 investigated the influence of trophic status on pcb distribution in sediments and biota in swedish lakes in spring and summer jeremiason et al 1999 compared biogeochemical cycling of pcbs in two experimental lakes of variable trophic status in ontario canada in the time frame of a few months everaert et al 2015 applied a model to explore the links between phytoplankton dynamics and pcb concentrations in marine sediments and biota in the north sea on a three decadal time scale all these studies provided very valuable information on the spatial and temporal occurrence and fate of hocs mostly in temperate and frigid regions and a few tropical and subtropical regions china has the largest subtropical lake density in the northern hemisphere downing et al 2006 and most of them are shallow lakes yang et al 2010 due to the rapid development of china currently 85 9 of these lakes are eutrophic or hyper eutrophic yang et al 2010 and suffer from the contamination of hocs fang et al 2014 li et al 2017 qin et al 2013 qiu et al 2010 ren et al 2017a shi et al 2017 especially the pahs li et al 2016 2017 tao et al 2010 tao et al 2017b 2017c in contrast to previous studied oligotrophic waters water chemistry and cycling of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and hocs in chinese subtropical lakes change faster due to higher annual mean water temperatures and plankton biomass and higher background levels of hocs in waters chuai et al 2011 tao et

may consequently be different from previous studies in oligotrophic waters to date the knowledge on the long term occurrence and fate of hocs in plankton food webs in chinese subtropical lakes has received little attention due to the lack of field observation the main objectives of this work are i to report a one year data set of the concentrations of 16 priority pahs in five compartments water dissolved organic carbon phytoplankton zooplankton and total suspended particles tsp of four chinese subtropical lakes with different trophic status on a biweekly basis ii to investigate the annual

located in nanjing with areas of 3 68 and 1 60 km2 and mean depths of 1 14 and 1 60 m lake jinniu is a rural lake 103 km far from nanjing with an area of 17 km2 and a mean depth of 5 74 m lake taihu is the third largest freshwater lake of china 230 km far from nanjing with an area of 2338 km2 and a mean depth of 1 89 m the annual mean temperature of this area is 15 16 c sampling campaigns were performed simultaneously at one site in each lake every ten to fifteen days from october 2015 to september 2016 all together 26 sampling campaigns were conducted for each lake water phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp were collected simultaneously from each lake during each sampling campaign twenty liters of water sample were collected separately from the depths of 30 60 and 90 cm and combined together as one sample zooplankton 112 μm composed of copepods and cladocerans were collected and concentrated from 50 l of combined water sample with a 112 μm mesh net and then transferred onto a pre combusted and pre weighed gf f glass fiber filter two liters of water sample after filtered with 112 μm mesh net was used to collect phytoplankton and tsp by sinking chen et al 2006 tao et al 2017b 2017c after sinking for 30 min an aliquot of 500 ml supernatant water was filtered through a gf f glass fiber filter to collect phytoplankton the tsp was collected by filtering the bottom water with a gf f glass fiber filter the result of chl a showed that more than 90 of the phytoplankton and tsp were separated by this method the samples of phytoplankton zooplankton tsp and surface sediments were freeze dried weighed and stored at 18 c until chemical analysis an aliquot of 500 ml of the filtered water was concentrated with a pre conditioned c18 solid phase extraction column to collect the dissolved pahs an aliquot of 50 ml of the filtered water was analyzed for dissolved organic carbon doc the mean temperature at the beginning the first ten days the middle the second ten days and the end the third ten days of each month was collected from local meteorology and used as the corresponding mean water temperature of each lake for each sampling campaign 2 3 chemical analysis the freeze dried filters with tsp phytoplankton and zooplankton were ground separately in a mortar to obtain homogeneous samples each of them was sonic extracted three times with 20 ml of n hexane and dichloromethane 1 1 v v each time the extract was reduced to approximately 5 ml with a rotary evaporator purged to 1 2 ml under a gentle nitrogen stream and then cleaned with a waters gel permeation

was operated at 70 ev the ion source temperature was 280 c the injector temperature was 300 c the pahs were scanned in the full scan mode for peak confirmation and quantified with characteristic ions in the selected ion monitoring mode 2 4 data analysis previous studies suggested that not only lipids but also other nonlipid organic materials played important roles in the accumulation of hocs by plankton borgå et al 2004 skoglund et al 1996 and not only the lipid content but also the composition and properties of lipids played important roles in bioaccumulation of hocs borgå et al 2004 lipid content only explained 40 of the total variation in dry weight normalized σpcb concentrations in plankton berglund et al 2000 furthermore adsorption on the surface of plankton also contributed to the uptake of hocs including less hydrophobic hocs due to the high surface area to volume ratio of plankton fan and reinfelder 2003 skoglund et al 1996 tao et al 2014 concentrations of the pahs in plankton were thereby normalized on dry weight here bioconcentration factor bcf was used to describe bioconcentration of the pah by phytoplankton which was defined as 1 bcf c p c fw where c p is the

consisted of pre extracted and baked out gf f filters were extracted and analyzed in the same way as the samples there was no difference between the concentrations in the laboratory and field blanks suggesting minimal contamination during transport storage and analysis calibration standard and solvent blank were run with each set of analysis the blank values were subtracted five surrogate standards naphthalene d8 acenaphthene d10 phenanthrene d10 chrysene d12 and perylene d12 were added to the samples and analyzed to quantify extraction efficiencies the recoveries of the surrogate standards varied from 71 to 103 a standard reference material sqci 016 nsi lab solutions was extracted and analyzed to confirm quantification accuracy the recoveries of the pahs in the reference

concentration of the 16 pahs σpah16 in the water columns composed of five compartments of water doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp of these lakes ranged from 201 22 67 53 to 1082 45 316 51 ng l 1 and increased with phytoplankton biomass fig 2c nap and phe were the dominant pah congeners in water phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp fig s3 the annual mean σpah16 in the water columns of these lakes increased in the order as lake baijia 359 69 31 52 ng l 1 lake jinniu 423 90 33 72 ng l 1 lake xuanwu 639 95 62 74 ng l 1 lake taihu 682 69 65 41 ng l 1 which was consistent with the orders of annual mean phytoplankton biomass and trophic state index of these lakes table s1 but was independent on the proximity of these lakes to urban areas the results demonstrated that eutrophication enhanced σpah16 in the water columns of these lakes it may be ascribed to lower turnover of organic carbon in the water column of more eutrophic lakes berglund et al 2001 the seasonal mean σpah16 in the water

bound σpah16 decreased with the ph fig 3 the concentrations of the pahs in the water columns of these lakes were comparable with those of other lakes in the same region such as lake chaohu qin et al 2013 and lake yueya tao et al 2015 although the annual mean phytoplankton biomass of these lakes ranged from 7 24 1 10 to 40 85 6 08 mg l 1 table s1 the percentages of σpah16 partitioning in water and phytoplankton to the total σpah16 in the water columns were not significantly different for different lakes varying from 40 43 3 31 to 47 61 4 09 and from 33 30 3 52 to 39 75 4 51 respectively biphasic correlations were found between the percentages of σpah16 partitioning in each compartment and the temperature fig 4 n 91 104 r2 0 049 0 234 p 03 the percentage of σpah16 in water decreased with the temperature when it was lower than 17 7 c but increased with the temperature when it continued to rise on the contrary inverse biphasic correlations were observed between the percentages of σpah16 in other compartments and the temperature fig 4 it may be attributed to the dynamics of plankton biomass doc and tsp correlated to the temperature and the equilibrium partitioning of the pahs between water and other compartments 3 3 factors for the annual occurrence of the pahs in the water columns although the σpah16 in the water columns increased with phytoplankton biomass fig 2c the factors for the occurrence of the pahs in the water columns were different during different periods the periods with different driving factors were separated to four types fig 5 the dynamics of σpah16 in doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp was inverse to that in water at most of the time type i in fig 5 furthermore the correlations between the percentages of the σpah16 in doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp and the temperature were inverse to that in water fig 4 the results suggested that equilibrium partitioning between water and other compartments dominated the distribution of the pahs in the water columns at most of the time the σpah16 and phytoplankton biomass in the water columns decreased sharply from 812 31 to 457 80 ng l 1 and from 29 70 to 16 73 mg l 1 from the end of october to the middle of november type ii in fig 5 furthermore the σpah16 in all the compartments was positively correlated to phytoplankton biomass additionally the mean temperature of this period was 14 3 0 4 c which was consistent with the overwintering temperature of phytoplankton in the field karentz and smayda 1984 settling and overwintering of phytoplankton may contribute to the sharp decrease in phytoplankton biomass in the water columns during this period hence atmospheric deposition especially the air water exchange modulated by the settling of overwintering phytoplankton dominated the occurrence of the pahs in the water columns during this period during the periods of the end of may the middle of june and the beginning of august the freely dissolved σpah16 was positively correlated to those of phytoplankton biomass and ph but the σpah16 in phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp was negatively correlated to phytoplankton biomass and ph type iii in fig 5 it was attributed to the indirect influence of eutrophication as proposed in our previous study tao et al 2017b which was described as follow phytoplankton biomass modulated by the temperature enhanced the ph of the water columns of these lakes fig 2a and b which consequently enhanced the freely dissolved σpah16 but reduced the doc bound σpah16 fig 3 and the bcfs bafs and k tsp water of the pahs fig 6 it can be ascribed to the enhanced surficial hydrophilicity of doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp due to the deprotonization of some chemical groups in the presence of high ph tao et al 2017b the mean ph of the water columns was 9 01 0 14 8 77 0 28 and 9 20 0 40 during the periods of the end of may the middle of june and the beginning of august respectively accumulation sorption of the pahs by doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp decreased consequently but the freely dissolved concentration increased during these periods in the middle period of april phytoplankton recruited from surface sediments to water columns in these lakes kong et al 2009 tao et al 2017a 2017b although phytoplankton biomass was as high as 34 49 12 86 mg l 1 the lowest concentration of σpah16 172 33 ng l 1 appeared in the water columns during this period type iv in fig 5 furthermore the σpah16 in all the compartments was low and negatively correlated to phytoplankton biomass fig 5 additionally the mean ph of the water columns was only 7 98 0 09 the affinity of the pahs for phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp was still high under this ph fig 6 therefore the probable process for the occurrence of the pahs in the water columns in the middle period of april was that the settling of phytoplankton derived organic matter depleted the freely dissolved pahs and consequently reduced the concentrations of the pahs in other compartments 3 4 bioaccumulation and biomagnification of the pahs in plankton food webs negative linear correlations were found between log c p of the pahs and the logarithm value of phytoplankton biomass log bp fig 7 suggesting that biodilution biological pump and or biodegradation drove the occurrence of the pahs in phytoplankton largely depending on the physicochemical properties of the pahs berrojalbiz et al 2011a tao et al 2017c the correlations can be described as 8 log c p m p log b p a where m p is the slope for the line a is the constant the results were consistent with the findings of taylor et al 1991 in temperate lakes in canada and berrojalbiz et al 2011a in the mediterranean who observed a decrease in concentrations of ocps and pcbs at high phytoplankton biomass the m p of the pahs varied from 0 54 to 0 91 here fig 7 biphasic correlation was found between m p and the log k ow of the pahs fig 8 the slopes of 2 3 ring pahs nap and acy and 5 6 ring pahs daha bghip and inp were much higher than the other pahs suggesting a higher control of c p by phytoplankton biomass for these pahs the results were different from those observed by berrojalbiz et al 2011b who found concentrations of pahs in plankton decreased at higher biomass only for low molecular weight pahs in the deep oligotrophic mediterranean and black seas one probable reason is that the pool of the pahs in the water columns of these lakes is large and can be rapidly compensated by atmospheric deposition he et al 2014 tao et al 2017b 2017c zhang et al 2013 and desorption from sediments due to the small depths of these lakes the larger m p values for 2 3 ring pahs may be attributed to the influence of enhanced degradation at high biomass berrojalbiz et al 2011b the larger m p values for 5 6 ring pahs may be ascribed to their greater sorption to settling organic matter berrojalbiz et al 2011b morales et al 2015 the lack of linear correlation between m p and log k ow of the pahs here may also be partly attributed to the dynamics of lipid content and species composition of phytoplankton borgå et al 2004 wainman et al 1993 negative linear correlations were also found between log c z of the pahs and the logarithm value of zooplankton biomass log bz fig s4 which can be described as 9 log c z m z log b z c where m z is the slope for the line c is the constant the values of m z for the pahs varied from 0 74 to 1 01 with the mean of 0 90 0 02 fig s4 fla bkf and daha had the largest slopes while bap and bghip had the lowest slopes there was no significant difference in the slopes for the other 11 pahs suggesting that the biodilution effect modulated the bioaccumulation of most of the pahs by zooplankton in these lakes the annual mean log bcfs and log bafs of the individual pahs by phytoplankton and zooplankton ranged from 4 50 0 07 to 5 36 0 09 and from 4 48 0 07 to 5 48 0 09 varying less than one logarithm unit throughout the year fig 9 chr had the largest bcf and baf in all the lakes log bcfs of the pahs decreased with phytoplankton biomass fig s5 n 94 103 r2 0 086 0 265 p 01 the annual mean bcfs and bafs of the pahs for these lakes increased in the order as lake taihu lake xuanwu lake baijia lake jinniu fig 9 which was inversely correlated to the annual mean phytoplankton biomass and trophic state index of these lakes fig 10 and table s1 the annual mean phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton biomass of lake taihu were 4 95 and 3 41 times higher than those of lake jinniu table s1 while the annual mean bcf and baf of the pahs in lake taihu were 3 55 and 2 75 times lower than those in lake jinniu fig 10 the results suggested that the biodilution effect predominantly modulated the annual bioaccumulation of the pahs by phytoplankton and zooplanktons in these lakes similar to previous studies on bioaccumulation of pcbs and ocps in temperate and frigid oligotrophic lakes berglund et al 2000 taylor et al 1991 both the annual mean log bcfs and log bafs increased with the log k ow of the pahs in these lakes fig 11 although the annual mean water temperature and trophic status of these lakes are much higher than those temperate and frigid oligotrophic waters berrojalbiz et al 2011a larsson et al 1992 taylor et al 1991 the correlation between bioaccumulation of hocs and the temperature has received little attention in the field study due to a dearth of long term data sets tao et al 2017a biphasic correlations were found between log bcfs and log bafs of the pahs and the mean temperature t in these lakes figs 12 and s6 n 97 136 r2 0 06 0 24 p 008 which were fitted by polynomial functions as 10 log bcf c 1 a 1 t b 1 t 2 11 log baf c 2 a 2 t b 2 t 2 the temperatures for the maximum log bcfs tm bcf of the pahs ranged from 10 8 to 17 8 c fig 12 and decreased with the log k ow of the pahs except inp fig s7 the mean tm bcf was 13 5 c which was consistent with the recruitment temperature of phytoplankton in the field cao et al 2008 karentz and smayda 1984 kong et al 2009 mehnert et al 2010 the temperatures for the maximum log bafs tm baf of the pahs varied from 12 3 to 19 5 c fig s6 the mean tm baf was 15 7 c which was consistent with the recruitment temperature of copepods and cladocerans in the field anderson and benke 1994 vijverberg 1980 the results here suggest that the annual bioaccumulation of the pahs by plankton are well related to plankton phenology it may be ascribed to the joint effect of the direct influence of temperature on thermodynamics of bioaccumulation and the biodilution effect indirectly induced by the temperature when the temperature is lower than the recruitment temperatures of plankton the uptake rate constant k u is greater than the growth rate constant k g fan and reinfelder 2003 the direct influence of temperature on thermodynamics of bioaccumulation thereby overwhelms the biodilution effect however when the temperature is higher than the recruitment temperatures of plankton k g is greater than k u the biomass dilution effect thereby dominates the bioaccumulation of the pahs fan and reinfelder 2003 the annual mean log bmfs of the pahs ranged from 0 004 0 05 to 0 14 0 05 fig 9 and increased with the log k ow of the pahs fig 11 biomagnification from phytoplankton to zooplankton was found for all the pahs in lake xuanwu and most of the pahs in lake taihu fig 9 however no biomagnification occurred for most of the pahs in lake jinniu and lake baijia fig 9 the annual mean log bmfs of the individual pahs for each lake increased in the order as lake jinniu lake baijia lake taihu lake xuanwu and was consistent with the trophic state index of these lakes fig 10 and table s1 in contrast to previous study on mercury bioaccumulation in lakes in the northeast usa which suggested that high plankton densities reduced mercury biomagnification chen and folt 2005 phytoplankton biomass enhanced the annual trophic transfer of the pahs from phytoplankton to zooplankton in these lakes fig 13 one probable reason is that the pool of the pahs in the water columns of these lakes is large and can be rapidly compensated by atmospheric deposition he et al 2014 tao et al 2017b 2017c zhang et al 2013 and desorption from sediments due to the small depths of these lakes the other probable reason is that the copepods and cladocerans directly or indirectly graze phytoplankton in these lakes which is confirmed by the positive correlation between the biomass of copepods and cladocerans and the phytoplankton biomass fig s2 however biomagnification of the pahs in the plankton food webs was only observed during algal bloom periods fig 14 it can be ascribed to the fact that the peaks of zooplankton biomass lag behind those of phytoplankton biomass in these lakes fig s1 the biodilution effect thereby had larger influence on bioaccumulation of the pahs by phytoplankton than by zooplankton during the algal bloom periods in contrast to log bcf and log baf the mean log bmfs of the individual pahs increased with the temperature fig s8 suggesting that temperature enhanced the annual transfer of the pahs from phytoplankton to copepods and cladocerans in these lakes 4 conclusions biogeochemical and physical factors for the annual occurrence bioaccumulation and biomagnification of 16 pahs in the plankton food webs of four subtropical eutrophic lakes were investigated in this study by one year simultaneous field observations for five compartments our results suggested that the annual mean trophic state index and phytoplankton biomass of these lakes enhanced the annual mean σpah16 in the water columns which was independent on the proximity to urban areas biodilution effect dominated the occurrence and bioaccumulation of the pahs in the plankton food webs in contrast to previous studies in oligotrophic waters not only the biological pump but also the equilibrium partitioning and the indirect influence of eutrophication modulated the annual occurrence of the pahs in the water columns of these eutrophic lakes biphasic correlations were found between the bcfs and bafs of the pahs and the temperature which were related to plankton phenology the bcfs bafs and bmfs were dependent on the hydrophobicity of the pahs trophic transfer of the pahs from phytoplankton to zooplankton increased with phytoplankton biomass and the temperature but decreased with lake trophic state index however biomagnification only occurred during phytoplankton bloom periods our study provides novel knowledge on the annual occurrence bioaccumulation and biomagnification of hocs in plankton food webs of subtropical eutrophic waters which may be of great help to understand and eliminate the risks of hocs in

five compartments the annual mean σpah16 in the water columns ranged from 359 69 31 52 ng l 1 to 682 69 65 41 ng l 1 and increased with the annual mean trophic state index and phytoplankton biomass of these lakes but was independent on the proximity of the lakes to urban areas biodilution effect played an important role in the occurrence of the pahs in both phytoplankton and zooplankton in contrast to previous studies in oligotrophic waters not only the biological pump but also the equilibrium partitioning and the indirect influence of eutrophication high ph induced by phytoplankton and

pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and organochlorine pesticides ocps are ubiquitous in aquatic environments posing great risks to organisms and humans due to their toxicity persistence and bioaccumulation potential berglund et al 2000 dachs et al 2002 jeremiason et al 1999 tao et al 2017a phytoplankton and zooplankton are the primary producer and primary predator in aquatic environments bioaccumulation and trophic transfer in plankton food webs are the first two steps for hocs to enter food webs elucidating and quantifying the factors for the occurrence and fate of hocs in plankton food webs will be of great help to understand and eliminate their risks in waters nizzetto et al 2012 one of the underlying mechanisms for the occurrence and fate of hocs in aquatic environments is uptake by phytoplankton and subsequently transferred to higher trophic level organisms or to deeper water and sediment by phytoplankton derived organic matter when phytoplankton bloom phytoplankton deplete the dissolved hocs in the water column reduce their concentrations in aquatic organisms and enhance their air water exchange fluxes sinking fluxes and sequestration in sediments dachs et al 2002 everaert et al 2015 jeremiason et al 1999 nizzetto et al 2012 the role of this biogeochemical process known as the biological pump in the sequestration of hocs has been intensively examined on the spatial scale in oceans in one growth season along the navigational route of a research vessel berrojalbiz et al 2011a 2011b casal et al 2017 dachs et al 2002 everaert et al 2015 morales et al 2015 in contrast empirical evidence of the working of the biological pump has been less studied on the temporal scale nizzetto et al 2012 investigated the coupling between phytoplankton biomass dynamics and the distribution and fate of pcbs in italian lake maggiore in the time frame of a few weeks berglund et al 2001 investigated the influence of trophic status on pcb distribution in sediments and biota in swedish lakes in spring and summer jeremiason et al 1999 compared biogeochemical cycling of pcbs in two experimental lakes of variable trophic status in ontario canada in the time frame of a few months everaert et al 2015 applied a model to explore the links between phytoplankton dynamics and pcb concentrations in marine sediments and biota in the north sea on a three decadal time scale all these studies provided very valuable information on the spatial and temporal occurrence and fate of hocs mostly in temperate and frigid regions and a few tropical and subtropical regions china has the largest subtropical lake density in the northern hemisphere downing et al 2006 and most of them are shallow lakes yang et al 2010 due to the rapid development of

phosphorus and hocs in chinese subtropical lakes change faster due to higher annual mean water temperatures and plankton biomass and higher background levels of hocs in waters chuai et al 2011 tao et

may consequently be different from previous studies in oligotrophic waters to date the knowledge on the long term occurrence and fate of hocs in plankton food webs in chinese subtropical lakes has received little attention due to the lack of field observation the main objectives of this work are i to report a one year data set of the concentrations of 16 priority pahs in five compartments water dissolved organic carbon phytoplankton zooplankton and total suspended particles tsp of four chinese subtropical lakes with different trophic status on a biweekly basis ii to investigate the annual biogeochemical and physical factors for the occurrence bioaccumulation and biomagnification of the pahs in the plankton food webs of these lakes and iii to provide novel knowledge on the annual occurrence bioaccumulation and biomagnification of hocs in plankton food webs of subtropical eutrophic waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials sixteen priority pahs including

new haven usa were used for quantification all solvents used were of hplc grade merk germany 2 2 site description and sample collection four chinese subtropical lakes with different trophic state index were chosen for this study fig 1 and table s1 trophic state index was calculated according to the studies of carlson 1977 and hu et al 2014 lake xuanwu and lake baijia are shallow urban lakes located in nanjing with areas of 3 68 and 1 60 km2 and mean depths of 1 14 and 1 60 m lake jinniu is a rural lake 103 km far from nanjing with an area of 17 km2 and a mean depth of 5 74 m lake taihu is the third largest freshwater lake of china 230 km far from nanjing with an area of 2338 km2 and a mean depth of 1 89 m the annual mean temperature of this area is 15 16 c sampling campaigns were performed simultaneously at one site in each lake every ten to fifteen days from october 2015 to september 2016 all together 26 sampling campaigns were conducted for each lake water phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp were collected simultaneously from each lake during each sampling campaign twenty liters of water sample were collected separately from the depths of 30 60 and 90 cm and combined together as one sample zooplankton 112 μm composed of copepods and cladocerans were collected and concentrated from 50 l of combined water sample with a 112 μm mesh net and then transferred onto a pre combusted and pre weighed gf f glass fiber filter two liters of water sample after filtered with 112 μm mesh net was used to collect phytoplankton and tsp by sinking chen et al 2006 tao et al 2017b 2017c after sinking for 30 min an aliquot of 500 ml supernatant water was filtered through a gf f glass fiber filter to collect phytoplankton the tsp was collected by filtering the bottom water with a gf f glass fiber filter the result of chl a showed that more than 90 of the phytoplankton and tsp were separated by this method the samples of phytoplankton zooplankton tsp and surface sediments were freeze dried weighed and stored at 18 c until chemical analysis an aliquot of 500 ml of the filtered water was concentrated with a pre conditioned c18 solid phase extraction column to collect the dissolved pahs an aliquot of 50 ml of the filtered water was analyzed for dissolved organic carbon doc the mean temperature at the beginning the first ten days the middle the second ten days and the end the third ten days of each month was collected from local meteorology and used as the corresponding mean water temperature of each lake for each sampling campaign 2 3 chemical analysis the freeze dried filters with tsp phytoplankton and zooplankton were ground separately in a mortar to obtain homogeneous samples each of them was sonic extracted three times with 20 ml of n hexane and dichloromethane 1 1 v v each time the extract was reduced to approximately 5 ml with a rotary evaporator purged to 1 2 ml under a gentle nitrogen stream and then cleaned with a waters gel permeation chromatography gpc composed of 1515 isocratic pump 2707 auto sampler 2489 uv vis detector fraction collector iii and an envirogel gpc cleanup column 19 mm 150 mm the mobile phase was consisted of n hexane dichloromethane 1 1 v v and pumped at a rate of 1 5 ml min the eluate was evaporated solvent exchanged to n hexane 100 μl and analyzed immediately the c18 solid phase extraction column was eluted with 70 ml of n hexane dichloromethane 7 3 v v the eluate was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate then evaporated solvent exchanged to n hexane 100 μl and analyzed immediately the pahs were analyzed by a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 7890 5977 with a db 5ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm i d 0 25 mm film thickness using electron ionization splitless injection of 1 0

was operated at 70 ev the ion source temperature was 280 c the injector temperature was 300 c the pahs were scanned in the full scan mode for peak confirmation and quantified with characteristic ions in the selected ion monitoring mode 2 4 data analysis previous studies suggested that not only lipids but also other nonlipid organic materials played important roles in the accumulation of hocs by plankton borgå et al 2004 skoglund et al 1996 and not only the lipid content but also the composition and properties of lipids played important roles in bioaccumulation of hocs borgå et al 2004 lipid content only explained 40 of the total variation in dry weight normalized σpcb concentrations in plankton berglund et al 2000 furthermore adsorption on the surface of plankton also contributed to the uptake of hocs including less hydrophobic hocs due to the high surface area to volume ratio of plankton fan and reinfelder 2003 skoglund et al 1996 tao et al 2014 concentrations of the pahs in plankton were thereby normalized on dry weight here bioconcentration factor bcf was used to describe bioconcentration of the pah by phytoplankton which was defined as 1 bcf c p c fw where c p is the concentration of the pah in phytoplankton ng g 1 d w c fw is the freely dissolved concentration of the pah in the water column ng l 1 and is calculated with the concentration of the pah in the water column c w ng l 1 the content of doc f doc mg l 1 and the doc water partitioning coefficient k doc l kg 1 of the pah as 2 c f w c w 1 f d o c k doc the k doc of the pah was calculated according to the review of burkhard 2000 as 3 k d o c 0 08 k o w the concentration of the pah in doc c doc ng l 1 was calculated as 4 c d o c c w c f w bioaccumulation factor baf was used to describe bioaccumulation

tsp is the concentration of the pah in tsp ng g 1 d w 2 5 quality control and statistical analysis seven concentration levels were prepared for calibration standards laboratory and field blanks consisted of pre extracted and baked out gf f filters were extracted and analyzed in the same way as the samples there was no difference between the concentrations in the laboratory and field blanks suggesting minimal contamination during transport storage and analysis calibration standard and solvent blank were run with each set of analysis the blank values were subtracted five surrogate standards naphthalene d8 acenaphthene d10 phenanthrene d10 chrysene d12 and perylene d12 were added to the samples and analyzed to quantify extraction efficiencies the recoveries of the surrogate standards varied from 71 to 103 a standard reference material sqci 016 nsi lab solutions was extracted and analyzed to confirm quantification accuracy the recoveries of the pahs in the reference material were between 72 and 108 detection limits defined as s n 3 were 0 50 1 00 ng g 1 d w for the pahs the method of one sample t test was used to compare the means analyses of variance anova followed by a tukey s pair wise comparison test were used to evaluate the differences in means between groups results were considered to be significant if p 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamics of planktonic biomass ph doc and tsp in the water columns the phytoplankton biomass in the water columns of these lakes varied from 0 75 to 76 88 mg l 1 d w during the studied periods fig s1 and increased with the mean temperature of this area fig 2 a the biomass of copepods and cladocerans varied from 12 20 to 693 30 μg l 1 d w fig s1 and was correlated to the phytoplankton biomass fig s2 the peaks of copepods and cladocerans biomass lagged behind those of phytoplankton biomass fig s1 the ph of the water columns ranged from 7 15 to 10 04 and increased with phytoplankton biomass fig 2b the mean concentrations of tsp and doc in the water columns ranged from 3 08 to 12 11 mg l 1 d w and from 2 81 to 7 57 mg l 1 3 2 annual occurrence of the pahs in the water columns the total concentration of the 16 pahs σpah16 in the water columns composed of five compartments of water doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp of these lakes ranged from 201 22 67 53 to 1082 45 316 51 ng l 1 and increased with phytoplankton biomass fig 2c nap and phe were the dominant pah congeners in water phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp fig s3 the annual mean σpah16 in the water columns of these lakes increased in the order as lake baijia 359 69 31 52 ng l 1 lake jinniu 423 90 33 72 ng l 1 lake xuanwu 639 95 62 74 ng l 1 lake taihu 682 69 65 41 ng l 1 which was consistent with the orders of annual mean phytoplankton biomass and trophic state index of these lakes table s1 but was independent on the proximity of these lakes to urban areas the results demonstrated that eutrophication enhanced σpah16 in the water columns of these lakes it may be ascribed to lower turnover of organic carbon in the water column of more eutrophic lakes berglund et al 2001 the seasonal mean σpah16 in the water

water columns was 526 56 28 48 ng l 1 the annual mean σpah16 partitioning in water freely dissolved doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp were 214 92 17 18 26 72 2 72 212 41 27 86 1 13 0 20 and 66 71 10 08 ng l 1 accounting for 41 18 5 12 40 70 0 21 and 12 78 of the total σpah16 in the water columns respectively the freely dissolved σpah16 increased with the ph of the water columns while the doc bound σpah16 decreased with the ph fig 3 the concentrations of the pahs in the water columns of these lakes were comparable with those of other lakes in the same region such as lake chaohu qin et al 2013 and lake yueya tao et al 2015 although the annual mean phytoplankton biomass of these lakes ranged from 7 24 1 10 to 40 85 6 08 mg l 1 table s1 the percentages of σpah16 partitioning in water and phytoplankton to the total σpah16 in the water columns were not significantly different for different lakes varying from 40 43 3 31 to 47 61 4 09 and from 33 30 3 52 to 39 75 4 51 respectively biphasic correlations were found between the percentages of σpah16 partitioning in each compartment and the temperature fig 4 n 91 104 r2 0 049 0 234 p 03 the percentage of σpah16 in water decreased with the temperature when it was lower than 17 7 c but increased with the temperature when it continued to rise on the contrary inverse biphasic correlations were observed between the percentages of σpah16 in other compartments and the temperature fig 4 it may be attributed to the dynamics of plankton biomass doc and tsp correlated to the temperature and the equilibrium partitioning of the pahs between water and other compartments 3 3 factors for the annual occurrence of the pahs in the water columns although the σpah16 in the water columns increased with phytoplankton biomass fig 2c the factors for the occurrence of the pahs in the water columns were different during different periods the periods with different driving factors were separated to four types fig 5 the dynamics of σpah16 in doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp was inverse to that in water at most of the time type i in fig 5 furthermore the correlations between the percentages of the σpah16 in doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp and the temperature were inverse to that in water fig 4 the results suggested that equilibrium partitioning between water and other compartments dominated the distribution of the pahs in the water columns at most of the time the σpah16 and phytoplankton biomass in the water columns decreased sharply from 812 31 to 457 80 ng l 1 and from 29 70 to 16 73 mg l 1 from the end of october to the middle of november type ii in fig 5 furthermore the σpah16 in all the compartments was positively correlated to phytoplankton biomass additionally the mean temperature of this period was 14 3 0 4 c which was consistent with the overwintering temperature of phytoplankton in the field karentz and smayda 1984 settling and overwintering of phytoplankton may contribute to the sharp decrease in phytoplankton biomass in the water columns during this period hence atmospheric deposition especially the air water exchange modulated by the settling of overwintering phytoplankton dominated the occurrence of the pahs in the water columns during this period during the periods of the end of may the middle of june and the beginning of august the freely dissolved σpah16 was positively correlated to those of phytoplankton biomass and ph but the σpah16 in phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp was negatively correlated to phytoplankton biomass and ph type iii in fig 5 it was attributed to the indirect influence of eutrophication as proposed in our previous study tao et al 2017b which was described as follow phytoplankton biomass modulated by the temperature enhanced the ph of the water columns of these lakes fig 2a and b which consequently enhanced the freely dissolved σpah16 but reduced the doc bound σpah16 fig 3 and the bcfs bafs and k tsp water of the pahs fig 6 it can be ascribed to the enhanced surficial hydrophilicity of doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp due to the deprotonization of some chemical groups in the presence of high ph tao et al 2017b the mean ph of the water columns was 9 01 0 14 8 77 0 28 and 9 20 0 40 during the periods of the end of may the middle of june and the beginning of august respectively accumulation sorption of the pahs by doc phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp decreased consequently but the freely dissolved concentration increased during these periods in the middle period of april phytoplankton recruited from surface sediments to water columns in these lakes kong et al 2009 tao et al 2017a 2017b although phytoplankton biomass was as high as 34 49 12 86 mg l 1 the lowest concentration of σpah16 172 33 ng l 1 appeared in the water columns during this period type iv in fig 5 furthermore the σpah16 in all the compartments was low and negatively correlated to phytoplankton biomass fig 5 additionally the mean ph of the water columns was only 7 98 0 09 the affinity of the pahs for phytoplankton zooplankton and tsp was still high under this ph fig 6 therefore the probable process for the occurrence of the pahs in the water columns in the middle period of april was that the settling of phytoplankton derived organic matter depleted the freely dissolved pahs and consequently reduced the concentrations of the pahs in other compartments 3 4 bioaccumulation and biomagnification of the pahs in plankton food webs negative linear correlations were found between log c p of the pahs and the logarithm value of phytoplankton biomass log bp fig 7 suggesting that biodilution biological pump and or biodegradation drove the occurrence of the pahs in phytoplankton largely depending on the physicochemical properties of the pahs berrojalbiz et al 2011a tao et al 2017c the correlations can be described as 8 log c p m p log b p a where m p is the slope for the line a is the constant the results were consistent with the findings of taylor et al 1991 in temperate lakes in canada and berrojalbiz et al 2011a in the mediterranean who observed a decrease in concentrations of ocps and pcbs at high phytoplankton biomass the m p of the pahs varied from 0 54 to 0 91 here fig 7 biphasic correlation was found between m p and the log k ow of the pahs fig 8 the slopes of 2 3 ring pahs nap and acy and 5 6 ring pahs daha bghip and inp were much higher than the other pahs suggesting a higher control of c p by phytoplankton biomass for these pahs the results were different from those observed by berrojalbiz et al 2011b who found concentrations of pahs in plankton decreased at higher biomass only for low molecular weight pahs in the deep oligotrophic mediterranean and black seas one probable reason is that the pool of the pahs in the water columns of these lakes is large and can be rapidly compensated by atmospheric deposition he et al 2014 tao et al 2017b 2017c zhang et al 2013 and desorption from sediments due to the small depths of these lakes the larger m p values for 2 3 ring pahs may be attributed to the influence of enhanced degradation at high biomass berrojalbiz et al 2011b the larger m p values for 5 6 ring pahs may be ascribed to their greater sorption to settling organic matter berrojalbiz et al 2011b morales et al 2015 the lack of linear correlation between m p and log k ow of the pahs here may also be partly attributed to the dynamics of lipid content and species composition of phytoplankton borgå et al 2004 wainman et al 1993 negative linear correlations were also found between log c z of the pahs and the logarithm value of zooplankton biomass log bz fig s4 which can be described as 9 log c z m z log b z c where m z is the slope for the line c is the constant the values of m z for the pahs varied from 0 74 to 1 01 with the mean of 0 90 0 02 fig s4 fla bkf and daha had the largest slopes while bap and bghip had the lowest slopes there was no significant difference in the slopes for the other 11 pahs suggesting that the biodilution effect modulated the bioaccumulation of most of the pahs by zooplankton in these lakes the annual mean log bcfs and log bafs of the individual pahs by phytoplankton and zooplankton ranged from 4 50 0 07 to 5 36 0 09 and from 4 48 0 07 to 5 48 0 09 varying less than one logarithm unit throughout the year fig 9 chr had the largest bcf and baf in all the lakes log bcfs of the pahs decreased with phytoplankton biomass fig s5 n 94 103 r2 0 086 0 265 p 01 the annual mean bcfs and bafs of the pahs for these lakes increased in the order as lake taihu lake xuanwu lake baijia lake jinniu fig 9 which was inversely correlated to the annual mean phytoplankton biomass and trophic state index of these lakes fig 10 and table s1 the annual mean phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton biomass of lake taihu were 4 95 and 3 41 times higher than those of lake jinniu table s1 while the annual mean bcf and baf of the pahs in lake taihu were 3 55 and 2 75 times lower than those in lake jinniu fig 10 the results suggested that the biodilution effect predominantly modulated the annual bioaccumulation of the pahs by phytoplankton and zooplanktons in these lakes similar to previous studies on bioaccumulation of pcbs and ocps in temperate and frigid oligotrophic lakes berglund et al 2000 taylor et al 1991 both the annual mean log bcfs and log bafs increased with the log k ow of the pahs in these lakes fig 11 although the annual mean water temperature and trophic status of these lakes are much higher than those temperate and frigid oligotrophic waters berrojalbiz et al 2011a larsson et al 1992 taylor et al 1991 the correlation between bioaccumulation of hocs and the temperature has received little attention in the field study due to a dearth of long term data sets tao et al 2017a biphasic correlations were found between log bcfs and log bafs of the pahs and the mean temperature t in these lakes figs 12 and s6 n 97 136 r2 0 06 0 24 p 008 which were fitted by polynomial functions as 10 log bcf c 1 a 1 t b 1 t 2 11 log baf c 2 a 2 t b 2 t 2 the temperatures for the maximum log bcfs tm bcf of the pahs ranged from 10 8 to 17 8 c fig 12 and decreased with the log k ow of the pahs except inp fig s7 the mean tm bcf was 13 5 c which was consistent with the recruitment temperature of phytoplankton in the field cao et al 2008 karentz and smayda 1984 kong et al 2009 mehnert et al 2010 the temperatures for the maximum log bafs tm baf of the pahs varied from 12 3 to 19 5 c fig s6 the mean tm baf was 15 7 c which was consistent with the recruitment temperature of copepods and cladocerans in the field anderson and benke 1994 vijverberg 1980 the results here suggest that the annual bioaccumulation of the pahs by plankton are well related to plankton phenology it may be ascribed to the joint effect of the direct influence of temperature on thermodynamics of bioaccumulation and the biodilution effect indirectly induced by the temperature when the temperature is lower than the recruitment temperatures of plankton the uptake rate constant k u is greater than the growth rate constant k g fan and reinfelder 2003 the direct influence of temperature on thermodynamics of bioaccumulation thereby overwhelms the biodilution effect however when the temperature is higher than the recruitment temperatures of plankton k g is greater than k u the biomass dilution effect thereby dominates the bioaccumulation of the pahs fan and reinfelder 2003 the annual mean log bmfs of the pahs ranged from 0 004 0 05 to 0 14 0 05 fig 9 and increased with the log k ow of the pahs fig 11 biomagnification from phytoplankton to zooplankton was found for all the pahs in lake xuanwu and most of the pahs in lake taihu fig 9 however no biomagnification occurred for most of the pahs in lake jinniu and lake baijia fig 9 the annual mean log bmfs of the individual pahs for each lake increased in the order as lake jinniu lake baijia lake taihu lake xuanwu and was consistent with the trophic state index of these lakes fig 10 and table s1 in contrast to previous study on mercury bioaccumulation in lakes in the northeast usa which suggested that high plankton densities reduced mercury biomagnification chen and folt 2005 phytoplankton biomass enhanced the annual trophic transfer of the pahs from phytoplankton to zooplankton in these lakes fig 13 one probable reason is that the pool of the pahs in the water columns of these lakes is large and can be rapidly compensated by atmospheric deposition he et al 2014 tao et al 2017b 2017c zhang et al 2013 and desorption from sediments due to the small depths of these lakes the other probable reason is that the copepods and cladocerans directly or indirectly graze phytoplankton in these lakes which is confirmed by the positive correlation between the biomass of copepods and cladocerans and the phytoplankton biomass fig s2 however biomagnification of the pahs in the plankton food webs was only observed during algal bloom periods fig 14 it can be ascribed to the fact that the peaks of zooplankton biomass lag behind those of phytoplankton biomass in these lakes fig s1 the biodilution effect thereby had larger influence on bioaccumulation of the pahs by phytoplankton than by zooplankton during the algal bloom periods in contrast to log bcf and log baf the mean log bmfs of the individual pahs increased with the temperature fig s8 suggesting that temperature enhanced the annual transfer of the pahs from phytoplankton to copepods and cladocerans in these lakes 4 conclusions biogeochemical and physical factors for the annual occurrence bioaccumulation and biomagnification of 16 pahs in the plankton food webs of four subtropical eutrophic lakes were investigated in this study by one year simultaneous field observations for five compartments our results suggested that the annual mean trophic state index and phytoplankton biomass of these lakes enhanced the annual mean σpah16 in the water columns which was independent on the proximity to urban areas biodilution effect dominated the occurrence and bioaccumulation of the pahs in the plankton food webs in contrast to previous studies in oligotrophic waters not only the biological pump but also the equilibrium partitioning and the indirect influence of eutrophication modulated the annual occurrence of the pahs in the water columns of these eutrophic lakes biphasic correlations were found between the bcfs and bafs of the pahs and the temperature which were related to plankton phenology the bcfs bafs and bmfs were dependent on the hydrophobicity of the pahs trophic transfer of the pahs from phytoplankton to zooplankton increased with phytoplankton biomass and the temperature but decreased with lake trophic state index however biomagnification only occurred during phytoplankton bloom periods our study provides novel knowledge on the annual occurrence bioaccumulation and biomagnification of hocs in plankton food webs of subtropical eutrophic waters which may be of great help to understand and eliminate the risks of hocs in such waters acknowledgments this work was funded by natural science foundation of china 41471400 natural science foundation of jiangsu province bk20170049 youth innovation promotion association cas
