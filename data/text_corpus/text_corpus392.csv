1960,the plains of the lower reaches of rivers are important areas for food production in the groundwater of irrigated agricultural areas of these regions the n2o concentration was generally observed to be higher than that of the water gas equilibrium due to the complexity and uncertainty of the aquifers the mechanisms by which groundwater n2o are affected by groundwater hydrogeology and geochemistry remain unexplored in this study 41 groundwater samples were collected from three zones of the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river i e piedmont plain coastal plain and central plain and the hydrogeological parameters of these three areas were characterized the results showed significant differences of the n2o concentration in the groundwater of the three zones of the lower reaches of yellow river plain which was 14 1 13 1 µg l 1 84 1 48 µg l and 36 5 40 5 µg l for the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain respectively the differences were attributed to different groundwater n input and hydrogeological parameters in the three zones the infiltration coefficient of precipitation was found to be the most important hydrogeological parameter affecting groundwater n2o this study also evaluated the indirect n2o emission factor in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river the n2o emissions induced by groundwater exploitation in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river were found to be 1 87 g hm 2 year 1 these findings provide a foundation to develop strategies to reduce n2o production and emissions in the agricultural area of the lower reaches of rivers keywords n2o groundwater hydrogeological parameters geochemical parameters the irrigation area of lower reaches of yellow river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the rising concentration of nitrous oxide n2o in the atmosphere is causing serious problems such as global warming and ozone layer depletion which hinder the stable development of human society makowski 2019 harris et al 2022 agricultural activities are an important source of n2o emissions tubiello et al 2013 thompson et al 2019 and research on n2o emissions in agricultural areas is a current research hotspot tesfaye et al 2021 ashiq et al 2022 maier et al 2022 mendoza beltran et al 2022 in recent years the increased use of fertilizers has led to large amounts of n accumulation in the groundwater ju et al 2009 savcı 2012 cassman and dobermann 2022 and n transformation results in elevated n2o concentration in the groundwater jurado et al 2017 subsequently groundwater has also become one of the important emission sources of n2o in agricultural areas the dynamic change process of n2o in the groundwater is complex and affected by many factors the mechanisms of the n2o dynamic process in the groundwater have an obvious hierarchy fig 1 firstly the production of n2o is mainly controlled by denitrification in the groundwater vilain et al 2012 jahangir et al 2013 li et al 2021a denitrification can occur biologically or abiotically but in the groundwater the former is more common since the organisms capable of denitrification i e denitrifiers tend to be ubiquitous in the groundwater groffman et al 1998 jahangir et al 2013 li et al 2021a secondly nitrogen transformation depends on the geochemistry of the groundwater e g redox conditions and electron donors philippe and hill 2004 rivett et al 2008b tesoriero and puckett 2011 zhao li et al 2021 thirdly groundwater geochemistry is influenced by groundwater hydrology e g variation in the groundwater depth rainfall periods and aquifer permeability jungkunst et al 2008 jurado et al 2018a in the natural environment groundwater hydrology affects groundwater n2o by its influence on groundwater geochemistry previous studies showed that rainfall periods water filled pore space wfps and fluctuations of groundwater depth had an important influence on groundwater n2o in agricultural areas weymann et al 2008 kim et al 2009 li et al 2021b jurado et al 2018a also reported the influence of different aquifer characteristics on groundwater n2o in the walloon region of belgium the chalks of mons with better permeability had a higher n2o concentration and the n2o in the aquifer was mainly from nitrification in the unsaturated zone in contrast the limestone aquifer of the namur basin the jurassic formations and the meuse gravels aquifer with low permeability and semi oxic or anoxic had relatively low n2o concentrations jurado et al 2018b however due to the spatial complexity of aquifers the mechanisms by which groundwater hydrogeology affect n2o in groundwater through its influence on groundwater geochemistry are still not clear the irrigation area in the lower reaches of yellow river is located in the central and southern parts of the north china plain ncp as one of the important grain producing areas in china its groundwater faces the threat of n leaching from the farmland like other important grain producing areas in the world van es et al 2002 oenema et al 2005 nila rekha et al 2011 letey and vaughan 2013 libutti and monteleone 2017 according to the geomorphic features the irrigation area in the lower reaches of yellow river is divided into three zones i e the piedmont plain the central plain and the coastal plain the characteristics of aquifers in each area provide distinguished natural conditions for studying the influence of aquifer characteristics on n2o in shallow groundwater in addition groundwater extraction is high in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river which is mainly used for agricultural irrigation liu et al 2001 feng et al 2013 yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 in recent years with the operation of the south north water diversion project and the implementation of strict control policies on groundwater extraction the groundwater extraction in the ncp has dropped from 1 57 1011 m3 year 1 to 1 00 1011 m3 year 1 per year yang et al 2021 however there is still a large amount of groundwater extracted for irrigation in the ncp n2o release from groundwater extraction in the region thus may be a potentially important source of n2o emissions the objectives of this paper were to 1 explore the effects of groundwater hydrogeology and geochemistry on groundwater n2o and 2 estimate n2o emissions by groundwater exploitation this study provided comprehensive data of n2o in groundwater in the lower reaches of yellow river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted within the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river in the temperate semi arid monsoon climate zone the main crops planted in the study area were maize wheat and cotton winter wheat summer maize rotation was the main planting pattern in the study area accounting for 70 of the planting area irrigation water was from groundwater and yellow river the elevation gradually decreased from the west to the east in the study area the main soil types included fluvo aquic soils yellow earths and yellow cinnamon soils the main mineral included quartz anorthite potassium feldspar calcite dolomite and clay mineral the pyrite was the trace mineral and made up a very small proportion of the aquifer minerals in study area fertilization was conducted mainly three times a year including before sowing winter wheat in november after sowing winter wheat in february or march and before sowing summer maize in july the fertilizers were either urea or compound fertilizer 2 2 aquifer profile the complexity of the spatial distribution of water bearing media complicated groundwater distribution and circulation this study mainly focused on the aquifer with a floor depth of 10 50 m which served as the main water supply aquifer in the study area according to the landform features the study area was divided into three zones i e the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain fig 2 the lithology of the shallow aquifer in the piedmont plain was mainly gravel medium coarse sand and medium fine sand so it had good vertical continuity and high permeability at the same time it was connected to the valley aquifer where runoff recharge could occur the aquifers in the central and coastal plains were similar in lithology and were mainly composed of silt and fine sand in addition there were clay layers with poor permeability in some unsaturated areas of the coastal plain which led to poor recharge by precipitation in the coastal plain anyhow it was characterized by a gradual transition from a single phreatic aquifer composed of sand and gravel in the middle and upper part of the piedmont alluvial fan in the northwest to a multi layered aquifer interbedded with sand silt and clay in the alluvial plain and coastal plain in the middle and eastern part from the front of the mountain to the coast the sand particles became thinner and thinner and the viscous soil layer became thicker the complexity of spatial distribution of water bearing media complicated the circulation and distribution of groundwater in the natural state the drainage of groundwater in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river included spring overflow phreatic evaporation and lateral runoff at present artificial groundwater exploitation was mainly used for agricultural irrigation the groundwater evaporation intensity in the study area varied greatly among different regions and the phreatic evaporation was mainly related to the groundwater table the lithology of the aquifer surface vegetation and climate at the same time groundwater in the study area had the characteristics of concentrated replenishment in the rainy season and perennial discharge and consumption 2 3 groundwater sampling groundwater samples were collected from 41 wells within the study area fig 2 samples were obtained from three zones 1 piedmont plain 2 central plain and 3 coastal plain all sampling points were located in shallow aquifers at depths varying from 30 to 50 m the groundwater samples were collected in march 2019 and the dissolved n2o concentration and presence of primary anions were analyzed to eliminate the interference of water in the wellbore groundwater was pumped for at least three wellbore volumes to stabilize the groundwater withdraw jurado et al 2018b nikolenko et al 2019 afterward a closed flow cell was used to collect 5 l of water and a portable multimeter hq40d hach usa was employed to measure the ph electrical conductivity ec μs cm do mg l and temperature c to analyze for dissolved n2o approximately 500 ml of groundwater was poured into a 250 ml borosilicate serum vial and allowed to overflow to prevent any ambient air from being stored in the bottle headspace the sample was preserved by adding 1 ml of saturated hgcl2 and immediately sealed with a butyl rubber stopper the vial was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c and transported to the laboratory within 48 h n2o concentrations were determined using the headspace equilibration technique 100 ml n2 headspace in 250 ml serum bottles and measured with a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a usa the concentration of dissolved n2o was calculated using the equation of weiss and price 1980 another 500 ml of groundwater was then collected in a 250 ml plastic bottle using the same method but without the addition of the preservative the samples were then stored in a refrigerator at 4 c and transported to the laboratory within 48 h of sampling to analyze for doc no3 so4 2 f and cl 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 major and minor ions of groundwater analysis of groundwater samples for major and minor ions was performed at the laboratory of the institute of geographic science and natural resources research and yucheng comprehensive experiment station chinese academy of sciences 2 4 2 indirect emission factor of groundwater n2o the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc provided the method of ef5 to evaluate the n2o emission factor for indirect n2o emissions resulting from n leaching in agricultural areas ipcc 2006 which is subdivided into three subcategories 1 ef ef 5 g 0 0025 ef 5 r 0 0025 ef 5 e 0 0025 where ef 5 g is the emission factor from groundwater ef5r is the emission factor from rivers and ef5e is the emission factor from estuarine coastal areas the ipcc defined ef5g as either i the ratio between n2o emission to the atmosphere n2o nout and n input to the system total ninput or ii the ratio of dissolved n2o n to no3 n in the water body as many studies often lacked information on n2o emissions and total ninput of the groundwater most ef5g data reported in the literature were derived from the ratio of dissolved n2o n to no3 n in groundwater 2 4 3 groundwater n2o emissions caused by groundwater exploitation the calculation method of n2o emissions induced by groundwater exploitation in the lower reaches of yellow river plain was based on the study by jurado et al 2018b 2 en 2 o gw p q abs cn 2 o obs cn 2 o eq where en 2 o gw p is the n2o emission flux caused by groundwater exploitation q abs is the average amount of groundwater extraction cn 2 o obs is the n2o concentration of groundwater at the sampling point and cn 2 o eq is the n2o concentration under water gas equilibrium 2 4 4 self organizing maps soms to identify which hydrogeological and geochemical parameters were needed for the characterization of groundwater n2o accumulation soms were used to analyze the groundwater samples obtained in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river this approach projected multidimensional data on a two dimensional grid and captured complex nonlinear relationships between the variables peeters et al 2007 the visual comparison of derived individual component planes provided an opportunity to reveal the statistical relationships between the analyzed variables while k means clustering on som allowed further exploration of the data properties in more detail as it enabled separation of the dataset into different groups of similar hydrogeochemical features gamble and babbar sebens 2012 2 4 5 path analysis we used path analysis to test the hypotheses that were illustrated in the overall conceptual path model of relationships between the geochemical parameters hydrological parameters and n2o concentration in groundwater fig 1 n2o concentration in the groundwater was the outcome dependent variable in this model the theoretical basis for the conceptual model was the results from previous analyses of groundwater systems in agricultural areas jurado et al 2018b nikolenko et al 2019 before path analysis correlation analyses were conducted within each attribute category and results were used to reduce the number of variables selected for path analyses in this study the groundwater depth infiltration coefficient of precipitation no3 concentration n2o concentration and do of the groundwater were used in path analysis the r program version 4 1 1 was used for all statistical analyses and plots in this study 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of groundwater greenhouse gases in irrigation area in the lower reaches of yellow river the spatial distribution of groundwater greenhouse gases in the study area was shown in fig 3 the results of the spatial distribution of anion and anion related to nitrification and denitrification were shown in sⅰ the n2o in the groundwater of the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river was 11 6 23 2 µg l which was higher than the dissolved concentration at equilibrium with the atmosphere 0 34 µg l at 20 the groundwater n2o concentration in the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain was 14 1 13 1 µg l 1 84 1 48 µg l and 36 5 40 4 µg l respectively thus the higher concentration mainly occurred in the piedmont plain and coastal plain fig 3 a meanwhile the variation coefficient of n2o concentration in the groundwater of each zone was large piedmont plain 92 9 central plain 80 5 coastal plain 110 8 indicating that the groundwater n2o had a strong response to influencing factors the ch4 in the groundwater of the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river was 4 1 7 0 mg l 1 the groundwater ch4 concentration in the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain was 2 72 3 07 mg l 1 5 76 8 79 mg l 1 and 1 04 0 90 mg l 1 respectively thus the higher concentration mainly occurred in the central plain fig 3 b the variation coefficient of ch4 concentration in the groundwater of each zone also had high values piedmont plain 112 6 central plain 152 7 coastal plain 86 2 the co2 in the groundwater of the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river was 24313 8 20180 6 ppm the groundwater co2 concentration in the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain was 13939 6 10247 9 ppm 25280 7 19401 9 ppm and 34501 7 25152 8 ppm respectively thus the higher concentration mainly occurred in the coastal plain fig 3 c the variation coefficient of co2 in the groundwater of each zone was lower than those of n2o and ch4 piedmont plain 73 5 central plain 76 8 coastal plain 72 9 the do in the groundwater of the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river was 1 57 2 09 mg l 1 the groundwater do in the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain was 0 19 0 08 mg l 1 1 47 2 15 mg l 1 and 3 56 1 68 mg l 1 respectively thus the higher concentration mainly occurred in the coastal plain fig 3 d the variation coefficient of do in the groundwater of piedmont plain and central plain was lower than those of n2o co2 and ch4 piedmont plain 43 7 central plain 146 0 coastal plain 47 1 3 2 n2o emissions of groundwater in irrigation area of lower reaches of yellow river plain the ef5g in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river was 0 27 groundwater in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river was an important water resource to ensure food security and more than 70 of farmland was irrigated by groundwater in this region wang et al 2012 groundwater exploitation in the piedmont plain of the lower reaches of yellow river plain was mainly shallow groundwater exploitation around 30 m while groundwater exploitation in the central plain was mainly deep groundwater exploitation 50 m the study area belonged to the ncp which had been exploiting groundwater on a large scale since the 1960 s with increased population and technology advancement the scale and intensity of groundwater exploitation have expanded leading to a three dimensional exploitation pattern of shallow and deep groundwater according to statistics there are currently about 2 million groundwater mining wells in the ncp the average multi year groundwater extraction in the ncp also increased from 3 9 109 m3 in the 1960 s to 7 9 109 m3 in the 1970 s from 1985 to the end of the 20th century the multi year average extraction exceeded 1 0 1010 m3 liu et al 2001 in the 21st century to reduce the environmental impacts induced by excessive exploitation of groundwater the exploitation of groundwater in some areas had been gradually curbed however the exploitation is still increasing from 2000 to 2010 groundwater exploitation reached the highest level in history with an annual average of 1 59 1010 m3 after 2014 with the advancement of groundwater over exploitation control and the water supply of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project the amount of groundwater exploitation decreased significantly in 2019 the groundwater exploitation decreased to 9 70 109 m3 and the groundwater exploitation in the lower reaches of yellow river plain was about 1 52 109 m3 the groundwater exploitation of the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain was 8 53 108 m3 4 84 108 m3 and 1 86 108 m3 data from yellow river water resources bulletin in 2019 when the high concentration of n2o in groundwater was exploited to the surface the n2o in the groundwater quickly diffused into the atmosphere it was estimated that the n2o emissions induced by groundwater exploitation in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river were 1 87 g hm 2 year 1 the n2o emissions induced by groundwater exploitation of the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain were 3 89 g hm 2 y 1 0 18 g hm 2 y 1 and 1 86 g hm 2 y 1 3 3 self organizing map analysis the som technique enabled the classification of hydrochemical conditions that favored the accumulation of n2o in the groundwater the data comprising the concentration of the ten physical and chemical parameters do n2o co2 ch4 f cl no3 so4 2 fe2 mn2 of 41 samples were input into the som system the number of nodes was calculated as 35 and the numbers of rows and columns were 7 and 5 respectively in this work all samples were divided into 3 clusters 4 clusters and 5 clusters first after a comprehensive analysis being divided into 4 clusters was found to be more appropriate the som results are shown in table 1 and fig 4 a where fig 4 a shows four different clusters ⅰ ⅱ iii iv each of which has a similar chemical composition cluster ⅰ red consisted of approximately 12 2 of the total number of sampling points it was characterized by a high concentration of ch4 21 0 8 1 mg l 1 and a low concentration of do 0 61 0 41 mg l 1 all sampling points of cluster ⅰ belonged to the central plain cluster ⅱ blue consisted of approximately 7 32 of the total number of sampling points it was characterized by a high concentration of co2 4 97 2 55 104 ppm sampling points in cluster ⅱ were mainly found in the central plain cluster iii blue consisted of approximately 12 2 of the total number of sampling points it was characterized by a high concentration of n2o 64 2 35 2 mg l 1 and a high concentration of no3 2 29 0 97 102 mg l 1 and compared with other clusters cluster iii had a shallow groundwater depth and higher infiltration coefficient of precipitation the sampling points in cluster iii were found in the piedmont plain and coastal plain cluster iv green consisted of approximately 68 3 of the total number of sampling points it was characterized by a lower concentration of n2o 4 96 7 02 ug l 1 co2 1 80 1 84 104 ppm ch4 1 93 2 18 ug l 1 no3 7 12 11 82 mg l 1 cl 2 29 2 33 102 mg l 1 so4 2 2 59 2 64 102 mg l 1 fe2 0 91 0 37 mg l 1 and mn2 52 8 64 5 mg l 1 3 4 path model result the path model was characterized by acceptable values for goodness of fit statistics the p values for tests was 0 057 0 05 the ratio of the chi square degree of freedom χ2 df was smaller than 3 with p value greater than 0 05 in the baseline comparisons the normed fit index nfi the non normed fit index tli the incremental fit index ifi the comparative fit index cfi the relative fit index rfi and the goodness of fit index gfi were regarded as the best with their parameter values ranging from 0 9 to 1 0 wei and liang 2019 to describe n2o in the groundwater in the path model groundwater depth infiltration coefficient of precipitation and do no3 and n2o in the groundwater were included as causal variables the model results showed that no3 had the greatest direct effect on n2o path coefficient 0 939 at the same time the model results also showed that the infiltration coefficient of precipitation mainly affected no3 through which n2o was affected in the groundwater which gradually increased however in this study we found no correlation between do and n2o in the groundwater 4 discussion 4 1 influence of aquifer characteristics on groundwater n2o in irrigation area of lower reaches of yellow river in this study the average concentration of n2o in the groundwater of the irrigation area of lower reaches of yellow river was 10 32 µg l and even reached 105 2 µg l at some points which was much higher than the concentration under water gas equilibrium 0 44 µg n2o l 1 20 these observations were consistent with those published in literatures table 2 large amounts of n input were one of the important reasons for the high n2o in the groundwater high n in the groundwater stimulated the activities of n cycling microorganisms which accelerated the nitrification and denitrification processes and in turn produced a large amount of n2o in the groundwater jurado et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wei zhou et al 2019 in this study the observations of n2o in the groundwater of the piedmont plain and central plain supported above conclusions the amount of applied fertilizers in the piedmont plain winter wheat 275 6 kg hm 2 summer maize 252 1 kg hm 2 was greater than that of the central plain winter wheat 235 98 kg hm 2 summer maize 229 57 kg hm 2 yu zhang 2015 which led to higher groundwater no3 30 3 45 3 mg l 1 and n2o 11 9 23 6 µg l in the piedmont plain than those of the central plain no3 of 2 31 1 88 mg l 1 and n2o of 1 86 1 50 µg l in addition to the n input the parameters of vertical n transport were also important factors affecting the groundwater n2o concentration weymann et al 2008 nikolenko et al 2019 huo et al 2023 the no3 and n2o concentrations in the groundwater of the piedmont plain were almost 6 times and 13 times higher than those of the groundwater in the central plain the magnitude of the groundwater n2o difference of the two plains was much larger than that of the n input of the two plains which was attributed to the higher infiltration of precipitation and shallower groundwater depth in the piedmont plain at the same time the piedmont plain was connected with aquifers in mountain valleys and had lateral runoff recharge to a certain extent surface water continuously infiltrated into the groundwater which brought not only the substrate for denitrification but also ions that were conducive to n2o production into the groundwater these observations were in line with that of the belgian groundwater n2o study in which n2o concentration of 458 3 µg l appeared in the mons and dinant regions with better aquifer permeability jurado et al 2018b at the same time the results of path analysis fig 5 showed that the groundwater depth and rainfall infiltration coefficient affected n2o through their effect on no3 in the groundwater as a key factor in nitrification and denitrification no3 had an important impact on the concentration of n2o in the groundwater weymann et al 2008 jurado et al 2017 mcaleer et al 2017 it was further proved that hydrogeological conditions affected n2o in the groundwater by affecting the groundwater hydrochemistry the higher groundwater no3 and n2o concentrations in the coastal plain groundwater were not only attributed to the nitrogen input but also impacted by the geographical location and geology of the coastal plain boehm et al 2006 wong et al 2015 compared with the other two plains the groundwater n2o concentration in the coastal plain was the highest reaching 36 5 40 5 µg l the no3 concentration in the groundwater was 1 68 2 58 102 mg l 1 with the highest point reaching 3 69 102 mg l 1 seawater intrusion and soil salinization increased groundwater salinity liu et al 2016 xia et al 2021 which inhibited denitrification in the groundwater rivett et al 2008a santoro 2010 the geographical location of the coastal plain was also special located in the lower yellow river estuary area it was the end point of the groundwater flow in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of the yellow river xing et al 2013 cao et al 2016 li et al 2020 thus unconsumed no3 throughout the lower yellow river plain continued to accumulate in the groundwater of the coastal plain which made one of the important hydrogeological characteristics of high groundwater no3 concentrations in the coastal plain moreover hydrogeological factors combined with anthropogenic factors resulted in no3 concentration two orders of magnitude higher in the groundwater of the coastal plain which also indicated that significant nitrification and denitrification occurred with large amounts of n2o produced 4 2 influence mechanism of groundwater hydrochemical characteristics on groundwater n2o in irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river through soms we analyzed the groundwater hydrochemical parameters and hydrogeological parameters of the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of the yellow river fig 4 b displays the 12 component maps n2o co2 ch4 f cl no3 so4 2 do fe2 mn2 groundwater depth gd and infiltration coefficient of precipitation icp representing the component values of the reference vectors for the 35 nodes and enabling a visual identification of the relationships among variables the nodes representing high and low values are colored red and blue respectively according to the results of fig 4 b the high value regions of n2o no3 cl so4 2 and shallow groundwater depth simultaneously appeared in the upper left part of their respective maps it showed that the sampling points with high no3 concentration high cl concentration and high so4 2 concentration in the groundwater and shallow groundwater depth and low infiltration coefficient of precipitation low f concentration and ch4 concentration in the groundwater were favorable for n2o accumulation a positive correlation between no3 and n2o was also reported in previous studies weymann et al 2008 jurado et al 2017 mcaleer et al 2017 in previous studies the correlation between so4 2 and n2o was mainly focused on autotrophic denitrification with sulfide as the electron donor for example in the jiangxi region which was rich in pyrite so4 2 and n2o in the groundwater showed negative correlation zhao li et al 2021 however in this study so4 2 and n2o showed a positive correlation the main reason was that the pyrite in the study was relatively scarce and most of the so4 2 in the groundwater came from anthropogenic sources and the dissolution of sulfate sedimentary rocks moreover so4 2 was similar to cl indicating that so4 2 and cl in the groundwater of the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river mainly came from the same source i e fertilizer this further explained that fertilizer use led to an increase in the n2o concentration in the groundwater as shown in the n2o map of fig 4 b the bottom left corner region of the n2o map was the low concentration region the high concentration regions of the ch4 map and low concentration regions of the do map appeared in the bottom left corner this indicated a negative correlation between ch4 and do kampbell et al 1989 jurado et al 2018b lupon et al 2019 it also showed that when do was at a low level most of the organic matter in the groundwater was used by anaerobic methanogens to produce methane while denitrification was limited by the carbon source with limited n2o production fe2 and mn2 as electron donors for autotrophic denitrification were important factors affecting n2o in the groundwater mcaleer et al 2017 clague et al 2019 flint et al 2021 when the concentration of doc in the groundwater was low heterotrophic denitrification was inhibited mn could then provide electron donors for autotrophic denitrification to generate n2o however no significant relationship between fe2 mn2 and n2o was found in this study 4 3 indirect n2o emissions from groundwater in recent years due to increased fertilizer applications a large proportion of the nitrogen applied to farmland was lost to adjacent water bodies through runoff and leaching processes jurado et al 2018a more and more attention has thus been paid to indirect n2o emissions from the groundwater jurado et al 2018b nikolenko et al 2019 wei zhou et al 2019 the estimation of regional indirect groundwater n2o emissions was mainly based on ef5g however due to the large heterogeneity of environmental conditions ef5g was highly uncertain and considerable bias existed by using the ipcc default values 0 25 to predict indirect emissions of n2o from groundwater a syakila 2011 beaulieu jake et al 2011 cooper et al 2017 fu et al 2018 for instance tian et al 2019 conducted a comparison analysis of indirect n2o emissions based on 254 agricultural fields worldwide between 1979 and 2018 and revealed that the newly estimated ef5r and ef5e were not significantly different from the ipcc default values but some other researchers found that the newly estimated ef5g was typically greater than the ipcc 2006 guidelines default values for example the study by zhou et al 2019 on ef5g from an agricultural land in eastern china showed that ef5g for vineyards 0 91 and vegetables 0 92 were much higher than the ipcc default value 0 25 suggesting that these land uses contributed to the differences in indirect n2o emissions from groundwater in this study the ef5g in the irrigation area of lower reaches of yellow river was 0 27 which was also higher than the ipcc default value moreover ef5g also varied between the three zones within the study area with 0 24 in the piedmont plain 0 32 in the central plain and 0 16 in the coastal plain the results of this study again showed that there was a large regional heterogeneity in ef5g therefore more local research data are needed to reduce the uncertainty of indirect groundwater n2o emissions recent studies also investigated n2o emissions due to groundwater exploitation jurado et al 2018b estimated the n2o flux from the groundwater exploitation was 17 28 g hm 2 y 1 in the walloon region for an area of 16 844 km2 in this study the n2o emission flux by groundwater exploitation in the irrigation area of lower reaches of yellow river was 1 87 g hm 2 y 1 for the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain the n2o flux was 3 89 g hm 2 y 1 0 18 g hm 2 y 1 and 1 87 g hm 2 y 1 respectively the n2o emission flux by groundwater exploitation in the irrigation area of lower reaches of yellow river was much lower than those of the walloon region 5 conclusions in this study 41 groundwater samples were collected from the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river by comparing the spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater n2o in the piedmont plain the central plain and the coastal plain the impacts of hydrogeological parameters and geochemical parameters on groundwater n2o were explored in this study significant differences of the n2o concentration in the groundwater of the three zones in the lower reaches of yellow river plain were observed the main reasons for these differences were the differences in groundwater n input as well as the

1960,the plains of the lower reaches of rivers are important areas for food production in the groundwater of irrigated agricultural areas of these regions the n2o concentration was generally observed to be higher than that of the water gas equilibrium due to the complexity and uncertainty of the aquifers the mechanisms by which groundwater n2o are affected by groundwater hydrogeology and geochemistry remain unexplored in this study 41 groundwater samples were collected from three zones of the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river i e piedmont plain coastal plain and central plain and the hydrogeological parameters of these three areas were characterized the results showed significant differences of the n2o concentration in the groundwater of the three zones of the lower reaches of yellow river plain which was 14 1 13 1 µg l 1 84 1 48 µg l and 36 5 40 5 µg l for the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain respectively the differences were attributed to different groundwater n input and hydrogeological parameters in the three zones the infiltration coefficient of precipitation was found to be the most important hydrogeological parameter affecting groundwater n2o this study also evaluated the indirect n2o emission factor in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river the n2o emissions induced by groundwater exploitation in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river were found to be 1 87 g hm 2 year 1 these findings provide a foundation to develop strategies to reduce n2o production and emissions in the agricultural area of the lower reaches of rivers keywords n2o groundwater hydrogeological parameters geochemical parameters the irrigation area of lower reaches of yellow river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the rising concentration of nitrous oxide n2o in the atmosphere is causing serious problems such as global warming and ozone layer depletion which hinder the stable development of human society makowski 2019 harris et al 2022 agricultural activities are an important source of n2o emissions tubiello et al 2013 thompson et al 2019 and research on n2o emissions in agricultural areas is a current research hotspot tesfaye et al 2021 ashiq et al 2022 maier et al 2022 mendoza beltran et al 2022 in recent years the increased use of fertilizers has led to large amounts of n accumulation in the groundwater ju et al 2009 savcı 2012 cassman and dobermann 2022 and n transformation results in elevated n2o concentration in the groundwater jurado et al 2017 subsequently groundwater has also become one of the important emission sources of n2o in agricultural areas the dynamic change process of n2o in the groundwater is complex and affected by many factors the mechanisms of the n2o dynamic process in the groundwater have an obvious hierarchy fig 1 firstly the production of n2o is mainly controlled by denitrification in the groundwater vilain et al 2012 jahangir et al 2013 li et al 2021a denitrification can occur biologically or abiotically but in the groundwater the former is more common since the organisms capable of denitrification i e denitrifiers tend to be ubiquitous in the groundwater groffman et al 1998 jahangir et al 2013 li et al 2021a secondly nitrogen transformation depends on the geochemistry of the groundwater e g redox conditions and electron donors philippe and hill 2004 rivett et al 2008b tesoriero and puckett 2011 zhao li et al 2021 thirdly groundwater geochemistry is influenced by groundwater hydrology e g variation in the groundwater depth rainfall periods and aquifer permeability jungkunst et al 2008 jurado et al 2018a in the natural environment groundwater hydrology affects groundwater n2o by its influence on groundwater geochemistry previous studies showed that rainfall periods water filled pore space wfps and fluctuations of groundwater depth had an important influence on groundwater n2o in agricultural areas weymann et al 2008 kim et al 2009 li et al 2021b jurado et al 2018a also reported the influence of different aquifer characteristics on groundwater n2o in the walloon region of belgium the chalks of mons with better permeability had a higher n2o concentration and the n2o in the aquifer was mainly from nitrification in the unsaturated zone in contrast the limestone aquifer of the namur basin the jurassic formations and the meuse gravels aquifer with low permeability and semi oxic or anoxic had relatively low n2o concentrations jurado et al 2018b however due to the spatial complexity of aquifers the mechanisms by which groundwater hydrogeology affect n2o in groundwater through its influence on groundwater geochemistry are still not clear the irrigation area in the lower reaches of yellow river is located in the central and southern parts of the north china plain ncp as one of the important grain producing areas in china its groundwater faces the threat of n leaching from the farmland like other important grain producing areas in the world van es et al 2002 oenema et al 2005 nila rekha et al 2011 letey and vaughan 2013 libutti and monteleone 2017 according to the geomorphic features the irrigation area in the lower reaches of yellow river is divided into three zones i e the piedmont plain the central plain and the coastal plain the characteristics of aquifers in each area provide distinguished natural conditions for studying the influence of aquifer characteristics on n2o in shallow groundwater in addition groundwater extraction is high in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river which is mainly used for agricultural irrigation liu et al 2001 feng et al 2013 yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 in recent years with the operation of the south north water diversion project and the implementation of strict control policies on groundwater extraction the groundwater extraction in the ncp has dropped from 1 57 1011 m3 year 1 to 1 00 1011 m3 year 1 per year yang et al 2021 however there is still a large amount of groundwater extracted for irrigation in the ncp n2o release from groundwater extraction in the region thus may be a potentially important source of n2o emissions the objectives of this paper were to 1 explore the effects of groundwater hydrogeology and geochemistry on groundwater n2o and 2 estimate n2o emissions by groundwater exploitation this study provided comprehensive data of n2o in groundwater in the lower reaches of yellow river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted within the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river in the temperate semi arid monsoon climate zone the main crops planted in the study area were maize wheat and cotton winter wheat summer maize rotation was the main planting pattern in the study area accounting for 70 of the planting area irrigation water was from groundwater and yellow river the elevation gradually decreased from the west to the east in the study area the main soil types included fluvo aquic soils yellow earths and yellow cinnamon soils the main mineral included quartz anorthite potassium feldspar calcite dolomite and clay mineral the pyrite was the trace mineral and made up a very small proportion of the aquifer minerals in study area fertilization was conducted mainly three times a year including before sowing winter wheat in november after sowing winter wheat in february or march and before sowing summer maize in july the fertilizers were either urea or compound fertilizer 2 2 aquifer profile the complexity of the spatial distribution of water bearing media complicated groundwater distribution and circulation this study mainly focused on the aquifer with a floor depth of 10 50 m which served as the main water supply aquifer in the study area according to the landform features the study area was divided into three zones i e the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain fig 2 the lithology of the shallow aquifer in the piedmont plain was mainly gravel medium coarse sand and medium fine sand so it had good vertical continuity and high permeability at the same time it was connected to the valley aquifer where runoff recharge could occur the aquifers in the central and coastal plains were similar in lithology and were mainly composed of silt and fine sand in addition there were clay layers with poor permeability in some unsaturated areas of the coastal plain which led to poor recharge by precipitation in the coastal plain anyhow it was characterized by a gradual transition from a single phreatic aquifer composed of sand and gravel in the middle and upper part of the piedmont alluvial fan in the northwest to a multi layered aquifer interbedded with sand silt and clay in the alluvial plain and coastal plain in the middle and eastern part from the front of the mountain to the coast the sand particles became thinner and thinner and the viscous soil layer became thicker the complexity of spatial distribution of water bearing media complicated the circulation and distribution of groundwater in the natural state the drainage of groundwater in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river included spring overflow phreatic evaporation and lateral runoff at present artificial groundwater exploitation was mainly used for agricultural irrigation the groundwater evaporation intensity in the study area varied greatly among different regions and the phreatic evaporation was mainly related to the groundwater table the lithology of the aquifer surface vegetation and climate at the same time groundwater in the study area had the characteristics of concentrated replenishment in the rainy season and perennial discharge and consumption 2 3 groundwater sampling groundwater samples were collected from 41 wells within the study area fig 2 samples were obtained from three zones 1 piedmont plain 2 central plain and 3 coastal plain all sampling points were located in shallow aquifers at depths varying from 30 to 50 m the groundwater samples were collected in march 2019 and the dissolved n2o concentration and presence of primary anions were analyzed to eliminate the interference of water in the wellbore groundwater was pumped for at least three wellbore volumes to stabilize the groundwater withdraw jurado et al 2018b nikolenko et al 2019 afterward a closed flow cell was used to collect 5 l of water and a portable multimeter hq40d hach usa was employed to measure the ph electrical conductivity ec μs cm do mg l and temperature c to analyze for dissolved n2o approximately 500 ml of groundwater was poured into a 250 ml borosilicate serum vial and allowed to overflow to prevent any ambient air from being stored in the bottle headspace the sample was preserved by adding 1 ml of saturated hgcl2 and immediately sealed with a butyl rubber stopper the vial was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c and transported to the laboratory within 48 h n2o concentrations were determined using the headspace equilibration technique 100 ml n2 headspace in 250 ml serum bottles and measured with a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a usa the concentration of dissolved n2o was calculated using the equation of weiss and price 1980 another 500 ml of groundwater was then collected in a 250 ml plastic bottle using the same method but without the addition of the preservative the samples were then stored in a refrigerator at 4 c and transported to the laboratory within 48 h of sampling to analyze for doc no3 so4 2 f and cl 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 major and minor ions of groundwater analysis of groundwater samples for major and minor ions was performed at the laboratory of the institute of geographic science and natural resources research and yucheng comprehensive experiment station chinese academy of sciences 2 4 2 indirect emission factor of groundwater n2o the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc provided the method of ef5 to evaluate the n2o emission factor for indirect n2o emissions resulting from n leaching in agricultural areas ipcc 2006 which is subdivided into three subcategories 1 ef ef 5 g 0 0025 ef 5 r 0 0025 ef 5 e 0 0025 where ef 5 g is the emission factor from groundwater ef5r is the emission factor from rivers and ef5e is the emission factor from estuarine coastal areas the ipcc defined ef5g as either i the ratio between n2o emission to the atmosphere n2o nout and n input to the system total ninput or ii the ratio of dissolved n2o n to no3 n in the water body as many studies often lacked information on n2o emissions and total ninput of the groundwater most ef5g data reported in the literature were derived from the ratio of dissolved n2o n to no3 n in groundwater 2 4 3 groundwater n2o emissions caused by groundwater exploitation the calculation method of n2o emissions induced by groundwater exploitation in the lower reaches of yellow river plain was based on the study by jurado et al 2018b 2 en 2 o gw p q abs cn 2 o obs cn 2 o eq where en 2 o gw p is the n2o emission flux caused by groundwater exploitation q abs is the average amount of groundwater extraction cn 2 o obs is the n2o concentration of groundwater at the sampling point and cn 2 o eq is the n2o concentration under water gas equilibrium 2 4 4 self organizing maps soms to identify which hydrogeological and geochemical parameters were needed for the characterization of groundwater n2o accumulation soms were used to analyze the groundwater samples obtained in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river this approach projected multidimensional data on a two dimensional grid and captured complex nonlinear relationships between the variables peeters et al 2007 the visual comparison of derived individual component planes provided an opportunity to reveal the statistical relationships between the analyzed variables while k means clustering on som allowed further exploration of the data properties in more detail as it enabled separation of the dataset into different groups of similar hydrogeochemical features gamble and babbar sebens 2012 2 4 5 path analysis we used path analysis to test the hypotheses that were illustrated in the overall conceptual path model of relationships between the geochemical parameters hydrological parameters and n2o concentration in groundwater fig 1 n2o concentration in the groundwater was the outcome dependent variable in this model the theoretical basis for the conceptual model was the results from previous analyses of groundwater systems in agricultural areas jurado et al 2018b nikolenko et al 2019 before path analysis correlation analyses were conducted within each attribute category and results were used to reduce the number of variables selected for path analyses in this study the groundwater depth infiltration coefficient of precipitation no3 concentration n2o concentration and do of the groundwater were used in path analysis the r program version 4 1 1 was used for all statistical analyses and plots in this study 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of groundwater greenhouse gases in irrigation area in the lower reaches of yellow river the spatial distribution of groundwater greenhouse gases in the study area was shown in fig 3 the results of the spatial distribution of anion and anion related to nitrification and denitrification were shown in sⅰ the n2o in the groundwater of the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river was 11 6 23 2 µg l which was higher than the dissolved concentration at equilibrium with the atmosphere 0 34 µg l at 20 the groundwater n2o concentration in the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain was 14 1 13 1 µg l 1 84 1 48 µg l and 36 5 40 4 µg l respectively thus the higher concentration mainly occurred in the piedmont plain and coastal plain fig 3 a meanwhile the variation coefficient of n2o concentration in the groundwater of each zone was large piedmont plain 92 9 central plain 80 5 coastal plain 110 8 indicating that the groundwater n2o had a strong response to influencing factors the ch4 in the groundwater of the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river was 4 1 7 0 mg l 1 the groundwater ch4 concentration in the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain was 2 72 3 07 mg l 1 5 76 8 79 mg l 1 and 1 04 0 90 mg l 1 respectively thus the higher concentration mainly occurred in the central plain fig 3 b the variation coefficient of ch4 concentration in the groundwater of each zone also had high values piedmont plain 112 6 central plain 152 7 coastal plain 86 2 the co2 in the groundwater of the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river was 24313 8 20180 6 ppm the groundwater co2 concentration in the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain was 13939 6 10247 9 ppm 25280 7 19401 9 ppm and 34501 7 25152 8 ppm respectively thus the higher concentration mainly occurred in the coastal plain fig 3 c the variation coefficient of co2 in the groundwater of each zone was lower than those of n2o and ch4 piedmont plain 73 5 central plain 76 8 coastal plain 72 9 the do in the groundwater of the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river was 1 57 2 09 mg l 1 the groundwater do in the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain was 0 19 0 08 mg l 1 1 47 2 15 mg l 1 and 3 56 1 68 mg l 1 respectively thus the higher concentration mainly occurred in the coastal plain fig 3 d the variation coefficient of do in the groundwater of piedmont plain and central plain was lower than those of n2o co2 and ch4 piedmont plain 43 7 central plain 146 0 coastal plain 47 1 3 2 n2o emissions of groundwater in irrigation area of lower reaches of yellow river plain the ef5g in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river was 0 27 groundwater in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river was an important water resource to ensure food security and more than 70 of farmland was irrigated by groundwater in this region wang et al 2012 groundwater exploitation in the piedmont plain of the lower reaches of yellow river plain was mainly shallow groundwater exploitation around 30 m while groundwater exploitation in the central plain was mainly deep groundwater exploitation 50 m the study area belonged to the ncp which had been exploiting groundwater on a large scale since the 1960 s with increased population and technology advancement the scale and intensity of groundwater exploitation have expanded leading to a three dimensional exploitation pattern of shallow and deep groundwater according to statistics there are currently about 2 million groundwater mining wells in the ncp the average multi year groundwater extraction in the ncp also increased from 3 9 109 m3 in the 1960 s to 7 9 109 m3 in the 1970 s from 1985 to the end of the 20th century the multi year average extraction exceeded 1 0 1010 m3 liu et al 2001 in the 21st century to reduce the environmental impacts induced by excessive exploitation of groundwater the exploitation of groundwater in some areas had been gradually curbed however the exploitation is still increasing from 2000 to 2010 groundwater exploitation reached the highest level in history with an annual average of 1 59 1010 m3 after 2014 with the advancement of groundwater over exploitation control and the water supply of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project the amount of groundwater exploitation decreased significantly in 2019 the groundwater exploitation decreased to 9 70 109 m3 and the groundwater exploitation in the lower reaches of yellow river plain was about 1 52 109 m3 the groundwater exploitation of the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain was 8 53 108 m3 4 84 108 m3 and 1 86 108 m3 data from yellow river water resources bulletin in 2019 when the high concentration of n2o in groundwater was exploited to the surface the n2o in the groundwater quickly diffused into the atmosphere it was estimated that the n2o emissions induced by groundwater exploitation in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river were 1 87 g hm 2 year 1 the n2o emissions induced by groundwater exploitation of the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain were 3 89 g hm 2 y 1 0 18 g hm 2 y 1 and 1 86 g hm 2 y 1 3 3 self organizing map analysis the som technique enabled the classification of hydrochemical conditions that favored the accumulation of n2o in the groundwater the data comprising the concentration of the ten physical and chemical parameters do n2o co2 ch4 f cl no3 so4 2 fe2 mn2 of 41 samples were input into the som system the number of nodes was calculated as 35 and the numbers of rows and columns were 7 and 5 respectively in this work all samples were divided into 3 clusters 4 clusters and 5 clusters first after a comprehensive analysis being divided into 4 clusters was found to be more appropriate the som results are shown in table 1 and fig 4 a where fig 4 a shows four different clusters ⅰ ⅱ iii iv each of which has a similar chemical composition cluster ⅰ red consisted of approximately 12 2 of the total number of sampling points it was characterized by a high concentration of ch4 21 0 8 1 mg l 1 and a low concentration of do 0 61 0 41 mg l 1 all sampling points of cluster ⅰ belonged to the central plain cluster ⅱ blue consisted of approximately 7 32 of the total number of sampling points it was characterized by a high concentration of co2 4 97 2 55 104 ppm sampling points in cluster ⅱ were mainly found in the central plain cluster iii blue consisted of approximately 12 2 of the total number of sampling points it was characterized by a high concentration of n2o 64 2 35 2 mg l 1 and a high concentration of no3 2 29 0 97 102 mg l 1 and compared with other clusters cluster iii had a shallow groundwater depth and higher infiltration coefficient of precipitation the sampling points in cluster iii were found in the piedmont plain and coastal plain cluster iv green consisted of approximately 68 3 of the total number of sampling points it was characterized by a lower concentration of n2o 4 96 7 02 ug l 1 co2 1 80 1 84 104 ppm ch4 1 93 2 18 ug l 1 no3 7 12 11 82 mg l 1 cl 2 29 2 33 102 mg l 1 so4 2 2 59 2 64 102 mg l 1 fe2 0 91 0 37 mg l 1 and mn2 52 8 64 5 mg l 1 3 4 path model result the path model was characterized by acceptable values for goodness of fit statistics the p values for tests was 0 057 0 05 the ratio of the chi square degree of freedom χ2 df was smaller than 3 with p value greater than 0 05 in the baseline comparisons the normed fit index nfi the non normed fit index tli the incremental fit index ifi the comparative fit index cfi the relative fit index rfi and the goodness of fit index gfi were regarded as the best with their parameter values ranging from 0 9 to 1 0 wei and liang 2019 to describe n2o in the groundwater in the path model groundwater depth infiltration coefficient of precipitation and do no3 and n2o in the groundwater were included as causal variables the model results showed that no3 had the greatest direct effect on n2o path coefficient 0 939 at the same time the model results also showed that the infiltration coefficient of precipitation mainly affected no3 through which n2o was affected in the groundwater which gradually increased however in this study we found no correlation between do and n2o in the groundwater 4 discussion 4 1 influence of aquifer characteristics on groundwater n2o in irrigation area of lower reaches of yellow river in this study the average concentration of n2o in the groundwater of the irrigation area of lower reaches of yellow river was 10 32 µg l and even reached 105 2 µg l at some points which was much higher than the concentration under water gas equilibrium 0 44 µg n2o l 1 20 these observations were consistent with those published in literatures table 2 large amounts of n input were one of the important reasons for the high n2o in the groundwater high n in the groundwater stimulated the activities of n cycling microorganisms which accelerated the nitrification and denitrification processes and in turn produced a large amount of n2o in the groundwater jurado et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wei zhou et al 2019 in this study the observations of n2o in the groundwater of the piedmont plain and central plain supported above conclusions the amount of applied fertilizers in the piedmont plain winter wheat 275 6 kg hm 2 summer maize 252 1 kg hm 2 was greater than that of the central plain winter wheat 235 98 kg hm 2 summer maize 229 57 kg hm 2 yu zhang 2015 which led to higher groundwater no3 30 3 45 3 mg l 1 and n2o 11 9 23 6 µg l in the piedmont plain than those of the central plain no3 of 2 31 1 88 mg l 1 and n2o of 1 86 1 50 µg l in addition to the n input the parameters of vertical n transport were also important factors affecting the groundwater n2o concentration weymann et al 2008 nikolenko et al 2019 huo et al 2023 the no3 and n2o concentrations in the groundwater of the piedmont plain were almost 6 times and 13 times higher than those of the groundwater in the central plain the magnitude of the groundwater n2o difference of the two plains was much larger than that of the n input of the two plains which was attributed to the higher infiltration of precipitation and shallower groundwater depth in the piedmont plain at the same time the piedmont plain was connected with aquifers in mountain valleys and had lateral runoff recharge to a certain extent surface water continuously infiltrated into the groundwater which brought not only the substrate for denitrification but also ions that were conducive to n2o production into the groundwater these observations were in line with that of the belgian groundwater n2o study in which n2o concentration of 458 3 µg l appeared in the mons and dinant regions with better aquifer permeability jurado et al 2018b at the same time the results of path analysis fig 5 showed that the groundwater depth and rainfall infiltration coefficient affected n2o through their effect on no3 in the groundwater as a key factor in nitrification and denitrification no3 had an important impact on the concentration of n2o in the groundwater weymann et al 2008 jurado et al 2017 mcaleer et al 2017 it was further proved that hydrogeological conditions affected n2o in the groundwater by affecting the groundwater hydrochemistry the higher groundwater no3 and n2o concentrations in the coastal plain groundwater were not only attributed to the nitrogen input but also impacted by the geographical location and geology of the coastal plain boehm et al 2006 wong et al 2015 compared with the other two plains the groundwater n2o concentration in the coastal plain was the highest reaching 36 5 40 5 µg l the no3 concentration in the groundwater was 1 68 2 58 102 mg l 1 with the highest point reaching 3 69 102 mg l 1 seawater intrusion and soil salinization increased groundwater salinity liu et al 2016 xia et al 2021 which inhibited denitrification in the groundwater rivett et al 2008a santoro 2010 the geographical location of the coastal plain was also special located in the lower yellow river estuary area it was the end point of the groundwater flow in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of the yellow river xing et al 2013 cao et al 2016 li et al 2020 thus unconsumed no3 throughout the lower yellow river plain continued to accumulate in the groundwater of the coastal plain which made one of the important hydrogeological characteristics of high groundwater no3 concentrations in the coastal plain moreover hydrogeological factors combined with anthropogenic factors resulted in no3 concentration two orders of magnitude higher in the groundwater of the coastal plain which also indicated that significant nitrification and denitrification occurred with large amounts of n2o produced 4 2 influence mechanism of groundwater hydrochemical characteristics on groundwater n2o in irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river through soms we analyzed the groundwater hydrochemical parameters and hydrogeological parameters of the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of the yellow river fig 4 b displays the 12 component maps n2o co2 ch4 f cl no3 so4 2 do fe2 mn2 groundwater depth gd and infiltration coefficient of precipitation icp representing the component values of the reference vectors for the 35 nodes and enabling a visual identification of the relationships among variables the nodes representing high and low values are colored red and blue respectively according to the results of fig 4 b the high value regions of n2o no3 cl so4 2 and shallow groundwater depth simultaneously appeared in the upper left part of their respective maps it showed that the sampling points with high no3 concentration high cl concentration and high so4 2 concentration in the groundwater and shallow groundwater depth and low infiltration coefficient of precipitation low f concentration and ch4 concentration in the groundwater were favorable for n2o accumulation a positive correlation between no3 and n2o was also reported in previous studies weymann et al 2008 jurado et al 2017 mcaleer et al 2017 in previous studies the correlation between so4 2 and n2o was mainly focused on autotrophic denitrification with sulfide as the electron donor for example in the jiangxi region which was rich in pyrite so4 2 and n2o in the groundwater showed negative correlation zhao li et al 2021 however in this study so4 2 and n2o showed a positive correlation the main reason was that the pyrite in the study was relatively scarce and most of the so4 2 in the groundwater came from anthropogenic sources and the dissolution of sulfate sedimentary rocks moreover so4 2 was similar to cl indicating that so4 2 and cl in the groundwater of the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river mainly came from the same source i e fertilizer this further explained that fertilizer use led to an increase in the n2o concentration in the groundwater as shown in the n2o map of fig 4 b the bottom left corner region of the n2o map was the low concentration region the high concentration regions of the ch4 map and low concentration regions of the do map appeared in the bottom left corner this indicated a negative correlation between ch4 and do kampbell et al 1989 jurado et al 2018b lupon et al 2019 it also showed that when do was at a low level most of the organic matter in the groundwater was used by anaerobic methanogens to produce methane while denitrification was limited by the carbon source with limited n2o production fe2 and mn2 as electron donors for autotrophic denitrification were important factors affecting n2o in the groundwater mcaleer et al 2017 clague et al 2019 flint et al 2021 when the concentration of doc in the groundwater was low heterotrophic denitrification was inhibited mn could then provide electron donors for autotrophic denitrification to generate n2o however no significant relationship between fe2 mn2 and n2o was found in this study 4 3 indirect n2o emissions from groundwater in recent years due to increased fertilizer applications a large proportion of the nitrogen applied to farmland was lost to adjacent water bodies through runoff and leaching processes jurado et al 2018a more and more attention has thus been paid to indirect n2o emissions from the groundwater jurado et al 2018b nikolenko et al 2019 wei zhou et al 2019 the estimation of regional indirect groundwater n2o emissions was mainly based on ef5g however due to the large heterogeneity of environmental conditions ef5g was highly uncertain and considerable bias existed by using the ipcc default values 0 25 to predict indirect emissions of n2o from groundwater a syakila 2011 beaulieu jake et al 2011 cooper et al 2017 fu et al 2018 for instance tian et al 2019 conducted a comparison analysis of indirect n2o emissions based on 254 agricultural fields worldwide between 1979 and 2018 and revealed that the newly estimated ef5r and ef5e were not significantly different from the ipcc default values but some other researchers found that the newly estimated ef5g was typically greater than the ipcc 2006 guidelines default values for example the study by zhou et al 2019 on ef5g from an agricultural land in eastern china showed that ef5g for vineyards 0 91 and vegetables 0 92 were much higher than the ipcc default value 0 25 suggesting that these land uses contributed to the differences in indirect n2o emissions from groundwater in this study the ef5g in the irrigation area of lower reaches of yellow river was 0 27 which was also higher than the ipcc default value moreover ef5g also varied between the three zones within the study area with 0 24 in the piedmont plain 0 32 in the central plain and 0 16 in the coastal plain the results of this study again showed that there was a large regional heterogeneity in ef5g therefore more local research data are needed to reduce the uncertainty of indirect groundwater n2o emissions recent studies also investigated n2o emissions due to groundwater exploitation jurado et al 2018b estimated the n2o flux from the groundwater exploitation was 17 28 g hm 2 y 1 in the walloon region for an area of 16 844 km2 in this study the n2o emission flux by groundwater exploitation in the irrigation area of lower reaches of yellow river was 1 87 g hm 2 y 1 for the piedmont plain central plain and coastal plain the n2o flux was 3 89 g hm 2 y 1 0 18 g hm 2 y 1 and 1 87 g hm 2 y 1 respectively the n2o emission flux by groundwater exploitation in the irrigation area of lower reaches of yellow river was much lower than those of the walloon region 5 conclusions in this study 41 groundwater samples were collected from the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river by comparing the spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater n2o in the piedmont plain the central plain and the coastal plain the impacts of hydrogeological parameters and geochemical parameters on groundwater n2o were explored in this study significant differences of the n2o concentration in the groundwater of the three zones in the lower reaches of yellow river plain were observed the main reasons for these differences were the differences in groundwater n input as well as the hydrogeology the groundwater depth and infiltration coefficient of precipitation were the most important hydrogeological parameters affecting groundwater n2o through their impacts on groundwater no3 concentration fig 5 the som results fig 4 b showed that the favorable geochemical conditions for groundwater n2o accumulation were high no3 concentration high cl concentration high so4 2 concentration and low f concentration and ch4 concentration the favorable hydrogeological conditions for groundwater n2o accumulation were a low groundwater depth and high infiltration coefficient of precipitation this study also evaluated the indirect n2o emission factor which was found to be 0 27 in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river the n2o emissions induced by groundwater exploitation in the irrigation area of the lower reaches of yellow river were 1 87 g hm 2 year 1 credit authorship contribution statement zhao li conceptualization methodology software validation investigation

1961,to meet the carbon peak and carbon neutrality objectives the middle low latitude karst areas of southwest china have become popular research areas due to their rich terrestrial carbon sink storage capability however whether the enhanced terrestrial vegetation carbon sink will consume more water resources in this area is still unclear in this research three mid small basins that represent different levels of carbon sink and human activity were selected in the middle low latitude karst area of southwest china net ecosystem productivity nep was used to indicate the variation in the carbon sink and the remote sensing driven distributed time variant gain model rs dtvgm and a new runoff monitoring technology named the remote sensing hydrological station rshs were integrated to quantitatively analyze the correlation between the carbon sink and water resources from 2000 to 2020 the results showed that 1 in the past 20 years the nep of the three basins all showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing while the runoff of all basins showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing the opposite trends of nep and runoff supported the negative correlation between nep and runoff 2 the enhanced carbon sink will consume more water but on the premise of similar climatic and geographical conditions the significant strong negative correlation between the carbon sink and water resources will gradually weaken and become insignificant as the land use cover change lucc occurs and the forest background conditions improve from approximately 35 to more than 80 3 the serious drought event had a large influence on the water yield and carbon sink and the basin with higher forest coverage could resist extreme drought by consuming more runoff to retain more carbon this research quantitatively answered the question of whether the enhanced carbon sink will consume more water resources in the middle low latitude humid karst areas which provide valuable implications to managers who want to increase carbon sinks but worry about lost water resources and the results can be used to promote the co evolution of the water carbon system thereby achieving the carbon neutrality objective keywords vegetation carbon sink water resources hydrological model remote sensing hydrological stations extreme drought data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global and regional carbon cycling processes have become the core of global change and macroecological research snelgrove et al 2018 regnier et al 2022 one of the key points in carbon cycling research is to determine the volume spatial distribution and variation in the terrestrial vegetation carbon sink and forests are the main carbon sinks worldwide fauset et al 2015 changes in forest coverage will greatly affect the terrestrial carbon cycling process and the carbon sink pan et al 2011 brienen et al 2020 additionally these changes have a negative influence on the biodiversity water content carbon and nutrient cycling and the energy balance of the terrestrial ecological system phillips and lewis 2014 a fluctuation of the terrestrial carbon sink will vastly change the land surface environment and the hydrological cycling process in a basin pugh et al 2019 afforestation and plant recovery are effective and important ways to add terrestrial vegetation carbon sinks that can store co2 in the air so many afforestation projects have been implemented worldwide segura et al 2021 wu et al 2021b however at the basin scale the increased area of plants will affect the water resources by enhancing the evaporation capacity and reducing the runoff in the river le maitre and versfeld 1997 betts 2011 we should focus on the close coupling of hydrological and carbon cycling in the basin and they play the role of media and the engine of transportation of material and energy when the co2 concentration in the air increases due to the combustion of fossil fuel the climate and the coupled carbon water cycle change and then alter the processes of terrestrial hydrology and the usability of soil moisture when the plan leaf absorbs co2 kramer 1981 leakey et al 2006 in addition the leaf stoma adjusts and biomass is enhanced based on the air co2 concentration and the photosynthesis ability and transpiration rate are strengthened gifford 1995 these variations in vegetation cover and the carbon sink at the microscale will have an imperceptible and deep influence on carbon and water cycling the increase in terrestrial vegetation carbon sinks will consume a large amount of water resources in their respective basins and this result is prominently shown by a significant decrease in runoff for example robust and systematic ecological restoration policies e g the grain for green policy from the china government have increased the vegetation cover in the past two decades especially on the loess plateau located in the semiarid region of central china huang et al 2003 chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 and this increase in vegetation has caused surface runoff and regionally available water resources to decrease additionally ecological restoration policies have been implemented in the subtropical region of southwest china lou et al 2021 yang et al 2022 where the vegetation types and biodiversity are much richer than those in the semiarid area driven by these policies and social development the variations in the plant coverage and the carbon sink are very significant in many basins in this area and these variations cause fluctuations in the water resources wei et al 2021 three characteristics exist in the terrestrial carbon sink in southwest china first under the background of the carbon peak and carbon neutrality objectives in china the terrestrial carbon sink has experienced turbulence in the past twenty years in southwest china unlike grassland areas that can achieve the carbon neutrality objective by adjusting the moderate grazing duration zhang et al 2023 due to the grain for green policy a large area of artificial forest has been cultivated in southwest china to achieve the carbon neutrality objective second southwest china is the main distribution area of middle low latitude karst areas with a total area of 55 104 km2 wang et al 2015 in addition to rich forest resources and biodiversity yang et al 2021 the carbonate rock weathering carbon sink and silicate rock weathering carbon sink in karst areas of southwest china play significant roles in carbon sequestration and the reduction of the greenhouse effect gong et al 2021 li et al 2022 xiong et al 2022 li et al 2023 third extreme weather events e g extreme drought have been identified as key factors influencing the terrestrial carbon sink and they have occurred more frequently in southwest china yin et al 2018 in general southwest china receives more attention because of its large and stable terrestrial carbon sink however if managers hope to obtain more carbon sinks to satisfy the carbon neutrality objective the risks to water resources should be taken seriously in this research we focused on the correlation between the carbon sink and the water resources in the mid small basin at a long temporal scale in the middle low latitude karst areas of southwest china which are often overlooked however due to scarce scientific data on carbon sinks and water resources the mid small basin is more sensitive to fluctuations in vegetation cover and climate change to address this issue multisource remote sensing and new runoff monitoring technology were applied in this study the objectives were as follows 1 determine whether policy driven forest restoration which enhances the carbon sink consumes more water resources at the basin scale under different land use cover changes luccs and forest background conditions and 2 determine whether a basin with high forest coverage will retain more carbon sinks by consuming more runoff when experiencing extreme drought this research is expected to provide valuable implications for managers who want to increase carbon sinks but worry about lost water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area three typical mid small basins namely the nanming nm basin maotiao mt basin and shamu sm basin were selected as the study area fig 1 these basins are located in guizhou province the center of the karst area in southwest china with the karst landform accounting for 65 2 of the total area of guizhou province bai et al 2023 in addition to the rich forest resources and large carbon sink potential the karst landform is a prominent feature in the study area quantities of water usually named invalid blue water chen et al 2016 leak through the extensive underground cracks pipelines caves and underground streams in karst areas leading to a deficiency in surface water resources significant soil erosion and rocky desertification bai et al 2013 dubois et al 2014 qin et al 2015 these basins shared the same climatic conditions e g a subtropical plateau monsoon humid climate with distinct seasons high temperature and rain in summer and warmth and humidity in winter the average annual precipitation can reach 1052 1180 mm the average annual temperature is between 14 and 16 5 c the average annual sunshine duration is approximately1200 hours and the average annual runoff of the nm basin mt basin and sm basin is 21 16 23 38 and 4 52 m3 s respectively table 1 additionally these basins differ in their development directions first the nm basin where the capital of guizhou province is located has an area of 1334 95 km2 a total of 22 62 of the area is construction land which is the highest among the three basins the nm basin has more human activities and good economic conditions with a population density and agdp of 1791 32 people km2 and 7 79 104 respectively and the speed of urban expansion was far greater than the speed of forest restoration from 2000 to 2020 second the mt basin has a similar basin area of 1341 21 km2 and there are no significant differences in precipitation temperature sunshine duration runoff and other climatic factors between the mt and nm basins different from the nm basin the mt basin has a slight level of human development with a population density and agdp of 398 33 people km2 and 6 17 104 respectively there was a large amount of forest restoration in the mt basin from 2000 to 2020 resulting in a forest coverage rate of approximately 50 which was higher than the 35 forest coverage rate in the nm basin third the sm basin is similar to a pure natural basin with a smaller area of 250 61 km2 due to the existence of the yuntai mountain national natural reserve human activities are limited and lucc was not obvious from 2000 to 2020 in the sm basin with a population density and agdp of 17 53 people km2 and 3 18 104 respectively therefore the correlation between the carbon sink and water resources in the sm basin can be regarded as being affected only by climate change 2 2 methods 2 2 1 terrestrial vegetation soil ecosystem carbon sink calculation methods net ecosystem productivity nep can reflect the process of the material cycle and energy flow and it can properly represent the terrestrial vegetation soil ecosystem carbon sink and be used to check whether an ecosystem is a carbon source or a carbon sink liu et

accessibility the main date range was from 2000 to 2020 3 results 3 1 variation in forest coverage in the basins the forest coverage variation in the three basins is presented here first due to its significant importance as a carbon sink fig 3 from 2000 to 2020 the nm basin with a large city and a large population had a significant and dispersive degeneration trend of forest coverage specifically its forest area decreased from 481 18 km2 to 461 47 km2 and the forest coverage rate decreased from 36 03 to 34 56 in the mt basin which has fewer influences from human activities than the nm basin the forest area increased from 652 82 km2 to 688 94 km2 and the coverage rate increased from 49 07 to 51 78 in the past two decades the forest coverage rate of the sm basin which has little influence from human activities was fairly stable and increased from 81 52 to 82 55 in the past 20 years in general from 2000 to 2020 the nm basin had the lowest forest coverage and degeneration characteristics and the mt basin had a higher coverage rate and a recovery trend the sm basin had a large natural reserve with high and stable forest coverage 3 2 characteristics of terrestrial vegetation carbon sinks in the basins the basin terrestrial vegetation carbon sink can be represented by the nep the net ecosystem productivity of the vegetation the nep in the three basins in the past two decades was quantitatively analyzed and it was found that the carbon sink of these basins showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing from 2000 to 2020 but the trend significance and change rate of the different basins were different fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the order of the average nep from 2000 to 2020 was nm basin mt basin and sm basin with average values of 588 45 607 50 and 637 64 gc m2 respectively from 2000 to 2020 the nep of the three basins showed divergent trends the nm basin showed an insignificant decreasing trend of 0 11 gc m2 year 1 the sm basin showed an insignificant increasing trend of 0 08 gc m2 year 1 and the mt basin showed a relatively insignificant increasing trend p 0 16 of 1 78 gc m2 year 1 after adopting the subsection fitting method from 2000 to 2013 the mt basin and nm basin both showed relatively insignificant increasing trends with similar increasing rates 4 14 and 4 35 gc m2 year 1 significance probability p 0 11 and 0 16 and coefficient of determination r 2 0 16 and 0 06 for the sm basin the nep had a large fluctuation with no significant trend p 0 38 and r 2 0 06 from 2013 to 2020 the nm basin and sm basin both showed a relatively significant decreasing trend with rates of 8 80 and 7 50 gc m2 year 1 and the significance probability p 0 09 and 0 10 and coefficient of determination r 2 0 41 and 0 39 were similar notably due to the forest restoration in the mt basin nep showed an insignificant decreasing trend p 0 32 and r 2 0 16 with a rate of 5 03 gc m2 year 1 additionally the order of the nep standard deviation from 2000 to 2020 was also the nm basin mt basin and sm basin the nm and mt basins had a similar variation tendency the nep standard was deviation maintained at a high level when the carbon sink in the basin was enhanced and the nep standard deviation decreased when the carbon storage ability was weakened however the nep standard deviation of the sm basin had a flatter variation trend than that of the other two basins mainly because the spatial distribution of the nep was uniform and the whole basin had a high level of carbon storage the carbon sink in each studied basin had prominent spatial variation which was close to the variation in forest coverage fig 5 the nep in the whole mt basin increased over the past 20 years with an average increasing rate of 1 71 gc m2 year 1 and there was a heterogeneous spatial distribution i e the southeastern area with a low nep in 2000 had a further decreasing trend by 2020 while the northwestern area with a high nep had an increasing trend in the nm basin the nep in the whole area had a significant decline with a decreasing rate of 6 90 gc m2 year 1 and had a spatial aggregation effect from 2000 to 2020 i e the nep had a high value in the forest restoration area in the mt basin but in the southeast the nep decreased different from the other two basins the sm basin had a high background nep value and it also had a large and stable forest area therefore due to the increases in temperature and precipitation the spatial changes in nep in the sm basin were staggered and slightly increased overall with an increasing rate of 0 13 gc m2 year 1 3 3 performance of the rshs and the variation in water resources the runoff of the three basins from 2016 to 2020 was calculated by using the rshs technology since the field survey work was carried out in 2019 and 2020 the parameter calibration and validation of rs dtvgm were carried out with the calibration period being from 2019 to 2020 and the validation period being from 2016 to 2018 fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the runoff simulations during the calibration period for the mt nm and sm basins were reliable showing high nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients nses of 0 79 0 77 and 0 71 and low root mean square errors rmses of 8 29 8 09 and 1 66 m3 s respectively during the validation period the runoff simulation was still reliable although the nses of the mt nm and sm basins decreased slightly by 0 09 0 02 and 0 03 respectively in summary the rshs improved the accuracy of the rs dtvgm in runoff simulation and enabled rs dtvgm to obtain reliable long term runoff after the calibration of the rshs the monthly runoff was simulated by the rs dtvgm from 2000 to 2020 in the three basins fig 7 a c with the increase in precipitation the runoff of the three basins all showed an increasing trend and the occurrence times of the precipitation peak and runoff peak coincided next to avoid the impact of intra annual fluctuations in precipitation and runoff all monthly scale data were combined into annual scale data and trend analysis was carried out fig 7d as shown in fig 7d the mt nm and sm basins showed fluctuating insignificant increasing trends with average rates of 3 41 3 62 and 1 81 mm year and significance probability p of 0 35 0 23 and 0 59 respectively after adopting the subsection fitting method from 2000 to 2011 the mt nm and sm basins showed relatively significant decreasing trends with average rates of 14 08 11 57 and 11 87 mm year and significance probability p of 0 08 0 07 and 0 17 respectively the reason why the runoff change in the sm basin was relatively insignificant is that the sm basin was far away from the mt and nm basins and the difference in climate conditions resulted in the significance probability p of precipitation fitting line in the sm basin p 0 13 being slightly higher in mt and nm basins p 0 05 and 0 06 from 2000 to 2011 from 2011 to 2020 the mt nm and sm basins all showed significant increasing trends with average rates of 24 96 21 54 and 21 09 mm year and significance probability p of 0 03 0 03 and 0 06 respectively notably compared with the nep trend analysis results of the three basins shown in fig 4 although the dividing point was 2 years away there was an opposite trend between the water resources and carbon sinks in the three basins from 2000 to 2020 in general which could support the negative correlation between the nep and runoff finally the precipitation data and rs dtvgm runoff results from 2000 to 2020 were compared with the statistical data of the prefecture level cities where the three basins are located in the water resource bulletin of guizhou province the results showed that the input precipitation and runoff results of the rs dtvgm were reliable fig 7e and f as shown in fig 7e although there were some extremely wet or dry years the precipitation data still had a significant positive correlation with the statistical data in the mt nm and sm basins p 0 01 with coefficients of determination r 2 of 0 82 0 83 and 0 63 respectively as shown in fig 7f the rs dtvgm runoff results also had a significant positive correlation with the statistical runoff depth in the water resource bulletin in the mt nm and sm basins p 0 01 with coefficients of determination r 2 of 0 61 0 62 and 0 67 respectively 3 4 correlation between vegetation carbon sink and water resources the correlation analysis between nep and runoff was carried out from 2000 to 2020 in the nm mt and sm basins fig 8 a c as shown in fig 8a c regardless of the nep value the connection lines between precipitation and runoff were parallel indicating a stable causal correlation between the precipitation and runoff in all three basins then there were many intersections between the connection line of nep and runoff in the mt and nm basins and it usually corresponded to lower runoff when nep was higher than 636 10 and 621 21 gc m2 respectively which means that there was an obvious reduction of the runoff in the mt and nm basins when the carbon sink was enhanced however the runoff was also high when the nep in the sm basin was low but the corresponding runoff was moderate when the nep was high which indicated that there was a weak correlation between the nep and runoff in the sm basin next the fitting line of nep and runoff in the past 20 years in the three basins was further fitted by univariate linear fitting fig 8d as shown in fig 8d the nm basin which had rapid urban expansion and poor forest background conditions showed a significant strong negative correlation between nep and runoff with a fitting slope k of 0 88 a pearsoncorrelation coefficient r of 0 45 and a significance probability p 0 05 this means that approximately 0 88 mm of runoff will be consumed by increasing the carbon sink by 1 gc m2 in the nm basin although the mt basin had a similar basin area and climatic conditions to the nm basin the runoff and carbon sink showed a relatively insignificant weak negative correlation in the mt basin with a fitting slope k of 0 68 a pearsoncorrelation coefficient r of 0 26 and a significance probability p of 0 27 this means that approximately 0 68 mm of runoff less than that in the nm basin will be consumed by increasing the carbon sink by 1 gc m2 in the mt basin which was probably affected by the implementation of forest restoration projects and better forest background conditions in the mt basin in the past 20 years finally the sm basin which always maintained high forest coverage from 2000 2020 had no significant correlation between nep and runoff with a fitting slope k of 0 35 a pearsoncorrelation coefficient r of 0 13 and a significance probability p of 0 60 in general due to the developed root system luxuriant branches and leaves and strong water retention of forest land van dijke et al 2022 xiao et al 2023 the increase in carbon sinks caused by forest restoration will lead to an increase in the consumption of water resources in addition due to the characteristics of the thin soil layer and strong permeability in karst areas bai et al 2013 chen et al 2016 the significant negative correlation between carbon sinks and water resources will gradually weaken and become insignificant as lucc occurs and the f forest background conditions improve on the premise under similar climatic and geographical conditions 3 5 effects of insufficient water yield on the vegetation carbon sink during drought years although the study area is located in a humid area a serious drought occurred in all three basins in 2011 significantly affecting the carbon sink and runoff by comparing the nep and runoff in 2011 with the multiyear average it was found that the lucc and forest background conditions played a key role in controlling the ability to adjust the carbon sinks and runoff in the different basins the basin with high forest coverage resisted extreme drought by consuming more runoff to retain more carbon when experiencing drought fig 9 as shown in fig 9 the nep of the nm and mt basins decreased by 33 92 and 20 76 gc m2 compared with the multiyear average respectively spatially the nep of 68 31 and 77 44 of the area of the nm and mt basins decreased mainly located in the north central part of the nm basin and the northern part of the mt basin however due to the high forest coverage in the sm basin only 37 68 of the sm basin showed a decrease in nep of 200 0 gc m2 respectively the remaining 62 32 of the sm basin showed a slight increasing trend resulting in an average increase in nep of 4 96 gc m2 additionally the runoff anomalies of the nm mt and sm basins in 2011 were 159 31 180 79 and 199 74 mm respectively and their sequence was contrary to that of nep 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of how the vegetation carbon sink affects water resources changes in terrestrial vegetation carbon sinks have important influences on water resources in the past 20 years the nep of the three basins all showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing while the runoff showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing the enhanced carbon sinks will consume more water resources but on the premise of similar climatic and geographical conditions the significant negative correlation between the carbon sinks and water resources will gradually weaken and become insignificant with the luccs and the improvement of forest background conditions figs 7 and 8 forests are the most important terrestrial vegetation carbon sink and have deep root systems that enable plants to extract deep soil moisture the increase in forest coverage not only increases the terrestrial vegetation carbon sink capacity but also changes the processes of infiltration evapotranspiration soil water transport runoff generation and confluence in the hydrological process thus enhancing the water consumption and storage of the basin and reducing the total water resources in the basins lee and veizer 2003 lang et al 2017 song and deng 2017 van dijke et al 2022 especially in arid areas such as the middle reaches of the yellow river basin of china due to its dry climate and low soil moisture large scale ecological restoration policies have increased the vegetation coverage but have led to a sharp reduction in water resources in the basin feng et al 2016 liu et al 2016 in the middle low latitude karst area of southwest china the correlation between the vegetation carbon sinks and water resources was significantly related to the luccs and the forest background conditions due to the extensive development of underground cracks pipelines caves and underground streams in karst areas when the vegetation coverage is low a large amount of water leaks before it flows into rivers or is absorbed by vegetation resulting in engineering water shortages bai et al 2013 dubois et al 2014 qin et al 2015 when the forest coverage rate gradually increases the changes in the plant canopy and soil aquifer can intercept more unavailable leakage water although the amount of intercepted water is far less than the change in precipitation it can improve the water use efficiency of vegetation increase the water holding capacity and improve the engineering water shortage in karst landforms chen et al 2016 yang et al 2017 additionally this study has certain limitations in the calculation of terrestrial vegetation carbon sinks first rock weathering carbon sinks which are the key components of carbon sinks in the middle low latitude karst area of southwest china gong et al 2021 li et al 2022 xiong et al 2022 li et al 2023 should be incorporated into the terrestrial carbon sink calculation then although the arbor layer is the main carbon sink in the study area the shrub layer litter layer and soil layer also have certain carbon sink potential and are closely related to human activities such as afforestation and deforestation zhao et al 2016 wu et al 2021a xiao et al 2023 thus the consideration and accurate calculation of the vertical spatial distribution of vegetation carbon sinks is of great significance for achieving the carbon neutrality objective and should also be incorporated into terrestrial carbon sink calculation finally only three mid small karst basins with similar climatic and geographical conditions were selected while the difference in the correlation between carbon sinks and water resources could be associated with many factors such as basin area forest coverage rate climate factors and lucc etc 4 2 analysis of the carbon sink and water yield in basins during the drought period extreme events such as drought have a great impact on vegetation carbon sinks and water yields and are identified as key components of the terrestrial water and carbon cycles yin et al 2018 during the drought period temperature increases and precipitation decreases led to a sharp decrease in water yield in the basin the climatic and hydrological characteristics may have direct and indirect impacts on the carbon sink capacity of vegetation in a basin and these impacts are almost negative frank et al 2015 vegetation growth in arid ecosystems has strong resistance to drought events and can inhibit the significant reduction in gpp vicente serrano et al 2013 in humid ecosystems drought can influence the carbon cycle by altering physiological functioning including photosynthesis and vegetation respiration and reducing vegetation productivity zhang et al 2020 extreme events also increase tree mortality and can lead to the degradation of the basin ecosystem additionally indirect and lagging extreme arid climate factors including fires and pest and pathogen outbreaks may lead to the weakening of the carbon sink capacity in a basin aldersley et al 2011 cornelissen 2011 the interannual variability in the carbon cycle is particularly dominated by the occurrence of extreme events seneviratne et al 2010 and the impact of extreme events on terrestrial vegetation carbon sinks is multifaceted in 2011 the study area had the most severe drought in nearly a century li et al 2019 and this drought had a large influence on the water yield and carbon sink the basin with higher forest coverage resisted extreme drought by consuming more runoff to retain more carbon fig 9 among the basins in this study the stabilized basin sm basin as a subtropical nature reserve in southwest china has the highest forest coverage and the best plant ecology forests tend to have a larger carbon sink capacity than most other biomes because trees store carbon in woody tissues that are protected from decomposition and respiratory release keenan and williams 2018 to obtain the advantage of resisting extreme drought the aboveground biomass dominated by trees has higher survival and carbon sink capacity under drought and consumes more water resources eventually basins with high forest coverage tend to consume more water resources but retain more carbon 4 3 policy implications for terrestrial vegetation carbon sink enhancement china s policies on land use planning have greatly affected regional water resources since the late 1990s china has carried out a large cropland conversion program the grain for green policy largely alleviated water and soil erosion and slowed rocky desertification in karst areas lang et al 2017 additionally during the implementation of ecological policies such as large scale forest expansion china has simultaneously experienced the largest economic development and urbanization process globally in this context china still proposes an ambitious carbon neutrality objective and the conflict between carbon sinks and water resources in the basins will become even more pronounced therefore considering the negative correlation between carbon sinks and water resources at the basin scale of different land structures should be the next direction of land use policy in china different basin development models have different contradictions between carbon sinks and water yields in the degenerated basin nm basin there is the guiyang urban agglomeration in southwest china and the main reason for the reduction in vegetation cover is the expansion of economic development and urbanization economic development destroys the original vegetation in the basin reducing the vegetation and carbon sink capacity which makes the negative correlation between the carbon sink and water yield more significant the restoration basin mt basin responds to the national ecological policy and realizes the restoration of forests in patches the large scale artificial ecological afforestation project not only increases the carbon sink capacity but also weakens the negative correlation between the carbon sink and water yield which is conducive to the utilization of water resources in the stabilized basin sm basin the carbon sink and water yield have achieved a slight negative correlation which indicates that the policy of maintaining the natural forest reserve is an important means to alleviate the contradiction between the carbon sink and water resources 5 conclusion by using rs dtvgm and rshs technology this research quantitatively analyzed the correlation between nep and runoff from 2000 to 2020 in three mid small basins that represent different levels of carbon sinks and human activity in the middle low latitude karst area of southwest china the results are as follows 1 in the past 20 years the nep of all three basins showed trends of first increasing and then decreasing while the runoff showed trends of first decreasing and then increasing the opposite trends of nep and runoff supported the negative correlation between nep and runoff 2 the enhanced carbon sinks will consume more water but on the premise of similar climatic and geographical conditions the significant strong negative correlation between carbon sink and water resources will gradually weaken and become insignificant as the lucc occurs and the forest background conditions improve from approximately 35 to more than 80 3 the serious drought event had a large influence on the water yield and carbon sink and the basin with the highest forest coverage resisted extreme drought by consuming more runoff to retain more carbon this research found that the negative correlation between the vegetation carbon sinks and water resources in the middle low latitude karst area was significantly related to luccs and the forest background conditions which also play key roles in controlling the ability to adjust the carbon sink and water yield in the basins when resisting extreme drought the question of whether the enhanced carbon sink will consume more water resources in mid small basins in middle low latitude karst areas was quantitatively answered which has valuable implications for managers who want to increase carbon sinks but worry about lost water resources and the results can be used to promote the co evolution of the water carbon system thereby achieving the carbon neutrality objective credit authorship contribution statement hezhen lou

1961,to meet the carbon peak and carbon neutrality objectives the middle low latitude karst areas of southwest china have become popular research areas due to their rich terrestrial carbon sink storage capability however whether the enhanced terrestrial vegetation carbon sink will consume more water resources in this area is still unclear in this research three mid small basins that represent different levels of carbon sink and human activity were selected in the middle low latitude karst area of southwest china net ecosystem productivity nep was used to indicate the variation in the carbon sink and the remote sensing driven distributed time variant gain model rs dtvgm and a new runoff monitoring technology named the remote sensing hydrological station rshs were integrated to quantitatively analyze the correlation between the carbon sink and water resources from 2000 to 2020 the results showed that 1 in the past 20 years the nep of the three basins all showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing while the runoff of all basins showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing the opposite trends of nep and runoff supported the negative correlation between nep and runoff 2 the enhanced carbon sink will consume more water but on the premise of similar climatic and geographical conditions the significant strong negative correlation between the carbon sink and water resources will gradually weaken and become insignificant as the land use cover change lucc occurs and the forest background conditions improve from approximately 35 to more than 80 3 the serious drought event had a large influence on the water yield and carbon sink and the basin with higher forest coverage could resist extreme drought by consuming more runoff to retain more carbon this research quantitatively answered the question of whether the enhanced carbon sink will consume more water resources in the middle low latitude humid karst areas which provide valuable implications to managers who want to increase carbon sinks but worry about lost water resources and the results can be used to promote the co evolution of the water carbon system thereby achieving the carbon neutrality objective keywords vegetation carbon sink water resources hydrological model remote sensing hydrological stations extreme drought data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global and regional carbon cycling processes have become the core of global change and macroecological research snelgrove et al 2018 regnier et al 2022 one of the key points in carbon cycling research is to determine the volume spatial distribution and variation in the terrestrial vegetation carbon sink and forests are the main carbon sinks worldwide fauset et al 2015 changes in forest coverage will greatly affect the terrestrial carbon cycling process and the carbon sink pan et al 2011 brienen et al 2020 additionally these changes have a negative influence on the biodiversity water content carbon and nutrient cycling and the energy balance of the terrestrial ecological system phillips and lewis 2014 a fluctuation of the terrestrial carbon sink will vastly change the land surface environment and the hydrological cycling process in a basin pugh et al 2019 afforestation and plant recovery are effective and important ways to add terrestrial vegetation carbon sinks that can store co2 in the air so many afforestation projects have been implemented worldwide segura et al 2021 wu et al 2021b however at the basin scale the increased area of plants will affect the water resources by enhancing the evaporation capacity and reducing the runoff in the river le maitre and versfeld 1997 betts 2011 we should focus on the close coupling of hydrological and carbon cycling in the basin and they play the role of media and the engine of transportation of material and energy when the co2 concentration in the air increases due to the combustion of fossil fuel the climate and the coupled carbon water cycle change and then alter the processes of terrestrial hydrology and the usability of soil moisture when the plan leaf absorbs co2 kramer 1981 leakey et al 2006 in addition the leaf stoma adjusts and biomass is enhanced based on the air co2 concentration and the photosynthesis ability and transpiration rate are strengthened gifford 1995 these variations in vegetation cover and the carbon sink at the microscale will have an imperceptible and deep influence on carbon and water cycling the increase in terrestrial vegetation carbon sinks will consume a large amount of water resources in their respective basins and this result is prominently shown by a significant decrease in runoff for example robust and systematic ecological restoration policies e g the grain for green policy from the china government have increased the vegetation cover in the past two decades especially on the loess plateau located in the semiarid region of central china huang et al 2003 chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 and this increase in vegetation has caused surface runoff and regionally available water resources to decrease additionally ecological restoration policies have been implemented in the subtropical region of southwest china lou et al 2021 yang et al 2022 where the vegetation types and biodiversity are much richer than those in the semiarid area driven by these policies and social development the variations in the plant coverage and the carbon sink are very significant in many basins in this area and these variations cause fluctuations in the water resources wei et al 2021 three characteristics exist in the terrestrial carbon sink in southwest china first under the background of the carbon peak and carbon neutrality objectives in china the terrestrial carbon sink has experienced turbulence in the past twenty years in southwest china unlike grassland areas that can achieve the carbon neutrality objective by adjusting the moderate grazing duration zhang et al 2023 due to the grain for green policy a large area of artificial forest has been cultivated in southwest china to achieve the carbon neutrality objective second southwest china is the main distribution area of middle low latitude karst areas with a total area of 55 104 km2 wang et al 2015 in addition to rich forest resources and biodiversity yang et al 2021 the carbonate rock weathering carbon sink and silicate rock weathering carbon sink in karst areas of southwest china play significant roles in carbon sequestration and the reduction of the greenhouse effect gong et al 2021 li et al 2022 xiong et al 2022 li et al 2023 third extreme weather events e g extreme drought have been identified as key factors influencing the terrestrial carbon sink and they have occurred more frequently in southwest china yin et al 2018 in general southwest china receives more attention because of its large and stable terrestrial carbon sink however if managers hope to obtain more carbon sinks to satisfy the carbon neutrality objective the risks to water resources should be taken seriously in this research we focused on the correlation between the carbon sink and the water resources in the mid small basin at a long temporal scale in the middle low latitude karst areas of southwest china which are often overlooked however due to scarce scientific data on carbon sinks and water resources the mid small basin is more sensitive to fluctuations in vegetation cover and climate change to address this issue multisource remote sensing and new runoff monitoring technology were applied in this study the objectives were as follows 1 determine whether policy driven forest restoration which enhances the carbon sink consumes more water resources at the basin scale under different land use cover changes luccs and forest background conditions and 2 determine whether a basin with high forest coverage will retain more carbon sinks by consuming more runoff when experiencing extreme drought this research is expected to provide valuable implications for managers who want to increase carbon sinks but worry about lost water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area three typical mid small basins namely the nanming nm basin maotiao mt basin and shamu sm basin were selected as the study area fig 1 these basins are located in guizhou province the center of the karst area in southwest china with the karst landform accounting for 65 2 of the total area of guizhou province bai et al 2023 in addition to the rich forest resources and large carbon sink potential the karst landform is a prominent feature in the study area quantities of water usually named invalid blue water chen et al 2016 leak through the extensive underground cracks pipelines caves and underground streams in karst areas leading to a deficiency in surface water resources significant soil erosion and rocky desertification bai et al 2013 dubois et al 2014 qin et al 2015 these basins shared the same climatic conditions e g a subtropical plateau monsoon humid climate with distinct seasons high temperature and rain in summer and warmth and humidity in winter the average annual precipitation can reach 1052 1180 mm the average annual temperature is between 14 and 16 5 c the average annual sunshine duration is approximately1200 hours and the average annual runoff of the nm basin mt basin and sm basin is 21 16 23 38 and 4 52 m3 s respectively table 1 additionally these basins differ in their development directions first the nm basin where the capital of guizhou province is located has an area of 1334 95 km2 a total of 22 62 of the area is construction land which is the highest among the three basins the nm basin has more human activities and good economic conditions with a population density and agdp of 1791 32 people km2 and 7 79 104 respectively and the speed of urban expansion was far greater than the speed of forest restoration from 2000 to 2020 second the mt basin has a similar basin area of 1341 21 km2 and there are no significant differences in precipitation temperature sunshine duration runoff and other climatic factors between the mt and nm basins different from the nm basin the mt basin has a slight level of human development with a population density and agdp of 398 33 people km2 and 6 17 104 respectively there was a large amount of forest restoration in the mt basin from 2000 to 2020 resulting in a forest coverage rate of approximately 50 which was higher than the 35 forest coverage rate in the nm basin third the sm basin is similar to a pure natural basin with a smaller area of 250 61 km2 due to the existence of the yuntai mountain national natural reserve human activities are limited and lucc was not obvious from 2000 to 2020 in the sm basin with a population density and agdp of 17 53 people km2 and 3 18 104 respectively therefore the correlation between the carbon sink and water resources in the sm basin can be regarded as being affected only by climate change 2 2 methods 2 2 1 terrestrial vegetation soil ecosystem carbon sink calculation methods net ecosystem productivity nep can reflect the process of the material cycle and energy flow and it can properly represent the terrestrial vegetation soil ecosystem carbon sink and be used to check whether an ecosystem is a carbon source or a carbon sink liu et

of obtaining hydrological data in complex river channels in karst areas because of the special geographical environment and poor economic conditions a new technology named the remote sensing hydrological station rshs was applied to obtain long serial runoff data in these remote areas the rshs yang et al 2019 lou et al 2020 yang et al 2020 wufu et al 2021 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b

retrieve the river water width and 3 the calculation platform generated by the idl language was applied to calculate the long time serial runoff of the river sections and validate the performance of the technology 2 2 3 basin water resource calculation by rs dtvgm in this study a remote sensing driven distributed time variant gain model rs dtvgm xia et al 2003 cai et al 2017 lou et al 2019 was

accessibility the main date range was from 2000 to 2020 3 results 3 1 variation in forest coverage in the basins the forest coverage variation in the three basins is presented here first due to its significant importance as a carbon sink fig 3 from 2000 to 2020 the nm basin with a large city and a large population had a significant and dispersive degeneration trend of forest coverage specifically its forest area decreased from 481 18 km2 to 461 47 km2 and the forest coverage rate decreased from 36 03 to 34 56 in the mt basin which has fewer influences from human activities than the nm basin the forest area increased from 652 82 km2 to 688 94 km2 and the coverage rate increased from 49 07 to 51 78 in the past two decades the forest coverage rate of the sm basin which has little influence from human activities was fairly stable and increased from 81 52 to 82 55 in the past 20 years in general from 2000 to 2020 the nm basin had the lowest forest coverage and degeneration characteristics and the mt basin had a higher coverage rate and a recovery trend the sm basin had a large natural reserve with high and stable forest coverage 3 2 characteristics of terrestrial vegetation carbon sinks in the basins the basin terrestrial vegetation carbon sink can be represented by the nep the net ecosystem productivity of the vegetation the nep in the three basins in the past two decades was quantitatively analyzed and it was found that the carbon sink of these basins showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing from 2000 to 2020 but the trend significance and change rate of the different basins were different fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the order of the average nep from 2000 to 2020 was nm basin mt basin and sm basin with average values of 588 45 607 50 and 637 64 gc m2 respectively from 2000 to 2020 the nep of the three basins showed divergent trends the nm basin showed an insignificant decreasing trend of 0 11 gc m2 year 1 the sm basin showed an insignificant increasing trend of 0 08 gc m2 year 1 and the mt basin showed a relatively insignificant increasing trend p 0 16 of 1 78 gc m2 year 1 after adopting the subsection fitting method from 2000 to 2013 the mt basin and nm basin both showed relatively insignificant increasing trends with similar increasing rates 4 14 and 4 35 gc m2 year 1 significance probability p 0 11 and 0 16 and coefficient of determination r 2 0 16 and 0 06 for the sm basin the nep had a large fluctuation with no significant trend p 0 38 and r 2 0 06 from 2013 to 2020 the nm basin and sm basin both showed a relatively significant decreasing trend with rates of 8 80 and 7 50 gc m2 year 1 and the significance probability p 0 09 and 0 10 and coefficient of determination r 2 0 41 and 0 39 were similar notably due to the forest restoration in the mt basin nep showed an insignificant decreasing trend p 0 32 and r 2 0 16 with a rate of 5 03 gc m2 year 1 additionally the order of the nep standard deviation from 2000 to 2020 was also the nm basin mt basin and sm basin the nm and mt basins had a similar variation tendency the nep standard was deviation maintained at a high level when the carbon sink in the basin was enhanced and the nep standard deviation decreased when the carbon storage ability was weakened however the nep standard deviation of the sm basin had a flatter variation trend than that of the other two basins mainly because the spatial distribution of the nep was uniform and the whole basin had a high level of carbon storage the carbon sink in each studied basin had prominent spatial variation which was close to the variation in forest coverage fig 5 the nep in the whole mt basin increased over the past 20 years with an average increasing rate of 1 71 gc m2 year 1 and there was a heterogeneous spatial distribution i e the southeastern area with a low nep in 2000 had a further decreasing trend by 2020 while the northwestern area with a high nep had an increasing trend in the nm basin the nep in the whole area had a significant decline with a decreasing rate of 6 90 gc m2 year 1 and had a spatial aggregation effect from 2000 to 2020 i e the nep had a high value in the forest restoration area in the mt basin but in the southeast the nep decreased different from the other two basins the sm basin had a high background nep value and it also had a large and stable forest area therefore due to the increases in temperature and precipitation the spatial changes in nep in the sm basin were staggered and slightly increased overall with an increasing rate of 0 13 gc m2 year 1 3 3 performance of the rshs and the variation in water resources the runoff of the three basins from 2016 to 2020 was calculated by using the rshs technology since the field survey work was carried out in 2019 and 2020 the parameter calibration and validation of rs dtvgm were carried out with the calibration period being from 2019 to 2020 and the validation period being from 2016 to 2018 fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the runoff simulations during the calibration period for the mt nm and sm basins were reliable showing high nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients nses of 0 79 0 77 and 0 71 and low root mean square errors rmses of 8 29 8 09 and 1 66 m3 s respectively during the validation period the runoff simulation was still reliable although the nses of the mt nm and sm basins decreased slightly by 0 09 0 02 and 0 03 respectively in summary the rshs improved the accuracy of the rs dtvgm in runoff simulation and enabled rs dtvgm to obtain reliable long term runoff after the calibration of the rshs the monthly runoff was simulated by the rs dtvgm from 2000 to 2020 in the three basins fig 7 a c with the increase in precipitation the runoff of the three basins all showed an increasing trend and the occurrence times of the precipitation peak and runoff peak coincided next to avoid the impact of intra annual fluctuations in precipitation and runoff all monthly scale data were combined into annual scale data and trend analysis was carried out fig 7d as shown in fig 7d the mt nm and sm basins showed fluctuating insignificant increasing trends with average rates of 3 41 3 62 and 1 81 mm year and significance probability p of 0 35 0 23 and 0 59 respectively after adopting the subsection fitting method from 2000 to 2011 the mt nm and sm basins showed relatively significant decreasing trends with average rates of 14 08 11 57 and 11 87 mm year and significance probability p of 0 08 0 07 and 0 17 respectively the reason why the runoff change in the sm basin was relatively insignificant is that the sm basin was far away from the mt and nm basins and the difference in climate conditions resulted in the significance probability p of precipitation fitting line in the sm basin p 0 13 being slightly higher in mt and nm basins p 0 05 and 0 06 from 2000 to 2011 from 2011 to 2020 the mt nm and sm basins all showed significant increasing trends with average rates of 24 96 21 54 and 21 09 mm year and significance probability p of 0 03 0 03 and 0 06 respectively notably compared with the nep trend analysis results of the three basins shown in fig 4 although the dividing point was 2 years away there was an opposite trend between the water resources and carbon sinks in the three basins from 2000 to 2020 in general which could support the negative correlation between the nep and runoff finally the precipitation data and rs dtvgm runoff results from 2000 to 2020 were compared with the statistical data of the prefecture level cities where the three basins are located in the water resource bulletin of guizhou province the results showed that the input precipitation and runoff results of the rs dtvgm were reliable fig 7e and f as shown in fig 7e although there were some extremely wet or dry years the precipitation data still had a significant positive correlation with the statistical data in the mt nm and sm basins p 0 01 with coefficients of determination r 2 of 0 82 0 83 and 0 63 respectively as shown in fig 7f the rs dtvgm runoff results also had a significant positive correlation with the statistical runoff depth in the water resource bulletin in the mt nm and sm basins p 0 01 with coefficients of determination r 2 of 0 61 0 62 and 0 67 respectively 3 4 correlation between vegetation carbon sink and water resources the correlation analysis between nep and runoff was carried out from 2000 to 2020 in the nm mt and sm basins fig 8 a c as shown in fig 8a c regardless of the nep value the connection lines between precipitation and runoff were parallel indicating a stable causal correlation between the precipitation and runoff in all three basins then there were many intersections between the connection line of nep and runoff in the mt and nm basins and it usually corresponded to lower runoff when nep was higher than 636 10 and 621 21 gc m2 respectively which means that there was an obvious reduction of the runoff in the mt and nm basins when the carbon sink was enhanced however the runoff was also high when the nep in the sm basin was low but the corresponding runoff was moderate when the nep was high which indicated that there was a weak correlation between the nep and runoff in the sm basin next the fitting line of nep and runoff in the past 20 years in the three basins was further fitted by univariate linear fitting fig 8d as shown in fig 8d the nm basin which had rapid urban expansion and poor forest background conditions showed a significant strong negative correlation between nep and runoff with a fitting slope k of 0 88 a pearsoncorrelation coefficient r of 0 45 and a significance probability p 0 05 this means that approximately 0 88 mm of runoff will be consumed by increasing the carbon sink by 1 gc m2 in the nm basin although the mt basin had a similar basin area and climatic conditions to the nm basin the runoff and carbon sink showed a relatively insignificant weak negative correlation in the mt basin with a fitting slope k of 0 68 a pearsoncorrelation coefficient r of 0 26 and a significance probability p of 0 27 this means that approximately 0 68 mm of runoff less than that in the nm basin will be consumed by increasing the carbon sink by 1 gc m2 in the mt basin which was probably affected by the implementation of forest restoration projects and better forest background conditions in the mt basin in the past 20 years finally the sm basin which always maintained high forest coverage from 2000 2020 had no significant correlation between nep and runoff with a fitting slope k of 0 35 a pearsoncorrelation coefficient r of 0 13 and a significance probability p of 0 60 in general due to the developed root system luxuriant branches and leaves and strong water retention of forest land van dijke et al 2022 xiao et al 2023 the increase in carbon sinks caused by forest restoration will lead to an increase in the consumption of water resources in addition due to the characteristics of the thin soil layer and strong permeability in karst areas bai et al 2013 chen et al 2016 the significant negative correlation between carbon sinks and water resources will gradually weaken and become insignificant as lucc occurs and the f forest background conditions improve on the premise under similar climatic and geographical conditions 3 5 effects of insufficient water yield on the vegetation carbon sink during drought years although the study area is located in a humid area a serious drought occurred in all three basins in 2011 significantly affecting the carbon sink and runoff by comparing the nep and runoff in 2011 with the multiyear average it was found that the lucc and forest background conditions played a key role in controlling the ability to adjust the carbon sinks and runoff in the different basins the basin with high forest coverage resisted extreme drought by consuming more runoff to retain more carbon when experiencing drought fig 9 as shown in fig 9 the nep of the nm and mt basins decreased by 33 92 and 20 76 gc m2 compared with the multiyear average respectively spatially the nep of 68 31 and 77 44 of the area of the nm and mt basins decreased mainly located in the north central part of the nm basin and the northern part of the mt basin however due to the high forest coverage in the sm basin only 37 68 of the sm basin showed a decrease in nep of 200 0 gc m2 respectively the remaining 62 32 of the sm basin showed a slight increasing trend resulting in an average increase in nep of 4 96 gc m2 additionally the runoff anomalies of the nm mt and sm basins in 2011 were 159 31 180 79 and 199 74 mm respectively and their sequence was contrary to that of nep 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of how the vegetation carbon sink affects water resources changes in terrestrial vegetation carbon sinks have important influences on water resources in the past 20 years the nep of the three basins all showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing while the runoff showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing the enhanced carbon sinks will consume more water resources but on the premise of similar climatic and geographical conditions the significant negative correlation between the carbon sinks and water resources will gradually weaken and become insignificant with the luccs and the improvement of forest background conditions figs 7 and 8 forests are the most important terrestrial vegetation carbon sink and have deep root systems that enable plants to extract deep soil moisture the increase in forest coverage not only increases the terrestrial vegetation carbon sink capacity but also changes the processes of infiltration evapotranspiration soil water transport runoff generation and confluence in the hydrological process thus enhancing the water consumption and storage of the basin and reducing the total water resources in the basins lee and veizer 2003 lang et al 2017 song and deng 2017 van dijke et al 2022 especially in arid areas such as the middle reaches of the yellow river basin of china due to its dry climate and low soil moisture large scale ecological restoration policies have increased the vegetation coverage but have led to a sharp reduction in water resources in the basin feng et al 2016 liu et al 2016 in the middle low latitude karst area of southwest china the correlation between the vegetation carbon sinks and water resources was significantly related to the luccs and the forest background conditions due to the extensive development of underground cracks pipelines caves and underground streams in karst areas when the vegetation coverage is low a large amount of water leaks before it flows into rivers or is absorbed by vegetation resulting in engineering water shortages bai et al 2013 dubois et al 2014 qin et al 2015 when the forest coverage rate gradually increases the changes in the plant canopy and soil aquifer can intercept more unavailable leakage water although the amount of intercepted water is far less than the change in precipitation it can improve the water use efficiency of vegetation increase the water holding capacity and improve the engineering water shortage in karst landforms chen et al 2016 yang et al 2017 additionally this study has certain limitations in the calculation of terrestrial vegetation carbon sinks first rock weathering carbon sinks which are the key components of carbon sinks in the middle low latitude karst area of southwest china gong et al 2021 li et al 2022 xiong et al 2022 li et al 2023 should be incorporated into the terrestrial carbon sink calculation then although the arbor layer is the main carbon sink in the study area the shrub layer litter layer and soil layer also have certain carbon sink potential and are closely related to human activities such as afforestation and deforestation zhao et al 2016 wu et al 2021a xiao et al 2023 thus the consideration and accurate calculation of the vertical spatial distribution of vegetation carbon sinks is of great significance for achieving the carbon neutrality objective and should also be incorporated into terrestrial carbon sink calculation finally only three mid small karst basins with similar climatic and geographical conditions were selected while the difference in the correlation between carbon sinks and water resources could be associated with many factors such as basin area forest coverage rate climate factors and lucc etc 4 2 analysis of the carbon sink and water yield in basins during the drought period extreme events such as drought have a great impact on vegetation carbon sinks and water yields and are identified as key components of the terrestrial water and carbon cycles yin et al 2018 during the drought period temperature increases and precipitation decreases led to a sharp decrease in water yield in the basin the climatic and hydrological characteristics may have direct and indirect impacts on the carbon sink capacity of vegetation in a basin and these impacts are almost negative frank et al 2015 vegetation growth in arid ecosystems has strong resistance to drought events and can inhibit the significant reduction in gpp vicente serrano et al 2013 in humid ecosystems drought can influence the carbon cycle by altering physiological functioning including photosynthesis and vegetation respiration and reducing vegetation productivity zhang et al 2020 extreme events also increase tree mortality and can lead to the degradation of the basin ecosystem additionally indirect and lagging extreme arid climate factors including fires and pest and pathogen outbreaks may lead to the weakening of the carbon sink capacity in a basin aldersley et al 2011 cornelissen 2011 the interannual variability in the carbon cycle is particularly dominated by the occurrence of extreme events seneviratne et al 2010 and the impact of extreme events on terrestrial vegetation carbon sinks is multifaceted in 2011 the study area had the most severe drought in nearly a century li et al 2019 and this drought had a large influence on the water yield and carbon sink the basin with higher forest coverage resisted extreme drought by consuming more runoff to retain more carbon fig 9 among the basins in this study the stabilized basin sm basin as a subtropical nature reserve in southwest china has the highest forest coverage and the best plant ecology forests tend to have a larger carbon sink capacity than most other biomes because trees store carbon in woody tissues that are protected from decomposition and respiratory release keenan and williams 2018 to obtain the advantage of resisting extreme drought the aboveground biomass dominated by trees has higher survival and carbon sink capacity under drought and consumes more water resources eventually basins with high forest coverage tend to consume more water resources but retain more carbon 4 3 policy implications for terrestrial vegetation carbon sink enhancement china s policies on land use planning have greatly affected regional water resources since the late 1990s china has carried out a large cropland conversion program the grain for green policy largely alleviated water and soil erosion and slowed rocky desertification in karst areas lang et al 2017 additionally during the implementation of ecological policies such as large scale forest expansion china has simultaneously experienced the largest economic development and urbanization process globally in this context china still proposes an ambitious carbon neutrality objective and the conflict between carbon sinks and water resources in the basins will become even more pronounced therefore considering the negative correlation between carbon sinks and water resources at the basin scale of different land structures should be the next direction of land use policy in china different basin development models have different contradictions between carbon sinks and water yields in the degenerated basin nm basin there is the guiyang urban agglomeration in southwest china and the main reason for the reduction in vegetation cover is the expansion of economic development and urbanization economic development destroys the original vegetation in the basin reducing the vegetation and carbon sink capacity which makes the negative correlation between the carbon sink and water yield more significant the restoration basin mt basin responds to the national ecological policy and realizes the restoration of forests in patches the large scale artificial ecological afforestation project not only increases the carbon sink capacity but also weakens the negative correlation between the carbon sink and water yield which is conducive to the utilization of water resources in the stabilized basin sm basin the carbon sink and water yield have achieved a slight negative correlation which indicates that the policy of maintaining the natural forest reserve is an important means to alleviate the contradiction between the carbon sink and water resources 5 conclusion by using rs dtvgm and rshs technology this research quantitatively analyzed the correlation between nep and runoff from 2000 to 2020 in three mid small basins that represent different levels of carbon sinks and human activity in the middle low latitude karst area of southwest china the results are as follows 1 in the past 20 years the nep of all three basins showed trends of first increasing and then decreasing while the runoff showed trends of first decreasing and then increasing the opposite trends of nep and runoff supported the negative correlation between nep and runoff 2 the enhanced carbon sinks will consume more water but on the premise of similar climatic and geographical conditions the significant strong negative correlation between carbon sink and water resources will gradually weaken and become insignificant as the lucc occurs and the forest background conditions improve from approximately 35 to more than 80 3 the serious drought event had a large influence on the water yield and carbon sink and the basin with the highest forest coverage resisted extreme drought by consuming more runoff to retain more carbon this research found that the negative correlation between the vegetation carbon sinks and water resources in the middle low latitude karst area was significantly related to luccs and the forest background conditions which also play key roles in controlling the ability to adjust the carbon sink and water yield in the basins when resisting extreme drought the question of whether the enhanced carbon sink will consume more water resources in mid small basins in middle low latitude karst areas was quantitatively answered which has valuable implications for managers who want to increase carbon sinks but worry about lost water resources and the results can be used to promote the co evolution of the water carbon system thereby achieving the carbon neutrality objective credit authorship contribution statement hezhen lou

1962,the effect of flood waves entering into artificial reservoirs has to be carefully considered for properly addressing dam management to warrant water resources utilization and to provide flood control within a context of safety for the upstream and downstream territories the optimization of the dam management has to be mainly based on the forecast of the water volume entering the reservoir and of the planning releases from the bottom outlets and the spillways the flood forecasting models are able to provide discharge predictions at sections of particular interest i e upstream of artificial reservoirs with forecast horizons appropriate to support the civil protection activities for the mitigation of flooding effects in 2019 nanda et al developed five deterministic forecasts of inflows to the indian dam of hirakud in the mahanadi river basin by using the semi distributed variable infiltration capacity vic model and four error correction models for updating the streamflow predictions by vic these models only provide deterministic forecasts for the future events and do not deal with the uncertainty on decisions with the aim to shed light on the benefits for appropriately using probabilistic forecasts and uncertainty estimate the deterministic forecasts provided in nanda et al 2019 are here used to feed the model conditional processor mcp that allows to estimate the predictive uncertainty through the analytical treatment of multivariate probability densities enabling a decision based on multiple forecasts of different models at the same time the study is performed considering the monsoon periods of the years 2008 2011 the results achieved for the calibration and validation analysis show that mcp application involving a larger number of deterministic models up to five improves the probabilistic forecast accuracy in terms of the expected value accuracy and 90 uncertainty band width moreover when only the two best deterministic models are considered as inputs for mcp the results are similar to the ones achieved by using all the available deterministic forecasts the results indicate that mcp is able to provide effective probabilistic real time inflow forecasting into the reservoir to be used as an appropriate support for the artificial reservoir management during significant flood events keywords vic model error updating flood forecasting predictive un certainty threshold exceedance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction last decades showed the steady increase of damages due to flooding highlighting the need of developing effective measures to reduce the impact of flood events to this end structural and non structural measures such as real time flood forecasting and warning systems may be used to mitigate the hydraulic risk the presence of dams in the river basins influences the natural variability of streamflow also affecting the timing and magnitude of floods in the downstream areas mishra et al 2018 therefore the presence of reservoirs across the watersheds is an important aspect to be considered in the flood mitigation efforts boulange et al 2021 the main focus of reservoir operation is to find a trade off between water conservation for the dry season and mitigation of flooding effects sudheer et al 2019 awan and bae 2014 to operate multi purpose dams for flood control reliable inflow forecasts into the reservoirs with sufficient lead time are fundamental and the forecast horizon required is assessed by the minimum period of advance warning necessary for the preparatory action of disaster management xu et al 2021 hong et al 2020 faulty dam operations can exacerbate flooding events hence worsening the impact on the upstream and downstream territories nanditha and mishra 2021 patel et al 2017 in the scientific literature flood forecasting has been typically approached through physically based rainfall runoff das et al 2022 sayama et al 2020 jain et al 2018 kauffeldt et al 2016 brocca et al 2011 just to cite a few and or flood routing models e g huang et al 2022 sahoo et al 2014 perumal et al 2011 barbetta et al 2011 price 2009 hsu et al 2006 hsu et al 2003 while the former predicts the discharge at selected river sections with a lead time depending on the time of concentration of the river basin the latter provides forecasts at downstream ends of river reaches with a lead time limited by the wave travel time moreover other approaches for flood forecasting have been proposed such as the neural network based data driven models using discharge or water level as the input e g dtissibe et al 2020 hong et al 2020 kim and han 2020 nanda et al 2016 nguyen et al 2014 the operational real time conceptual or physically based rainfall runoff flood forecasting models need inputs of real time rainfall and meteorological forecasts either from the telemetric raingauge stations or satellite estimates in many world river basins the real time telemetric rainfalls are hardly available which made researchers depend on the satellite based real time rainfall products moreover the meteorological forecasts from the numerical weather prediction nwp linked with different grid based hydrological models are in operation in different world river basins for lead time flood forecasting at the river basin scale a flood forecasting model is generally comprised of two components i the deterministic component governed by the rainfall runoff rr model and ii the stochastic component which is based on the error series of the forecasted flow that involves forecasting of the residual errors of the simulated discharges among the rr models available in the literature the semi distributed variable infiltration capacity vic model is currently very popular e g srivastava et al 2017 recently this model has been used by nanda et al 2019 to develop a reliable inflow forecasting system to appropriately address the real time management of the hirakud reservoir located along the mahanadi river eastern india the study showed that the vic streamflow forecasting using the nwp forecasts resulted in significant underprediction of the inflows forecast at 1 to 5 day lead times therefore nanda et al 2019 evaluated the capability of vic in integration with the linear autoregressive aru bogner and kalas 2008 perumal et al 2011 autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs armaxu broersen 2007 bogner and kalas 2008 nonlinear static wavelet based neural network wnnu morlet at al 1982 and dynamic wavelet based non linear autoregressive with exogenous inputs wnarxu variants of error correction sub models nanda et al 2016 the results indicated that the accuracy of the vic standalone results improved significantly with the increase in the model complexity in the order vic standalone vic armaxu vic aru vicwnnu vic wnarxu despite the introduced improvements and whatever the used model many errors influence the forecast making the assessment of the uncertainty of predictions fundamental to properly support the decision makers activities many studies are available in the literature on generating probabilistic forecasting from deterministic forecasts by modelling the uncertainty in the single valued hydrologic forecast these approaches address forecasting in terms of a single value plus uncertainty alternatively the introduction of the hydrological uncertainty processor krzysztofowicz 1999 created the basis for the estimation of the flood predictive uncertainty pu which represents the probability of occurrence of a future value of a predictant conditional on all the information that can be obtained on the future value usually provided by forecasting models different processors for pu assessment have been introduced starting from krzysztofowicz 1999 who created the basis for pu estimation by introducing the bayesian forecasting system bfs several other approaches to predictive uncertainty assessment were developed todini 2008 proposed the model conditional processor mcp for estimating the pu mcp allows the analytical treatment of the multivariate probability densities after converting both observations and model s predictions into the normal space and providing a probabilistic forecast that also allow to estimate the probability of exceedance of pre fixed threshold values afterward mcp was extended to the multi model approach barbetta et al 2017 allowing a decision based on multiple forecasts provided by different deterministic models at the same time the present study applies the multi model approach of mcp for the hirakud dam inflow forecasting considering the five different forecasts provided by the vic standalone vic armaxu vic aru vicwnnu and vic wnarxu for lead times ranging from 1 day to 5 days thus providing probabilistic forecasts and probabilities of inflow threshold exceedance 2 study area and dataset the basin of the hirakud reservoir is selected as study area fig 1 it is located in eastern india and the drainage area subtended by the dam is about 83 400 km2 the sub catchments of the mahanadi river basin downstream to this artificial reservoir are mostly flood prone this area is characterized by a distinct wet season during june to september during which about 80 rainfall is received due to the south west summer monsoon system in the peninsular indian sub continent five hydrometric sections are located upstream of the dam on different rivers fig 1 the dataset used in this study is described in what follows for more details the reader is referred to nanda et al 2019 the era interim reanalysis meteorological products from the era interim global atmospheric forecasts at ecmwf such as rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed at 0 25 latitude 0 25 longitude spatial and 12 hour temporal resolutions for the study period 2000 2011 were downloaded for the selected study area from the ecmwf webpage the corresponding gridded daily in situ rainfall data available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 were obtained from the india meteorological department imd for evaluating the accuracy of the era interim rainfall product against the benchmark imd rainfall product these datasets were aggregated into daily timescales the observed daily inflow timeseries into the hirakud reservoir was collected for the period 2000 2011 from the hirakud dam project hdp authority burla the weather forecasts including rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed were obtained from the ecmwf 3 methodology the analysis is based on the reservoir inflow forecasting provided by five different deterministic models vic standalone vic aru vic armaxu vicwnnu and vic wnarxu and the application of the multi model approach of the model conditional processor mcp for predictive uncertainty and probabilistic forecasting assessment 3 1 vic hydrological model vic liang et al 1994 liang et al 1996 is a grid based semi distributed hydrological model that consists of two modules the water balance or the water and energy balance module and the routing module lohmann et al 1996 in the vic model the spatial variability of the infiltration capacity in different land uses is computed by the xianjiang model for setting up the vic rainfall runoff model using the water balance mode the input database requires four input files forcing files soil parameter file vegetation parameter file and vegetation library file the forcing file includes rainfall temperature and wind speed data for each individual grid of the catchment the vic model was run at 0 5 0 5 grid size which is consistent with the resolution of the meteorological forecasts obtained from the ecmwf the daily scale hydro meteorological timeseries data of the year 2000 was used for warming up before calibration to create the initial catchment condition seven years 2001 2007 data was used for calibration and four years data 2008 2011 was used for validation the vic model was calibrated using the reanalysis meteorological inputs from the era interim for setting up the model parameters the ecmwf forecasts of rainfall temperatures and wind speed were used in the calibrated vic to simulate the lead time streamflow forecasts the calibrated vic was run at a 30 days monthly window using i the historical era interim rainfalls for the past 25 days to generate the antecedent soil moisture condition and ii the ecmwf meteorological forecasts for the remaining 5 days to simulate streamflow with a lead time of 1 5 days 3 2 error forecasting models for updating the streamflow forecasts simulated by the vic model an error model ε can be developed using the input error timeseries of ε t ε t 1 ε t d obtained during the model calibration ε t is the simulation error between the observed qobs and vic simulated qsim discharges at any time t with d the effectively correlated time lag for real time streamflow forecasting the lead time error forecasts predicted using error forecasting models ε t α can be used to update the discharge forecasts of vic as 1 q t α q sim t α ε t α where α is the time step ahead forecast the main characteristics of these error correction models are described below for more details the reader is referred to nanda et al 2019 3 2 1 aru error correction model the ar model is often applied for updating streamflow forecast at smaller time step due to its simplicity the simple ar model could be represented as 2 ε t α a i i 1 d ε t 1 i e t α where ε q obs t q sim t simulated streamflow biases by vic ε error simulated by the aru model e white noise and d time delay for inputs which decides the order of the ar model 3 2 2 armaxu error correction model the armax model is capable of incorporating exogenous input variables in addition to the autoregressive endogenous inputs expressed as 3 a q ε t α b q i 1 d ε t 1 i j 1 τ ε t α j c q e t α where d time delay for exogenous inputs used in the armax model τ time delay for endogenous inputs and a q b q and c q are the polynomials of the regression equation 3 2 3 wnnu error correction model the wnnu error correction model is based on a mother wavelet function that constructs a family of wavelets of a finite interval morlet et al 1982 characterized by continuous and discrete wavelet transforms the non stationarity in the forecast error timeseries could be minimized with the wavelet based multi resolution analysis that decomposes the input data into approximate and detail components finally eliminating the noise signal to obtain the temporal and the spectral information contained in the simulation error time series data during the calibration period wavelet decomposition was carried out in this study 3 2 4 wnarx error correction model the wnarxu error model integrates the concepts of wnn and nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs narx models in which the input variables are pre processed by discrete wavelet transformation dwt to be used in the narx model nanda et al 2016 in this study the wnarxu error model uses the endogenous inputs in the form of the most recent historical biases as simulated by the standalone vic model up to the current time level and recurrent exogenous feedback inputs of ε as predicted by the model during the pre forecast lead time levels for any α time step ahead forecast the error can be forecasted by using the wnarxu model with a log sigmoid function in the hidden layer of the neural network as 4 ε t α 1 1 e x p i 1 d ε t 1 i w i j 1 τ ε t α j w j where t α is the prediction error at α time steps ahead d is the effective time lag for the exogenous inputs of ε τ is the effective time lag for the endogenous recurrent inputs in the wnarxu model framework and w is the weight of the neuron 3 3 model conditional processor mcp mcp is the bayesian approach used in this study for estimating the flood predictive uncertainty pu defined as the probability density of a future outcome conditional on all the available information usually provided by model forecasts the main characteristics of mcp are presented in what follows while for additional details the reader is referred to coccia and todini 2011 and barbetta et al 2017 mcp was developed for predictive uncertainty pu estimate to support the flood forecasting activities in real time and it is essentially based on the definition of the multivariate conditional distribution i e the density of the predictand water level discharge etc conditional on multiple deterministic model predictions predictors the multivariate conditional distribution is obtained by dividing the joint predictand prediction distribution by the joint marginal distribution of the predictor s these distributions are estimated by simulating forecasts for an identified calibration data period specifically the calibration consists in identifying the joint and marginal probability distributions required for bayes theorem application the mcp application is based on four steps 1 the observations y and the forecasts y k k 1 m m number of forecasts of m different models are converted into the normal space using the normal quantile transform nqt the variables y and y k whose empirical cumulative distribution functions are computed using the weibull plotting position are converted to their transformed values η and η k respectively which are normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance the probability of each element of η and η k is the same as its original corresponding y and y k 2 in the normal space the joint probability distribution of observed and predicted variables f η η k is assumed to be a normal multivariate distribution 3 the predictive density is obtained by applying the bayes theorem 5 f η η k f η η 1 η m f η 1 η m where f η 1 η m are the marginal probability distributions of the predictors f η η k is normally distributed with mean μ η η k and variance σ 2 η η k defined as 6 μ η η k σ η η σ η η 1 η 1 η m 7 σ 2 η η k 1 σ η η σ η η 1 σ η η t 4 the pu in the normal space is finally reconverted to the real space through the inverse nqt 3 4 set up of configurations for mcp application nanda et al 2019 developed a study on the hirakud dam estimating forecasted inflows with five different deterministic models i e the vic hydrological model and four other models developed considering four different error updating procedures therefore there are five deterministic inflow forecasts available with the lead times ranging from 1 day to 5 days the size of the available dataset about 440 daily data does not allow to properly develop mcp calibration and validation analysis therefore the dataset is resampled by interpolating the data at a semi daily time resolution getting a doubled sample keeping the forecast lead times unchanged the multi model approach of mcp is applied in this work considering different configurations to investigate the effect of involving a different number of deterministic models specifically 1 vic forecast mcp 1mod 2 vic and vic aru forecast mcp 2mod 3 vic vic aru and vic armaxu forecast mcp 3mod 4 vic vic aru vic armaxu vic wnarxu forecast mcp 4mod 5 vic vic aru vic armaxu vic wnarxu and vic wnnu forecast mcp 5mod moreover the mcp is tested considering the two more accurate deterministic models 6 vic wnarxu forecast mcp 1bmod 7 vic wnarxu and vic wnnu forecast mcp 2bmod the obtained results and the performances of the different configurations are compared and discussed in the following section 4 results and discussion the present study is developed by investigating the capability of mcp in calibration and validation modes specifically the 2009 2011 dataset is used for calibration analysis while the 2008 dataset is considered for validation purposes the choice of the calibration period is done for including the highest observed flood occurred in september 2011 see fig 2 a necessary condition to achieve a reliable calibration of mcp parameters the predictive density conditional on prior information typically on models predictions is the proper objective of a forecast however showing that the expected value ev of the conditional predictand improves over the original deterministic models forecast is also of great interest for this reason statistics of both the original deterministic models forecasts and the expected conditional values are discussed moreover the analysis addressed to estimate the probability of exceedance of the three selected discharge thresholds q th1 9169 m3s 1 q th2 15 363 m3s 1 q th3 29 183 m3s 1 shown in fig 2 these discharges represent the peak flows observed during the years 2010 2009 and 2011 respectively and were responsible for severe flooding problem at the downstream reaches of the mahanadi river basin followed by improper reservoir operations due to lack of appropriate inflow forecasting the statistical analysis of the maximum annual peak inflow observed at hirakud dam for the period 1991 2015 was assessed to be the 35 years return period flood for the highest threshold q th3 4 1 calibration analysis fig 3 a c e show the performance of the five deterministic models and of the expected value of the seven mcp configurations in terms of absolute error mean errm and standard deviation errsd and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 for a lead time equal to 1 day 3 days and 5 days respectively for the calibration period 2009 2011 dataset the comparison is carried out between the observed inflow the inflows forecasted by the five deterministic models and the estimated probabilistic forecasts as it can be seen the vic wnarxu is overall the most accurate deterministic model with lower errors and higher ns values for all the lead times as indicated by the left green boxes in fig 3a c e nanda et al 2019 specifically vic wnarxu is characterized by errm errsd equal to 827 941 m3s 1 982 1773 m3s 1 1123 2216 m3s 1 for 1 day 3 days and 5 days lead time respectively ns values are equal to 0 86 0 64 and 0 46 respectively vic wnnu is found to be the second most reliable forecasting model with values of the performance measures slightly lower than the ones of vic wnarxu the results of the mcp application indicate that involving a larger number of deterministic models up to five improves the probabilistic forecast accuracy in terms of expected value ev specifically for lead time equal to 1 day and 3 days mcp 5mod is found to be characterized by the best performance with a mean standard deviation of the absolute error equal to 232 384 m3s 1 and 490 830 m3s 1 for 1 day and 3 days lead times respectively and ns equal to 0 98 and 0 93 for 1 day and 3 days forecasting horizons respectively when the 5 days lead time is considered mcp 5mod is still among the best configurations see fig 3e but in this case the mcp application considering only the two best deterministic models mcp 2bmod is the one with the lowest error errm 510 m3s 1 errsd 895 m3s 1 and the highest ns 0 92 fig 3a c e clearly show that the probabilistic forecast takes advantage of using the best deterministic model in the analysis i e vic wnarxu with an evident reduction of the absolute error and an increase of ns value the benefit in the probabilistic forecast from the use of vic wnarxu forecasts is evident also in the reduction of the 90 uncertainty band width as shown in fig 3b d f the mean and the standard deviation of the band width significantly reduce when the forecasts provided by vic wnarxu are used for mcp application for lead times equal to 1 day the lowest mean equal to 1025 m3s 1 and standard deviation equal to 1472 m3s 1 are obtained for the mcp 5mod configuration when the 5 days forecast is considered the contemporary use of the two most accurate deterministic forecasts i e mcp 2bmod provides the best results with a mean and a standard deviation of the band width equal to 1993 and 2507 m3s 1 respectively it is also worth noting that mcp is able to significantly improve the forecast reliability even when the vic model the worst one is considered as unique available forecast in this case for 1 day lead time vic is characterized by errm 1547 m3s 1 errsd 2550 m3s 1 and ns 0 22 while the performance of ev of mcp 1mod is described by errm 284 m3s 1 errsd 556 m3s 1 and ns 0 97 respectively similarly for 3 days 5 days lead time the performance measures improve from errm 1566 1582 m3s 1 errsd 2663 2767 m3s 1 and ns 0 16 0 11 for deterministic model to errm 685 897 m3s 1 errsd 1346 1708 m3s 1 and ns 0 80 0 67 for the ev of mcp 1mod the highest flood event was observed during september 2011 see fig 2 therefore we focus the analysis on this flood and on the highest threshold to test the benefit provided by the probabilistic forecast fig 4 a shows the results for the 1 day lead time and mcp 5mod configuration while all the deterministic forecasts underestimate the observed flood even the best one the expected value of mcp well predicts it one day ahead the 90 uncertainty band also provides useful information in terms of probability of exceedance of fixed threshold values specifically only when such probability is higher than 0 5 the real time flood risk system should address the decision of issuing or not issuing an alert in this case about the dam management the highest threshold was reached on september 9 mcp 5mod provides the probability of exceedance for one day ahead forecasts and it can be seen that on september 8 it estimates a probability higher than 70 for the next day see fig 4b similar considerations hold for the 3 days lead time results shown in fig 5 in particular when the forecast is provided 3 days ahead mcp estimates a probability of q th3 exceedance equal to 57 and 68 for september 8 and september 9 of 2011 respectively this information could be really useful to properly support decision making concerning the dam management in real time moreover the mcp performance is investigated through the comparison of the estimated percentiles and the corresponding observed occurrences barbetta et al 2017 the outcome is shown in fig 6 for the mcp 5mod configuration and lead time equal to 1 3 and 5 days specifically the comparison is depicted in the graph with the cumulated 0 05 probability quantiles from the processor nobs i n plotted on the y axis and the corresponding percentages of observed data falling below each percentile plotted on the x axis in detail nobs i is the number of observed occurrences below the i th percentile and n is the total sample size the line y x corresponds to the perfect behavior and the deviation from it indicates if the mcp percentiles are underestimated or overestimated results shown in fig 6 clearly indicate that mcp is able to accurately estimate the observed occurrences for all the investigated lead times moreover the percentage of observed discharges included in the 90 uncertainty band is found slightly lower than 90 and equal to 87 86 and 86 for the lead times of 1 day 3 days and 5 days respectively 4 2 validation analysis fig 7 a c e show the performances of the five deterministic models and of the expected values of the seven mcp configurations for a lead time equal to 1 day 3 days and 5 days respectively for the validation period 2008 dataset as it can be seen vic wnarxu and vic wnnu are the two most accurate deterministic models see the left green boxes in fig 7a c the best performance measures are found for 1 day lead time and for vic wnnu errm 377 m3s 1 errsd 526 m3s 1 ns 0 94 vic wnarxu is found to be the best forecasting model for a lead time equal to 5 days see the left green box in fig 7e with a mean and standard deviation of the absolute error equal to 1331 and 2104 m3s 1 respectively and ns 0 53 the results of the mcp application clearly indicate that also for the validation analysis the accuracy of the ev is always better than the one of the all deterministic models whatever configuration is used for the processor application however the outcomes show that involving a larger number of deterministic models up to five improves more the probabilistic forecast accuracy in terms of ev specifically for the forecasting horizons equal to 1 day and 3 days mcp 5mod shows the best performance with errm errsd equal to 178 317 and 504 696 m3s 1 respectively and ns equal to 0 98 and 0 90 for 1 day and 3 days lead times respectively when the 5 days lead time is considered mcp 2bmod is the best configuration see fig 7e with the lowest error errm 635 m3s 1 errsd 776 m3s 1 and the highest ns 0 92 however similar performances are observed for mcp 5mod and mcp 1bmod configurations overall also the results of the validation analysis clearly indicate that the probabilistic forecast takes advantage of using the best deterministic models also in terms of reduction of the 90 uncertainty band width see fig 3b d f also in validation mcp improves the forecast accuracy even when the original vic model based forecast is used as the single available deterministic forecast specifically for 1 day lead time vic has errm 1293 m3s 1 errsd 2186 m3s 1 and ns 0 10 while the corresponding performances of ev of mcp 1mod is characterized by errm 317 m3s 1 errsd 536 m3s 1 and ns 0 95 respectively similar considerations can be developed for the lead times equal to 3 and 5 days the highest flood event occurred during the validation period was observed in september 2008 and it reached the q th2 threshold see fig 2 therefore for this flood we present the comparison between the deterministic forecasts the expected value and 90 uncertainty band provided by mcp and the observed flood along with the estimation of the threshold probability of exceedance fig 8 a shows the results for the 1 day lead time and mcp 5mod configuration wherein most of the deterministic forecasts underestimate the observed flood and only the vic wnarxu model seems to provide an accurate forecast of the peak value the expected value of mcp well predicts the peak flood magnitude even if the peak time is anticipated however the uncertainty band mostly includes the rising limb and the peak region of the flood while the recession limb is well predicted moreover the probabilistic forecast allows to estimate the probability of exceedance of the threshold values in this case the q th2 is reached and mcp 5mod estimates a probability of exceedance for one day ahead that is higher than 80 fig 8b when the 3 days lead time forecasts are considered shown in fig 9 the expected value of mcp significantly improves the accuracy of all the five deterministic models it well predicts the rising limb and underestimates the peak region which is however included in the uncertainty band it is worth noting that only one deterministic forecast vic wnarxu reaches q th2 with a large advance the mcp expected value does not reach the threshold but the probabilistic forecast allows to estimate a probability of exceedance equal to 0 45 45 see fig 9b even if this value lower than 50 should not initiate an assessment phase about issuing or not issuing an alert it provides to the decision makers the fundamental indication that the probability of threshold exceedance is not null with a lead time equal to 3 days this kind of information coming from probabilistic forecast estimate represents the real added value to the management authorities knowledge that is not provided by deterministic forecasts the performance of mcp in validation is also investigated through the comparison of the estimated percentiles and the corresponding observed occurrences results shown in fig 10 indicate that mcp is able to quite accurately estimate the observed occurrences for all the lead times even better for 3 and 5 days actually an overestimation is observed in the range 30 80 of the pu estimated percentile however the percentage of observed discharges included in the uncertainty band is found to be very close to 90 and equal to 89 91 and 92 for the lead times of 1 day 3 days and 5 days respectively 5 conclusions this paper applies the multi model approach of the model conditional processor mcp to discharge forecasts entering into the hirakud reservoir eastern india provided by five different deterministic models to test the benefits introduced by the probabilistic forecast estimate to support decision making in real time mcp uses a generalized form of the bayes theorem to estimate the predictive uncertainty pu and it is here applied by considering a semi daily dataset 2008 2011 monsoon periods a three years period 2009 2011 is used for calibration purpose while 2008 dataset is condidered for validation the results of both calibration and validation analysis show that mcp application involving a larger number of deterministic models up to five improves the probabilistic forecast accuracy in terms of the expected value accuracy and 90 uncertainty band width moreover when only the two best deterministic models are considered as inputs for mcp the results are similar to the ones achieved by using all the available deterministic forecasts mcp is found able to provide effective probabilistic real time inflow forecasting into the reservoir as a fundamental support for the decision making in real time the information that can be inferred from the probabilistic forecasts including the quantification of the probability of exceedance of discharge thresholds represent an important advancement in the

1962,the effect of flood waves entering into artificial reservoirs has to be carefully considered for properly addressing dam management to warrant water resources utilization and to provide flood control within a context of safety for the upstream and downstream territories the optimization of the dam management has to be mainly based on the forecast of the water volume entering the reservoir and of the planning releases from the bottom outlets and the spillways the flood forecasting models are able to provide discharge predictions at sections of particular interest i e upstream of artificial reservoirs with forecast horizons appropriate to support the civil protection activities for the mitigation of flooding effects in 2019 nanda et al developed five deterministic forecasts of inflows to the indian dam of hirakud in the mahanadi river basin by using the semi distributed variable infiltration capacity vic model and four error correction models for updating the streamflow predictions by vic these models only provide deterministic forecasts for the future events and do not deal with the uncertainty on decisions with the aim to shed light on the benefits for appropriately using probabilistic forecasts and uncertainty estimate the deterministic forecasts provided in nanda et al 2019 are here used to feed the model conditional processor mcp that allows to estimate the predictive uncertainty through the analytical treatment of multivariate probability densities enabling a decision based on multiple forecasts of different models at the same time the study is performed considering the monsoon periods of the years 2008 2011 the results achieved for the calibration and validation analysis show that mcp application involving a larger number of deterministic models up to five improves the probabilistic forecast accuracy in terms of the expected value accuracy and 90 uncertainty band width moreover when only the two best deterministic models are considered as inputs for mcp the results are similar to the ones achieved by using all the available deterministic forecasts the results indicate that mcp is able to provide effective probabilistic real time inflow forecasting into the reservoir to be used as an appropriate support for the artificial reservoir management during significant flood events keywords vic model error updating flood forecasting predictive un certainty threshold exceedance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction last decades showed the steady increase of damages due to flooding highlighting the need of developing effective measures to reduce the impact of flood events to this end structural and non structural measures such as real time flood forecasting and warning systems may be used to mitigate the hydraulic risk the presence of dams in the river basins influences the natural variability of streamflow also affecting the timing and magnitude of floods in the downstream areas mishra et al 2018 therefore the presence of reservoirs across the watersheds is an important aspect to be considered in the flood mitigation efforts boulange et al 2021 the main focus of reservoir operation is to find a trade off between water conservation for the dry season and mitigation of flooding effects sudheer et al 2019 awan and bae 2014 to operate multi purpose dams for flood control reliable inflow forecasts into the reservoirs with sufficient lead time are fundamental and the forecast horizon required is assessed by the minimum period of advance warning necessary for the preparatory action of disaster management xu et al 2021 hong et al 2020 faulty dam operations can exacerbate flooding events hence worsening the impact on the upstream and downstream territories nanditha and mishra 2021 patel et al 2017 in the scientific literature flood forecasting has been typically approached through physically based rainfall runoff das et al 2022 sayama et al 2020 jain et al 2018 kauffeldt et al 2016 brocca et al 2011 just to cite a few and or flood routing models e g huang et al 2022 sahoo et al 2014 perumal et al 2011 barbetta et al 2011 price 2009 hsu et al 2006 hsu et al 2003 while the former predicts the discharge at selected river sections with a lead time depending on the time of concentration of the river basin the latter provides forecasts at downstream ends of river reaches with a lead time limited by the wave travel time moreover other approaches for flood forecasting have been proposed such as the neural network based data driven models using discharge or water level as the input e g dtissibe et al 2020 hong et al 2020 kim and han 2020 nanda et al 2016 nguyen et al 2014 the operational real time conceptual or physically based rainfall runoff flood forecasting models need inputs of real time rainfall and meteorological forecasts either from the telemetric raingauge stations or satellite estimates in many world river basins the real time telemetric rainfalls are hardly available which made researchers depend on the satellite based real time rainfall products moreover the meteorological forecasts from the numerical weather prediction nwp linked with different grid based hydrological models are in operation in different world river basins for lead time flood forecasting at the river basin scale a flood forecasting model is generally comprised of two components i the deterministic component governed by the rainfall runoff rr model and ii the stochastic component which is based on the error series of the forecasted flow that involves forecasting of the residual errors of the simulated discharges among the rr models available in the literature the semi distributed variable infiltration capacity vic model is currently very popular e g srivastava et al 2017 recently this model has been used by nanda et al 2019 to develop a reliable inflow forecasting system to appropriately address the real time management of the hirakud reservoir located along the mahanadi river eastern india the study showed that the vic streamflow forecasting using the nwp forecasts resulted in significant underprediction of the inflows forecast at 1 to 5 day lead times therefore nanda et al 2019 evaluated the capability of vic in integration with the linear autoregressive aru bogner and kalas 2008 perumal et al 2011 autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs armaxu broersen 2007 bogner and kalas 2008 nonlinear static wavelet based neural network wnnu morlet at al 1982 and dynamic wavelet based non linear autoregressive with exogenous inputs wnarxu variants of error correction sub models nanda et al 2016 the results indicated that the accuracy of the vic standalone results improved significantly with the increase in the model complexity in the order vic standalone vic armaxu vic aru vicwnnu vic wnarxu despite the introduced improvements and whatever the used model many errors influence the forecast making the assessment of the uncertainty of predictions fundamental to properly support the decision makers activities many studies are available in the literature on generating probabilistic forecasting from deterministic forecasts by modelling the uncertainty in the single valued hydrologic forecast these approaches address forecasting in terms of a single value plus uncertainty alternatively the introduction of the hydrological uncertainty processor krzysztofowicz 1999 created the basis for the estimation of the flood predictive uncertainty pu which represents the probability of occurrence of a future value of a predictant conditional on all the information that can be obtained on the future value usually provided by forecasting models different processors for pu assessment have been introduced starting from krzysztofowicz 1999 who created the basis for pu estimation by introducing the bayesian forecasting system bfs several other approaches to predictive uncertainty assessment were developed todini 2008 proposed the model conditional processor mcp for estimating the pu mcp allows the analytical treatment of the multivariate probability densities after converting both observations and model s predictions into the normal space and providing a probabilistic forecast that also allow to estimate the probability of exceedance of pre fixed threshold values afterward mcp was extended to the multi model approach barbetta et al 2017 allowing a decision based on multiple forecasts provided by different deterministic models at the same time the present study applies the multi model approach of mcp for the hirakud dam inflow forecasting considering the five different forecasts provided by the vic standalone vic armaxu vic aru vicwnnu and vic wnarxu for lead times ranging from 1 day to 5 days thus providing probabilistic forecasts and probabilities of inflow threshold exceedance 2 study area and dataset the basin of the hirakud reservoir is selected as study area fig 1 it is located in eastern india and the drainage area subtended by the dam is about 83 400 km2 the sub catchments of the mahanadi river basin downstream to this artificial reservoir are mostly flood prone this area is characterized by a distinct wet season during june to september during which about 80 rainfall is received due to the south west summer monsoon system in the peninsular indian sub continent five hydrometric sections are located upstream of the dam on different rivers fig 1 the dataset used in this study is described in what follows for more details the reader is referred to nanda et al 2019 the era interim reanalysis meteorological products from the era interim global atmospheric forecasts at ecmwf such as rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed at 0 25 latitude 0 25 longitude spatial and 12 hour temporal resolutions for the study period 2000 2011 were downloaded for the selected study area from the ecmwf webpage the corresponding gridded daily in situ rainfall data available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 were obtained from the india meteorological department imd for evaluating the accuracy of the era interim rainfall product against the benchmark imd rainfall product these datasets were aggregated into daily timescales the observed daily inflow timeseries into the hirakud reservoir was collected for the period 2000 2011 from the hirakud dam project hdp authority burla the weather forecasts including rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed were obtained from the ecmwf 3 methodology the analysis is based on the reservoir inflow forecasting provided by five different deterministic models vic standalone vic aru vic armaxu vicwnnu and vic wnarxu and the application of the multi model approach of the model conditional processor mcp for predictive uncertainty and probabilistic forecasting assessment 3 1 vic hydrological model vic liang et al 1994 liang et al 1996 is a grid based semi distributed hydrological model that consists of two modules the water balance or the water and energy balance module and the routing module lohmann et al 1996 in the vic model the spatial variability of the infiltration capacity in different land uses is computed by the xianjiang model for setting up the vic rainfall runoff model using the water balance mode the input database requires four input files forcing files soil parameter file vegetation parameter file and vegetation library file the forcing file includes rainfall temperature and wind speed data for each individual grid of the catchment the vic model was run at 0 5 0 5 grid size which is consistent with the resolution of the meteorological forecasts obtained from the ecmwf the daily scale hydro meteorological timeseries data of the year 2000 was used for warming up before calibration to create the initial catchment condition seven years 2001 2007 data was used for calibration and four years data 2008 2011 was used for validation the vic model was calibrated using the reanalysis meteorological inputs from the era interim for setting up the model parameters the ecmwf forecasts of rainfall temperatures and wind speed were used in the calibrated vic to simulate the lead time streamflow forecasts the calibrated vic was run at a 30 days monthly window using i the historical era interim rainfalls for the past 25 days to generate the antecedent soil moisture condition and ii the ecmwf meteorological forecasts for the remaining 5 days to simulate streamflow with a lead time of 1 5 days 3 2 error forecasting models for updating the streamflow forecasts simulated by the vic model an error model ε can be developed using the input error timeseries of ε t ε t 1 ε t d obtained during the model calibration ε t is the simulation error between the observed qobs and vic simulated qsim discharges at any time t with d the effectively correlated time lag for real time streamflow forecasting the lead time error forecasts predicted using error forecasting models ε t α can be used to update the discharge forecasts of vic as 1 q t α q sim t α ε t α where α is the time step ahead forecast the main characteristics of these error correction models are described below for more details the reader is referred to nanda et al 2019 3 2 1 aru error correction model the ar model is often applied for updating streamflow forecast at smaller time step due to its simplicity the simple ar model could be represented as 2 ε t α a i i 1 d ε t 1 i e t α where ε q obs t q sim t simulated streamflow biases by vic ε error simulated by the aru model e white noise and d time delay for inputs which decides the order of the ar model 3 2 2 armaxu error correction model the armax model is capable of incorporating exogenous input variables in addition to the autoregressive endogenous inputs expressed as 3 a q ε t α b q i 1 d ε t 1 i j 1 τ ε t α j c q e t α where d time delay for exogenous inputs used in the armax model τ time delay for endogenous inputs and a q b q and c q are the polynomials of the regression equation 3 2 3 wnnu error correction model the wnnu error correction model is based on a mother wavelet function that constructs a family of wavelets of a finite interval morlet et al 1982 characterized by continuous and discrete wavelet transforms the non stationarity in the forecast error timeseries could be minimized with the wavelet based multi resolution analysis that decomposes the input data into approximate and detail components finally eliminating the noise signal to obtain the temporal and the spectral information contained in the simulation error time series data during the calibration period wavelet decomposition was carried out in this study 3 2 4 wnarx error correction model the wnarxu error model integrates the concepts of wnn and nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs narx models in which the input variables are pre processed by discrete wavelet transformation dwt to be used in the narx model nanda et al 2016 in this study the wnarxu error model uses the endogenous inputs in the form of the most recent historical biases as simulated by the standalone vic model up to the current time level and recurrent exogenous feedback inputs of ε as predicted by the model during the pre forecast lead time levels for any α time step ahead forecast the error can be forecasted by using the wnarxu model with a log sigmoid function in the hidden layer of the neural network as 4 ε t α 1 1 e x p i 1 d ε t 1 i w i j 1 τ ε t α j w j where t α is the prediction error at α time steps ahead d is the effective time lag for the exogenous inputs of ε τ is the effective time lag for the endogenous recurrent inputs in the wnarxu model framework and w is the weight of the neuron 3 3 model conditional processor mcp mcp is the bayesian approach used in this study for estimating the flood predictive uncertainty pu defined as the probability density of a future outcome conditional on all the available information usually provided by model forecasts the main characteristics of mcp are presented in what follows while for additional details the reader is referred to coccia and todini 2011 and barbetta et al 2017 mcp was developed for predictive uncertainty pu estimate to support the flood forecasting activities in real time and it is essentially based on the definition of the multivariate conditional distribution i e the density of the predictand water level discharge etc conditional on multiple deterministic model predictions predictors the multivariate conditional distribution is obtained by dividing the joint predictand prediction distribution by the joint marginal distribution of the predictor s these distributions are estimated by simulating forecasts for an identified calibration data period specifically the calibration consists in identifying the joint and marginal probability distributions required for bayes theorem application the mcp application is based on four steps 1 the observations y and the forecasts y k k 1 m m number of forecasts of m different models are converted into the normal space using the normal quantile transform nqt the variables y and y k whose empirical cumulative distribution functions are computed using the weibull plotting position are converted to their transformed values η and η k respectively which are normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance the probability of each element of η and η k is the same as its original corresponding y and y k 2 in the normal space the joint probability distribution of observed and predicted variables f η η k is assumed to be a normal multivariate distribution 3 the predictive density is obtained by applying the bayes theorem 5 f η η k f η η 1 η m f η 1 η m where f η 1 η m are the marginal probability distributions of the predictors f η η k is normally distributed with mean μ η η k and variance σ 2 η η k defined as 6 μ η η k σ η η σ η η 1 η 1 η m 7 σ 2 η η k 1 σ η η σ η η 1 σ η η t 4 the pu in the normal space is finally reconverted to the real space through the inverse nqt 3 4 set up of configurations for mcp application nanda et al 2019 developed a study on the hirakud dam estimating forecasted inflows with five different deterministic models i e the vic hydrological model and four other models developed considering four different error updating procedures therefore there are five deterministic inflow forecasts available with the lead times ranging from 1 day to 5 days the size of the available dataset about 440 daily data does not allow to properly develop mcp calibration and validation analysis therefore the dataset is resampled by interpolating the data at a semi daily time resolution getting a doubled sample keeping the forecast lead times unchanged the multi model approach of mcp is applied in this work considering different configurations to investigate the effect of involving a different number of deterministic models specifically 1 vic forecast mcp 1mod 2 vic and vic aru forecast mcp 2mod 3 vic vic aru and vic armaxu forecast mcp 3mod 4 vic vic aru vic armaxu vic wnarxu forecast mcp 4mod 5 vic vic aru vic armaxu vic wnarxu and vic wnnu forecast mcp 5mod moreover the mcp is tested considering the two more accurate deterministic models 6 vic wnarxu forecast mcp 1bmod 7 vic wnarxu and vic wnnu forecast mcp 2bmod the obtained results and the performances of the different configurations are compared and discussed in the following section 4 results and discussion the present study is developed by investigating the capability of mcp in calibration and validation modes specifically the 2009 2011 dataset is used for calibration analysis while the 2008 dataset is considered for validation purposes the choice of the calibration period is done for including the highest observed flood occurred in september 2011 see fig 2 a necessary condition to achieve a reliable calibration of mcp parameters the predictive density conditional on prior information typically on models predictions is the proper objective of a forecast however showing that the expected value ev of the conditional predictand improves over the original deterministic models forecast is also of great interest for this reason statistics of both the original deterministic models forecasts and the expected conditional values are discussed moreover the analysis addressed to estimate the probability of exceedance of the three selected discharge thresholds q th1 9169 m3s 1 q th2 15 363 m3s 1 q th3 29 183 m3s 1 shown in fig 2 these discharges represent the peak flows observed during the years 2010 2009 and 2011 respectively and were responsible for severe flooding problem at the downstream reaches of the mahanadi river basin followed by improper reservoir operations due to lack of appropriate inflow forecasting the statistical analysis of the maximum annual peak inflow observed at hirakud dam for the period 1991 2015 was assessed to be the 35 years return period flood for the highest threshold q th3 4 1 calibration analysis fig 3 a c e show the performance of the five deterministic models and of the expected value of the seven mcp configurations in terms of absolute error mean errm and standard deviation errsd and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 for a lead time equal to 1 day 3 days and 5 days respectively for the calibration period 2009 2011 dataset the comparison is carried out between the observed inflow the inflows forecasted by the five deterministic models and the estimated probabilistic forecasts as it can be seen the vic wnarxu is overall the most accurate deterministic model with lower errors and higher ns values for all the lead times as indicated by the left green boxes in fig 3a c e nanda et al 2019 specifically vic wnarxu is characterized by errm errsd equal to 827 941 m3s 1 982 1773 m3s 1 1123 2216 m3s 1 for 1 day 3 days and 5 days lead time respectively ns values are equal to 0 86 0 64 and 0 46 respectively vic wnnu is found to be the second most reliable forecasting model with values of the performance measures slightly lower than the ones of vic wnarxu the results of the mcp application indicate that involving a larger number of deterministic models up to five improves the probabilistic forecast accuracy in terms of expected value ev specifically for lead time equal to 1 day and 3 days mcp 5mod is found to be characterized by the best performance with a mean standard deviation of the absolute error equal to 232 384 m3s 1 and 490 830 m3s 1 for 1 day and 3 days lead times respectively and ns equal to 0 98 and 0 93 for 1 day and 3 days forecasting horizons respectively when the 5 days lead time is considered mcp 5mod is still among the best configurations see fig 3e but in this case the mcp application considering only the two best deterministic models mcp 2bmod is the one with the lowest error errm 510 m3s 1 errsd 895 m3s 1 and the highest ns 0 92 fig 3a c e clearly show that the probabilistic forecast takes advantage of using the best deterministic model in the analysis i e vic wnarxu with an evident reduction of the absolute error and an increase of ns value the benefit in the probabilistic forecast from the use of vic wnarxu forecasts is evident also in the reduction of the 90 uncertainty band width as shown in fig 3b d f the mean and the standard deviation of the band width significantly reduce when the forecasts provided by vic wnarxu are used for mcp application for lead times equal to 1 day the lowest mean equal to 1025 m3s 1 and standard deviation equal to 1472 m3s 1 are obtained for the mcp 5mod configuration when the 5 days forecast is considered the contemporary use of the two most accurate deterministic forecasts i e mcp 2bmod provides the best results with a mean and a standard deviation of the band width equal to 1993 and 2507 m3s 1 respectively it is also worth noting that mcp is able to significantly improve the forecast reliability even when the vic model the worst one is considered as unique available forecast in this case for 1 day lead time vic is characterized by errm 1547 m3s 1 errsd 2550 m3s 1 and ns 0 22 while the performance of ev of mcp 1mod is described by errm 284 m3s 1 errsd 556 m3s 1 and ns 0 97 respectively similarly for 3 days 5 days lead time the performance measures improve from errm 1566 1582 m3s 1 errsd 2663 2767 m3s 1 and ns 0 16 0 11 for deterministic model to errm 685 897 m3s 1 errsd 1346 1708 m3s 1 and ns 0 80 0 67 for the ev of mcp 1mod the highest flood event was observed during september 2011 see fig 2 therefore we focus the analysis on this flood and on the highest threshold to test the benefit provided by the probabilistic forecast fig 4 a shows the results for the 1 day lead time and mcp 5mod configuration while all the deterministic forecasts underestimate the observed flood even the best one the expected value of mcp well predicts it one day ahead the 90 uncertainty band also provides useful information in terms of probability of exceedance of fixed threshold values specifically only when such probability is higher than 0 5 the real time flood risk system should address the decision of issuing or not issuing an alert in this case about the dam management the highest threshold was reached on september 9 mcp 5mod provides the probability of exceedance for one day ahead forecasts and it can be seen that on september 8 it estimates a probability higher than 70 for the next day see fig 4b similar considerations hold for the 3 days lead time results shown in fig 5 in particular when the forecast is provided 3 days ahead mcp estimates a probability of q th3 exceedance equal to 57 and 68 for september 8 and september 9 of 2011 respectively this information could be really useful to properly support decision making concerning the dam management in real time moreover the mcp performance is investigated through the comparison of the estimated percentiles and the corresponding observed occurrences barbetta et al 2017 the outcome is shown in fig 6 for the mcp 5mod configuration and lead time equal to 1 3 and 5 days specifically the comparison is depicted in the graph with the cumulated 0 05 probability quantiles from the processor nobs i n plotted on the y axis and the corresponding percentages of observed data falling below each percentile plotted on the x axis in detail nobs i is the number of observed occurrences below the i th percentile and n is the total sample size the line y x corresponds to the perfect behavior and the deviation from it indicates if the mcp percentiles are underestimated or overestimated results shown in fig 6 clearly indicate that mcp is able to accurately estimate the observed occurrences for all the investigated lead times moreover the percentage of observed discharges included in the 90 uncertainty band is found slightly lower than 90 and equal to 87 86 and 86 for the lead times of 1 day 3 days and 5 days respectively 4 2 validation analysis fig 7 a c e show the performances of the five deterministic models and of the expected values of the seven mcp configurations for a lead time equal to 1 day 3 days and 5 days respectively for the validation period 2008 dataset as it can be seen vic wnarxu and vic wnnu are the two most accurate deterministic models see the left green boxes in fig 7a c the best performance measures are found for 1 day lead time and for vic wnnu errm 377 m3s 1 errsd 526 m3s 1 ns 0 94 vic wnarxu is found to be the best forecasting model for a lead time equal to 5 days see the left green box in fig 7e with a mean and standard deviation of the absolute error equal to 1331 and 2104 m3s 1 respectively and ns 0 53 the results of the mcp application clearly indicate that also for the validation analysis the accuracy of the ev is always better than the one of the all deterministic models whatever configuration is used for the processor application however the outcomes show that involving a larger number of deterministic models up to five improves more the probabilistic forecast accuracy in terms of ev specifically for the forecasting horizons equal to 1 day and 3 days mcp 5mod shows the best performance with errm errsd equal to 178 317 and 504 696 m3s 1 respectively and ns equal to 0 98 and 0 90 for 1 day and 3 days lead times respectively when the 5 days lead time is considered mcp 2bmod is the best configuration see fig 7e with the lowest error errm 635 m3s 1 errsd 776 m3s 1 and the highest ns 0 92 however similar performances are observed for mcp 5mod and mcp 1bmod configurations overall also the results of the validation analysis clearly indicate that the probabilistic forecast takes advantage of using the best deterministic models also in terms of reduction of the 90 uncertainty band width see fig 3b d f also in validation mcp improves the forecast accuracy even when the original vic model based forecast is used as the single available deterministic forecast specifically for 1 day lead time vic has errm 1293 m3s 1 errsd 2186 m3s 1 and ns 0 10 while the corresponding performances of ev of mcp 1mod is characterized by errm 317 m3s 1 errsd 536 m3s 1 and ns 0 95 respectively similar considerations can be developed for the lead times equal to 3 and 5 days the highest flood event occurred during the validation period was observed in september 2008 and it reached the q th2 threshold see fig 2 therefore for this flood we present the comparison between the deterministic forecasts the expected value and 90 uncertainty band provided by mcp and the observed flood along with the estimation of the threshold probability of exceedance fig 8 a shows the results for the 1 day lead time and mcp 5mod configuration wherein most of the deterministic forecasts underestimate the observed flood and only the vic wnarxu model seems to provide an accurate forecast of the peak value the expected value of mcp well predicts the peak flood magnitude even if the peak time is anticipated however the uncertainty band mostly includes the rising limb and the peak region of the flood while the recession limb is well predicted moreover the probabilistic forecast allows to estimate the probability of exceedance of the threshold values in this case the q th2 is reached and mcp 5mod estimates a probability of exceedance for one day ahead that is higher than 80 fig 8b when the 3 days lead time forecasts are considered shown in fig 9 the expected value of mcp significantly improves the accuracy of all the five deterministic models it well predicts the rising limb and underestimates the peak region which is however included in the uncertainty band it is worth noting that only one deterministic forecast vic wnarxu reaches q th2 with a large advance the mcp expected value does not reach the threshold but the probabilistic forecast allows to estimate a probability of exceedance equal to 0 45 45 see fig 9b even if this value lower than 50 should not initiate an assessment phase about issuing or not issuing an alert it provides to the decision makers the fundamental indication that the probability of threshold exceedance is not null with a lead time equal to 3 days this kind of information coming from probabilistic forecast estimate represents the real added value to the management authorities knowledge that is not provided by deterministic forecasts the performance of mcp in validation is also investigated through the comparison of the estimated percentiles and the corresponding observed occurrences results shown in fig 10 indicate that mcp is able to quite accurately estimate the observed occurrences for all the lead times even better for 3 and 5 days actually an overestimation is observed in the range 30 80 of the pu estimated percentile however the percentage of observed discharges included in the uncertainty band is found to be very close to 90 and equal to 89 91 and 92 for the lead times of 1 day 3 days and 5 days respectively 5 conclusions this paper applies the multi model approach of the model conditional processor mcp to discharge forecasts entering into the hirakud reservoir eastern india provided by five different deterministic models to test the benefits introduced by the probabilistic forecast estimate to support decision making in real time mcp uses a generalized form of the bayes theorem to estimate the predictive uncertainty pu and it is here applied by considering a semi daily dataset 2008 2011 monsoon periods a three years period 2009 2011 is used for calibration purpose while 2008 dataset is condidered for validation the results of both calibration and validation analysis show that mcp application involving a larger number of deterministic models up to five improves the probabilistic forecast accuracy in terms of the expected value accuracy and 90 uncertainty band width moreover when only the two best deterministic models are considered as inputs for mcp the results are similar to the ones achieved by using all the available deterministic forecasts mcp is found able to provide effective probabilistic real time inflow forecasting into the reservoir as a fundamental support for the decision making in real time the information that can be inferred from the probabilistic forecasts including the quantification of the probability of exceedance of discharge thresholds represent an important advancement in the

1963,in a river confluence the fluvial process is complex because of the merging of different flows from rivers with distinct morphologies however the mixing of suspended sediment in river confluences has been inadequately investigated owing to the low resolution of conventional techniques for measuring suspended sediment in this study we investigated the mixing of suspended sediment at the confluence of the hwang and nakdong rivers in south korea by analyzing the spectral characteristics of suspended sediment from high resolution hyperspectral data we retrieved the suspended sediment concentration ssc from high resolution hyperspectral imagery using the conversion technique which is a cluster based machine learning regression with optical variability hyperspectral clustering was first applied to classify the water regions of the main river nakdong and its tributary hwang the clustering result at a near field after the confluence point was strongly related to the mixing degree of flow and sediments from two different rivers through segmentation regressors with hyperspectral clusters enabled accurate ssc measurement in particular they precisely retrieved the concentrations adjacent to the mixing layer even when the relationship between the spectral data and suspended sediment concentrations of the main river and tributary was substantially different using a detailed ssc map we compared two cases of mixing patterns by calculating the variation in sediment concentration along the downstream river confluence we found that the mixing pattern was different because of the flow velocity and a large sandbar near the stagnant area even though river discharge was similar for both cases in the slow mixing case the sandbar caused a velocity deficit with a wake that reduced the variance of ssc due to the irregular flow near the mixing layer in this case dual counter rotating secondary flow cells also limited mixing across the post confluence reach however when the wake and dual counter rotating secondary flows weakened due to the erosion of the sandbar and lower flow velocity the transverse mixing coefficient increased by approximately 40 compared to the slow mixing case this study demonstrated that the hyperspectral approach can be used to investigate the mixing of suspended sediment in greater detail in complex river systems as it provides high resolution information that conventional measurement methods cannot explore keywords remote sensing hyperspectral imagery river confluence suspended sediment transverse mixing ssc mapping data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the river confluence is a dynamic area in which complex flow patterns develop as the flows of two different streams merge in this area the spatial distribution of suspended sediments is also complex because the flow from the tributary with different suspended sediment concentration is converged into gualtieri et al 2018 ostad ali askari 2022a riley et al 2015 szupiany et al 2009 zhang et al 2020a zinger et al 2013 the turbulent mixing of suspended sediment and other suspended matter occurs actively with various patterns downstream of the river confluence because tributary flows commonly have different discharge momentum velocity and bottom elevation from those of the main river constantinescu et al 2012 konsoer and rhoads 2014 ostad ali askari 2022b rhoads and johnson 2018 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 sukhodolov et al 2017 yuan et al 2021 2019 zinger et al 2013 although the mixing of suspended sediment has a substantial influence on the morphodynamics and water quality downstream of the confluence most studies have focused on the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic features of river confluences based on measurements of the flow field and bed elevation fattahi nafchi et al 2021 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 riley et al 2015 sabrina et al 2021 sukhodolov et al 2017 zinger et al 2013 at the river confluence the mixing process can be divided into three stages near field intermediate field and far field mixing fig 1 among the three regions the mixing processes in the near field called the confluence hydrodynamic zone chz are the most complex and dynamic the shear interface and helical motions in the chz significantly affect the mixing mechanisms of the suspended sediment downstream of the chz konsoer and rhoads 2014 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 despite the importance of the mixing mechanisms of suspended sediment downstream of the chz there have been few studies on detailed analysis of sediment mixing analyzing the mixing pattern of suspended sediment in the river confluence was mainly limited by the difficulty of acquiring high resolution data on suspended sediment concentration ssc the spatial distribution of ssc in rivers has not been thoroughly measured owing to the limitations of conventional measurement methods among the conventional measuring techniques the manual collection of samples using a water sampler has been widely used to measure suspended sediments edwards and glysson 1999 latosinski et al 2014 yang and julien 2019 to apply this method to large rivers spatial distribution measurement has relied on the possibility of deploying reel mounted water samplers on bridges cableways and boats because of their non wadeable condition umar et al 2018 although this sampling method is the most accurate it is very labor intensive and time consuming and it requires measuring the dry weight of the sediment in the laboratory recently as an alternative method adcp based cross sectional measurements have been adapted to collect datasets of spatial distribution despite the relatively high uncertainty simmons et al 2020 szupiany et al 2019 this adcp based method is superior to the sampling method for obtaining spatial distribution because it is possible to obtain high resolution data by making the boat path dense and converting the data into a continuous spatial distribution using an interpolation technique kwak et al 2020 lane et al 2008 son et al 2021 although this method can efficiently measure ssc data with water depth and velocity profiles it has a relatively low resolution for quantifying the mixing patterns and rates of suspended sediment in addition the movement of a boat usually disturbs the suspended sediment distribution and the interpolated data are not sufficiently reliable this disadvantage is critical for investigating the characteristics of the irregular mixing layer in the near field of river confluences fig 1 although the aforementioned methods enable the collection of accurate ssc data within individual points and cross sections at a specific time the sediment data obtained using these methods are insufficient for analyzing the complex mixing processes of suspended sediment in a complex river system which requires high resolution data compared to these methods the remote sensing based ssc measurement technique can be an ideal platform for obtaining high resolution data to analyze mixing dynamics on a large spatiotemporal scale even though it focuses on measuring the near surface concentration kwon et al 2022a lewis et al 2020 umar et al 2018 in the remote sensing approach scattering by suspended sediment is detected as radiance and converted into concentration using various conversion methods binding et al 2005 chen et al 1991 dethier et al 2020 however the scattered radiance is significantly affected by the variability of sediment and water quality albert and mobley 2003 lee et al 2002 1999 mobley 1999 moreover in shallow waters of wide rivers applying a remote sensing approach is challenging because the river bottom signal critically disturbs the intrinsic signal of the suspended sediment legleiter and harrison 2019 zhou et al 2017 in this respect river confluences are the most optically complex areas in riverine systems because they usually have two different spectral characteristics from confluent flows the complex topography owing to the dynamic flow structure caused by the convergence of the two flows results in a heterogeneous distribution of water depths in the confluence area biron et al 2019 constantinescu et al 2012 guillén ludeña et al 2017 to study the mixing of suspended sediment in the river confluence by remote sensing umar et al 2018 first measured the spatial distributions of ssc using satellite remote sensing in the mississippi and missouri rivers in the usa however in this study the spatial resolution of multispectral satellite imagery is not sufficient to capture detailed mixing patterns of suspended sediments especially in the near field in addition this study did not consider the spectral variability of river confluences likewise although other researchers jiang et al 2021 koestner et al 2020 peterson et al 2018 shen et al 2010 spyrakos et al 2018 zhang et al 2020c zhang et al 2020b have also successfully applied satellite based remote sensing techniques for measuring ssc in water environments the retrieval of suspended sediment at river confluences has not been widely studied because of its high spectral variability and the lack of a high resolution ssc dataset the objectives of this study were to understand the spectral characteristics of suspended sediment at a river confluence the hwang nakdong river confluence in south korea with its physical properties and to evaluate the feasibility of a hyperspectral approach for investigating the mixing patterns of suspended sediment in the river confluence in this study we retrieved the suspended sediment pattern from high resolution hyperspectral imagery using the machine learning based conversion technique which incorporated the spectral variability of the river confluences in addition we analyzed the detailed mixing patterns for different mixing cases using high resolution ssc maps obtained from hyperspectral retrieval 2 field surveys in a river confluence 2 1 study site two field surveys were conducted to obtain combined datasets of hyperspectral images along with flow velocity fields bathymetry suspended sediment and water quality to apply the hyperspectral approach to river confluence under different conditions the study site was the confluence of the nakdong and hwang rivers in south korea as shown in fig 2 the streambed substrates of both rivers were predominantly fine sand d50 91 μm so morphological changes as well as sediment transport occurred very dynamically in various ways molit 2016 the total watershed area of the nakdong river is 23 817 km2 with a main channel length of 522 km the hwang river converges on the right bank of the nakdong river with a channel length of 107 6 km and a total watershed area of 1 329 km2 the confluence of the two rivers is located in the lower reaches of the nakong river approximately 7 5 km downstream of the hapcheon changnyung dam as shown in fig 2 in this study field surveys were conducted at the near field of river confluence where dynamic mixing usually occurs owing to the varying confluent flows from both rivers two field surveys were performed under similar discharge conditions during the spring dry season when the water temperatures of both rivers were relatively low 13 16 7 c table 1 despite the similar discharge conditions in both surveys distinct patterns of mixing layers for the two cases were generated as shown in the photographs of each survey as shown in fig 3 survey 1 showed an irregular mixing layer with large billows whereas the mixing layer appeared relatively smooth and the color contrast of both rivers faded rapidly after confluence in survey 2 moreover the colors of the water bodies from the tributaries in both surveys were substantially different the two surveys were conducted approximately 13 months apart and during that time the bathymetry of the hwang nakdong confluence was extensively altered as shown in the interpolated bathymetry from the adcp using standard kriging in fig 3 a shallow submerged sandbar h 1 m developed near the stagnation zone in survey 1 but the sandbar was considerably eroded in survey 2 therefore we precisely measured suspended sediment water quality and velocity using both hyperspectral and in situ techniques and then analyzed the effect of morphological differences on mixing patterns at the river confluence 2 2 in situ field measurements suspended sediment velocity water quality the profiles of the volumetric suspended sediment concentration sscv and particle size distribution psd near the water surface were measured using a submersible laser diffraction based particle size analyzer lisst 200x sequoia scientific inc usa the measurement ranges of the sscv and psd were as follows the range of the psd was from 1 to 500 μm in logarithmic increments with 36 bins the range of the ssc was 0 5 700 ppm this sensor demonstrated a high sampling rate up to 1 hz and showed a high accuracy r2 of 90 or more when compared to the known concentration of suspended sediment samples in the laboratory kwon et al 2022b using this sensor the surface sscv was measured by the moving boat method kwak et al 2020 son et al 2021 specifically a reel with a lisst 200x was attached to the side of a boat thus the sscv could be efficiently measured along the path of a moving boat in addition vertical profiles were measured by descending the lisst 200x into the water column by controlling the reel as shown in table 1 the surface sscv was measured at 2 369 points located upstream and downstream of the confluence and tributary in the study area the surface sscv was densely measured at approximately 3 meter intervals for each cross section within the near field of the confluence indicating a complex mixing layer this allowed for the collection of an adequate dataset that reflects the varying ssc between the main river and the tributary the vertical sscv and psd profiles were measured at four to five points in the downstream section at approximately 350 m confluence for both surveys hydraulic data water depth and velocity profile of the measurement points were obtained using the adcp river surveyor m9 sontek usa and geometric coordinates were measured by differential global positioning system dgps with an accuracy of less than 1 m at a sampling rate of approximately 1 hz installed on the boat a compass was calibrated before deploying the adcp on the boat then the bathymetry and velocity profiles from the near bed point to the near surface point were simultaneously collected along the two repeat paths of the crossing boat using water mode 1 at each measurement section during the transaction the dgps tracked the position of the moving boat and then the boat speed was determined using a dgps receiver according to the m9 manual sontek 2014 as the river bottom material was fine at the study site as described in section 2 1 we did not use the bottom tracking function of the adcp which requires a non moving bottom condition sontek 2014 szupiany et al 2009 xu et al 2022 the average boat speed was maintained steadily at 0 4 0 5 m s order of water speed along the straight path perpendicular to the flow direction to ensure measurement accuracy by minimizing the lateral variation of the transect line the vertical cell size ranged from 0 2 to 0 5 m from the sontek m9 firmware smart pulse based on these measurement processes in surveys 1 the cross sectional data were obtained from nine cross sections to focus on the velocity field within the complex mixing layer shown in the aerial imagery in contrast five cross sections were measured in survey 2 due to the relatively simple mixing layer for post processing the vmt software was used to analyze and visualize bathymetry and cross sectional velocity profiles parsons et al 2013 we averaged the repeatedly measured data at each measurement section for the final cross sectional profile the secondary flow vectors were calculated using rozovskii decomposition which rotates individual verticals rather than the entire section rozovskii 1957 from this decomposition the primary velocity direction for each point was precisely obtained as a depth integrated flow vector accordingly secondary flows were efficiently calculated using the differences in depth averaged vectors szupiany et al 2009 the cross sectional component of the secondary flow was also calculated in detail using the divergence of the primary velocity vectors without distortion in this study a ysi 6600 v2 sonde ysi incorporated usa was utilized to measure water temperature and water quality data such as conductivity chl a turbidity ph and dissolved oxygen do according to the sensor specifications the measurement accuracy of the ysi 6600 v2 sonde is as follows accuracy of water temperature and ph are 0 15 c and 0 2 respectively errors of conductivity turbidity do are 0 5 2 and 1 of reading respectively all data from lisst adcp and ysi were collected at a frequency of 1 hz and the collected data were synchronized with the measurement time 2 3 hyperspectral imagery collection and pre processing in this study hsis were acquired using a uav mounted hyperspectral camera platform kwon et al 2022b 2022a this platform consists of a hyperspectral camera microhsi 410 shark corning inc usa m600 pro uav dji china ronin 3 axis handheld gimbal dji china and gps sensor the hyperspectral camera has a push broom type sensor covering a wavelength range of 400 1000 nm with 150 spectral bands because this camera is a push broom type sensor it can scan 682 pixels for one line at once thus it can capture the entire image with continuously measured lines by the moving uav a more detailed specification of the uav mounted hyperspectral camera platform used in this study was elaborated by kwon et al 2022a during both surveys the uav mounted hyperspectral camera platform was manipulated to scan the river area in the transverse direction to cover the entire target area fig 4 a for this reason several flight strips were designed and the separately acquired strips of hyperspectral images were co registered to obtain hyperspectral images covering the entire area fig 4b in this procedure the georeferenced points and rgb images were used to accurately align the hsis strips such that the corresponding pixels of the overlapped locations were geometrically integrated the final co registered images were used as orthophotos for the final hsi on the other hand radiometric correction was required to convert a digital number dn which stored the radiance as an integer on the hyperspectral camera to relative reflectance because the radiance recorded by the hyperspectral camera did not coincide with the actual energy emitted or reflected by the surface owing to the azimuth angle and elevation of the sun a radiometric correction was required to normalize the images for this correction dn should first be converted into radiance l using the gain and offset of each pixel these gain and offset values are typically retrieved from the hyperspectral sensor metadata after this conversion the radiance was converted to relative reflectance using the empirical line method elm based on reference reflectance values smith and milton 1999 1 r λ g a i n l λ o f f s e t where r λ is relative reflectance gain is a slope of the empirical line λ is a wavelength and offset is an intercept of the empirical line the reference reflectance values for calibration were obtained using calibration tarps that offered lambertian reflectance lambertian reflectance denotes the isotropic reflected light intensity which is a reference for radiometric correction regardless of the camera angle baek et al 2019 in this study calibration tarps offering lambertian reflectance values of 0 84 0 56 0 24 and 0 03 were used to convert the l to normalized reflectance with this correction the normalized hsi provides enhanced interpretability and quality of hyperspectral data jeon et al 2019 kwon et al 2020 3 methodology 3 1 hyperspectral retrieval of suspended sediment the principle of detecting the scattering feature of suspended sediment as radiance and converting it into concentration is physically clear but the radiance detected by the hyperspectral camera usually consists of complex signals in addition the scattered radiance is significantly affected by the variability of the sediment and stream properties thus it is essential to understand the spectral variability by clarifying this principle in general the total radiance lu in the water environment consists of four significant subradiance components as shown in eq 2 baek et al 2019 niroumand jadidi et al 2018 legleiter et al 2004 2 l u λ l b λ l c λ l s λ l p λ where lb is the upwelling radiance from the bed lc is the backscattered radiance from the water column ls is the upwelling radiance from the interface between the atmosphere and water body lp is the upwelling path radiance from the atmosphere the magnitude of lp is insignificant in the hsi captured by uavs which obtain images at low altitudes ls is locally generated by water surface reflection due to turbulence or suspended matter near the surface this can be minimized using glint removal algorithms overstreet and legleiter 2017 however lc is more complex than other variables because it is related to the inherent optical properties iops of the constituents contained in the water column fan et al 2015 olmanson et al 2013 pinet et al 2017 wong et al 2019 the constituents of the water column usually consist of suspended sediment suspended matter and colored dissolved organic matter cdom and their properties determine these iops backscattering and absorbance coefficients mobley 1999 furthermore lb also increases the spectral variability because this term varies according to the water depth and channel bottom type this signal usually coexists with lc therefore it can be a critical factor in disturbing ssc estimation from lc especially in shallow waters in this respect river confluences usually have substantial spectral variability because two different water bodies merge and the water depth and bottom properties vary irregularly in the confluence area in this study to consider spectral variability in river confluences we employed a robust hyperspectral imagery based ssc measurement method this method is a cluster based machine learning regression with optical variability named cmr ov developed by kwon et al 2022a cmr ov deals with the spectral variability problem by combining hyperspectral clustering and the random forest model as a machine learning regression method as shown in fig 5 a hyperspectral clustering separates a complex dataset into several homogeneous datasets according to the spectral characteristics of the water body then machine learning regressors corresponding to each clustered dataset were built to construct the relationship between the hyperspectral spectrum and ssc such as regressors 1 2 and 3 as shown in fig 5 b in this study hyperspectral clustering was applied to classify hyperspectral data with similar statistical characteristics to 150 spectral band values in the 400 1000 nm wavelength range first this method was applied to river hyperspectral images to achieve spatial division between regions with similar spectral characteristics according to the waterbody characteristics at the river confluence the characteristics of suspended sand and other suspended matter in the two rivers are usually different and the contribution of bottom reflectance could vary according to water depth therefore hyperspectral clustering enables the division of the whole region into the main river and tributary regions because the spectral characteristics are also different when the waterbody characteristics are different this spatial division contributes to understanding the complex mechanism of the river confluence especially in near field of the confluence where complex mixing and morphological change occur in this study the gaussian mixture model gmm was used as the hyperspectral clustering method this clustering method classifies a dataset according to the statistical characteristics of the gaussian distribution the gmm can represent the entire dataset as several probability density functions pdfs of a gaussian distribution löffler et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 therefore the entire dataset can be separated from each pdf to ensure the statistical homogeneity when applied to hyperspectral imagery captured in a water environment it classifies an optically complex dataset into homogeneous clusters kwon et al 2022a specifically the gaussian mixture pdfs p of the reflectance spectrum in each pixel xi can be expressed as eq 3 3 p x i k 1 k π k n k x μ k σ k where k is the number of clusters π k is the mixture coefficient with a total sum of 1 1 k π k 1 nk is a single gaussian distribution of kth cluster with a mean μ k and covariance matrix σ k all parameters in p can be estimated using the expectation maximization em algorithm which obtains the optimal value of each parameter by maximizing the likelihood zhou et al 2018 the finally fitted p from the gmm can be decomposed into several n as the pdf of pixel based spectral clusters in this study the gmm process was further elaborated by kwon et al 2022a in this study we developed multiple regression models for each cluster from gmm to consider spectral variability in rivers fig 5b as a hyperspectral regression method the rf regression model was adapted to estimate ssc from the hyperspectral spectrum in each pixel this method is an ensemble decision tree model that minimizes the bias of the predicted results breiman 2001 in rf a large number of decision tree models weree combined by averaging in a process called ensemble learning each decision tree in the rf was developed from a random selection of samples and variables based on the bagging method proposed by breiman 1996 the sample was generated using bootstrap sampling with random replacement during the bagging process owing to this randomization the bagging process can reduce the variance and correlation between the established decision trees in the bagging process the decision trees in the rf were trained separately using the sampled dataset specifically each node in decision tree was split by maximizing the reduction in overall impurity in nodes this study used the mean square error mse as a criterion for impurity as follows in eq 4 4 mse 1 n i y i y i 2 where n is the number of training dataset yi is the ssc measured by lisst and y is the ssc estimated by the rf for each clustered rf model the number of decision trees and the number of features randomly sampled at each split were tuned using gridsearchcv in python based on the parameter range specified in earlier studies kwon et al 2021 probst et al 2019 after training rf the final prediction result was calculated by aggregating the predicted ssc in each decision tree model at this stage the final ssc values and uncertainty are presented based on the average and standard deviation of the predicted ssc values the main advantage of rf is that it requires only a short time to build a model and is insensitive to hyperparameters 3 2 mixing evaluation in the river confluence when the flows from the main river and the tributary with ssc contrast merge after the river confluence the constant sediment fluxes continuously flow to the confluence from the two incoming rivers if the discharge and concentration from the two flows can be assumed to be steady longitudinal mixing can be neglected in river confluences jung et al 2019 lewis et al 2020 pouchoulin et al 2020 compared with longitudinal mixing transverse mixing usually occurs more dynamically because of the various secondary currents related to helical motion developed downstream of the river confluence the shear layer also develops in various ways i e wake mode and kelvin helmholtz mode depending on the momentum and velocity ratios between the two flows and the internal velocity deficit induced by the stagnation zone because the lateral momentum flux of the mean flow is pronounced with the lateral momentum flux of turbulence e the strong eddy caused by the lateral momentum flux was much larger than the turbulent eddy in the transverse direction which was proven by the numerical model and experimental results cheng and constantinescu 2020 constantinescu et al 2012 lewis et al 2020 lewis and rhoads 2015 rhoads and sukhodolov 2008 this means that the dispersion from the secondary current is pronounced and enhances transverse mixing within river confluences particularly in the near field as illustrated in fig 1 moreover in large and shallow confluences w h 100 the horizontal eddy is less affected by the boundary but vertical eddy is difficult to grow because the length scale is limited by the water depth constantinescu et al 2014 gualtieri et al 2019 uijttewaal and booij 2000 in this study the transverse mixing in a river confluence was analyzed based on a depth averaged 2d mixing equation under steady state concentration negligible longitudinal mixing and neutrally buoyant and conservative sediment conditions eq 5 jung et al 2019 seo et al 2006a 5 u c x v c y 1 h y h d t c y s where u and v are depth averaged longitudinal and transverse velocities c is the depth averaged concentration x is the longitudinal direction h is the water depth y is the transverse distance dt is the transverse mixing coefficient and s is a sink source term the conventional point measurement of ssc has a limitation in analyzing mixing patterns in river confluences due to resolution problems however the detailed patterns of transverse mixing at the river confluence can be evaluated using a high resolution ssc map from hyperspectral retrievals in this study we analyzed the mixing pattern by calculating the continuous longitudinal profile of the variance of the transverse ssc distribution σ y 2 from the ssc map as defined by 6 σ y 2 0 w c y 2 d y 0 w cdy transverse mixing is typically characterized as dt in eq 3 which accounts for transverse mixing from shear dispersion turbulent diffusion and channel irregularities rutherford 1994 in many earlier studies covering the mixing in rivers the mixing coefficient was nondimensionalized as d t h u by averaged water depth h and shear velocity u where u gr s 0 and s0 is the reach slope 0 001808 in nakdong river fischer 1968 rutherford 1994 this nondimensional mixing coefficient was usually suggested to compare the mixing in various sites such as straight stream meandering stream and confluences baek and seo 2010 jung et al 2019 lane et al 2008 rutherford 1994 seo et al 2006a 2006b shin et al 2020 in this study the transverse mixing coefficient was estimated by the moment method eq 7 from the σ y 2 along longitudinal distance sayre and chang 1968 7 d t u 2 d σ y 2 dx dt was estimated from the slope of the fitted linear regression between σ y 2 and x therefore the σ y 2 x profile obtained from the ssc map can increase the reliability of dt estimation owing to its high resolution 4 model validation in this study the evaluation of the cmr ov was performed in two respects 1 cross applicability and 2 uncalibrated dataset applicability four types of datasets were used for the evaluations as listed in table 2 the cross applicability of the remote sensing based regressor needs to be proven to overcome the limitation attributed to the locality of the estimator baek et al 2019 dethier et al 2020 kwon et al 2022b the locality of the estimator usually reduces the field applicability of the remote sensing based estimator because a general regressor cannot accurately learn various datasets and it must re learn when it is applied in the uncalibrated area learning the dataset collected in river confluences was similar to learning two different river datasets therefore it was necessary to use a robust model for spectral variability although cmr ov was proven to be a robust model under optically complex conditions kwon et al 2022a additional verification using various field datasets was necessary for river confluences because it was only validated using data from field scale channels hence in this study local learning which independently trained the cmr ov using survey data of river confluences and merged learning using a combined dataset of field scale experiments and field surveys was conducted to evaluate the field applicability in river confluences moreover a 5 folds cross validation was conducted using a combined dataset to evaluate cross applicability as these datasets were independently collected in different areas under different conditions as shown in table 2 these tests could be used to evaluate whether cmr ov can be extended to various river conditions datasets of vertical ssc profiles collected in surveys 1 and 2 were used to verify the applicability of cmr ov using depth averaged and uncalibrated datasets in local and merged learning tests we trained each model by randomly sampling 80 of the dataset and evaluated it using the residual data in each training the results of local learning using a dataset from survey 1 are presented in fig 6 a and b in this figure the data density is represented from red high density to blue low density this result shows that the cmr ov can accurately learn the spectral characteristics of the river confluence with a bimodal distribution as a result of the merged learning the training and test accuracy improved substantially compared with local learning fig 6c and d therefore from this result one can say that the more the model learns from various datasets the better is the performance and this model is robust to spectral variability cross validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate the cross applicability probst et al 2019 to evaluate cross applicability of cmr ov 5 folds cross validation was implemented to split the test and training datasets in the ratios of 80 and 20 respectively the evaluation using the dataset under various conditions indicated how the estimator should perform in general when applied to predict under independent conditions with the training of the estimator the dataset in this validation was randomly shuffled and split into five unique groups each group was used as a test dataset and the remaining groups were used as the training dataset fig 7 shows the randomly shuffled test and training dataset of 5 folds which indicates the training and test datasets in white and black respectively using these datasets the training and test scores of r2 and their standard deviations were estimated according to the number of clusters as shown in fig 7 a both the training and test performances were best with two clusters with 1 of the standard deviation of cross applicability the evaluation using the rmse showed a similar result the test score was best with 2 4 clusters and the average rmse was 12 ppm with a standard deviation of 2 ppm fig 7b in addition the learning rate of cmr ov was more rapid with increased clusters fig 7c therefore the amount of training data for each model was more influential in the learning rate than in the number of clusters consequently the cmr ov showed competent performance in the cross applicability test 5 field application 5 1 analysis of in situ data 5 1 1 flow dynamics table 3 shows the characteristic parameters of the flow suspended sediment and water quality averaged from cross sectionally measured values in two to three upstream sections of the confluence in the two surveys in survey 1 the difference in flow variables between the hwang river and nakdong river was larger than in survey 2 as indicated by the velocity ratio ur momentum ratio mr and discharge ratio qr in addition to such hydraulic differences at the upstream sections of confluence the morphological difference between the two surveys fig 3 resulted in substantial discrepancies in the flow patterns and dynamics of the suspended sediment in survey 1 the large sandbar in the stagnation zone separats the flow from the induced wake flow therefore the mixing layer was irregular similar to the wake behind an obstacle as shown in the photograph of survey 1 fig 2a in contrast the mixing layer was more regular in survey 2 because the sandbar in the stagnation zone of the nakdong river was eroded and submerged under a high water depth the density difference between the two rivers at the confluence can be a critical factor for hydrodynamic conditions and mixing states because it can distort the interface between water from the main river and the tributary gualtieri et al 2019 horna munoz et al 2020 van rooijen et al 2020 therefore in this study the relative density difference δρ was calculated from the measured water temperature and ssc using eq 8 ford and johnson 1983 to consider the effect of suspended sediments on water density 8 δ ρ ssc s s c 1 1 sg 10 3 where s g is the specific gravity of the suspended sediment assumed to be the typical value of sediment equal to 2 65 the densimetric froude number frd was also calculated using δρ to investigate the contribution of the inertial and buoyancy forces as follows 9 f r d u δ ρ g h 1 2 where g denotes the gravitational acceleration δρ varies seasonally ranging from o 10 5 in winter to o 10 3 in summer gualtieri et al 2019 2018 the densimetric froude number indicates that inertial forces dominate over unity f r d 1 gualtieri et al 2019 horna munoz et al 2020 therefore the density contrast was relatively weak in all surveys according to these criteria the flow characteristics were investigated in depth to understand the mixing pattern in the river confluence because large scale coherent structures from merged flows such as secondary flows and velocity instabilities wake or kelvin helmholtz substantially contribute to the transverse mixing of the suspended sediment in a river confluence biron et al 2019 constantinescu et al 2016 in survey 1 the velocity fields and bathymetry profiles were measured and analyzed at 9 cross sections as shown in figs 8 and 9 at the upstream sections of the confluence the bathymetry is considerably distorted because of the sandbar near the stagnation zone in nr1 and 2 accordingly the main flow velocity develops near the left bank in nr3 two strong flows from the nakdong and hwang rivers ur 0 864 merged downstream of the stagnation zone sandbar which was acting as an obstacle therefore a deficit in the depth averaged velocity occurred owing to the merging boundary layers of the two river flows this velocity deficit in the near field of confluence suggests that wake vortices should be generated and were shedding from the velocity deficit zone into the downstream flow konsoer and rhoads 2014 sukhodolov et al 2022 likewise a velocity deficit zone was developed at the same location of the mixing layer with billows as shown in the photograph of survey 1 fig 8 a the low velocity in this zone could limit the sediment mixing near the mixing layer velocity vector plot in y z plane showed that dual counter rotating secondary flow cells were developed on both sides of the velocity deficit zone at section nr3 owing to the flow curvature and bed discordance fig 9 a here in the downstream sections of the sandbar at the stagnation zone and the inlet of the tributary substantial bed discordance induced upwelling motions with secondary flows this confirms previous reports where the upwelling flows can occur near the confluence due to bed discordance de serres et al 1999 moradi et al 2019 in nr4 the pair of secondary flows became stronger as the velocity deficit zone decreased these secondary flows are noteworthy because they would inhibit the mixing processes in the post confluence channel xu et al 2022 at subsequent sections nr5 7 complex flow structures still developed at a mixing interface even though the velocity deficit zone almost recovered further downstream nr8 9 secondary current cells dissipated gradually because the momentum of the tributary flow was relatively weak mr 0 142 then the merging effect on the flow dynamics tended to disappear in survey 2 dual counter rotating secondary flows were also developed at nr2 fig 9b however the secondary flows were weaker than those in survey 1 owing to the low velocity magnitude of incoming flows from the nakdong and hwang rivers fig 8b in addition the bathymetry was less distorted in survey 1 particularly the sandbar near the stagnation zone in nr1 and 2 fig 2b the sandbar area in the stagnation zone which was very shallow in survey 1 was eroded and completely submerged in survey 2 the water depth in this area was approximately 2 m as indicated by the cross sectional velocity distribution in nr1 fig 9b subsequently a velocity deficit was generated at nr2 when the two flows with similar velocity magnitudes merged after the confluence nevertheless the velocity deficit was minimal and rapidly recovered at nr3 270 m downstream from the confluence apex owing to the submerged sandbar low velocity magnitude and weak momentum of the tributary flow mr 0 189 this result reveals that the wake effect was not profound from the weak velocity deficit in survey 2 which is consistent with the photograph fig 3b although the velocity ratio was close to unity ur 0 94 accordingly the flows from the two rivers interacted near the mixing layer as shown in the cross sectional velocity field of nr3 however the flow structure recovered at nr4 downstream 450 m from the confluence apex here the secondary flows and wake developed weakly and then dissipated rapidly compared to those in survey 1 owing to the weaker dual counter rotating secondary flow and wake effect the two water bodies consisting of different colors mixed rapidly as shown in the photograph of survey 2 in fig 3 b 5 1 2 sediment dynamics the field survey results showed that ssc and particle size contrast were noticeable between the main river and tributary because of different hydrodynamic conditions and mixing layers owing to the discrepancy in sscv between the two rivers especially in survey 1 the color difference between the two rivers was clearly observed as shown in the aerial images fig 3 moreover there was an apparent difference in the particle size of the suspended sediment between the nakdong and hwang rivers in survey 1 relatively large particles d50 167 47 µm were transported from upstream of nakdong river whereas the particle size of hwang river was relatively fine d50 81 52 µm however in survey 2 the difference of d50 between the two rivers was not so big showing 50 36 µm for the nakdong river and 39 16 µm for the hwang river respectively vertical mixing of the suspended sediment at the confluence was analyzed using the vertical profiles of ssc and psd measured at section nr5 in survey 1 as the flow structure changed abruptly and the mixing layer developed strongly in this section as shown in fig 8 a vertical mixing was enhanced by the secondary current developed in this section even though the dual counter rotating secondary flows inhibited the sediment mixing in the transverse direction xu et al 2022 as shown in fig 10 a the vertical distribution of the sscv was generally uniform except for the concentration near the riverbed which can be inferred as the bed load this result also revealed that the stratification effect was weak owing to the low difference in density between the two rivers in addition as shown in fig 10 b the fraction of fine clay d 2 µm was highest near the right bank which originated from the hwang river this clay was distributed throughout the water depth of the hwang river with silt d 20 µm and was entrained into the nakdong river after confluence at section nr5 the waterbody from the nakdong river and hwang river had completely different psds near the mixing layer as a boundary after confluence and these heterogeneous psds near the mixing layer increased the spectral variability in the hyperspectral image analysis in survey 2 the vertical profiles of ssc and psd measured at section nr3 were analyzed because the mixing interface was developed in this section unlike the uniform ssc profiles of survey 1 the vertical sscv distributions near the mixing layer showed nonuniform profiles which appeared to be close to the theoretical profile of rouse 1937 as shown in fig 11 a the figure shows that the concentration was high at the riverbed and decreased slowly near the water surface this nonuniform profile was generated because the vertical mixing due to the secondary current was weaker in this section than in survey 1 at the right bank of nr3 where the flow was entrained from the hwang river a substantial concentration difference was observed between the water surface and riverbed this was induced by the discrepancy in the psd near the surface and riverbed as shown in fig 11 b suspended fine matter d 2 µm was distributed near the water surface only at the left bank this fine matter originated from the hwang river these particles floated on the surface imparting a green color to the water body in the rgb image fig 3b despite the low chl a and cyanobacteria cell counts in survey 2 as mentioned above this variability in suspended matter with sediment and various vertical sscv profiles substantially caused the strong spectral variability in hyperspectral image analysis 5 2 application of cmr ov to the river confluence 5 2 1 classification of river regions using hyperspectral clustering using the hsi acquired in the two surveys hyperspectral clustering was applied to classify two water bodies at the river confluence the hsi acquired in survey 1 was separated into two clusters as shown in fig 12 a these clusters were precisely classified as the water bodies of the nakdong and hwang rivers with a mixing layer in between however the sandbar area of the nakdong river located in the stagnation zone near the confluence junction is included in cluster 2 hence the optical characteristics of this area were similar to those of the hwang river because the reflectance of the sand bottom was dominant and the water column effect was negligible because of the shallow water depth h 1 m in addition the result of the apparent classification demonstrated that both rivers have distinct optical characteristics and flows from two rivers at the near field of the confluence do not mix well the averaged hyperspectral spectrum of each cluster also had different profiles as shown in fig 12 b and c although the sscv of nakdong river was higher than that of hwang river the reflectance was the opposite hwang river showed higher reflectance owing to the high contribution of the scattering effect from fine sediment particles and bottom reflectance by shallow water depth this result conflicts with the previously reported idea that the sscv and reflectance are positively correlated binding et al 2005 montanher et al 2014 pereira et al 2019 qu et al 2016 umar et al 2018 fig 13 shows the values of sscv d50 and water quality parameters turbidity water temperature ph and electronic conductivity ec from hyperspectral clusters both clusters showed different characteristics and these values were similar to the in situ measured values in addition the hyperspectral clustering results were compared to clustering using suspended sediment measured in situ and water quality parameters when the in situ measured data were divided into two clusters fig 14 b the patterns of the two clusters were almost identical to the hyperspectral clustering results except for the sand bar area fig 14 a furthermore even when these clusters were divided into three and four the results were more finely divided within the two hyperspectral clusters as indicated in fig 14 c and d this result reveals that hyperspectral clustering can classify water characteristics differences without water quality information and can simplify the variability of optical and sediment water characteristics of river confluences using hyperspectral imagery in survey 2 the contrasts of sscv and turbidity between the two rivers were 5 39 ppm and 1 02 ntu table 2 owing to these contrasts hyperspectral clustering apparently separated the hsi of the river confluence into two water bodies of both rivers as two clusters fig 15 a similarly the average wavelengths of the divided clusters had significantly different values however the wavelength in the red edge region 700 800 nm which is highly correlated with the intrinsic spectral characteristics of the sediment showed similar reflectance for both rivers spectral bands in other wavelength regions showed relatively high values for the hwang river with a low sscv these results are identical to those of survey 1 in the case of survey 1 the downstream part of the confluence was divided into two parts forming the mixing layer in between but in survey 2 the area of the hwang river after the confluence point was very small the two clusters were divided without a clear mixing layer as in survey 1 because mixing occurred actively after confluence and the tributary inflow did not significantly affect the spectral characteristics of the mainstream therefore the spectral characteristics were more clearly divided than in survey 1 indicating the degree of mixing of the confluence to some extent fig 16 presents the values of the water quality parameters for both hyperspectral clusters this result demonstrates that differences in water quality can be well classified from hyperspectral clusters according to survey 1 consequently hyperspectral clustering is a competent method to classify river confluence regardless of the information on sediment water quality characteristics furthermore it can be used as a practical process to resolve the spectral variability of river confluence 5 2 2 retrievals of sscv map based on the hyperspectral clusters the trained rf models in cmr ov were applied to retrieve the sscv distribution at the confluence of the hwang and nakdong rivers under two different conditions fig 17 presents the mapping results of survey 1 as shown in this figure a high concentration occurred in the nakdong river although the tributary appeared more turbid in the actual rgb image fig 17a the reflectance of the hyperspectral spectrum in the nakdong river with high sscv was low whereas the reflectivity of the hwang river with low sscv was high owing to spectral variability in addition the water depth of the sandbar area in the stagnation zone near the confluence apex was less than 1 m which induced a substantial contribution from the bottom reflectance despite this bottom effect cmr ov can control it by separating this area from the hyperspectral clustering as shown in fig 17 c in terms of mixing layer retrievals irregular interfacial billows were generated at the mixing layer in survey 1 owing to the complex flow condition at the near field of confluence fig 17 clearly demonstrates that the hyperspectral retrievals reproduced the mixing layer shown in the rgb image of fig 3 a more precisely than the sscv map interpolated from the in situ measured data notably detailed measured data from hyperspectral retrievals at the mixing layer can be expected to enhance the capability of analyzing confluence dynamics remote sensing techniques generally retrieve the surface concentration owing to the strong absorbance of light in the water column balasubramanian et al 2020 umar et al 2018 however a value close to the average concentration can be obtained in shallow waters kwon et al 2022b suspended sediment signals can be received up to the riverbed at depths of 2 m or less if the bottom signal is well controlled albert and mobley 2003 lee et al 1999 in this respect the sscv retrieved from the cmr ov showed good agreement with the depth averaged sscv profile from in situ measurements at section nr 5 as shown in fig 18 a in this figure the transverse distance y is from the left bank of the nakdong river the estimated transverse profile of sscv revealed a steep concentration gradient within the mixing layer in the general mixing phenomenon at confluence the concentration gradient within the mixing layer tends to decrease owing to the shear effect jung et al 2019 lewis and rhoads 2015 pouchoulin et al 2020 however in this case a poor mixing pattern was observed in the sscv map owing to the dual counter rotating secondary flows and wake effect which resulted in hydraulic analysis the site specific problem of remote sensing in a water environment is the most critical issue dethier et al 2020 kabir and ahmari 2020 liu et al 2003 montanher et al 2014 pyo et al 2019 the dataset collected in survey 2 was not used as a training dataset table 2 thus the performance of cmr ov in the uncalibrated case was evaluated using this dataset fig 18 b presents a comparison between the depth averaged in situ measured sscv and the retrieved sscv in section nr 3 in survey 2 this figure shows a reasonable agreement between the hyperspectral retrievals and in situ data moreover although the fine suspended matter was distributed in the water from the hwang river on the surface as shown in fig 8 hyperspectral retrievals by cmr ov detected suspended sediment below the water surface and showed a result close to the depth averaged sscv fig 19 depicts the spatial distribution of sscv retrieved by cmr ov showing the mixing pattern of suspended sediment with sscv contrast in survey 2 unlike survey 1 the mixing layer was not clearly seen after the confluence even though the contrast of sscv between the two rivers before the confluence was clearly seen in the retrieved map this means that the mixing layer disappeared rapidly owing to strong transverse mixing between the two water bodies while transverse mixing was suppressed by the dual counter rotating secondary flows in the case of survey 1 5 2 3 analysis of mixing pattern using sscv map as shown in the sscv map retrieved from hsi the mixing patterns of both surveys were quite different especially near the mixing layer fig 20 shows the transverse sscv profiles at nr3 nr8 in survey 1 the concentration gradient of the mixing layer tended to decrease with longitudinal distance from the confluence apex since the incoming suspended sediment flux from the two rivers was mixed transversely notably the wake effect from the velocity deficit induced irregular ssc curves near the mixing layer which was consistent with the irregular billows in the ssc map as shown in fig 17 c the low velocity within the velocity deficit zone causes a local concentration hump to inhibit the transverse mixing in contrast as shown in fig 21 the transverse sscv profiles in survey 2 indicated that an irregular concentration hump did not occur and the concentration gradient was quickly smoothed by transverse mixing downstream of the confluence this figure showed that transverse mixing was almost complete within the near field x 1 10 the results of the two cases indicated that the dual counter rotating secondary flows and wake effect substantially affected the transverse mixing even though vertical mixing was accelerated owing to the strong secondary current in survey 1 fig 10 the variance calculated from the transverse distribution of the sscv for surveys 1 and 2 is plotted against the longitudinal distance in fig 22 this figure shows that for both surveys the variance increases linearly along the longitudinal distance r2 of the linear regression curves were 0 93 and 0 86 in surveys 1 and 2 respectively the slope of the linear regression curve of survey 2 was almost twice as large as that of survey 1 indicating that transverse mixing occurred more quickly in the case of survey 2 with a weak dual counter rotating secondary flow and wake effect in this study from the slope of the variance versus the longitudinal distance dt was estimated using the moment method eq 7 and the results are summarized in table 4 because the velocity was faster in survey 1 than in survey 2 table 3 the difference in the dt was lower than the difference in the variance slopes of the two cases the dimensionless transverse mixing coefficient values d t h u for both cases were over unity which means that the transverse mixing strongly occurred as much as sharply curved channels ranging from 1 to 3 as suggested by rutherford 1994 the results of this study revealed that the mixing rate varies considerably depending on the velocity and morphology even when the discharge conditions are similar however more substantial mixing could occur more strongly in river confluences if enhancing factors such as a single secondary flow are present instead of confounding factors such as wakes or dual counter rotating helical cells pouchoulin et al 2020 6 future research and applicability this study analyzed mixing patterns at a river confluence using high resolution hyperspectral imagery to obtain a precise ssc map uav based hyperspectral imaging provides images with a resolution of less than 10 cm and a high spectral resolution of 4 nm intervals therefore this approach can be used for the precise measurement of various physical quantities in water environments such as organic matter algal blooms chemicals and water depth gwon et al 2023 legleiter and harrison 2019 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 precise mixing analysis using satellite imagery with a spatial resolution of 10 m or more is challenging however satellite imagery offers wider spatial coverage fortunately recent launches of hyperspectral satellites e g hyperion on nasa s earth observing 1 satellite and chris on esa s proba 1 which provide more spectral information than multispectral satellites offer the potential for accurate monitoring of a wider area rast and painter 2019 by applying the spectral model from uav based images to satellite images the reliability of the remote sensing model can be improved which will also aid in wide monitoring at the basin scale in terms of mixing analysis it is very challenging to obtain depth averaged information from remote sensing based measurements as shown by the tendency to underestimate ssc in the deep water area in survey 2 in deeper rivers the focus of ssc estimation is on surface concentration moreover stratification has a substantial influence on mixing at the river confluence gualtieri et al 2019 xu et al 2022 but the hyperspectral approach is limited in this regard nevertheless analysis of three dimensional mixing would be possible based on more precise measurements by combining the hyperspectral approach and adcp based ssc measurement techniques which are advantageous for vertical concentration distribution estimation sassi et al 2013 simmons et al 2020 szupiany et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 in future research the drawbacks of adcp based measurements such as the existence of unmeasured points and difficulty in measuring surface concentration should be addressed by combining them with hyperspectral measurements to analyze a three dimensional ssc field 7 conclusions in this study detailed mixing patterns of suspended sediment in the river confluence were analyzed using high resolution ssc maps obtained from hyperspectral retrievals cluster based ml regression was applied to two cases where suspended sediment mixing occurred at the confluence of the nakdong and hwang rivers through the hyperspectral approach the spectral characteristics according to the water body characteristics of the confluence were analyzed and the ssc map was retrieved to investigate the transverse mixing dynamics of suspended sediment downstream of the river confluence the main findings of this study are as follows 1 hyperspectral clustering classifies the waterbody regions of the main river and tributary based on spectral characteristics in particular we confirmed that mixing occurred rapidly and slowly from the distribution of clusters after confluence in addition hyperspectral clustering showed similar results to clustering based on the water quality factors this result indicates that we could determine the mixing trend after the river confluence using only hyperspectral imagery 2 based on hyperspectral clustering rf regressors can retrieve the highly spectrally complex phenomena of the two cases at the river confluence in the first case turbidity and ssc were inversely proportional because of a highly turbid flow with fine matter and sediment laden flows with large sand particles merged at the confluence in the second case a tributary flowed with fine suspended solids on the surface and suspended sediment in the water column in both cases despite the spectral variability the retrieved ssc values showed good agreement with the depth averaged ssc from the in situ measurements in addition the transverse gradient of the sscv near the mixing layer was reproduced well using the hyperspectral approach 3 the complex spatial distribution of ssc was estimated in greater detail but this was difficult to reproduce using conventional measurements continuous variance distributions of both cases in this study were extracted from the high resolution ssc maps the variance distribution not only revealed the detailed mixing features but was also used as input data for the estimation of the transverse mixing coefficient from the moment method 4 the mixing coefficient in survey 1 was approximately 40 lower than that in survey 2 this result showed that the key factors for the difference in mixing patterns were the wake and dual counter rotating helical flows even though both surveys were conducted under similar discharge conditions 5 in survey 1 a substantial velocity deficit occurred behind a large sandbar near the stagnation zone and then induced complex wake flows as visualized by the color difference between the tributary and the main river this phenomenon locally delayed mixing within the velocity deficit zone therefore the ssc variance decreased owing to irregular sscv changes near the mixing layer in the transverse sscv profiles the dual counter rotating secondary flows also significantly limited the sediment mixing across the post confluence sections the interface between both secondary flows acted as a barrier for transverse mixing along the velocity deficit and mixing layers 6 the averaged velocity magnitudes of the main river and tributary were more similar in survey 2 ur 0 95 than in survey 1 ur 0 86 despite this the wake and dual counter rotating helical flows were weak in survey 2 because erosion of the sandbar at the stagnation zone leading to an increased mixing rate considering the type of abnormal mixing found in this study the hyperspectral based measurement presented in this study can effectively estimate the mixing coefficient with higher reliability this study demonstrated the advantages of the hyperspectral approach for investigating suspended sediment mixing in river confluences high resolution hyperspectral imagery based ssc measurement is a substantial supplement when high resolution ssc data are required such as at river confluences and meandering streams

1963,in a river confluence the fluvial process is complex because of the merging of different flows from rivers with distinct morphologies however the mixing of suspended sediment in river confluences has been inadequately investigated owing to the low resolution of conventional techniques for measuring suspended sediment in this study we investigated the mixing of suspended sediment at the confluence of the hwang and nakdong rivers in south korea by analyzing the spectral characteristics of suspended sediment from high resolution hyperspectral data we retrieved the suspended sediment concentration ssc from high resolution hyperspectral imagery using the conversion technique which is a cluster based machine learning regression with optical variability hyperspectral clustering was first applied to classify the water regions of the main river nakdong and its tributary hwang the clustering result at a near field after the confluence point was strongly related to the mixing degree of flow and sediments from two different rivers through segmentation regressors with hyperspectral clusters enabled accurate ssc measurement in particular they precisely retrieved the concentrations adjacent to the mixing layer even when the relationship between the spectral data and suspended sediment concentrations of the main river and tributary was substantially different using a detailed ssc map we compared two cases of mixing patterns by calculating the variation in sediment concentration along the downstream river confluence we found that the mixing pattern was different because of the flow velocity and a large sandbar near the stagnant area even though river discharge was similar for both cases in the slow mixing case the sandbar caused a velocity deficit with a wake that reduced the variance of ssc due to the irregular flow near the mixing layer in this case dual counter rotating secondary flow cells also limited mixing across the post confluence reach however when the wake and dual counter rotating secondary flows weakened due to the erosion of the sandbar and lower flow velocity the transverse mixing coefficient increased by approximately 40 compared to the slow mixing case this study demonstrated that the hyperspectral approach can be used to investigate the mixing of suspended sediment in greater detail in complex river systems as it provides high resolution information that conventional measurement methods cannot explore keywords remote sensing hyperspectral imagery river confluence suspended sediment transverse mixing ssc mapping data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the river confluence is a dynamic area in which complex flow patterns develop as the flows of two different streams merge in this area the spatial distribution of suspended sediments is also complex because the flow from the tributary with different suspended sediment concentration is converged into gualtieri et al 2018 ostad ali askari 2022a riley et al 2015 szupiany et al 2009 zhang et al 2020a zinger et al 2013 the turbulent mixing of suspended sediment and other suspended matter occurs actively with various patterns downstream of the river confluence because tributary flows commonly have different discharge momentum velocity and bottom elevation from those of the main river constantinescu et al 2012 konsoer and rhoads 2014 ostad ali askari 2022b rhoads and johnson 2018 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 sukhodolov et al 2017 yuan et al 2021 2019 zinger et al 2013 although the mixing of suspended sediment has a substantial influence on the morphodynamics and water quality downstream of the confluence most studies have focused on the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic features of river confluences based on measurements of the flow field and bed elevation fattahi nafchi et al 2021 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 riley et al 2015 sabrina et al 2021 sukhodolov et al 2017 zinger et al 2013 at the river confluence the mixing process can be divided into three stages near field intermediate field and far field mixing fig 1 among the three regions the mixing processes in the near field called the confluence hydrodynamic zone chz are the most complex and dynamic the shear interface and helical motions in the chz significantly affect the mixing mechanisms of the suspended sediment downstream of the chz konsoer and rhoads 2014 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 despite the importance of the mixing mechanisms of suspended sediment downstream of the chz there have been few studies on detailed analysis of sediment mixing analyzing the mixing pattern of suspended sediment in the river confluence was mainly limited by the difficulty of acquiring high resolution data on suspended sediment concentration ssc the spatial distribution of ssc in rivers has not been thoroughly measured owing to the limitations of conventional measurement methods among the conventional measuring techniques the manual collection of samples using a water sampler has been widely used to measure suspended sediments edwards and glysson 1999 latosinski et al 2014 yang and julien 2019 to apply this method to large rivers spatial distribution measurement has relied on the possibility of deploying reel mounted water samplers on bridges cableways and boats because of their non wadeable condition umar et al 2018 although this sampling method is the most accurate it is very labor intensive and time consuming and it requires measuring the dry weight of the sediment in the laboratory recently as an alternative method adcp based cross sectional measurements have been adapted to collect datasets of spatial distribution despite the relatively high uncertainty simmons et al 2020 szupiany et al 2019 this adcp based method is superior to the sampling method for obtaining spatial distribution because it is possible to obtain high resolution data by making the boat path dense and converting the data into a continuous spatial distribution using an interpolation technique kwak et al 2020 lane et al 2008 son et al 2021 although this method can efficiently measure ssc data with water depth and velocity profiles it has a relatively low resolution for quantifying the mixing patterns and rates of suspended sediment in addition the movement of a boat usually disturbs the suspended sediment distribution and the interpolated data are not sufficiently reliable this disadvantage is critical for investigating the characteristics of the irregular mixing layer in the near field of river confluences fig 1 although the aforementioned methods enable the collection of accurate ssc data within individual points and cross sections at a specific time the sediment data obtained using these methods are insufficient for analyzing the complex mixing processes of suspended sediment in a complex river system which requires high resolution data compared to these methods the remote sensing based ssc measurement technique can be an ideal platform for obtaining high resolution data to analyze mixing dynamics on a large spatiotemporal scale even though it focuses on measuring the near surface concentration kwon et al 2022a lewis et al 2020 umar et al 2018 in the remote sensing approach scattering by suspended sediment is detected as radiance and converted into concentration using various conversion methods binding et al 2005 chen et al 1991 dethier et al 2020 however the scattered radiance is significantly affected by the variability of sediment and water quality albert and mobley 2003 lee et al 2002 1999 mobley 1999 moreover in shallow waters of wide rivers applying a remote sensing approach is challenging because the river bottom signal critically disturbs the intrinsic signal of the suspended sediment legleiter and harrison 2019 zhou et al 2017 in this respect river confluences are the most optically complex areas in riverine systems because they usually have two different spectral characteristics from confluent flows the complex topography owing to the dynamic flow structure caused by the convergence of the two flows results in a heterogeneous distribution of water depths in the confluence area biron et al 2019 constantinescu et al 2012 guillén ludeña et al 2017 to study the mixing of suspended sediment in the river confluence by remote sensing umar et al 2018 first measured the spatial distributions of ssc using satellite remote sensing in the mississippi and missouri rivers in the usa however in this study the spatial resolution of multispectral satellite imagery is not sufficient to capture detailed mixing patterns of suspended sediments especially in the near field in addition this study did not consider the spectral variability of river confluences likewise although other researchers jiang et al 2021 koestner et al 2020 peterson et al 2018 shen et al 2010 spyrakos et al 2018 zhang et al 2020c zhang et al 2020b have also successfully applied satellite based remote sensing techniques for measuring ssc in water environments the retrieval of suspended sediment at river confluences has not been widely studied because of its high spectral variability and the lack of a high resolution ssc dataset the objectives of this study were to understand the spectral characteristics of suspended sediment at a river confluence the hwang nakdong river confluence in south korea with its physical properties and to evaluate the feasibility of a hyperspectral approach for investigating the mixing patterns of suspended sediment in the river confluence in this study we retrieved the suspended sediment pattern from high resolution hyperspectral imagery using the machine learning based conversion technique which incorporated the spectral variability of the river confluences in addition we analyzed the detailed mixing patterns for different mixing cases using high resolution ssc maps obtained from hyperspectral retrieval 2 field surveys in a river confluence 2 1 study site two field surveys were conducted to obtain combined datasets of hyperspectral images along with flow velocity fields bathymetry suspended sediment and water quality to apply the hyperspectral approach to river confluence under different conditions the study site was the confluence of the nakdong and hwang rivers in south korea as shown in fig 2 the streambed substrates of both rivers were predominantly fine sand d50 91 μm so morphological changes as well as sediment transport occurred very dynamically in various ways molit 2016 the total watershed area of the nakdong river is 23 817 km2 with a main channel length of 522 km the hwang river converges on the right bank of the nakdong river with a channel length of 107 6 km and a total watershed area of 1 329 km2 the confluence of the two rivers is located in the lower reaches of the nakong river approximately 7 5 km downstream of the hapcheon changnyung dam as shown in fig 2 in this study field surveys were conducted at the near field of river confluence where dynamic mixing usually occurs owing to the varying confluent flows from both rivers two field surveys were performed under similar discharge conditions during the spring dry season when the water temperatures of both rivers were relatively low 13 16 7 c table 1 despite the similar discharge conditions in both surveys distinct patterns of mixing layers for the two cases were generated as shown in the photographs of each survey as shown in fig 3 survey 1 showed an irregular mixing layer with large billows whereas the mixing layer appeared relatively smooth and the color contrast of both rivers faded rapidly after confluence in survey 2 moreover the colors of the water bodies from the tributaries in both surveys were substantially different the two surveys were conducted approximately 13 months apart and during that time the bathymetry of the hwang nakdong confluence was extensively altered as shown in the interpolated bathymetry from the adcp using standard kriging in fig 3 a shallow submerged sandbar h 1 m developed near the stagnation zone in survey 1 but the sandbar was considerably eroded in survey 2 therefore we precisely measured suspended sediment water quality and velocity using both hyperspectral and in situ techniques and then analyzed the effect of morphological differences on mixing patterns at the river confluence 2 2 in situ field measurements suspended sediment velocity water quality the profiles of the volumetric suspended sediment concentration sscv and particle size distribution psd near the water surface were measured using a submersible laser diffraction based particle size analyzer lisst 200x sequoia scientific inc usa the measurement ranges of the sscv and psd were as follows the range of the psd was from 1 to 500 μm in logarithmic increments with 36 bins the range of the ssc was 0 5 700 ppm this sensor demonstrated a high sampling rate up to 1 hz and showed a high accuracy r2 of 90 or more when compared to the known concentration of suspended sediment samples in the laboratory kwon et al 2022b using this sensor the surface sscv was measured by the moving boat method kwak et al 2020 son et al 2021 specifically a reel with a lisst 200x was attached to the side of a boat thus the sscv could be efficiently measured along the path of a moving boat in addition vertical profiles were measured by descending the lisst 200x into the water column by controlling the reel as shown in table 1 the surface sscv was measured at 2 369 points located upstream and downstream of the confluence and tributary in the study area the surface sscv was densely measured at approximately 3 meter intervals for each cross section within the near field of the confluence indicating a complex mixing layer this allowed for the collection of an adequate dataset that reflects the varying ssc between the main river and the tributary the vertical sscv and psd profiles were measured at four to five points in the downstream section at approximately 350 m confluence for both surveys hydraulic data water depth and velocity profile of the measurement points were obtained using the adcp river surveyor m9 sontek usa and geometric coordinates were measured by differential global positioning system dgps with an accuracy of less than 1 m at a sampling rate of approximately 1 hz installed on the boat a compass was calibrated before deploying the adcp on the boat then the bathymetry and velocity profiles from the near bed point to the near surface point were simultaneously collected along the two repeat paths of the crossing boat using water mode 1 at each measurement section during the transaction the dgps tracked the position of the moving boat and then the boat speed was determined using a dgps receiver according to the m9 manual sontek 2014 as the river bottom material was fine at the study site as described in section 2 1 we did not use the bottom tracking function of the adcp which requires a non moving bottom condition sontek 2014 szupiany et al 2009 xu et al 2022 the average boat speed was maintained steadily at 0 4 0 5 m s order of water speed along the straight path perpendicular to the flow direction to ensure measurement accuracy by minimizing the lateral variation of the transect line the vertical cell size ranged from 0 2 to 0 5 m from the sontek m9 firmware smart pulse based on these measurement processes in surveys 1 the cross sectional data were obtained from nine cross sections to focus on the velocity field within the complex mixing layer shown in the aerial imagery in contrast five cross sections were measured in survey 2 due to the relatively simple mixing layer for post processing the vmt software was used to analyze and visualize bathymetry and cross sectional velocity profiles parsons et al 2013 we averaged the repeatedly measured data at each measurement section for the final cross sectional profile the secondary flow vectors were calculated using rozovskii decomposition which rotates individual verticals rather than the entire section rozovskii 1957 from this decomposition the primary velocity direction for each point was precisely obtained as a depth integrated flow vector accordingly secondary flows were efficiently calculated using the differences in depth averaged vectors szupiany et al 2009 the cross sectional component of the secondary flow was also calculated in detail using the divergence of the primary velocity vectors without distortion in this study a ysi 6600 v2 sonde ysi incorporated usa was utilized to measure water temperature and water quality data such as conductivity chl a turbidity ph and dissolved oxygen do according to the sensor specifications the measurement accuracy of the ysi 6600 v2 sonde is as follows accuracy of water temperature and ph are 0 15 c and 0 2 respectively errors of conductivity turbidity do are 0 5 2 and 1 of reading respectively all data from lisst adcp and ysi were collected at a frequency of 1 hz and the collected data were synchronized with the measurement time 2 3 hyperspectral imagery collection and pre processing in this study hsis were acquired using a uav mounted hyperspectral camera platform kwon et al 2022b 2022a this platform consists of a hyperspectral camera microhsi 410 shark corning inc usa m600 pro uav dji china ronin 3 axis handheld gimbal dji china and gps sensor the hyperspectral camera has a push broom type sensor covering a wavelength range of 400 1000 nm with 150 spectral bands because this camera is a push broom type sensor it can scan 682 pixels for one line at once thus it can capture the entire image with continuously measured lines by the moving uav a more detailed specification of the uav mounted hyperspectral camera platform used in this study was elaborated by kwon et al 2022a during both surveys the uav mounted hyperspectral camera platform was manipulated to scan the river area in the transverse direction to cover the entire target area fig 4 a for this reason several flight strips were designed and the separately acquired strips of hyperspectral images were co registered to obtain hyperspectral images covering the entire area fig 4b in this procedure the georeferenced points and rgb images were used to accurately align the hsis strips such that the corresponding pixels of the overlapped locations were geometrically integrated the final co registered images were used as orthophotos for the final hsi on the other hand radiometric correction was required to convert a digital number dn which stored the radiance as an integer on the hyperspectral camera to relative reflectance because the radiance recorded by the hyperspectral camera did not coincide with the actual energy emitted or reflected by the surface owing to the azimuth angle and elevation of the sun a radiometric correction was required to normalize the images for this correction dn should first be converted into radiance l using the gain and offset of each pixel these gain and offset values are typically retrieved from the hyperspectral sensor metadata after this conversion the radiance was converted to relative reflectance using the empirical line method elm based on reference reflectance values smith and milton 1999 1 r λ g a i n l λ o f f s e t where r λ is relative reflectance gain is a slope of the empirical line λ is a wavelength and offset is an intercept of the empirical line the reference reflectance values for calibration were obtained using calibration tarps that offered lambertian reflectance lambertian reflectance denotes the isotropic reflected light intensity which is a reference for radiometric correction regardless of the camera angle baek et al 2019 in this study calibration tarps offering lambertian reflectance values of 0 84 0 56 0 24 and 0 03 were used to convert the l to normalized reflectance with this correction the normalized hsi provides enhanced interpretability and quality of hyperspectral data jeon et al 2019 kwon et al 2020 3 methodology 3 1 hyperspectral retrieval of suspended sediment the principle of detecting the scattering feature of suspended sediment as radiance and converting it into concentration is physically clear but the radiance detected by the hyperspectral camera usually consists of complex signals in addition the scattered radiance is significantly affected by the variability of the sediment and stream properties thus it is essential to understand the spectral variability by clarifying this principle in general the total radiance lu in the water environment consists of four significant subradiance components as shown in eq 2 baek et al 2019 niroumand jadidi et al 2018 legleiter et al 2004 2 l u λ l b λ l c λ l s λ l p λ where lb is the upwelling radiance from the bed lc is the backscattered radiance from the water column ls is the upwelling radiance from the interface between the atmosphere and water body lp is the upwelling path radiance from the atmosphere the magnitude of lp is insignificant in the hsi captured by uavs which obtain images at low altitudes ls is locally generated by water surface reflection due to turbulence or suspended matter near the surface this can be minimized using glint removal algorithms overstreet and legleiter 2017 however lc is more complex than other variables because it is related to the inherent optical properties iops of the constituents contained in the water column fan et al 2015 olmanson et al 2013 pinet et al 2017 wong et al 2019 the constituents of the water column usually consist of suspended sediment suspended matter and colored dissolved organic matter cdom and their properties determine these iops backscattering and absorbance coefficients mobley 1999 furthermore lb also increases the spectral variability because this term varies according to the water depth and channel bottom type this signal usually coexists with lc therefore it can be a critical factor in disturbing ssc estimation from lc especially in shallow waters in this respect river confluences usually have substantial spectral variability because two different water bodies merge and the water depth and bottom properties vary irregularly in the confluence area in this study to consider spectral variability in river confluences we employed a robust hyperspectral imagery based ssc measurement method this method is a cluster based machine learning regression with optical variability named cmr ov developed by kwon et al 2022a cmr ov deals with the spectral variability problem by combining hyperspectral clustering and the random forest model as a machine learning regression method as shown in fig 5 a hyperspectral clustering separates a complex dataset into several homogeneous datasets according to the spectral characteristics of the water body then machine learning regressors corresponding to each clustered dataset were built to construct the relationship between the hyperspectral spectrum and ssc such as regressors 1 2 and 3 as shown in fig 5 b in this study hyperspectral clustering was applied to classify hyperspectral data with similar statistical characteristics to 150 spectral band values in the 400 1000 nm wavelength range first this method was applied to river hyperspectral images to achieve spatial division between regions with similar spectral characteristics according to the waterbody characteristics at the river confluence the characteristics of suspended sand and other suspended matter in the two rivers are usually different and the contribution of bottom reflectance could vary according to water depth therefore hyperspectral clustering enables the division of the whole region into the main river and tributary regions because the spectral characteristics are also different when the waterbody characteristics are different this spatial division contributes to understanding the complex mechanism of the river confluence especially in near field of the confluence where complex mixing and morphological change occur in this study the gaussian mixture model gmm was used as the hyperspectral clustering method this clustering method classifies a dataset according to the statistical characteristics of the gaussian distribution the gmm can represent the entire dataset as several probability density functions pdfs of a gaussian distribution löffler et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 therefore the entire dataset can be separated from each pdf to ensure the statistical homogeneity when applied to hyperspectral imagery captured in a water environment it classifies an optically complex dataset into homogeneous clusters kwon et al 2022a specifically the gaussian mixture pdfs p of the reflectance spectrum in each pixel xi can be expressed as eq 3 3 p x i k 1 k π k n k x μ k σ k where k is the number of clusters π k is the mixture coefficient with a total sum of 1 1 k π k 1 nk is a single gaussian distribution of kth cluster with a mean μ k and covariance matrix σ k all parameters in p can be estimated using the expectation maximization em algorithm which obtains the optimal value of each parameter by maximizing the likelihood zhou et al 2018 the finally fitted p from the gmm can be decomposed into several n as the pdf of pixel based spectral clusters in this study the gmm process was further elaborated by kwon et al 2022a in this study we developed multiple regression models for each cluster from gmm to consider spectral variability in rivers fig 5b as a hyperspectral regression method the rf regression model was adapted to estimate ssc from the hyperspectral spectrum in each pixel this method is an ensemble decision tree model that minimizes the bias of the predicted results breiman 2001 in rf a large number of decision tree models weree combined by averaging in a process called ensemble learning each decision tree in the rf was developed from a random selection of samples and variables based on the bagging method proposed by breiman 1996 the sample was generated using bootstrap sampling with random replacement during the bagging process owing to this randomization the bagging process can reduce the variance and correlation between the established decision trees in the bagging process the decision trees in the rf were trained separately using the sampled dataset specifically each node in decision tree was split by maximizing the reduction in overall impurity in nodes this study used the mean square error mse as a criterion for impurity as follows in eq 4 4 mse 1 n i y i y i 2 where n is the number of training dataset yi is the ssc measured by lisst and y is the ssc estimated by the rf for each clustered rf model the number of decision trees and the number of features randomly sampled at each split were tuned using gridsearchcv in python based on the parameter range specified in earlier studies kwon et al 2021 probst et al 2019 after training rf the final prediction result was calculated by aggregating the predicted ssc in each decision tree model at this stage the final ssc values and uncertainty are presented based on the average and standard deviation of the predicted ssc values the main advantage of rf is that it requires only a short time to build a model and is insensitive to hyperparameters 3 2 mixing evaluation in the river confluence when the flows from the main river and the tributary with ssc contrast merge after the river confluence the constant sediment fluxes continuously flow to the confluence from the two incoming rivers if the discharge and concentration from the two flows can be assumed to be steady longitudinal mixing can be neglected in river confluences jung et al 2019 lewis et al 2020 pouchoulin et al 2020 compared with longitudinal mixing transverse mixing usually occurs more dynamically because of the various secondary currents related to helical motion developed downstream of the river confluence the shear layer also develops in various ways i e wake mode and kelvin helmholtz mode depending on the momentum and velocity ratios between the two flows and the internal velocity deficit induced by the stagnation zone because the lateral momentum flux of the mean flow is pronounced with the lateral momentum flux of turbulence e the strong eddy caused by the lateral momentum flux was much larger than the turbulent eddy in the transverse direction which was proven by the numerical model and experimental results cheng and constantinescu 2020 constantinescu et al 2012 lewis et al 2020 lewis and rhoads 2015 rhoads and sukhodolov 2008 this means that the dispersion from the secondary current is pronounced and enhances transverse mixing within river confluences particularly in the near field as illustrated in fig 1 moreover in large and shallow confluences w h 100 the horizontal eddy is less affected by the boundary but vertical eddy is difficult to grow because the length scale is limited by the water depth constantinescu et al 2014 gualtieri et al 2019 uijttewaal and booij 2000 in this study the transverse mixing in a river confluence was analyzed based on a depth averaged 2d mixing equation under steady state concentration negligible longitudinal mixing and neutrally buoyant and conservative sediment conditions eq 5 jung et al 2019 seo et al 2006a 5 u c x v c y 1 h y h d t c y s where u and v are depth averaged longitudinal and transverse velocities c is the depth averaged concentration x is the longitudinal direction h is the water depth y is the transverse distance dt is the transverse mixing coefficient and s is a sink source term the conventional point measurement of ssc has a limitation in analyzing mixing patterns in river confluences due to resolution problems however the detailed patterns of transverse mixing at the river confluence can be evaluated using a high resolution ssc map from hyperspectral retrievals in this study we analyzed the mixing pattern by calculating the continuous longitudinal profile of the variance of the transverse ssc distribution σ y 2 from the ssc map as defined by 6 σ y 2 0 w c y 2 d y 0 w cdy transverse mixing is typically characterized as dt in eq 3 which accounts for transverse mixing from shear dispersion turbulent diffusion and channel irregularities rutherford 1994 in many earlier studies covering the mixing in rivers the mixing coefficient was nondimensionalized as d t h u by averaged water depth h and shear velocity u where u gr s 0 and s0 is the reach slope 0 001808 in nakdong river fischer 1968 rutherford 1994 this nondimensional mixing coefficient was usually suggested to compare the mixing in various sites such as straight stream meandering stream and confluences baek and seo 2010 jung et al 2019 lane et al 2008 rutherford 1994 seo et al 2006a 2006b shin et al 2020 in this study the transverse mixing coefficient was estimated by the moment method eq 7 from the σ y 2 along longitudinal distance sayre and chang 1968 7 d t u 2 d σ y 2 dx dt was estimated from the slope of the fitted linear regression between σ y 2 and x therefore the σ y 2 x profile obtained from the ssc map can increase the reliability of dt estimation owing to its high resolution 4 model validation in this study the evaluation of the cmr ov was performed in two respects 1 cross applicability and 2 uncalibrated dataset applicability four types of datasets were used for the evaluations as listed in table 2 the cross applicability of the remote sensing based regressor needs to be proven to overcome the limitation attributed to the locality of the estimator baek et al 2019 dethier et al 2020 kwon et al 2022b the locality of the estimator usually reduces the field applicability of the remote sensing based estimator because a general regressor cannot accurately learn various datasets and it must re learn when it is applied in the uncalibrated area learning the dataset collected in river confluences was similar to learning two different river datasets therefore it was necessary to use a robust model for spectral variability although cmr ov was proven to be a robust model under optically complex conditions kwon et al 2022a additional verification using various field datasets was necessary for river confluences because it was only validated using data from field scale channels hence in this study local learning which independently trained the cmr ov using survey data of river confluences and merged learning using a combined dataset of field scale experiments and field surveys was conducted to evaluate the field applicability in river confluences moreover a 5 folds cross validation was conducted using a combined dataset to evaluate cross applicability as these datasets were independently collected in different areas under different conditions as shown in table 2 these tests could be used to evaluate whether cmr ov can be extended to various river conditions datasets of vertical ssc profiles collected in surveys 1 and 2 were used to verify the applicability of cmr ov using depth averaged and uncalibrated datasets in local and merged learning tests we trained each model by randomly sampling 80 of the dataset and evaluated it using the residual data in each training the results of local learning using a dataset from survey 1 are presented in fig 6 a and b in this figure the data density is represented from red high density to blue low density this result shows that the cmr ov can accurately learn the spectral characteristics of the river confluence with a bimodal distribution as a result of the merged learning the training and test accuracy improved substantially compared with local learning fig 6c and d therefore from this result one can say that the more the model learns from various datasets the better is the performance and this model is robust to spectral variability cross validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate the cross applicability probst et al 2019 to evaluate cross applicability of cmr ov 5 folds cross validation was implemented to split the test and training datasets in the ratios of 80 and 20 respectively the evaluation using the dataset under various conditions indicated how the estimator should perform in general when applied to predict under independent conditions with the training of the estimator the dataset in this validation was randomly shuffled and split into five unique groups each group was used as a test dataset and the remaining groups were used as the training dataset fig 7 shows the randomly shuffled test and training dataset of 5 folds which indicates the training and test datasets in white and black respectively using these datasets the training and test scores of r2 and their standard deviations were estimated according to the number of clusters as shown in fig 7 a both the training and test performances were best with two clusters with 1 of the standard deviation of cross applicability the evaluation using the rmse showed a similar result the test score was best with 2 4 clusters and the average rmse was 12 ppm with a standard deviation of 2 ppm fig 7b in addition the learning rate of cmr ov was more rapid with increased clusters fig 7c therefore the amount of training data for each model was more influential in the learning rate than in the number of clusters consequently the cmr ov showed competent performance in the cross applicability test 5 field application 5 1 analysis of in situ data 5 1 1 flow dynamics table 3 shows the characteristic parameters of the flow suspended sediment and water quality averaged from cross sectionally measured values in two to three upstream sections of the confluence in the two surveys in survey 1 the difference in flow variables between the hwang river and nakdong river was larger than in survey 2 as indicated by the velocity ratio ur momentum ratio mr and discharge ratio qr in addition to such hydraulic differences at the upstream sections of confluence the morphological difference between the two surveys fig 3 resulted in substantial discrepancies in the flow patterns and dynamics of the suspended sediment in survey 1 the large sandbar in the stagnation zone separats the flow from the induced wake flow therefore the mixing layer was irregular similar to the wake behind an obstacle as shown in the photograph of survey 1 fig 2a in contrast the mixing layer was more regular in survey 2 because the sandbar in the stagnation zone of the nakdong river was eroded and submerged under a high water depth the density difference between the two rivers at the confluence can be a critical factor for hydrodynamic conditions and mixing states because it can distort the interface between water from the main river and the tributary gualtieri et al 2019 horna munoz et al 2020 van rooijen et al 2020 therefore in this study the relative density difference δρ was calculated from the measured water temperature and ssc using eq 8 ford and johnson 1983 to consider the effect of suspended sediments on water density 8 δ ρ ssc s s c 1 1 sg 10 3 where s g is the specific gravity of the suspended sediment assumed to be the typical value of sediment equal to 2 65 the densimetric froude number frd was also calculated using δρ to investigate the contribution of the inertial and buoyancy forces as follows 9 f r d u δ ρ g h 1 2 where g denotes the gravitational acceleration δρ varies seasonally ranging from o 10 5 in winter to o 10 3 in summer gualtieri et al 2019 2018 the densimetric froude number indicates that inertial forces dominate over unity f r d 1 gualtieri et al 2019 horna munoz et al 2020 therefore the density contrast was relatively weak in all surveys according to these criteria the flow characteristics were investigated in depth to understand the mixing pattern in the river confluence because large scale coherent structures from merged flows such as secondary flows and velocity instabilities wake or kelvin helmholtz substantially contribute to the transverse mixing of the suspended sediment in a river confluence biron et al 2019 constantinescu et al 2016 in survey 1 the velocity fields and bathymetry profiles were measured and analyzed at 9 cross sections as shown in figs 8 and 9 at the upstream sections of the confluence the bathymetry is considerably distorted because of the sandbar near the stagnation zone in nr1 and 2 accordingly the main flow velocity develops near the left bank in nr3 two strong flows from the nakdong and hwang rivers ur 0 864 merged downstream of the stagnation zone sandbar which was acting as an obstacle therefore a deficit in the depth averaged velocity occurred owing to the merging boundary layers of the two river flows this velocity deficit in the near field of confluence suggests that wake vortices should be generated and were shedding from the velocity deficit zone into the downstream flow konsoer and rhoads 2014 sukhodolov et al 2022 likewise a velocity deficit zone was developed at the same location of the mixing layer with billows as shown in the photograph of survey 1 fig 8 a the low velocity in this zone could limit the sediment mixing near the mixing layer velocity vector plot in y z plane showed that dual counter rotating secondary flow cells were developed on both sides of the velocity deficit zone at section nr3 owing to the flow curvature and bed discordance fig 9 a here in the downstream sections of the sandbar at the stagnation zone and the inlet of the tributary substantial bed discordance induced upwelling motions with secondary flows this confirms previous reports where the upwelling flows can occur near the confluence due to bed discordance de serres et al 1999 moradi et al 2019 in nr4 the pair of secondary flows became stronger as the velocity deficit zone decreased these secondary flows are noteworthy because they would inhibit the mixing processes in the post confluence channel xu et al 2022 at subsequent sections nr5 7 complex flow structures still developed at a mixing interface even though the velocity deficit zone almost recovered further downstream nr8 9 secondary current cells dissipated gradually because the momentum of the tributary flow was relatively weak mr 0 142 then the merging effect on the flow dynamics tended to disappear in survey 2 dual counter rotating secondary flows were also developed at nr2 fig 9b however the secondary flows were weaker than those in survey 1 owing to the low velocity magnitude of incoming flows from the nakdong and hwang rivers fig 8b in addition the bathymetry was less distorted in survey 1 particularly the sandbar near the stagnation zone in nr1 and 2 fig 2b the sandbar area in the stagnation zone which was very shallow in survey 1 was eroded and completely submerged in survey 2 the water depth in this area was approximately 2 m as indicated by the cross sectional velocity distribution in nr1 fig 9b subsequently a velocity deficit was generated at nr2 when the two flows with similar velocity magnitudes merged after the confluence nevertheless the velocity deficit was minimal and rapidly recovered at nr3 270 m downstream from the confluence apex owing to the submerged sandbar low velocity magnitude and weak momentum of the tributary flow mr 0 189 this result reveals that the wake effect was not profound from the weak velocity deficit in survey 2 which is consistent with the photograph fig 3b although the velocity ratio was close to unity ur 0 94 accordingly the flows from the two rivers interacted near the mixing layer as shown in the cross sectional velocity field of nr3 however the flow structure recovered at nr4 downstream 450 m from the confluence apex here the secondary flows and wake developed weakly and then dissipated rapidly compared to those in survey 1 owing to the weaker dual counter rotating secondary flow and wake effect the two water bodies consisting of different colors mixed rapidly as shown in the photograph of survey 2 in fig 3 b 5 1 2 sediment dynamics the field survey results showed that ssc and particle size contrast were noticeable between the main river and tributary because of different hydrodynamic conditions and mixing layers owing to the discrepancy in sscv between the two rivers especially in survey 1 the color difference between the two rivers was clearly observed as shown in the aerial images fig 3 moreover there was an apparent difference in the particle size of the suspended sediment between the nakdong and hwang rivers in survey 1 relatively large particles d50 167 47 µm were transported from upstream of nakdong river whereas the particle size of hwang river was relatively fine d50 81 52 µm however in survey 2 the difference of d50 between the two rivers was not so big showing 50 36 µm for the nakdong river and 39 16 µm for the hwang river respectively vertical mixing of the suspended sediment at the confluence was analyzed using the vertical profiles of ssc and psd measured at section nr5 in survey 1 as the flow structure changed abruptly and the mixing layer developed strongly in this section as shown in fig 8 a vertical mixing was enhanced by the secondary current developed in this section even though the dual counter rotating secondary flows inhibited the sediment mixing in the transverse direction xu et al 2022 as shown in fig 10 a the vertical distribution of the sscv was generally uniform except for the concentration near the riverbed which can be inferred as the bed load this result also revealed that the stratification effect was weak owing to the low difference in density between the two rivers in addition as shown in fig 10 b the fraction of fine clay d 2 µm was highest near the right bank which originated from the hwang river this clay was distributed throughout the water depth of the hwang river with silt d 20 µm and was entrained into the nakdong river after confluence at section nr5 the waterbody from the nakdong river and hwang river had completely different psds near the mixing layer as a boundary after confluence and these heterogeneous psds near the mixing layer increased the spectral variability in the hyperspectral image analysis in survey 2 the vertical profiles of ssc and psd measured at section nr3 were analyzed because the mixing interface was developed in this section unlike the uniform ssc profiles of survey 1 the vertical sscv distributions near the mixing layer showed nonuniform profiles which appeared to be close to the theoretical profile of rouse 1937 as shown in fig 11 a the figure shows that the concentration was high at the riverbed and decreased slowly near the water surface this nonuniform profile was generated because the vertical mixing due to the secondary current was weaker in this section than in survey 1 at the right bank of nr3 where the flow was entrained from the hwang river a substantial concentration difference was observed between the water surface and riverbed this was induced by the discrepancy in the psd near the surface and riverbed as shown in fig 11 b suspended fine matter d 2 µm was distributed near the water surface only at the left bank this fine matter originated from the hwang river these particles floated on the surface imparting a green color to the water body in the rgb image fig 3b despite the low chl a and cyanobacteria cell counts in survey 2 as mentioned above this variability in suspended matter with sediment and various vertical sscv profiles substantially caused the strong spectral variability in hyperspectral image analysis 5 2 application of cmr ov to the river confluence 5 2 1 classification of river regions using hyperspectral clustering using the hsi acquired in the two surveys hyperspectral clustering was applied to classify two water bodies at the river confluence the hsi acquired in survey 1 was separated into two clusters as shown in fig 12 a these clusters were precisely classified as the water bodies of the nakdong and hwang rivers with a mixing layer in between however the sandbar area of the nakdong river located in the stagnation zone near the confluence junction is included in cluster 2 hence the optical characteristics of this area were similar to those of the hwang river because the reflectance of the sand bottom was dominant and the water column effect was negligible because of the shallow water depth h 1 m in addition the result of the apparent classification demonstrated that both rivers have distinct optical characteristics and flows from two rivers at the near field of the confluence do not mix well the averaged hyperspectral spectrum of each cluster also had different profiles as shown in fig 12 b and c although the sscv of nakdong river was higher than that of hwang river the reflectance was the opposite hwang river showed higher reflectance owing to the high contribution of the scattering effect from fine sediment particles and bottom reflectance by shallow water depth this result conflicts with the previously reported idea that the sscv and reflectance are positively correlated binding et al 2005 montanher et al 2014 pereira et al 2019 qu et al 2016 umar et al 2018 fig 13 shows the values of sscv d50 and water quality parameters turbidity water temperature ph and electronic conductivity ec from hyperspectral clusters both clusters showed different characteristics and these values were similar to the in situ measured values in addition the hyperspectral clustering results were compared to clustering using suspended sediment measured in situ and water quality parameters when the in situ measured data were divided into two clusters fig 14 b the patterns of the two clusters were almost identical to the hyperspectral clustering results except for the sand bar area fig 14 a furthermore even when these clusters were divided into three and four the results were more finely divided within the two hyperspectral clusters as indicated in fig 14 c and d this result reveals that hyperspectral clustering can classify water characteristics differences without water quality information and can simplify the variability of optical and sediment water characteristics of river confluences using hyperspectral imagery in survey 2 the contrasts of sscv and turbidity between the two rivers were 5 39 ppm and 1 02 ntu table 2 owing to these contrasts hyperspectral clustering apparently separated the hsi of the river confluence into two water bodies of both rivers as two clusters fig 15 a similarly the average wavelengths of the divided clusters had significantly different values however the wavelength in the red edge region 700 800 nm which is highly correlated with the intrinsic spectral characteristics of the sediment showed similar reflectance for both rivers spectral bands in other wavelength regions showed relatively high values for the hwang river with a low sscv these results are identical to those of survey 1 in the case of survey 1 the downstream part of the confluence was divided into two parts forming the mixing layer in between but in survey 2 the area of the hwang river after the confluence point was very small the two clusters were divided without a clear mixing layer as in survey 1 because mixing occurred actively after confluence and the tributary inflow did not significantly affect the spectral characteristics of the mainstream therefore the spectral characteristics were more clearly divided than in survey 1 indicating the degree of mixing of the confluence to some extent fig 16 presents the values of the water quality parameters for both hyperspectral clusters this result demonstrates that differences in water quality can be well classified from hyperspectral clusters according to survey 1 consequently hyperspectral clustering is a competent method to classify river confluence regardless of the information on sediment water quality characteristics furthermore it can be used as a practical process to resolve the spectral variability of river confluence 5 2 2 retrievals of sscv map based on the hyperspectral clusters the trained rf models in cmr ov were applied to retrieve the sscv distribution at the confluence of the hwang and nakdong rivers under two different conditions fig 17 presents the mapping results of survey 1 as shown in this figure a high concentration occurred in the nakdong river although the tributary appeared more turbid in the actual rgb image fig 17a the reflectance of the hyperspectral spectrum in the nakdong river with high sscv was low whereas the reflectivity of the hwang river with low sscv was high owing to spectral variability in addition the water depth of the sandbar area in the stagnation zone near the confluence apex was less than 1 m which induced a substantial contribution from the bottom reflectance despite this bottom effect cmr ov can control it by separating this area from the hyperspectral clustering as shown in fig 17 c in terms of mixing layer retrievals irregular interfacial billows were generated at the mixing layer in survey 1 owing to the complex flow condition at the near field of confluence fig 17 clearly demonstrates that the hyperspectral retrievals reproduced the mixing layer shown in the rgb image of fig 3 a more precisely than the sscv map interpolated from the in situ measured data notably detailed measured data from hyperspectral retrievals at the mixing layer can be expected to enhance the capability of analyzing confluence dynamics remote sensing techniques generally retrieve the surface concentration owing to the strong absorbance of light in the water column balasubramanian et al 2020 umar et al 2018 however a value close to the average concentration can be obtained in shallow waters kwon et al 2022b suspended sediment signals can be received up to the riverbed at depths of 2 m or less if the bottom signal is well controlled albert and mobley 2003 lee et al 1999 in this respect the sscv retrieved from the cmr ov showed good agreement with the depth averaged sscv profile from in situ measurements at section nr 5 as shown in fig 18 a in this figure the transverse distance y is from the left bank of the nakdong river the estimated transverse profile of sscv revealed a steep concentration gradient within the mixing layer in the general mixing phenomenon at confluence the concentration gradient within the mixing layer tends to decrease owing to the shear effect jung et al 2019 lewis and rhoads 2015 pouchoulin et al 2020 however in this case a poor mixing pattern was observed in the sscv map owing to the dual counter rotating secondary flows and wake effect which resulted in hydraulic analysis the site specific problem of remote sensing in a water environment is the most critical issue dethier et al 2020 kabir and ahmari 2020 liu et al 2003 montanher et al 2014 pyo et al 2019 the dataset collected in survey 2 was not used as a training dataset table 2 thus the performance of cmr ov in the uncalibrated case was evaluated using this dataset fig 18 b presents a comparison between the depth averaged in situ measured sscv and the retrieved sscv in section nr 3 in survey 2 this figure shows a reasonable agreement between the hyperspectral retrievals and in situ data moreover although the fine suspended matter was distributed in the water from the hwang river on the surface as shown in fig 8 hyperspectral retrievals by cmr ov detected suspended sediment below the water surface and showed a result close to the depth averaged sscv fig 19 depicts the spatial distribution of sscv retrieved by cmr ov showing the mixing pattern of suspended sediment with sscv contrast in survey 2 unlike survey 1 the mixing layer was not clearly seen after the confluence even though the contrast of sscv between the two rivers before the confluence was clearly seen in the retrieved map this means that the mixing layer disappeared rapidly owing to strong transverse mixing between the two water bodies while transverse mixing was suppressed by the dual counter rotating secondary flows in the case of survey 1 5 2 3 analysis of mixing pattern using sscv map as shown in the sscv map retrieved from hsi the mixing patterns of both surveys were quite different especially near the mixing layer fig 20 shows the transverse sscv profiles at nr3 nr8 in survey 1 the concentration gradient of the mixing layer tended to decrease with longitudinal distance from the confluence apex since the incoming suspended sediment flux from the two rivers was mixed transversely notably the wake effect from the velocity deficit induced irregular ssc curves near the mixing layer which was consistent with the irregular billows in the ssc map as shown in fig 17 c the low velocity within the velocity deficit zone causes a local concentration hump to inhibit the transverse mixing in contrast as shown in fig 21 the transverse sscv profiles in survey 2 indicated that an irregular concentration hump did not occur and the concentration gradient was quickly smoothed by transverse mixing downstream of the confluence this figure showed that transverse mixing was almost complete within the near field x 1 10 the results of the two cases indicated that the dual counter rotating secondary flows and wake effect substantially affected the transverse mixing even though vertical mixing was accelerated owing to the strong secondary current in survey 1 fig 10 the variance calculated from the transverse distribution of the sscv for surveys 1 and 2 is plotted against the longitudinal distance in fig 22 this figure shows that for both surveys the variance increases linearly along the longitudinal distance r2 of the linear regression curves were 0 93 and 0 86 in surveys 1 and 2 respectively the slope of the linear regression curve of survey 2 was almost twice as large as that of survey 1 indicating that transverse mixing occurred more quickly in the case of survey 2 with a weak dual counter rotating secondary flow and wake effect in this study from the slope of the variance versus the longitudinal distance dt was estimated using the moment method eq 7 and the results are summarized in table 4 because the velocity was faster in survey 1 than in survey 2 table 3 the difference in the dt was lower than the difference in the variance slopes of the two cases the dimensionless transverse mixing coefficient values d t h u for both cases were over unity which means that the transverse mixing strongly occurred as much as sharply curved channels ranging from 1 to 3 as suggested by rutherford 1994 the results of this study revealed that the mixing rate varies considerably depending on the velocity and morphology even when the discharge conditions are similar however more substantial mixing could occur more strongly in river confluences if enhancing factors such as a single secondary flow are present instead of confounding factors such as wakes or dual counter rotating helical cells pouchoulin et al 2020 6 future research and applicability this study analyzed mixing patterns at a river confluence using high resolution hyperspectral imagery to obtain a precise ssc map uav based hyperspectral imaging provides images with a resolution of less than 10 cm and a high spectral resolution of 4 nm intervals therefore this approach can be used for the precise measurement of various physical quantities in water environments such as organic matter algal blooms chemicals and water depth gwon et al 2023 legleiter and harrison 2019 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 precise mixing analysis using satellite imagery with a spatial resolution of 10 m or more is challenging however satellite imagery offers wider spatial coverage fortunately recent launches of hyperspectral satellites e g hyperion on nasa s earth observing 1 satellite and chris on esa s proba 1 which provide more spectral information than multispectral satellites offer the potential for accurate monitoring of a wider area rast and painter 2019 by applying the spectral model from uav based images to satellite images the reliability of the remote sensing model can be improved which will also aid in wide monitoring at the basin scale in terms of mixing analysis it is very challenging to obtain depth averaged information from remote sensing based measurements as shown by the tendency to underestimate ssc in the deep water area in survey 2 in deeper rivers the focus of ssc estimation is on surface concentration moreover stratification has a substantial influence on mixing at the river confluence gualtieri et al 2019 xu et al 2022 but the hyperspectral approach is limited in this regard nevertheless analysis of three dimensional mixing would be possible based on more precise measurements by combining the hyperspectral approach and adcp based ssc measurement techniques which are advantageous for vertical concentration distribution estimation sassi et al 2013 simmons et al 2020 szupiany et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 in future research the drawbacks of adcp based measurements such as the existence of unmeasured points and difficulty in measuring surface concentration should be addressed by combining them with hyperspectral measurements to analyze a three dimensional ssc field 7 conclusions in this study detailed mixing patterns of suspended sediment in the river confluence were analyzed using high resolution ssc maps obtained from hyperspectral retrievals cluster based ml regression was applied to two cases where suspended sediment mixing occurred at the confluence of the nakdong and hwang rivers through the hyperspectral approach the spectral characteristics according to the water body characteristics of the confluence were analyzed and the ssc map was retrieved to investigate the transverse mixing dynamics of suspended sediment downstream of the river confluence the main findings of this study are as follows 1 hyperspectral clustering classifies the waterbody regions of the main river and tributary based on spectral characteristics in particular we confirmed that mixing occurred rapidly and slowly from the distribution of clusters after confluence in addition hyperspectral clustering showed similar results to clustering based on the water quality factors this result indicates that we could determine the mixing trend after the river confluence using only hyperspectral imagery 2 based on hyperspectral clustering rf regressors can retrieve the highly spectrally complex phenomena of the two cases at the river confluence in the first case turbidity and ssc were inversely proportional because of a highly turbid flow with fine matter and sediment laden flows with large sand particles merged at the confluence in the second case a tributary flowed with fine suspended solids on the surface and suspended sediment in the water column in both cases despite the spectral variability the retrieved ssc values showed good agreement with the depth averaged ssc from the in situ measurements in addition the transverse gradient of the sscv near the mixing layer was reproduced well using the hyperspectral approach 3 the complex spatial distribution of ssc was estimated in greater detail but this was difficult to reproduce using conventional measurements continuous variance distributions of both cases in this study were extracted from the high resolution ssc maps the variance distribution not only revealed the detailed mixing features but was also used as input data for the estimation of the transverse mixing coefficient from the moment method 4 the mixing coefficient in survey 1 was approximately 40 lower than that in survey 2 this result showed that the key factors for the difference in mixing patterns were the wake and dual counter rotating helical flows even though both surveys were conducted under similar discharge conditions 5 in survey 1 a substantial velocity deficit occurred behind a large sandbar near the stagnation zone and then induced complex wake flows as visualized by the color difference between the tributary and the main river this phenomenon locally delayed mixing within the velocity deficit zone therefore the ssc variance decreased owing to irregular sscv changes near the mixing layer in the transverse sscv profiles the dual counter rotating secondary flows also significantly limited the sediment mixing across the post confluence sections the interface between both secondary flows acted as a barrier for transverse mixing along the velocity deficit and mixing layers 6 the averaged velocity magnitudes of the main river and tributary were more similar in survey 2 ur 0 95 than in survey 1 ur 0 86 despite this the wake and dual counter rotating helical flows were weak in survey 2 because erosion of the sandbar at the stagnation zone leading to an increased mixing rate considering the type of abnormal mixing found in this study the hyperspectral based measurement presented in this study can effectively estimate the mixing coefficient with higher reliability this study demonstrated the advantages of the hyperspectral approach for investigating suspended sediment mixing in river confluences high resolution hyperspectral imagery based ssc measurement is a substantial supplement when high resolution ssc data are required such as at river confluences and meandering streams therefore the hyperspectral approach proposed in this study may provide insight into the complex mixing processes in riverine systems credit authorship contribution statement siyoon kwon

1964,the hysteretic relationship between the water level and the inundated area is one of the basic non linear characteristics of lake hydrology however it is difficult to obtain this relationship accurately especially for large floodplain lakes that exhibit time varying boundaries with rapid water level fluctuations taking the largest lake floodplain system of the yangtze river basin poyang lake and its extremely productive wetland as an example we investigated the spatial temporal variation of the stage area hysteretic relationship in large heterogeneous lake floodplain systems by adopting the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflection fusion model estarfm based on the observed water levels and reconstructed high spatial temporal resolution inundation datasets using multi source remote sensing data the major results indicate that the inundation dynamics in the regions of the main lake and seasonal floodplain lakes are remarkably inconsistent concerning the inundation behavior of the river and lake floodplain a conceptual model was established to explain the formation mechanism of the counter clockwise and clockwise stage area hysteretic relationships in the poyang lake floodplain system further investigation revealed that seasonal lakes exist widely in floodplain settings and have a crucial impact on increasing the hysteresis of upstream stations and decreasing that of downstream stations the magnitude and direction of the stage area hysteretic relationships varied with time in a changingenvironment this study extends the understanding of the complexity of hydrological behavior in large heterogeneous lake floodplain systems which is of vital importance for lake water resources and ecological management keywords inundation dynamics stage area hysteretic relationship hysteresis seasonal lakes remote sensing poyang lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hysteresis is a non linear phenomenon characterized by a non unique relationship between two variables under cyclic variation ewing 1885 norbiato and borga 2008 the relationship curve often forms a closed loop because of the different changes in the directions and paths of the variables hydrological hysteresis is widely observed in various hydrological processes such as soil moisture retention during wetting and drying cycles zhang et al 2009 saturated soil water content and subsurface flow during hillslope runoff events norbiato and borga 2008 and river stage discharge rating curves fread 2007 ajmera and goyal 2012 wolfs and willems 2014 sun et al 2021 the hysteretic relationship between the water level and the inundated area is one of the basic characteristics of lake hydrology however compared to unsaturated zones and riverine situations studies on stage area hysteresis in lake hydrology are limited particularly in large lakes with extensive seasonal floodplain areas zhang and werner 2015 such lakes usually have complex hydrological and hydrodynamic processes and large water level fluctuations throughout the year which makes it difficult to monitor changes in inundated areas li et al 2019a a common method for obtaining inundated areas of hydrological systems is to perform numerical simulations using physically based models koponen et al 2005 lai et al 2012 tan et al 2022 however studies have pointed out that for shallow floodplain lakes with significant time varying water levels significant uncertainties may exist in the numerical simulation owing to difficulties in defining lake boundaries bathymetric variations human disturbance and unconsidered groundwater recharging discharging li et al 2014 tan et al 2019 in addition numerical models usually have complex structures strict requirements for boundary conditions and large basic data requirements which limit their application to long term continuous modeling in areas with insufficient data with the rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology multiple sources of remote sensing data have provided important information for inundation monitoring of terrestrial water surfaces in recent years feng et al 2012 pekel et al 2016 however owing to high spatiotemporal heterogeneity it remains a challenge to capture rapid changes in surface water with fine spatiotemporal resolution in those floodplain lakes ye et al 2019 tan et al 2019 for these lakes remote sensing data with high spatial resolutions e g 30 m of landsat series are normally limited in their value for detecting rapid changes in the water surface due to the long revisit cycles of satellites frequent cloud contamination and other poor atmospheric conditions zhu et al 2010 however satellite remote sensing images with short temporal intervals e g eight days of the modis series do not capture the spatial details of the water surface because of the relatively low spatial resolution 250 m 500 m and 1000 m cheng et al 2020 in this regard some studies have proposed spatiotemporal fusion technology for remote sensing data e g zhu et al 2010 2016 chen et al 2018 by combining the advantages of medium and high spatial resolution remote sensing images with those of high temporal resolution remote sensing images remote sensing images with high spatiotemporal resolution can be obtained providing a technical guarantee for the study of inundation dynamics in heterogeneous floodplain lakes tan et al 2019 located on the south bank of the middle lower yangtze river poyang lake is one of the two large lakes that remain naturally connected to the yangtze river it is a typical shallow water carrying lake that plays an irreplaceable ecological service function the most notable feature of the lake is its high water level fluctuations resulting in a large floodplain adjacent to the main lake in which interconnected seasonal lakes are widely distributed li et al 2019a zhang and werner 2015 first explored the hysteresis relationships between the inundated area water storage and water level of this lake floodplain system using a physically based hydrodynamic model mike 21 zhang et al 2017 further revealed a three phase hydrological regime in stage flow relationships that assisted in developing an improved physical interpretation of stage area hysteretic relationships these pioneering studies have highlighted the significance of hysteresis in floodplain lakes and the development of management models the reported large uncertainties in water surface simulations from previous studies e g li et al 2014 tan et al 2019 call for the use of more accurate high spatial temporal resolution remote sensing data in the investigation of water inundation dynamics and potential hydrological hysteresis in floodplain lakes furthermore the stage area hysteretic relationships may change in the context of climate change and human impacts which have not been adequately considered in previous studies the variability and causes of the stage area hysteretic relationships in the poyang lake floodplain system remain to be explored this study aims to address these gaps specifically the objectives of this study are 1 to examine the inundation dynamics of the water surface and its spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the poyang lake floodplain system by reconstructing high spatiotemporal resolution 30 m 8 day inundated water surface data from 2000 to 2018 2 to generalize the formation mechanism of stage area hysteretic relationships and reveal the effect of seasonal lakes in the floodplain and 3 to explore the interannual variability and causes of stage area hysteretic relationships in recent years this study would greatly improve the understanding of the hydrological regimes of large floodplain lakes and promote management practices for shallow lake ecosystems 2 study area overview the poyang lake n28 24 29 46 e115 49 116 46 is the largest freshwater lake in china fig 1 a the lake receives upstream runoff mainly from five tributary rivers ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui and is discharged directly into the yangtze river after regulation and storage fig 1b the outline of the lake is similar to a gourd shape wide in the south and long and narrow in the north the lake catchment covering a drainage area of 162 225 km2 belongs to a subtropical monsoon climate zone with an average annual temperature of 17 5 c and average annual precipitation of 1665 mm the hydrological regime of poyang lake is affected by both catchment inflow and the yangtze river discharge and the water level fluctuates significantly throughout the year fig 1c 1d the lake water surface can expand to 4 000 km2 in the summer wet season july september and shrink to less than 500 km2 in the winter dry season december february showing the typical hydrological characteristics of an ocean during the flood season and a stream during the dry season this huge seasonal fluctuation in lake water surface inundation creates an extensive wetland ecosystem across the floodplain region of some 3 000 km2 zhang and werner 2015 shallow floodplains provide an excellent place for the reproduction of various animals and plants as well as a transfer station for many wintering migratory birds li et al 2019c bounded by the songmen mountain the northern lake is narrow and dominated by water channels whereas the southern lake is flat and broad where extensive floodplains have developed fig 1b in floodplain regions seasonal shallow and small lakes with sizes ranging from 1 km2 to 71 km2 are distinctive hydrological units the total water surface area of these seasonal lakes is approximately 767 km2 tan et al 2020 according to the periphery of the seasonal lakes the entire poyang lake floodplain system can be roughly divided into two regions the main lake and seasonal floodplain lakes topographically the lake bottom varies from floodplain areas of 30 m to flow channels of approximately 8 m yellow sea datum china the bottom elevation of most seasonal lakes varies from 12 to 13 m which is almost higher than that of the main lake because of the changes in hydrologic connectivity throughout the year the floodplains and their seasonal lakes can be partly or fully coupled to the main lake at high water levels during the summer months june october but become isolated at low water levels during the winter months december february li et al 2019b 3 data and method 3 1 data the observed daily lake water levels during 2000 2018 were measured at five hydrostations hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan across poyang lake daily runoff during the same period was recorded from seven hydro stations qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng of the five rivers in the poyang lake catchment among the seven hydro stations waizhou lijiadu and meigang were located at the downstream outlets of the ganjiang fuhe and xinjiang rivers respectively whereas the hushan and dukengfeng wanjiabu and qiujin stations were located at the branches of the raohe and xiushui rivers respectively in addition runoff data from the hankou hydro station were collected to represent discharge from the upper middle yangtze river the period of daily runoff at the hankou hydro station was 2000 2012 whereas that of annual runoff was from 2000 to 2018 all hydrological data were provided by the jiangxi hydrological bureau and the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission the total drainage area controlled by the seven hydrostations in the poyang lake catchment is 137 143 km2 which is 25 082 km2 smaller than the entire poyang lake catchment in this study the total inflow to the entire poyang lake catchment was calculated using a simple scaling method based on the ratio of the gauged area to the total area the remote sensing image data used in this study included landsat series including tm etm and oli from 2000 to 2018 downloaded from http glovis usgs gov and modis surface reflectance data series on the nasa terra platform mod09a1 downloaded from http reverb echo nasa gov table 1 landsat data have a spatial resolution of 30 m and a temporal resolution of 16 d owing to the influence of cloud cover the availability of landsat data is greatly reduced during the study period 275 landsat data sets were obtained the mod09a1 dataset is a composite product of the 500 m surface reflectance of modis data every eight days a total of 46 images were captured each year in total 847 modis images were obtained during the study period all the acquired landsat and modis data were of good quality before application all the image data were subjected to standardized preprocessing on the envi platform including projection transformation radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction 3 2 water surface extraction the normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 was used to determine the lake water area this index was constructed by calculating the ratio of the strong and weak reflection bands and combining it with a certain threshold to extract water information using the following formula 1 n d w i d n g r e e n d n n i r d n g r e e n d n n i r where dn nir and dn green indicate the digital number dn values in the nir near infrared and green bands of remote sensing imagery respectively generally the acquired ndwi ranges from 1 to 1 water features have positive values whereas soil and terrestrial vegetation features have zero or negative values mcfeeters 1996 based on the calculated ndwi images the inundation and non inundation areas could be distinguished by setting two different values for the ndwi across the lake floodplain the inundation area i e ndwi with positive values was set to 1 and the non inundation area i e ndwi with zero or negative values was set to 0 3 3 estarfm fusion framework the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model estarfm was applied to reconstruct continuous remote sensing image data with high temporal and spatial resolution estarfm is a data fusion method based on a moving window that considers the auxiliary information obtained from adjacent pixels with similar spectra and the weights of these pixels themselves zhu et al 2010 the estarfm model fuses and reconstructs landsat images of the current day lp through a modis image mp and landsat la lb and modis ma mb images of at least two stages before and after the simulation date the details of the principle of the model can be found in zhu et al 2010 a flowchart of the estarfm fusion process is shown in fig 2 it should be noted that there are two fusion schemes bi blend then index and ib index then blend abdollah et al 2014 which differ in the fusion order a previous study by kai 2018 indicated that compared to the bi scheme the ib scheme can weaken the speckle phenomenon caused by cloud interference and can better reflect the fine texture characteristics of real features therefore the ib scheme was selected for image fusion in this study the input data in the fusion model were the calculated ndwi data images this study reconstructed the missing ndwi data of 667 images from 2000 to 2018 using the estarfm model and formed a continuous high spatial temporal resolution 8d 30 m ndwi dataset since 2000 the inundated areas of the real landsat and estarfm fused images were subtracted to verify the accuracy statistical analyses showed that the average accuracy of the fused image data in calculating water ndwi was 92 7 with reference to real landsat data 3 4 measurement of hysteresis the degree of stage area hysteresis was quantified by calculating the loop area of the stage area relationship curve norbiato and borga 2008 zhang and werner 2015 firstly both the lake water level and area were normalized and then the loop area was calculated as the dimensionless hysteresis η using the following formula 2 h t h t h min h max h min 3 a t a t a min a max a min 4 η 0 1 a r h d h 1 0 a f h d h where h is the observed lake water level m at a specific station and a is the corresponding lake water surface km 2 at time t the subscripts of m i n and m a x represent the minimum and maximum values from time series of h and a h and a are the normalized variables of lake stage and inundated water surface η is the degree of hysteresis the subscripts r and f represent the rising and falling stages of the loop of the stage area hysteretic curve respectively the bigger the hysteresis η the larger the loop of the stage area curve and the greater the fluctuation of lake inundation and vice versa 4 results 4 1 intra annual variation in the lake inundated area the inundated water surface of poyang lake exhibited clear seasonal fluctuations fig 3 on average the inundated area of the lake increased steadily from january to june peaking in july subsequently it gradually decreased over subsequent months during the past 19 years the maximum inundation was approximately 3000 km2 whereas the minimum inundation area was less than 600 km2 the lake surface area varied seasonally with a maximum in october 2400 km2 and a minimum in july 990 km2 lower variability in the lake water surface mainly occurred during the winter dry season and summer flood season during this time the inundated area of the lake typically reached an extreme value and changed only slightly in contrast larger variability usually occurred in the spring season april and may when the lake water surface expanded rapidly and in the autumn season when the lake surface shrank quickly september and october statistics show that the average annual inundated areas in the main lake and floodplain seasonal lakes are 1232 km2 and 392 km2 respectively although both had similar seasonal fluctuations throughout the year the inundation of the seasonal floodplain lakes differed from that of the main lake in certain months as shown by the gray area in fig 4 when the inundated area of the main lake showed an increasing trend at the end of march a decreasing trend was observed in the regions of the seasonal lake in addition during the recession period of poyang lake in october the inundated area in the seasonal lake decreased rapidly and maintained a stable and slow decline subsequently while the rapid decline of the inundated area in the main lake from october continued until november 4 2 stage area hysteretic relationships the non linear characteristics of the lake water level stage and surface area inundated area relationship in the poyang lake floodplain system were prominent and showed clear spatial differences two different directions of stage area hysteretic relationships existed in the poyang lake floodplain system fig 5 clockwise hysteresis was observed at the hukou xingzi and duchang stations which are mainly located downstream and in the center of the lake whereas counter clockwise hysteresis was apparent for the tangyin and kangshan stations upstream of the lake this relationship was most prominent for lake water levels below 14 m at the hukou and xingzi stations and between 13 m and 16 m at the tangyin and kangshan stations the counterclockwise and clockwise stage area hysteretic relationships of the upstream and downstream stations are further reflected in the statistical differences in lake water levels during the rising and recession periods the average water levels during the rising period at the hukou xingzi and duchang stations were lower than those during the recession period whereas the opposite was observed at the tangyin and kangshan stations table 2 the calculated hysteresis in fig 5f indicates the degree of stage area hysteretic relationships i e the degree of nonlinearity at different stations among the five stations the hysteresis of the kangshan station in the southernmost part of the lake was the largest followed by the hukou xingzi and tangyin stations the duchang station in the center of the lake had the smallest hysteresis as noted in previous studies that the volume of seasonal floodplain lakes accounted for a small part of the whole poyang lake in both the high 3 5 1 9 and low 5 6 2 0 water level periods li et al 2019b tan et al 2020 on this basis the influence of seasonal floodplain lakes on lake stage area hysteretic relationships can be preliminarily evaluated by comparing the stage area hysteretic relationships for the entire poyang lake floodplain and the main lake region without considering the hydraulic connection between seasonal lakes and the main lake as shown in fig 5 the hollow line loops for the main lake at all stations shifted downward to the right without considering the inundated area in the seasonal lake region for downstream stations hukou xingzi and duchang the stage area hysteresis increased while it decreased for the upstream stations tangyin and kangshan which is evident from the calculated η in fig 5 for all stations the relative impact of seasonal lakes on the stage area hysteresis was most prominent at tangyin 4 3 interannual variability the stage area hysteresis of poyang lake changed over time fig 6 shows the calculated hysteresis of the five stations in three different periods before and after the multi stage experimental impoundment of the three gorges project it can be seen from the figure that during 2000 2003 the hysteresis of the stage area relationship at xingzi station was the smallest and it increased in turn from duchang tangyin and kangshan along the south lake the hukou hysteresis at the north end of the lake was greater than that at the xingzi and duchang stations a clockwise hysteretic relationship was observed at hukou and xingzi and a counterclockwise hysteretic relationship was observed at the other three stations in the following period 2004 2009 the hysteresis of the stage area relationship at the hukou xingzi and duchang stations increased significantly and the direction of the hysteretic relationship at the duchang station changed clockwise in contrast the hysteresis at the tangyin and kangshan stations decreased slightly during this period the hysteresis at tangyin station was the smallest among all stations the characteristics of the new stage area hysteretic relationship across the lake emerged from 2010 to 2018 in the former period the hysteresis of the hukou xingzi and duchang stations decreased significantly whereas that of the tangyin and kangshan stations increased significantly during this period the hysteresis of the stage area relationship at duchang station was the smallest 5 discussion lake and river floodplains are special underlying surface systems with periodic alternations of dry and wet conditions caused by flood disturbances globally such floodplains cover an area of approximately 80 220 104 km2 entwistle et al 2019 including the famous river floodplains of the nile and amazon and the lake floodplains of tonle sap lake and poyang lake because of the significant spatial heterogeneity of the underlying surface strong openness of the system and highly dynamic hydrological rhythms water interactions among floodplains inflow rivers and lakes are often complex leading to prominent non linear characteristics of hydrological processes rudorff et al 2014 li et al 2019b our research revealed that within the same open shallow lake floodplain system there are two different directions of stage area hysteretic relationships indicating that the formation mechanisms behind them are completely different the typical lake floodplain system exhibits obvious fluvial facies during the dry season owing to the extensive exposure of floodplains and water flows mainly along specific down cutting channels within the system normally during the rising period of a lake the rapid rise in the water level in the mainstream channel caused by a large amount of upstream catchment inflow leads to overflow to the floodplains on both sides forming a typical overbank inundation in contrast during the lake recession period the floodplain water level was higher and drained into the mainstream channel and downstream these processes are illustrated in the conceptual diagram shown in fig 7 a therefore compared to the rising period the inundated area of the lake was larger during the recession period for a given water level forming a typical counterclockwise stage area hysteretic relationship such as the hysteretic relationship presented at the tangyin and kangshan stations in the poyang lake floodplain system the formation mechanism of this hysteretic relationship is similar to the behavior of river floodplains rudorff et al 2014 and its hysteresis is mainly affected by the upstream discharge along the flow direction in an open lake floodplain system catchment inflow usually enters the floodplain first and then discharges into the main lake however the outflow of the main lake is further affected by the blocking function of its connecting rivers in this study because the peak of the yangtze river discharge was approximately 1 2 months later than that of the poyang lake catchment inflow fig 1d the blocking effect of the yangtze river on the lake outflow was weak in the first half of the year because of the increasing catchment inflow and relatively low water level of the yangtze river at this time the downstream main lake receives water from the floodplains and can be discharged smoothly the water level of the entire lake floodplain is mainly affected by the amount of catchment inflow however when the catchment inflow decreases rapidly after the peak and the yangtze river discharge continues to rise the blocking effect of the yangtze river on lake outflow becomes obvious and subsequently controls the decline in the downstream lake water level hu et al 2007 therefore in contrast to the lake rising period a time lag can be expected for the drainage of the floodplain and the decrease in the downstream lake water level during the lake recession period because of this time lag the slope of the water surface of the entire lake floodplain system is clearly different from that in the lake rising period and a clockwise stage area hysteretic relationship can be obtained fig 7b this clockwise hysteresis is mainly attributed to the floodplain backwater effect in zhang and werner 2015 and can be recognized as a typical hydrological characteristic of the lake floodplain system hydrological processes in large open lake floodplain systems are highly complex and are related to not only the catchment inflow but also the overall hydrological status of the connected rivers in this study changes in the runoff of the lake catchment and the yangtze river as well as the alteration in the lake basin topography were responsible for the interannual variation of stage area hysteretic relationships in the poyang lake floodplain system compared to the period 2000 2003 the mean annual discharge of the hankou station decreased obviously during 2004 2009 fig 8 a in addition the operation of the three gorges project has caused riverbed erosion in the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river ye et al 2020 and sand mining activities in the lake have enlarged the lake outflow cross section lai et al 2014 these factors enhance the outflow capacity of poyang lake especially during the recession period bing et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 lai et al 2014 and shorten the time for catchment inflow to pass through the floodplain and fill the lake this weakened the backwater effect of the floodplain at downstream stations northern main lake area resulting in an obvious reduction in the inundated area during the recession period of the lake and subsequently increasing the stage area hysteresis as the outflow channel along the hukou xingzhou duchang stations deepened and the topographic gradient decreased fig 8b the blocking effect of the yangtze river at the duchang station strengthened this is the main reason why the hysteresis of the stage area relationship at the hukou xingzi and duchang stations increased significantly and why the direction of the hysteretic relationship at the duchang station changed from 2004 to 2009 to for the tangyin and kangshan stations upstream of the lake the stage area hysteretic relationships were more affected by changes in catchment inflow the catchment inflow during 2004 2009 decreased compared with that during 2000 2003 fig 8a thus the hysteresis decreased at the two stations during the period 2010 2018 the average discharge from hankou station increased significantly compared with that during 2004 2009 fig 8a resulting in the enhancement of the blocking effect of the yangtze river and a decrease in the hysteresis at the hukou xingzi and duchang stations similarly the significant increase in catchment inflow during 2010 2018 led to an increase in hysteresis at tangyin and kangshan stations in this study considering the time varying boundary of the water surface of a river lake floodplain system caused by large fluctuations in the water level a technique for reconstructing a high spatial temporal resolution inundation dataset based on multi source remote sensing data and image fusion technology provides an effective way for a detailed examination of the inundation dynamics in these areas for example this study revealed that the inundated areas in the two regions of the main lake and the seasonal floodplain lakes in the poyang lake floodplain system show obvious intra annual variations this result has not been found in previous relevant studies e g feng et al 2012 wu and liu 2015 tan et al 2019 mainly due to the lack of inundation data with high spatial temporal resolution the major reason for this inconsistent intraannual variation is the interference of human activity in floodplain areas in the poyang lake floodplain system many seasonal floodplain lakes have been extensively terraced dammed and farmed by local fishermen during the recession period of the lake to maintain the water surface while being released for fishing before the rapid rise of the lake water level resulting in an abnormal reduction in the water surface wang et al 2016 in addition based on a high spatiotemporal resolution inundation dataset the spatial characteristics of inundation frequency water depth and hydrological connectivity in these floodplain areas can be calculated which are important for the prediction of wetland vegetation change and the evaluation of ecosystem stability finally the reconstructed inundation dataset with high spatiotemporal resolution can also be used as a supplement to the numerical simulation not only to provide accurate water boundary conditions of the complex floodplain areas but also to validate the performance of the hydrodynamic model and improve the model structure the findings of this study extend the understanding of the hydrological complexity of large heterogeneous floodplain systems which have significant implications for relevant floodplain areas worldwide the main and secondary influencing factors of hydrological processes are intertwined and behave differently in different regions resulting in obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the inundation dynamics in these floodplain systems water resource management and ecological protection plans should be treated differently in different regions especially in the floodplains and main lake regions in addition for large heterogeneous floodplain lakes rivers the stage area hysteretic relationship varies with time and location therefore the observed water level at a specific station is not reliable for reflecting or evaluating the inundation dynamics of relevant areas lumped parameter hydrological models that neglect stage area hysteresis have large simulation errors 6 conclusions based on the reconstructed high spatiotemporal resolution inundation data of the poyang lake floodplain system this study revealed that inundated areas in regions of the main lake and adjacent floodplain can present inconsistent intra annual fluctuation both clockwise and counterclockwise stage area hysteretic relationships were observed in the poyang lake floodplain system the downstream stations show clockwise hysteresis whereas the upstream stations show counterclockwise hysteresis stage area hysteresis occurs because asynchronous inflows and outflows create time varying gradients across the floodplain lake complexes during this process floodplain settings where seasonal lakes are widely developed have a crucial impact on the formation and magnitude of hysteresis the magnitude and direction of the stage area hysteretic relationships also changed with time under the impacts of climate change and human activities in the external environment this study highlights the significance of reconstructing high spatiotemporal resolution inundation data based on multi source remote sensing data in floodplain hydrological research a better understanding of the spatiotemporal variation in water inundation and stage area hysteretic relationships provided by this study can be implemented in further research on floodplain areas worldwide credit authorship contribution statement juan wu writing original draft qi zhang

1964,the hysteretic relationship between the water level and the inundated area is one of the basic non linear characteristics of lake hydrology however it is difficult to obtain this relationship accurately especially for large floodplain lakes that exhibit time varying boundaries with rapid water level fluctuations taking the largest lake floodplain system of the yangtze river basin poyang lake and its extremely productive wetland as an example we investigated the spatial temporal variation of the stage area hysteretic relationship in large heterogeneous lake floodplain systems by adopting the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflection fusion model estarfm based on the observed water levels and reconstructed high spatial temporal resolution inundation datasets using multi source remote sensing data the major results indicate that the inundation dynamics in the regions of the main lake and seasonal floodplain lakes are remarkably inconsistent concerning the inundation behavior of the river and lake floodplain a conceptual model was established to explain the formation mechanism of the counter clockwise and clockwise stage area hysteretic relationships in the poyang lake floodplain system further investigation revealed that seasonal lakes exist widely in floodplain settings and have a crucial impact on increasing the hysteresis of upstream stations and decreasing that of downstream stations the magnitude and direction of the stage area hysteretic relationships varied with time in a changingenvironment this study extends the understanding of the complexity of hydrological behavior in large heterogeneous lake floodplain systems which is of vital importance for lake water resources and ecological management keywords inundation dynamics stage area hysteretic relationship hysteresis seasonal lakes remote sensing poyang lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hysteresis is a non linear phenomenon characterized by a non unique relationship between two variables under cyclic variation ewing 1885 norbiato and borga 2008 the relationship curve often forms a closed loop because of the different changes in the directions and paths of the variables hydrological hysteresis is widely observed in various hydrological processes such as soil moisture retention during wetting and drying cycles zhang et al 2009 saturated soil water content and subsurface flow during hillslope runoff events norbiato and borga 2008 and river stage discharge rating curves fread 2007 ajmera and goyal 2012 wolfs and willems 2014 sun et al 2021 the hysteretic relationship between the water level and the inundated area is one of the basic characteristics of lake hydrology however compared to unsaturated zones and riverine situations studies on stage area hysteresis in lake hydrology are limited particularly in large lakes with extensive seasonal floodplain areas zhang and werner 2015 such lakes usually have complex hydrological and hydrodynamic processes and large water level fluctuations throughout the year which makes it difficult to monitor changes in inundated areas li et al 2019a a common method for obtaining inundated areas of hydrological systems is to perform numerical simulations using physically based models koponen et al 2005 lai et al 2012 tan et al 2022 however studies have pointed out that for shallow floodplain lakes with significant time varying water levels significant uncertainties may exist in the numerical simulation owing to difficulties in defining lake boundaries bathymetric variations human disturbance and unconsidered groundwater recharging discharging li et al 2014 tan et al 2019 in addition numerical models usually have complex structures strict requirements for boundary conditions and large basic data requirements which limit their application to long term continuous modeling in areas with insufficient data with the rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology multiple sources of remote sensing data have provided important information for inundation monitoring of terrestrial water surfaces in recent years feng et al 2012 pekel et al 2016 however owing to high spatiotemporal heterogeneity it remains a challenge to capture rapid changes in surface water with fine spatiotemporal resolution in those floodplain lakes ye et al 2019 tan et al 2019 for these lakes remote sensing data with high spatial resolutions e g 30 m of landsat series are normally limited in their value for detecting rapid changes in the water surface due to the long revisit cycles of satellites frequent cloud contamination and other poor atmospheric conditions zhu et al 2010 however satellite remote sensing images with short temporal intervals e g eight days of the modis series do not capture the spatial details of the water surface because of the relatively low spatial resolution 250 m 500 m and 1000 m cheng et al 2020 in this regard some studies have proposed spatiotemporal fusion technology for remote sensing data e g zhu et al 2010 2016 chen et al 2018 by combining the advantages of medium and high spatial resolution remote sensing images with those of high temporal resolution remote sensing images remote sensing images with high spatiotemporal resolution can be obtained providing a technical guarantee for the study of inundation dynamics in heterogeneous floodplain lakes tan et al 2019 located on the south bank of the middle lower yangtze river poyang lake is one of the two large lakes that remain naturally connected to the yangtze river it is a typical shallow water carrying lake that plays an irreplaceable ecological service function the most notable feature of the lake is its high water level fluctuations resulting in a large floodplain adjacent to the main lake in which interconnected seasonal lakes are widely distributed li et al 2019a zhang and werner 2015 first explored the hysteresis relationships between the inundated area water storage and water level of this lake floodplain system using a physically based hydrodynamic model mike 21 zhang et al 2017 further revealed a three phase hydrological regime in stage flow relationships that assisted in developing an improved physical interpretation of stage area hysteretic relationships these pioneering studies have highlighted the significance of hysteresis in floodplain lakes and the development of management models the reported large uncertainties in water surface simulations from previous studies e g li et al 2014 tan et al 2019 call for the use of more accurate high spatial temporal resolution remote sensing data in the investigation of water inundation dynamics and potential hydrological hysteresis in floodplain lakes furthermore the stage area hysteretic relationships may change in the context of climate change and human impacts which have not been adequately considered in previous studies the variability and causes of the stage area hysteretic relationships in the poyang lake floodplain system remain to be explored this study aims to address these gaps specifically the objectives of this study are 1 to examine the inundation dynamics of the water surface and its spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the poyang lake floodplain system by reconstructing high spatiotemporal resolution 30 m 8 day inundated water surface data from 2000 to 2018 2 to generalize the formation mechanism of stage area hysteretic relationships and reveal the effect of seasonal lakes in the floodplain and 3 to explore the interannual variability and causes of stage area hysteretic relationships in recent years this study would greatly improve the understanding of the hydrological regimes of large floodplain lakes and promote management practices for shallow lake ecosystems 2 study area overview the poyang lake n28 24 29 46 e115 49 116 46 is the largest freshwater lake in china fig 1 a the lake receives upstream runoff mainly from five tributary rivers ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui and is discharged directly into the yangtze river after regulation and storage fig 1b the outline of the lake is similar to a gourd shape wide in the south and long and narrow in the north the lake catchment covering a drainage area of 162 225 km2 belongs to a subtropical monsoon climate zone with an average annual temperature of 17 5 c and average annual precipitation of 1665 mm the hydrological regime of poyang lake is affected by both catchment inflow and the yangtze river discharge and the water level fluctuates significantly throughout the year fig 1c 1d the lake water surface can expand to 4 000 km2 in the summer wet season july september and shrink to less than 500 km2 in the winter dry season december february showing the typical hydrological characteristics of an ocean during the flood season and a stream during the dry season this huge seasonal fluctuation in lake water surface inundation creates an extensive wetland ecosystem across the floodplain region of some 3 000 km2 zhang and werner 2015 shallow floodplains provide an excellent place for the reproduction of various animals and plants as well as a transfer station for many wintering migratory birds li et al 2019c bounded by the songmen mountain the northern lake is narrow and dominated by water channels whereas the southern lake is flat and broad where extensive floodplains have developed fig 1b in floodplain regions seasonal shallow and small lakes with sizes ranging from 1 km2 to 71 km2 are distinctive hydrological units the total water surface area of these seasonal lakes is approximately 767 km2 tan et al 2020 according to the periphery of the seasonal lakes the entire poyang lake floodplain system can be roughly divided into two regions the main lake and seasonal floodplain lakes topographically the lake bottom varies from floodplain areas of 30 m to flow channels of approximately 8 m yellow sea datum china the bottom elevation of most seasonal lakes varies from 12 to 13 m which is almost higher than that of the main lake because of the changes in hydrologic connectivity throughout the year the floodplains and their seasonal lakes can be partly or fully coupled to the main lake at high water levels during the summer months june october but become isolated at low water levels during the winter months december february li et al 2019b 3 data and method 3 1 data the observed daily lake water levels during 2000 2018 were measured at five hydrostations hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan across poyang lake daily runoff during the same period was recorded from seven hydro stations qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng of the five rivers in the poyang lake catchment among the seven hydro stations waizhou lijiadu and meigang were located at the downstream outlets of the ganjiang fuhe and xinjiang rivers respectively whereas the hushan and dukengfeng wanjiabu and qiujin stations were located at the branches of the raohe and xiushui rivers respectively in addition runoff data from the hankou hydro station were collected to represent discharge from the upper middle yangtze river the period of daily runoff at the hankou hydro station was 2000 2012 whereas that of annual runoff was from 2000 to 2018 all hydrological data were provided by the jiangxi hydrological bureau and the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission the total drainage area controlled by the seven hydrostations in the poyang lake catchment is 137 143 km2 which is 25 082 km2 smaller than the entire poyang lake catchment in this study the total inflow to the entire poyang lake catchment was calculated using a simple scaling method based on the ratio of the gauged area to the total area the remote sensing image data used in this study included landsat series including tm etm and oli from 2000 to 2018 downloaded from http glovis usgs gov and modis surface reflectance data series on the nasa terra platform mod09a1 downloaded from http reverb echo nasa gov table 1 landsat data have a spatial resolution of 30 m and a temporal resolution of 16 d owing to the influence of cloud cover the availability of landsat data is greatly reduced during the study period 275 landsat data sets were obtained the mod09a1 dataset is a composite product of the 500 m surface reflectance of modis data every eight days a total of 46 images were captured each year in total 847 modis images were obtained during the study period all the acquired landsat and modis data were of good quality before application all the image data were subjected to standardized preprocessing on the envi platform including projection transformation radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction 3 2 water surface extraction the normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 was used to determine the lake water area this index was constructed by calculating the ratio of the strong and weak reflection bands and combining it with a certain threshold to extract water information using the following formula 1 n d w i d n g r e e n d n n i r d n g r e e n d n n i r where dn nir and dn green indicate the digital number dn values in the nir near infrared and green bands of remote sensing imagery respectively generally the acquired ndwi ranges from 1 to 1 water features have positive values whereas soil and terrestrial vegetation features have zero or negative values mcfeeters 1996 based on the calculated ndwi images the inundation and non inundation areas could be distinguished by setting two different values for the ndwi across the lake floodplain the inundation area i e ndwi with positive values was set to 1 and the non inundation area i e ndwi with zero or negative values was set to 0 3 3 estarfm fusion framework the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model estarfm was applied to reconstruct continuous remote sensing image data with high temporal and spatial resolution estarfm is a data fusion method based on a moving window that considers the auxiliary information obtained from adjacent pixels with similar spectra and the weights of these pixels themselves zhu et al 2010 the estarfm model fuses and reconstructs landsat images of the current day lp through a modis image mp and landsat la lb and modis ma mb images of at least two stages before and after the simulation date the details of the principle of the model can be found in zhu et al 2010 a flowchart of the estarfm fusion process is shown in fig 2 it should be noted that there are two fusion schemes bi blend then index and ib index then blend abdollah et al 2014 which differ in the fusion order a previous study by kai 2018 indicated that compared to the bi scheme the ib scheme can weaken the speckle phenomenon caused by cloud interference and can better reflect the fine texture characteristics of real features therefore the ib scheme was selected for image fusion in this study the input data in the fusion model were the calculated ndwi data images this study reconstructed the missing ndwi data of 667 images from 2000 to 2018 using the estarfm model and formed a continuous high spatial temporal resolution 8d 30 m ndwi dataset since 2000 the inundated areas of the real landsat and estarfm fused images were subtracted to verify the accuracy statistical analyses showed that the average accuracy of the fused image data in calculating water ndwi was 92 7 with reference to real landsat data 3 4 measurement of hysteresis the degree of stage area hysteresis was quantified by calculating the loop area of the stage area relationship curve norbiato and borga 2008 zhang and werner 2015 firstly both the lake water level and area were normalized and then the loop area was calculated as the dimensionless hysteresis η using the following formula 2 h t h t h min h max h min 3 a t a t a min a max a min 4 η 0 1 a r h d h 1 0 a f h d h where h is the observed lake water level m at a specific station and a is the corresponding lake water surface km 2 at time t the subscripts of m i n and m a x represent the minimum and maximum values from time series of h and a h and a are the normalized variables of lake stage and inundated water surface η is the degree of hysteresis the subscripts r and f represent the rising and falling stages of the loop of the stage area hysteretic curve respectively the bigger the hysteresis η the larger the loop of the stage area curve and the greater the fluctuation of lake inundation and vice versa 4 results 4 1 intra annual variation in the lake inundated area the inundated water surface of poyang lake exhibited clear seasonal fluctuations fig 3 on average the inundated area of the lake increased steadily from january to june peaking in july subsequently it gradually decreased over subsequent months during the past 19 years the maximum inundation was approximately 3000 km2 whereas the minimum inundation area was less than 600 km2 the lake surface area varied seasonally with a maximum in october 2400 km2 and a minimum in july 990 km2 lower variability in the lake water surface mainly occurred during the winter dry season and summer flood season during this time the inundated area of the lake typically reached an extreme value and changed only slightly in contrast larger variability usually occurred in the spring season april and may when the lake water surface expanded rapidly and in the autumn season when the lake surface shrank quickly september and october statistics show that the average annual inundated areas in the main lake and floodplain seasonal lakes are 1232 km2 and 392 km2 respectively although both had similar seasonal fluctuations throughout the year the inundation of the seasonal floodplain lakes differed from that of the main lake in certain months as shown by the gray area in fig 4 when the inundated area of the main lake showed an increasing trend at the end of march a decreasing trend was observed in the regions of the seasonal lake in addition during the recession period of poyang lake in october the inundated area in the seasonal lake decreased rapidly and maintained a stable and slow decline subsequently while the rapid decline of the inundated area in the main lake from october continued until november 4 2 stage area hysteretic relationships the non linear characteristics of the lake water level stage and surface area inundated area relationship in the poyang lake floodplain system were prominent and showed clear spatial differences two different directions of stage area hysteretic relationships existed in the poyang lake floodplain system fig 5 clockwise hysteresis was observed at the hukou xingzi and duchang stations which are mainly located downstream and in the center of the lake whereas counter clockwise hysteresis was apparent for the tangyin and kangshan stations upstream of the lake this relationship was most prominent for lake water levels below 14 m at the hukou and xingzi stations and between 13 m and 16 m at the tangyin and kangshan stations the counterclockwise and clockwise stage area hysteretic relationships of the upstream and downstream stations are further reflected in the statistical differences in lake water levels during the rising and recession periods the average water levels during the rising period at the hukou xingzi and duchang stations were lower than those during the recession period whereas the opposite was observed at the tangyin and kangshan stations table 2 the calculated hysteresis in fig 5f indicates the degree of stage area hysteretic relationships i e the degree of nonlinearity at different stations among the five stations the hysteresis of the kangshan station in the southernmost part of the lake was the largest followed by the hukou xingzi and tangyin stations the duchang station in the center of the lake had the smallest hysteresis as noted in previous studies that the volume of seasonal floodplain lakes accounted for a small part of the whole poyang lake in both the high 3 5 1 9 and low 5 6 2 0 water level periods li et al 2019b tan et al 2020 on this basis the influence of seasonal floodplain lakes on lake stage area hysteretic relationships can be preliminarily evaluated by comparing the stage area hysteretic relationships for the entire poyang lake floodplain and the main lake region without considering the hydraulic connection between seasonal lakes and the main lake as shown in fig 5 the hollow line loops for the main lake at all stations shifted downward to the right without considering the inundated area in the seasonal lake region for downstream stations hukou xingzi and duchang the stage area hysteresis increased while it decreased for the upstream stations tangyin and kangshan which is evident from the calculated η in fig 5 for all stations the relative impact of seasonal lakes on the stage area hysteresis was most prominent at tangyin 4 3 interannual variability the stage area hysteresis of poyang lake changed over time fig 6 shows the calculated hysteresis of the five stations in three different periods before and after the multi stage experimental impoundment of the three gorges project it can be seen from the figure that during 2000 2003 the hysteresis of the stage area relationship at xingzi station was the smallest and it increased in turn from duchang tangyin and kangshan along the south lake the hukou hysteresis at the north end of the lake was greater than that at the xingzi and duchang stations a clockwise hysteretic relationship was observed at hukou and xingzi and a counterclockwise hysteretic relationship was observed at the other three stations in the following period 2004 2009 the hysteresis of the stage area relationship at the hukou xingzi and duchang stations increased significantly and the direction of the hysteretic relationship at the duchang station changed clockwise in contrast the hysteresis at the tangyin and kangshan stations decreased slightly during this period the hysteresis at tangyin station was the smallest among all stations the characteristics of the new stage area hysteretic relationship across the lake emerged from 2010 to 2018 in the former period the hysteresis of the hukou xingzi and duchang stations decreased significantly whereas that of the tangyin and kangshan stations increased significantly during this period the hysteresis of the stage area relationship at duchang station was the smallest 5 discussion lake and river floodplains are special underlying surface systems with periodic alternations of dry and wet conditions caused by flood disturbances globally such floodplains cover an area of approximately 80 220 104 km2 entwistle et al 2019 including the famous river floodplains of the nile and amazon and the lake floodplains of tonle sap lake and poyang lake because of the significant spatial heterogeneity of the underlying surface strong openness of the system and highly dynamic hydrological rhythms water interactions among floodplains inflow rivers and lakes are often complex leading to prominent non linear characteristics of hydrological processes rudorff et al 2014 li et al 2019b our research revealed that within the same open shallow lake floodplain system there are two different directions of stage area hysteretic relationships indicating that the formation mechanisms behind them are completely different the typical lake floodplain system exhibits obvious fluvial facies during the dry season owing to the extensive exposure of floodplains and water flows mainly along specific down cutting channels within the system normally during the rising period of a lake the rapid rise in the water level in the mainstream channel caused by a large amount of upstream catchment inflow leads to overflow to the floodplains on both sides forming a typical overbank inundation in contrast during the lake recession period the floodplain water level was higher and drained into the mainstream channel and downstream these processes are illustrated in the conceptual diagram shown in fig 7 a therefore compared to the rising period the inundated area of the lake was larger during the recession period for a given water level forming a typical counterclockwise stage area hysteretic relationship such as the hysteretic relationship presented at the tangyin and kangshan stations in the poyang lake floodplain system the formation mechanism of this hysteretic relationship is similar to the behavior of river floodplains rudorff et al 2014 and its hysteresis is mainly affected by the upstream discharge along the flow direction in an open lake floodplain system catchment inflow usually enters the floodplain first and then discharges into the main lake however the outflow of the main lake is further affected by the blocking function of its connecting rivers in this study because the peak of the yangtze river discharge was approximately 1 2 months later than that of the poyang lake catchment inflow fig 1d the blocking effect of the yangtze river on the lake outflow was weak in the first half of the year because of the increasing catchment inflow and relatively low water level of the yangtze river at this time the downstream main lake receives water from the floodplains and can be discharged smoothly the water level of the entire lake floodplain is mainly affected by the amount of catchment inflow however when the catchment inflow decreases rapidly after the peak and the yangtze river discharge continues to rise the blocking effect of the yangtze river on lake outflow becomes obvious and subsequently controls the decline in the downstream lake water level hu et al 2007 therefore in contrast to the lake rising period a time lag can be expected for the drainage of the floodplain and the decrease in the downstream lake water level during the lake recession period because of this time lag the slope of the water surface of the entire lake floodplain system is clearly different from that in the lake rising period and a clockwise stage area hysteretic relationship can be obtained fig 7b this clockwise hysteresis is mainly attributed to the floodplain backwater effect in zhang and werner 2015 and can be recognized as a typical hydrological characteristic of the lake floodplain system hydrological processes in large open lake floodplain systems are highly complex and are related to not only the catchment inflow but also the overall hydrological status of the connected rivers in this study changes in the runoff of the lake catchment and the yangtze river as well as the alteration in the lake basin topography were responsible for the interannual variation of stage area hysteretic relationships in the poyang lake floodplain system compared to the period 2000 2003 the mean annual discharge of the hankou station decreased obviously during 2004 2009 fig 8 a in addition the operation of the three gorges project has caused riverbed erosion in the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river ye et al 2020 and sand mining activities in the lake have enlarged the lake outflow cross section lai et al 2014 these factors enhance the outflow capacity of poyang lake especially during the recession period bing et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 lai et al 2014 and shorten the time for catchment inflow to pass through the floodplain and fill the lake this weakened the backwater effect of the floodplain at downstream stations northern main lake area resulting in an obvious reduction in the inundated area during the recession period of the lake and subsequently increasing the stage area hysteresis as the outflow channel along the hukou xingzhou duchang stations deepened and the topographic gradient decreased fig 8b the blocking effect of the yangtze river at the duchang station strengthened this is the main reason why the hysteresis of the stage area relationship at the hukou xingzi and duchang stations increased significantly and why the direction of the hysteretic relationship at the duchang station changed from 2004 to 2009 to for the tangyin and kangshan stations upstream of the lake the stage area hysteretic relationships were more affected by changes in catchment inflow the catchment inflow during 2004 2009 decreased compared with that during 2000 2003 fig 8a thus the hysteresis decreased at the two stations during the period 2010 2018 the average discharge from hankou station increased significantly compared with that during 2004 2009 fig 8a resulting in the enhancement of the blocking effect of the yangtze river and a decrease in the hysteresis at the hukou xingzi and duchang stations similarly the significant increase in catchment inflow during 2010 2018 led to an increase in hysteresis at tangyin and kangshan stations in this study considering the time varying boundary of the water surface of a river lake floodplain system caused by large fluctuations in the water level a technique for reconstructing a high spatial temporal resolution inundation dataset based on multi source remote sensing data and image fusion technology provides an effective way for a detailed examination of the inundation dynamics in these areas for example this study revealed that the inundated areas in the two regions of the main lake and the seasonal floodplain lakes in the poyang lake floodplain system show obvious intra annual variations this result has not been found in previous relevant studies e g feng et al 2012 wu and liu 2015 tan et al 2019 mainly due to the lack of inundation data with high spatial temporal resolution the major reason for this inconsistent intraannual variation is the interference of human activity in floodplain areas in the poyang lake floodplain system many seasonal floodplain lakes have been extensively terraced dammed and farmed by local fishermen during the recession period of the lake to maintain the water surface while being released for fishing before the rapid rise of the lake water level resulting in an abnormal reduction in the water surface wang et al 2016 in addition based on a high spatiotemporal resolution inundation dataset the spatial characteristics of inundation frequency water depth and hydrological connectivity in these floodplain areas can be calculated which are important for the prediction of wetland vegetation change and the evaluation of ecosystem stability finally the reconstructed inundation dataset with high spatiotemporal resolution can also be used as a supplement to the numerical simulation not only to provide accurate water boundary conditions of the complex floodplain areas but also to validate the performance of the hydrodynamic model and improve the model structure the findings of this study extend the understanding of the hydrological complexity of large heterogeneous floodplain systems which have significant implications for relevant floodplain areas worldwide the main and secondary influencing factors of hydrological processes are intertwined and behave differently in different regions resulting in obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the inundation dynamics in these floodplain systems water resource management and ecological protection plans should be treated differently in different regions especially in the floodplains and main lake regions in addition for large heterogeneous floodplain lakes rivers the stage area hysteretic relationship varies with time and location therefore the observed water level at a specific station is not reliable for reflecting or evaluating the inundation dynamics of relevant areas lumped parameter hydrological models that neglect stage area hysteresis have large simulation errors 6 conclusions based on the reconstructed high spatiotemporal resolution inundation data of the poyang lake floodplain system this study revealed that inundated areas in regions of the main lake and adjacent floodplain can present inconsistent intra annual fluctuation both clockwise and counterclockwise stage area hysteretic relationships were observed in the poyang lake floodplain system the downstream stations show clockwise hysteresis whereas the upstream stations show counterclockwise hysteresis stage area hysteresis occurs because asynchronous inflows and outflows create time varying gradients across the floodplain lake complexes during this process floodplain settings where seasonal lakes are widely developed have a crucial impact on the formation and magnitude of hysteresis the magnitude and direction of the stage area hysteretic relationships also changed with time under the impacts of climate change and human activities in the external environment this study highlights the significance of reconstructing high spatiotemporal resolution inundation data based on multi source remote sensing data in floodplain hydrological research a better understanding of the spatiotemporal variation in water inundation and stage area hysteretic relationships provided by this study can be implemented in further research on floodplain areas worldwide credit authorship contribution statement juan wu writing original draft qi zhang
