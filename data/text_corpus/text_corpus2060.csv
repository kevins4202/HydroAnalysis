10300,the spatial heterogeneity of yield caused by the interactions between soil types and crop types the nonlinear relationship between yield and irrigation and risks and uncertainties in the process of decision making make water allocation become a challenging task to address the above problems this paper proposed a framework that couples the distributed aquacrop simulation model with a risk based probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients optimization model compared with the conventional optimization models it can make the optimal water allocation schemes based on the actual crop growth process at the same time with considerations of multiple uncertainties expressed as fuzzy random variables and stochastic variables and the water shortage risk expressed as the water uniform scarcity index wusi besides it can address the relationship between the objective function with fuzzy random coefficient and fuzzy goals set by decision makers through the permissible levels moreover three risk scenarios with three water availability violated probabilities three allowable water shortage risk levels and three predefined objective probability levels of water allocation yield and permissible level are examined and influenced degrees of above risk parameters on system s outputs are explored by the sensitivity analysis method the developed model is used to a case study of irrigation water resources management in the yingke district yid heihe river basin china the results show that the optimal water allocation schemes and permissible level have different responses on risk parameters and the developed model can tradeoff the relationships amid water allocation water shortage risk yield and permissible levels it can help managers to identify desired decision alternatives in water allocation schemes among different crops in different soil types and different risk levels keywords irrigation water resources management water uniform scarcity index probabilistic possibilistic programming fuzzy random coefficient sensitivity uncertainties 1 introduction in china the proportion of agricultural water consumption is relatively high generally reaching 63 5 and this percentage is even up to 80 in the arid region of northwest china however the contradictions between agricultural water supplies and water demands aggravate by decreasing available agricultural water resources due to the rapid growth of water demand for non agricultural sectors e g domestic industrial recreational ecological and environmental use jiang et al 2015 moreover the water shortage in arid and sub arid subareas becomes more serious owing to the uneven temporal and spatial distribution of surface water zhang et al 2017 zahraei et al 2017 therefore it is essential to optimize irrigation water resources to alleviate the contradictions between water supplies and water demands and improve the crop yield the agricultural water resources management is divided into the on farm and off farm agricultural water management where the former refers to the optimization of water resources or crop patterns at the field scale and the latter means the application of automatic control systems to minimize operational water losses and increase the flexibility of water distribution orojloo et al 2018 in order to address the contradictions between water supplies and water demands and improve crop yield at the field scale water allocation at the on farm agricultural water resources system needs to be optimized there are numerous simulation optimization models for on farm agricultural water resources management for example jiang et al optimized irrigation water resources by simulation model based optimization model jiang et al 2015 it can optimize irrigation water resources among crops in the crop soil type units based on the crop water production functions but it cannot reflect the response of yield on irrigation at each growth period and neglect the uncertainties of parameters which makes the decisions lack wider applicability in addition wang et al proposed a framework which combines the distributed aquacrop model with a fuzzy dependent chance multi objective programming approach under uncertainties to optimize the irrigation water resources wang et al 2020a 2020b it can overcome the disadvantages of model developed by jiang et al by optimizing the water allocation at each crop growth period and deal with the uncertainties expressed as fuzzy goals but it is incapable of addressing associated uncertainties expressed as stochastic variables the two stage stochastic programming tsp approach can effectively deal with stochastic variables in the irrigation water resources management system zhang et al 2018 fu et al 2018 li et al 2020 it can tradeoff the relationship between pre defined target and penalty loss caused by stochastic variables but it cannot cope with the market prices presented as fuzzy random variables and the relationship between the objective function with fuzzy random variables and fuzzy goals of the objective function set by managers wang et al 2012 2017 2020a 2020b therefore the possibility and necessary measures are developed by integrating the fuzzy random variables fuzzy set theory with the tsp model to deal with above mentioned problems nevertheless the possibility and necessary measures have difficulties in linearizing fuzzy random variables and thus the probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients ppfr model is established by incorporating the fractile criterion approach fca into the possibility and necessary measures zhang et al 2017 sakawa et al 2011 it can handle the uncertainties presented as fuzzy random variables stochastic variables the relationship between the objective function with fuzzy random variables and fuzzy goals of the objective function besides it can linearize the fuzzy random variables however it is rarely used in irrigation water resources management and it cannot conduct irrigation water resources risk management the chance constrained programming ccp approach can deal with constraints violated risk in the irrigation water resource management system by measuring the variation of the system s outputs under a given series of constraints violated risk levels wang et al 2017 quddus et al 2018 nevertheless it is unable to deal with and quantify the water shortage risk and thus the ccp with the wusi constraints approach is established by integrating the risk control constraints formulated by the wusi with the ccp approach however there are no studies for irrigation water resources management under uncertainties considering the allowable quantitative water shortage risk therefore the risk based probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients rppfr model is developed in this paper but it cannot support in depth risk analysis and these concerns can be handled by the scenario analysis and the sensitivity analysis methods piao et al 2014 r h li et al 2018 q q li et al 2018 j li et al 2018 pishvaee and torabi 2010 zhang et al 2016 for example safavi et al adopted the scenarios analysis approach for water resources planning and management safavi et al 2016 chen et al used the sensitivity analysis approach to figure out the system s outputs on water demands chen et al 2017 nevertheless the previous studies cannot explore the effects of multiple kinds of risks on the system s outputs simultaneously the objective of this study is to develop a distributed aquacrop rppfr model for irrigation water resources risk management under uncertainties the probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients ccp approach water shortage risk control constraints formulated by the wusi will be integrated with the distributed aquacrop model the model has the following advantages 1 it can deal with fuzzy random variables and random variables in the model 2 it can measure the relationship between the objective function with fuzzy random variables and fuzzy goals of the objective function as the permissible levels under possibility and necessary cases 3 it can cope with the risks presented as water shortage risk constraints violated risk and objective violated risk and conduct irrigation water resources risk management 4 it can support in depth analysis of the relationship amid water allocation yield permissible level and multiple kinds of risks the developed model is applied to a case study of irrigation water resources management in the yingke irrigation district heihe river basin china to verify its applicability the optimal water allocation schemes and permissible levels under 27 kinds of risk scenarios composed of three water availability violated probabilities three allowable water shortage risks and three pre determined objective probabilities are examined besides the influenced degrees of the above three kinds of risk parameters on water allocation yield and permissible levels are explored the results can provide multiple water allocation schemes for managers under uncertainties and risks 2 methodology 2 1 the formulation of distributed aquacrop model the distributed aquacrop modeling is based on the aquacrop model at a single scale where the principle and operation refers to the aquacrop training handbooks the steps of formatting distributed aquacrop model are as follows firstly forming multiple homogeneous decision making units dmus based on the gis platform by overlying the soil layer and crop layer and each dmu has the same soil type and crop type secondly preparing the input data of all dmus and constructing the corresponding control file pro based on the aquacrop platform at a single point http www fao org land water databases and software aquacrop en thirdly putting pro files into the input file of the aquacrop plug in exe platform http www fao org aquacrop and running the exe file to get the yield and soil water elements e g transpiration evaporation irrigation precipitation deep infiltration and other elements of each unit lastly calibrating and verifying the built model with actual observed field data through statistical indicators the statistical indictors of the relative error re and determined coefficient r 2 are used to assess the differences between simulated yield and observed yield and further calibrate and validate the aquacrop model at a single point scale and the distributed aquacrop model and the expressions of the re and r 2 shown as follows 1 r e y o b s y s i m y o b s 100 2 r 2 1 i 1 n y s i m y s i m 2 i 1 n y o b s y o b s 2 where the y o b s and y s i m are the observed values and simulated values of yield separately y o b s and y s i m are the average observed value and average simulated value respectively n is the numbers of observed value the re less than 20 and r 2 larger than 0 6 indicate that the distributed aquacrop model can be used to simulate and forecast the yield 2 2 risk based probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients rppfr 2 2 1 probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients ppfr the two stage stochastic programming with fuzzy random coefficient could not only tradeoff the relationship between pre regulated policy and associated economic penalty but also deal with the objective functions with fuzzy random variables the expression is shown as follows 3a m a x f i 1 i c i t a i i 1 i h 1 h p h e i d i h 3b a x b 3c x 0 where f is the objective function c i and e i are fuzzy random coefficients respectively ta is the pre defined target d is the shortage between the actual value and target the ph is the occurrence probabilities of scenarios a and b are the coefficients in the left and right hands x are decision variables the objective function follows the membership function expressed as l r format which is restricted by the fuzzy random variables the membership function of the objective function is shown as follows and the diagram is shown in fig 1 4a o b i 1 i c i t i i 1 i h 1 h p h e i d i h 4b μ o b

d i h i 1 i c i r t i i 1 i h 1 h p h e i r d i h 0 o t h e r w i s e where μ o b is the membership function of the objective function c i l and c i r denote the left and right spreads of the fuzzy number c i respectively e i l and e i r represent the left and right spreads of the fuzzy number numbers e i separately c i c and e i c are the center values of c i and e i which are assumed to be gaussian random vectors with expected value u c i u e i and standard deviation σ c i σ u i the formulations of the membership function have two steps 1 formulate the fuzzy random variables including the left and right spreads central values of the fuzzy numbers 2 establish the membership function based on the eq 3b considering the ambiguous nature in the processes of decision making decision makers usually set fuzzy goals for objective function the relationship between objective function and fuzzy goals could be measured by the satisfactory degree based on the following fuzzy membership function wang et al 2015 the diagram is shown in fig 2 5 μ g z 1 i f z z 1 z 0 z z 0 z 1 i f z 0 z z 1 0 i f z z 0 where μ g z is the membership of objective function economic benefit z0 z1 present the least pre defined minimum and maximum system benefit set by decision makers respectively the difference between μ o b and μ g z is that the former is the membership function of objective function restricted by fuzzy random variables and the latter is the membership function of objective restricted by the pre defined fuzzy goals set by decision makers to address the relationship of above two membership functions the possibility and necessity measures are adopted here the expressions are shown as follows and the diagram is shown in fig 3 6 p o s o b g sup ς min μ o b ς μ g ς 7 n e c o b g sup ς min 1 μ o b ς μ g ς where p o s o b g and n e c o b g denote the possibility and necessity degrees that the fuzzy economic goal g is fulfilled by objective function with possibility distribution μ o b respectively the possibility measure is applicable for optimistic decision makers and the necessity measure is suitable for risk averse decision makers the possibility and necessary measures cannot deal with the nonlinear formats of the fuzzy random variables in the objective function and to address this problem the probabilistic possibilistic programming pp is formed through integrating the fractile criterion approach fca with the possibility and necessary measures it can optimize the permissible level that is greater than or equal to a certain threshold under possibility case and necessary case kataoka 1963 the eqs 6 and 7 could be reformulated as follows zhang et al 2017 a possibility case 8 m a x m pr p o s o b g m θ b necessary case 9 m a x m pr n e c o b g m θ where m is a permissible level that the degree of possibility p o s o b g necessity n e c o b g is greater than or equal to and θ presents a probability level predetermined by decision makers for the degree of possibility necessity being greater than or equal to m the eqs 8 and 9 is a nonlinear format in order to linearize the nonlinear format and the transformation is made as follows a possibility case 10

cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random variable the proof of the equations can be found in since the equality holds if m is maximum models 10 and 11 can be equivalently rewritten

fittingthe gaussian distribution function of the central value of the fuzzy randomvariable getting the stochastic variable value under given probability levelbased on the inverse function of the gaussian distribution function 4 formulating the permissible levels under possibility and necessary cases basedon the eqs 12a 13a 5 getting the optimal permissible levels underpossibility and necessary cases under a given series of probability levels bysolving the model 2 2 2 risk based probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients rppfr the ppfr model can address the fuzzy random variables and stochastic variables but it cannot deal with the water shortage risk which can be handled by the chance constrained programming ccp method and the water uniform scarcity index wusi shown as follows the expression of the ccp method is as follows 14a pr i 1 i a i w a i h η q h 1 q l h q l where i represents the index of decision making units h is the index of flow level pr donates the possibility level wa is water allocation decision variable 104 m3 q is available water resources 104 m3 the random coefficient η is the water use efficiency coefficient q l and 1 q l are the violated level and confidence level of constraints respectively when the left hand side coefficients are determined and the right hand side coefficient are random the eq 14a could be rewritten as follows 14b i 1 i w a i h q h q l h q l the steps of formulating the ccp method include 1 fit the distribution function of the stochastic variable 2 get the stochastic variable value under given probability level based on the inverse function of the fitted distributed function of the stochastic variable 3 establish the non equality equation as the eq 14b the expression of wusi is a follows 15a w s r i 1 i w a i h w min w max w min e s 15b s j 1 j w a i j h j 1 j w a i j h ln w a i j h j 1 j w a i j h where wsr is water shortage risk s is the information entropy wmin and wmax are the historical minimum and maximum water allocation respectively therefore the rppfr model is formulated as follows first model a possibility case objective function maximizing the permissible level 16a m

permissible levels under three water flow levels three water availability violated level q three water shortage risk level r and three pre determined probability level θ are obtained after solving the above two models 2 3 the construction of distributed simulation optimization model the distributed simulation optimization modeling is an interactive process involving a number of iterations between the distributed aquacrop model and the rppfr model the detailed process is shown in fig 4 the steps of formulating the distributed simulation optimization are as follows 1 establish the rppfr optimization model 2 develop the distributed aquacrop model 3 get the optimal water allocation schemes and permissible levels of 27 risk scenarios based on the ga method 2 4 sensitivity analysis multilevel factorial analysis mfa is one of the sensitivity analysis methods it can reflect the interaction among parameters and characterize the relationship between parameters and responses wang et al 2020a 2020b the mfa has advantages of easy implementation and low computational demand in the three level factorial analysis the main effects of individual parameters can be calculated based on the variation range of average model output response when an individual parameter varies across its three levels 18 a m a i n e f f e c t max y l y m y h min y l y m y h where y h y m a n d y l present the average response of system when individual a takes a high level medium level and low level respectively 3 case study 3 1 study area the yingke irrigation district yid is the third largest irrigation district in the middle oasis of the heihe river basin located in ganzhou district zhangye city gansu province northwest china 100 17 100 34 e 38 50 38 58 n shown in fig 5 it is the main food production base and the main grain crops include the wheat field corn and seed corn the weather condition of yid is monitored by zhangye weather station where the mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and annual evapotranspiration is 1200 mm and thus the agricultural production is mainly obtained from the irrigation the main water sources are surface water from heihe river and groundwater there are four soil types including type 1 t1 where the top soil and the subsoil are both silty loam type 2 t2 where the top soil is silty loam and the subsoil is sandy loam type 3 t3 where the top soil is silty loam and the subsoil is loam and type 4 t4 where the top soil and subsoil are both loam 3 2 problem description in this study area the problems of the unbalanced relationships between water demands and water supplies and the spatial heterogeneity of the regional yield caused by different soil types and crop types thus the precise irrigation based on the distributed simulation optimization model is desired to conduct irrigation water resources management besides the irrigation water resources management system is full of uncertainties such as the randomness of runoff and the randomness and fuzziness of market price which will lead to high uncertainties of decisions in order to address the above problems a more robust distributed simulation optimization model is aspired to be developed the water shortage risk is usually seen in the irrigation system and it affects the system s outputs and the measurement and control of water shortage risk contributes to improving the capacity of the model to deal with the risk and to enhance the robustness of decisions and thus the risk control measures are needed to be integrated with the distributed simulation optimization model to conduct irrigation water resources risk management 3 3 data collection the input data of the distributed aquacrop model are weather data precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and co2 management data initial soil water contents data soil parameters files crop parameters files groundwater files irrigation files soil layer and crop layers they are obtained from the field experiment local survey meteorological website http data cma cn en and china soil map the input data of optimization model include yield market price penalty coefficient water availability canal water use coefficient historical maximum water allocation and minimum water allocation of the irrigation district the maximum and minimum water allocation at each irrigation date water uniform scarcity index wusi and allowable maximum dp the related data are shown in table 1 the yield and dp are obtained from running the distributed aquacrop model and the allowable maximum dp is calculated through multiplying the respective 396 maximum water demands by 0 2 to avoid excessive deep infiltration the market price time series from the year 01 01 2017 03 05 2020 is used to formulate the fuzzy random numbers of the market price coefficient the historical minimum and maximum market prices are selected as minimum possible value and maximum possible value respectively the difference between the mean value and minimum possible value is left spread while the difference between the maximum possible value and mean value is right spread the mean value and standard deviation of gaussian distribution are fitted based on the market price time series the penalty coefficient time series is calculated through multiplying the market price with 1 3 and thus the fuzzy random numbers of penalty coefficient are determined according to the same method with the market price the allowable wusi is set as 0 47 0 5 and 0 52 to promise the allowable water shortage risk and figure out its effects on the system s outputs the maximum water demand of water allocation at each irrigation date is determined by the crop coefficient method and the minimum water demand is calculated by multiplying the maximum water demand by 0 6 the water availability and canal water use coefficient are obtained from water conservancy annual report the other data are collected from the statistical yearbook of zhangye city 4 results and discussion 4 1 goodness of fit for model simulation the field observation data including green canopy cover cc yield and soil water content swc are selected to calibrate the crop parameters and soil parameters of the aquacrop model at a point scale the results of cc and swc of the seed corn with four soil types and the r2 of yield of three corps are shown in fig 6 the r2 of cc and swc of seed corn under four soil types all exceed the 0 7 indicating that the cc and swc of seed corn under four soil types can be simulated well by the aquacrop model and the r2 of yield of three crops is 0 94 disclosing that observed yields are fitted well by simulated yields and the aquacrop model at a single point can be used to formulate the distributed aquacrop model the re and r2 are used to assess the differences between recorded regional yields and simulated regional yields of wheat field corn and seed corn and further to calibrate the distributed aquacrop model and the re value is shown in table 2 and the r2 values are displayed on fig 7 it shows that the re of wheat field corn and seed corn is all below 20 indicating that the regional crop yield can be simulated well by the distributed aquacrop model besides the r2 reaches 0 99 disclosing that the distributed aquacrop model can be used to simulate and forecast the regional yield 4 2 the optimal water allocation schemes and yield under different scenarios there are 27 kinds of optimal water allocation schemes under three water flow levels h high medium and low flow levels three water availability violated probabilities q q take 0 05 0 15 and 0 2 and three water shortage risk levels r r value 0 47 0 5 and 0 52 respectively besides the 27 kinds of permissible levels under three q levels three r levels and three pre determined objective probability levels θ are compared and discussed finally the sensitivity analysis method is used to figure out the effects of the above parameters on water allocation yield and permissible levels 4 2 1 scenario a the optimal water allocation and yield under different water flow levels scenarios there are ten decision making units dmus for wheat field corn and seed corn where each dmu has the same soil type and crop type taking the scenario of q values 0 2 r is 0 5 and θ takes 0 3 as an example the optimal water allocation and yield are shown in fig 8 and 9 fig 8 indicates that the water allocation under high flow level is highest followed by medium and low flow levels for most dmus this is because the available water resources decrease with the reduction of flow levels and water allocation lessens with the decreased available water resources it also demonstrates that the deep infiltration dp diminishes with the reduction of flow levels for example the total water allocation of seed corn with t2 are 610 mm 526 mm and 508 mm and the dp are 150 5 mm 65 8 mm and 48 7 mm under three flow level respectively this can be explained by reasons that more water allocation results in higher soil water content and dp that occurs as the soil water content exceeds the field capacity this means excessive irrigation will lead to ineffective water losses e g dp thus limiting excessive dp is essential for water saving and improving water use efficiency moreover the water allocation of wheat with t3 is biggest followed by t4 and t1 this is because a higher difference between the field capacity and wilting point will result in bigger water stress and lower maximum water demand under the same irrigation scheduling fig 9 reveals that the yield of wheat with t3 is highest followed by t4 and t1 and the yield of field corn with t4 is biggest ranked by t3 and t1 and the yield of seed corn with t2 is highest ordered by t4 t3 and t1 this is because the four soil types have different field capacities and wilting points and thus cause different water stress and water stress will be higher under a bigger difference and has a negative effect on crop yield and thus the yield with t2 is biggest followed by the t4 t3 and t1 under the same irrigation scheduling the yield of wheat with t3 is larger than t4 which is caused by the water allocation pattern in the whole growth period the differences in water stress of t3 and t4 are relatively small under the same irrigation scheduling but the water stress of t3 and t4 exists for obvious differences under different irrigation scheduling and leads to various yield therefore the planting areas of wheat in t3 field corn in t4 and seed corn in t3 can be increased to enlarge the yield besides it implies that the yield has a nonlinear relationship with water allocation taking wheat with t3 as an example the water allocations present obvious differences but the yields are almost the same under three flow levels this regulation is also suitable for other crops under three flow levels this is because that soil water exchanges occur at the whole growth period and only the effective irrigation used for crop transpiration can increase the crop yield however the yield is not always positive with transpiration biomass under the impact of the harvest index hi that is affected by water stress and thus the yield is comprehensive effects of the biomass and hi for example the total water allocation of seed corn with t2 are 610 mm 526 mm 508 mm and the transpiration is 513 9 mm 514 mm 513 6 mm and the biomass is 22 073 22 075 22 054 ton hm2 and the hi is 0 441 0 441 0 442 and the yield is 9 74 9 741 9 75 ton hm2 for high medium and low flow levels separately it indicates that the transpiration is mostly the same under three flow levels caused by soil water exchanges and the hi presents the different tendency with biomass under three flow levels the yield is not proportional to transpiration under three flow levels after the comprehensive effects of biomass and hi it indicates that the target yields of most crops are satisfied and the unsatisfied target yield such as the wheat with t4 decreases with the flow levels this can be explained by reasons the water stress between two irrigation date intervals will be alleviated with the increase of water allocation contributing to the increase in yield it illustrates that optimizing irrigation water resources based on the crop growth regulation contributes to improving the yield 4 2 2 scenario b the optimal water allocation and yield under different water availability violated probabilities scenarios the water availability violated probabilities q correspond to various available water resources and further affect the optimal water allocation and yield and thus the effects of q on water allocation and yield are analyzed and the variation process of the objective function with iterations numbers under three q levels is shown in fig 10 and there are two groups of optimal water allocation schemes corresponding to the maximum permissible level under possibility case and the maximum permissible level under the necessary case separately except for subsection about analyzing differences in permissible levels between possibility case and necessary case section 4 3 the result analysis in other subsections is based on the optimal water allocation corresponding to the permissible level under the possibility case fig 11 is the optimal water allocation schemes under three q levels to avoid excessive dp the maximum allowable dp are set as 180 mm 170 mm and 160 mm for q taking 0 2 0 15 and 0 05 respectively where the dp is generally below the 20 of the maximum water allocation fao 61 it reveals that water allocations of dmus have no obvious variation tendencies with changes of q this is because water availability constraints do not take effect under the impacts of maximum allowable water shortage risk and allowable dp constraints besides the actual evapotranspiration eta is almost the same for each dmu under three q levels for example the eta of seed corn with t3 is 546 7 mm as q varies through its three levels this is because the differences in the soil water content at the whole growth period under three q levels are relatively small and further generate the same evapotranspiration there are three kinds of relationships between yield and eta shown in fig 12 the first case is that the yield is positive with eta under three q levels and the second case is that the eta keeps unchanged but the yield changes with the variations of q and the third case is that the eta and yield both stay unchanged under three q levels taking the wheat with t1 as an example the eta is 430 8 mm 431 4 mm and 428 4 mm respectively and the yields are 5 572 ton hm2 5 578 ton hm2 and 5 531 ton hm2 separately for q as 0 05 0 15 and 0 2 the yield presents a positive relationship with eta which is because higher eta results in bigger biomass and water stress does not trigger the obvious difference in hi among three q levels taking the field corn with t3 as an example the eta are all 546 7 mm but the yields are 10 491 ton hm2 10 492 ton hm2 and 10 49 ton hm2 for q as 0 05 0 15 and 0 2 respectively this is because the hi are different as q changes through its three levels and the detailed reasons are that the various water allocation patterns under three q levels lead to different soil water contents and water stresses meanwhile the sensitivity degrees of eta and hi on water stress are different taking the seed corn with t4 as an example eta and yield are all 569 7 mm and 9 499 ton hm2 as q varies from its three levels this could be explained by reasons that the water allocation patterns under three q levels cause similar soil water content and water stress not triggering differences in eta and yield in summary the yield is not only affected by the irrigation but also the soil water content and water stress therefore the water allocation should avoid ineffective water loss promise sufficient soil water content and reduce water stress 4 2 3 scenario c the optimal water allocation and yield under different allowable water shortage risk scenarios the allowable water shortage risk levels r are set as 0 47 0 5 and 0 52 to figure out the responses of water allocation and the yield on r fig 13 is the variation process of the permissible level under possibility case with iteration numbers as r varies through its three levels and q takes 0 15 and θ is 0 3 fig 14 is the optimal water allocation schemes with three r levels under medium flow level it shows that the wusi under three flow levels is below 0 5 indicating the risk control constraints can effectively avoid the excessive water shortage risk besides the wusi decreases with the reduction of flow levels this is because the water shortage index and the information entropy of water structure enlarge with increasing water allocation and the former is positive with the wusi and the latter is negative with the wusi and thus the wusi decreases with the reduction of flow levels after the comprehensive effects of water shortage index and information entropy of water structure moreover water allocation presents no obvious variation tendency as the r changes from its three levels caused by the maximum allowable dp constraints and the relationship between yield and eta is similar with the scenario b the effects of water shortage risk levels on water allocation and permissible levels are explored by running 3 groups with 100 initial individuals and one r value e g 0 47 0 5 and 0 52 and recording the eligible individuals besides maximum allowable dp constraints are not included in the model because they affect the water shortage risk the results of total water allocation permissible levels and the numbers of qualified individuals are shown in table 3 it reveals that the numbers of eligible individuals and total water allocation increase with the enlargement of r this is because the increased water shortage risk level softens the maximum allowable water shortage risk constraints and more water resources can be allocated and the original unqualified individuals with higher water allocation become eligible individuals the dp of some eligible individual reaches 230 mm which is because higher water shortage risk level generates more water allocation and further results in the unacceptable dp this also illustrates that even though the allowable maximum water shortage risk constraints can promise the reasonable water shortage it cannot control effectively the excessive dp and thus the two kinds of constraints are essential to guide irrigation water allocation the effects of the q on the system s outputs without maximum allowable water shortage risk and maximum allowable dp constraints are analyzed by running the 100 individuals and recording the qualified individuals the results of water allocation dp wusi and permissible level are shown in table 4 it shows the total water allocation wusi dp under three flow levels enlarge with the rise of q and their values are higher than the individuals with these two risk control constraints this is because the bigger q leads to higher water allocation and wusi and dp meanwhile the maximum allowable shortage risk control constraints and dp constraints limit the water allocation and further reduce the wusi and dp it illustrates that the wusi of some qualified individuals exceeds 0 52 which is caused by excessive water allocation and also indicates the maximum allowable water shortage risk constraints can effectively avoid unacceptable water shortage risk in addition permissible level under the possibility case improves with the growth of q this is because more water allocation will generate higher economic benefit and thus the higher permissible level in summary the permissible level under possibility case water allocation wusi and dp increase with the rise of q without the water shortage risk control and allowable maximum dp constraints it also indicates that the water shortage risk is contradictory with the permissible level and higher permissible level economic benefit also corresponds to the bigger water shortage risk 4 3 the permissible level under different pre determined objective probabilities scenarios the permissible level changes with the pre determined objective probabilities θ and thus the optimal water allocation schemes when q equals 0 15 r takes 0 5 and θ varies through its three levels are compared fig 15 is the variations of permissible level with iteration numbers as θ varies through its three levels it indicates that the permissible level increases as θ decreases this could be explained by reasons that the economic profit is closer to given target economic benefit with the increase of confidence levels 1 θ and higher economic profit generates bigger permissible level the sensitivity degree of θ on the permissible level is 0 0654 under the possibility and necessary cases it implies that the permissible levels under two cases increase 0 065 when θ fluctuates through its three levels it also discloses that the permissible level under the possibility case is larger than the permissible level under the necessary case implying that the optimal decision will result in a higher level of fulfillment of objective than a risk aversion decision 4 4 the comparison of the system s outputs under different risk parameters and risk levels table 5 is the optimal total water allocation yield wusi permissible level under the possibility and necessary cases under different q and r it reveals the total water allocation yield and wusi decrease as the reduction of flow levels this is because the available water resources lessen with decreases of flow levels however the system s outputs have no obvious relationship with q or r which is because of the maximum allowable dp constraints besides the sensitivity analysis method is used to measure the influence of a single risk parameter e g q r on the system s outputs which is shown in table 6 it demonstrates that the total water allocation under high flow level changes 170 2 104 m3 as the q changes through its three levels similarly the total water allocation enlarges 92 2 104 m3 and 154 59 104 m3 under medium and low flow levels respectively this means that the variations of water availability violated probability and water shortage risk in these ranges will change the above water allocation amounts it illustrates that the water availability violated probability has a more obvious effect on total water allocation than water shortage risk the yields under high flow level change 2 40 104 kg and 2 79 104 kg when q and r change through their separate three levels it indicates the water shortage risk has a more apparent influence on yield than the water availability violated probability and the permissible levels and wusi also increase with the variations of q and r therefore the variations of q and r result into increases in water allocation yield permissible levels but also cause higher water shortage risk and thus the obtained optimal water allocation schemes could tradeoff relationship amid water shortage risk water allocation yield and permissible levels the decision maker could select the corresponding water allocation schemes based on their preferences and risk attitudes 5 conclusion in this paper the distributed aquacrop simulation model optimization model framework is developed for irrigation water resources risk management under uncertainty the probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients chance constrained programming and the water uniform scarcity index is integrated with the distributed aquacrop model it can deal with the fuzzy random variables stochastic variables and the relationship between the objective function with fuzzy random variables and fuzzy goals through the permissible level besides it can explore the effects of different risk parameters and risk levels on the system s outputs further conducting irrigation water resources risk management moreover it can provide the optimal water allocation schemes based on the crop growth process and with consideration of multiple kinds of uncertainties and risks for managers the developed model is applied to a case study of the yingke district to optimize irrigation water resources under uncertainty and the results show that the proposed model can be a reliable and effective tool for addressing irrigated water allocation simulation optimization problem however the actual water allocation schemes can be affected by future climate change which can be dealt with by combing the developed model with the downscaled scenarios of climate change besides the agricultural water resources risk management in this paper can only deal with the on farm water resources and the off farm water resources should be integrated with the on farm water resources to conduct the agricultural risk management the above two problems will be dealt with in further studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10300,the spatial heterogeneity of yield caused by the interactions between soil types and crop types the nonlinear relationship between yield and irrigation and risks and uncertainties in the process of decision making make water allocation become a challenging task to address the above problems this paper proposed a framework that couples the distributed aquacrop simulation model with a risk based probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients optimization model compared with the conventional optimization models it can make the optimal water allocation schemes based on the actual crop growth process at the same time with considerations of multiple uncertainties expressed as fuzzy random variables and stochastic variables and the water shortage risk expressed as the water uniform scarcity index wusi besides it can address the relationship between the objective function with fuzzy random coefficient and fuzzy goals set by decision makers through the permissible levels moreover three risk scenarios with three water availability violated probabilities three allowable water shortage risk levels and three predefined objective probability levels of water allocation yield and permissible level are examined and influenced degrees of above risk parameters on system s outputs are explored by the sensitivity analysis method the developed model is used to a case study of irrigation water resources management in the yingke district yid heihe river basin china the results show that the optimal water allocation schemes and permissible level have different responses on risk parameters and the developed model can tradeoff the relationships amid water allocation water shortage risk yield and permissible levels it can help managers to identify desired decision alternatives in water allocation schemes among different crops in different soil types and different risk levels keywords irrigation water resources management water uniform scarcity index probabilistic possibilistic programming fuzzy random coefficient sensitivity uncertainties 1 introduction in china the proportion of agricultural water consumption is relatively high generally reaching 63 5 and this percentage is even up to 80 in the arid region of northwest china however the contradictions between agricultural water supplies and water demands aggravate by decreasing available agricultural water resources due to the rapid growth of water demand for non agricultural sectors e g domestic industrial recreational ecological and environmental use jiang et al 2015 moreover the water shortage in arid and sub arid subareas becomes more serious owing to the uneven temporal and spatial distribution of surface water zhang et al 2017 zahraei et al 2017 therefore it is essential to optimize irrigation water resources to alleviate the contradictions between water supplies and water demands and improve the crop yield the agricultural water resources management is divided into the on farm and off farm agricultural water management where the former refers to the optimization of water resources or crop patterns at the field scale and the latter means the application of automatic control systems to minimize operational water losses and increase the flexibility of water distribution orojloo et al 2018 in order to address the contradictions between water supplies and water demands and improve crop yield at the field scale water allocation at the on farm agricultural water resources system needs to be optimized there are numerous simulation optimization models for on farm agricultural water resources management for example jiang et al optimized irrigation water resources by simulation model based optimization model jiang et al 2015 it can optimize irrigation water resources among crops in the crop soil type units based on the crop water production functions but it cannot reflect the response of yield on irrigation at each growth period and neglect the uncertainties of parameters which makes the decisions lack wider applicability in addition wang et al proposed a framework which combines the distributed aquacrop model with a fuzzy dependent chance multi objective programming approach under uncertainties to optimize the irrigation water resources wang et al 2020a 2020b it can overcome the disadvantages of model developed by jiang et al by optimizing the water allocation at each crop growth period and deal with the uncertainties expressed as fuzzy goals but it is incapable of addressing associated uncertainties expressed as stochastic variables the two stage stochastic programming tsp approach can effectively deal with stochastic variables in the irrigation water resources management system zhang et al 2018 fu et al 2018 li et al 2020 it can tradeoff the relationship between pre defined target and penalty loss caused by stochastic variables but it cannot cope with the market prices presented as fuzzy random variables and the relationship between the objective function with fuzzy random variables and fuzzy goals of the objective function set by managers wang et al 2012 2017 2020a 2020b therefore the possibility and necessary measures are developed by integrating the fuzzy random variables fuzzy set theory with the tsp model to deal with above mentioned problems nevertheless the possibility and necessary measures have difficulties in linearizing fuzzy random variables and thus the probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients ppfr model is established by incorporating the fractile criterion approach fca into the possibility and necessary measures zhang et al 2017 sakawa et al 2011 it can handle the uncertainties presented as fuzzy random variables stochastic variables the relationship between the objective function with fuzzy random variables and fuzzy goals of the objective function besides it can linearize the fuzzy random variables however it is rarely used in irrigation water resources management and it cannot conduct irrigation water resources risk management the chance constrained programming ccp approach can deal with constraints violated risk in the irrigation water resource management system by measuring the variation of the system s outputs under a given series of constraints violated risk levels wang et al 2017 quddus et al 2018 nevertheless it is unable to deal with and quantify the water shortage risk and thus the ccp with the wusi constraints approach is established by integrating the risk control constraints formulated by the wusi with the ccp approach however there are no studies for irrigation water resources management under uncertainties considering the allowable quantitative water shortage risk therefore the risk based probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients rppfr model is developed in this paper but it cannot support in depth risk analysis and these concerns can be handled by the scenario analysis and the sensitivity analysis methods piao et al 2014 r h li et al 2018 q q li et al 2018 j li et al 2018 pishvaee and torabi 2010 zhang et al 2016 for example safavi et al adopted the scenarios analysis approach for water resources planning and management safavi et al 2016 chen et al used the sensitivity analysis approach to figure out the system s outputs on water demands chen et al 2017 nevertheless the previous studies cannot explore the effects of multiple kinds of risks on the system s outputs simultaneously the objective of this study is to develop a distributed aquacrop rppfr model for irrigation water resources risk management under uncertainties the probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients ccp approach water shortage risk control constraints formulated by the wusi will be integrated with the distributed aquacrop model the model has the following advantages 1 it can deal with fuzzy random variables and random variables in the model 2 it can measure the relationship between the objective function with fuzzy random variables and fuzzy goals of the objective function as the permissible levels under possibility and necessary cases 3 it can cope with the risks presented as water shortage risk constraints violated risk and objective violated risk and conduct irrigation water resources risk management 4 it can support in depth analysis of the relationship amid water allocation yield permissible level and multiple kinds of risks the developed model is applied to a case study of irrigation water resources management in the yingke irrigation district heihe river basin china to verify its applicability the optimal water allocation schemes and permissible levels under 27 kinds of risk scenarios composed of three water availability violated probabilities three allowable water shortage risks and three pre determined objective probabilities are examined besides the influenced degrees of the above three kinds of risk parameters on water allocation yield and permissible levels are explored the results can provide multiple water allocation schemes for managers under uncertainties and risks 2 methodology 2 1 the formulation of distributed aquacrop model the distributed aquacrop modeling is based on the aquacrop model at a single scale where the principle and operation refers to the aquacrop training handbooks the steps of formatting distributed aquacrop model are as follows firstly forming multiple homogeneous decision making units dmus based on the gis platform by overlying the soil layer and crop layer and each dmu has the same soil type and crop type secondly preparing the input data of all dmus and constructing the corresponding control file pro based on the aquacrop platform at a single point http www fao org land water databases and software aquacrop en thirdly putting pro files into the input file of the aquacrop plug in exe platform http www fao org aquacrop and running the exe file to get the yield and soil water elements e g transpiration evaporation irrigation precipitation deep infiltration and other elements of each unit lastly calibrating and verifying the built model with actual observed field data through statistical indicators the statistical indictors of the relative error re and determined coefficient r 2 are used to assess the differences between simulated yield and observed yield and further calibrate and validate the aquacrop model at a single point scale and the distributed aquacrop model and the expressions of the re and r 2 shown as follows 1 r e y o b s y s i m y o b s 100 2 r 2 1 i 1 n y s i m y s i m 2 i 1 n y o b s y o b s 2 where the y o b s and y s i m are the observed values and simulated values of yield separately y o b s and y s i m are the average observed value and average simulated value respectively n is the numbers of observed value the re less than 20 and r 2 larger than 0 6 indicate that the distributed aquacrop model can be used to simulate and forecast the yield 2 2 risk based probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients rppfr 2 2 1 probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients ppfr the two stage stochastic programming with fuzzy random coefficient could not only tradeoff the relationship between pre regulated policy and associated economic penalty but also deal with the objective functions with fuzzy random variables the expression is shown as follows 3a m a x f i 1 i c i t a i i 1 i h 1 h p h e i d i h 3b a x b 3c x 0 where f is the objective function c i and e i are fuzzy random coefficients respectively ta is the pre defined target d is the shortage between the actual value and target the ph is the occurrence probabilities of scenarios a and b are the coefficients in the left and right hands x are decision variables the objective function follows the membership function expressed as l r format which is restricted by the fuzzy random variables the membership function of the objective function is shown as follows and the diagram is shown in fig 1 4a o b i 1 i c i t i i 1 i h 1 h p h e i d i h 4b μ o b

d i h i 1 i c i r t i i 1 i h 1 h p h e i r d i h 0 o t h e r w i s e where μ o b is the membership function of the objective function c i l and c i r denote the left and right spreads of the fuzzy number c i respectively e i l and e i r represent the left and right spreads of the fuzzy number numbers e i separately c i c and e i c are the center values of c i and e i which are assumed to be gaussian random vectors with expected value u c i u e i and standard deviation σ c i σ u i the formulations of the membership function have two steps 1 formulate the fuzzy random variables including the left and right spreads central values of the fuzzy numbers 2 establish the membership function based on the eq 3b considering the ambiguous nature in the processes of decision making decision makers usually set fuzzy goals for objective function the relationship between objective function and fuzzy goals could be measured by the satisfactory degree based on the following fuzzy membership function wang et al 2015 the diagram is shown in fig 2 5 μ g z 1 i f z z 1 z 0 z z 0 z 1 i f z 0 z z 1 0 i f z z 0 where μ g z is the membership of objective function economic benefit z0 z1 present the least pre defined minimum and maximum system benefit set by decision makers respectively the difference between μ o b and μ g z is that the former is the membership function of objective function restricted by fuzzy random variables and the latter is the membership function of objective restricted by the pre defined fuzzy goals set by decision makers to address the relationship of above two membership functions the possibility and necessity measures are adopted here the expressions are shown as follows and the diagram is shown in fig 3 6 p o s o b g sup ς min μ o b ς μ g ς 7 n e c o b g sup ς min 1 μ o b ς μ g ς where p o s o b g and n e c o b g denote the possibility and necessity degrees that the fuzzy economic goal g is fulfilled by objective function with possibility distribution μ o b respectively the possibility measure is applicable for optimistic decision makers and the necessity measure is suitable for risk averse decision makers the possibility and necessary measures cannot deal with the nonlinear formats of the fuzzy random variables in the objective function and to address this problem the probabilistic possibilistic programming pp is formed through integrating the fractile criterion approach fca with the possibility and necessary measures it can optimize the permissible level that is greater than or equal to a certain threshold under possibility case and necessary case kataoka 1963 the eqs 6 and 7 could be reformulated as follows zhang et al 2017 a possibility case 8 m a x m pr p o s o b g m θ b necessary case 9 m a x m pr n e c o b g m θ where m is a permissible level that the degree of possibility p o s o b g necessity n e c o b g is greater than or equal to and θ presents a probability level predetermined by decision makers for the degree of possibility necessity being greater than or equal to m the eqs 8 and 9 is a nonlinear format in order to linearize the nonlinear format and the transformation is made as follows a possibility case 10

gaussian distribution function 4 formulating the permissible levels under possibility and necessary cases basedon the eqs 12a 13a 5 getting the optimal permissible levels underpossibility and necessary cases under a given series of probability levels bysolving the model 2 2 2 risk based probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients rppfr the ppfr model can address the fuzzy random variables and stochastic variables but it cannot deal with the water shortage risk which can be handled by the chance constrained programming ccp method and the water uniform scarcity index wusi shown as follows the expression of the ccp method is as follows 14a pr i 1 i a i w a i h η q h 1 q l h q l where i represents the index of decision making units h is the index of flow level pr donates the possibility level wa is water allocation decision variable 104 m3 q is available water resources 104 m3 the random coefficient η is the water use efficiency coefficient q l and 1 q l are the violated level and confidence level of constraints respectively when the left hand side coefficients are determined and the right hand side coefficient are random the eq 14a could be rewritten as follows 14b i 1 i w a i h q h q l h q l the steps of formulating the ccp method include 1 fit the distribution function of the stochastic variable 2 get the stochastic variable value under given probability level based on the inverse function of the fitted distributed function of the stochastic variable 3 establish the non equality equation as the eq 14b the expression of wusi is a follows 15a w s r i 1 i w a i h w min w max w min e s 15b s j 1 j w a i j h j 1 j w a i j h ln w a i j h j 1 j w a i j h where wsr is water shortage risk s is the information entropy wmin and wmax are the historical minimum and maximum water allocation respectively therefore the rppfr model is formulated as follows first model a possibility case objective function maximizing the permissible level 16a m

above two models 2 3 the construction of distributed simulation optimization model the distributed simulation optimization modeling is an interactive process involving a number of iterations between the distributed aquacrop model and the rppfr model the detailed process is shown in fig 4 the steps of formulating the distributed simulation optimization are as follows 1 establish the rppfr optimization model 2 develop the distributed aquacrop model 3 get the optimal water allocation schemes and permissible levels of 27 risk scenarios based on the ga method 2 4 sensitivity analysis multilevel factorial analysis mfa is one of the sensitivity analysis methods it can reflect the interaction among parameters and characterize the relationship between parameters and responses wang et al 2020a 2020b the mfa has advantages of easy implementation and low computational demand in the three level factorial analysis the main effects of individual parameters can be calculated based on the

irrigation district in the middle oasis of the heihe river basin located in ganzhou district zhangye city gansu province northwest china 100 17 100 34 e 38 50 38 58 n shown in fig 5 it is the main food production base and the main grain crops include the wheat field corn and seed corn the weather condition of yid is monitored by zhangye weather station where the mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and annual evapotranspiration is 1200 mm and thus the agricultural production is mainly obtained from the irrigation the main water sources are surface water from heihe river and groundwater there are four soil types including type 1 t1 where the top soil and the subsoil are both silty loam type 2 t2 where the top soil is silty loam and the subsoil is sandy loam type 3 t3 where the top soil is silty loam and the subsoil is loam and type 4 t4 where the top soil and subsoil are both loam 3 2 problem description in this study area the problems of the unbalanced relationships between water demands and water supplies and the spatial heterogeneity of the regional yield caused by different soil types and crop types thus the precise irrigation based on the distributed simulation optimization model is desired to conduct irrigation water resources management besides the irrigation water resources management system is full of uncertainties such as the randomness of runoff and the randomness and fuzziness of market price which will lead to high uncertainties of decisions in order to address the above problems a more robust distributed simulation optimization model is aspired to be developed the water shortage risk is usually seen in the irrigation system and it affects the system s outputs and the measurement and control of water shortage risk contributes to improving the capacity of the model to deal with the risk and to enhance the robustness of decisions and thus the risk control measures are needed to be integrated with the distributed simulation optimization model to conduct irrigation water resources risk management 3 3 data collection the input data of the distributed aquacrop model are weather data precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and co2 management data initial soil water contents data soil parameters files crop parameters files groundwater files irrigation files soil layer and crop layers they are obtained from the field experiment local survey meteorological website http data cma cn en and china soil map the input data of optimization model include yield market price penalty coefficient water availability canal water use coefficient historical maximum water allocation and minimum water allocation of the irrigation district the maximum and minimum water allocation at each irrigation date water uniform scarcity index wusi and allowable maximum dp the related data are shown in table 1 the yield and dp are obtained from running the distributed aquacrop model and the allowable maximum dp is calculated through multiplying the respective 396 maximum water demands by 0 2 to avoid excessive deep infiltration the market price time series from the year 01 01 2017 03 05 2020 is used to formulate the fuzzy random numbers of the market price coefficient the historical minimum and maximum market prices are selected as minimum possible value and maximum possible value respectively the difference between the mean value and minimum possible value is left spread while the difference between the maximum possible value and mean value is right spread the mean value and standard deviation of gaussian distribution are fitted based on the market price time series the penalty coefficient time series is calculated through multiplying the market price with 1 3 and thus the fuzzy random numbers of penalty coefficient are determined according to the same method with the market price the allowable wusi is set as 0 47 0 5 and 0 52 to promise the allowable water shortage risk and figure out its effects on the system s outputs the maximum water demand of water allocation at each irrigation date is determined by the crop coefficient method and the minimum water demand is calculated by multiplying the maximum water demand by 0 6 the water availability and canal water use coefficient are obtained from water conservancy annual report the other data are collected from the statistical yearbook of zhangye city 4 results and discussion 4 1 goodness of fit for model simulation the field observation data including green canopy cover cc yield and soil water content swc are selected to calibrate the crop parameters and soil parameters of the aquacrop model at a point scale the results of cc and swc of the seed corn with four soil types and the r2 of yield of three corps are shown in fig 6 the r2 of cc and swc of seed corn under four soil types all exceed the 0 7 indicating that the cc and swc of seed corn under four soil types can be simulated well by the aquacrop model and the r2 of yield of three crops is 0 94 disclosing that observed yields are fitted well by simulated yields and the aquacrop model at a single point can be used to formulate the distributed aquacrop model the re and r2 are used to assess the differences between recorded regional yields and simulated regional yields of wheat field corn and seed corn and further to calibrate the distributed aquacrop model and the re value is shown in table 2 and the r2 values are displayed on fig 7 it shows that the re of wheat field corn and seed corn is all below 20 indicating that the regional crop yield can be simulated well by the distributed aquacrop model besides the r2 reaches 0 99 disclosing that the distributed aquacrop model can be used to simulate and forecast the regional yield 4 2 the optimal water allocation schemes and yield under different scenarios there are 27 kinds of optimal water allocation schemes under three water flow levels h high medium and low flow levels three water availability violated probabilities q q take 0 05 0 15 and 0 2 and three water shortage risk levels r r value 0 47 0 5 and 0 52 respectively besides the 27 kinds of permissible levels under three q levels three r levels and three pre determined objective probability levels θ are compared and discussed finally the sensitivity analysis method is used to figure out the effects of the above parameters on water allocation yield and permissible levels 4 2 1 scenario a the optimal water allocation and yield under different water flow levels scenarios there are ten decision making units dmus for wheat field corn and seed corn where each dmu has the same soil type and crop type taking the scenario of q values 0 2 r is 0 5 and θ takes 0 3 as an example the optimal water allocation and yield are shown in fig 8 and 9 fig 8 indicates that the water allocation under high flow level is highest followed by medium and low flow levels for most dmus this is because the available water resources decrease with the reduction of flow levels and water allocation lessens with the decreased available water resources it also demonstrates that the deep infiltration dp diminishes with the reduction of flow levels for example the total water allocation of seed corn with t2 are 610 mm 526 mm and 508 mm and the dp are 150 5 mm 65 8 mm and 48 7 mm under three flow level respectively this can be explained by reasons that more water allocation results in higher soil water content and dp that occurs as the soil water content exceeds the field capacity this means excessive irrigation will lead to ineffective water losses e g dp thus limiting excessive dp is essential for water saving and improving water use efficiency moreover the water allocation of wheat with t3 is biggest followed by t4 and t1 this is because a higher difference between the field capacity and wilting point will result in bigger water stress and lower maximum water demand under the same irrigation scheduling fig 9 reveals that the yield of wheat with t3 is highest followed by t4 and t1 and the yield of field corn with t4 is biggest ranked by t3 and t1 and the yield of seed corn with t2 is highest ordered by t4 t3 and t1 this is because the four soil types have different field capacities and wilting points and thus cause different water stress and water stress will be higher under a bigger difference and has a negative effect on crop yield and thus the yield with t2 is biggest followed by the t4 t3 and t1 under the same irrigation scheduling the yield of wheat with t3 is larger than t4 which is caused by the water allocation pattern in the whole growth period the differences in water stress of t3 and t4 are relatively small under the same irrigation scheduling but the water stress of t3 and t4 exists for obvious differences under different irrigation scheduling and leads to various yield therefore the planting areas of wheat in t3 field corn in t4 and seed corn in t3 can be increased to enlarge the yield besides it implies that the yield has a nonlinear relationship with water allocation taking wheat with t3 as an example the water allocations present obvious differences but the yields are almost the same under three flow levels this regulation is also suitable for other crops under three flow levels this is because that soil water exchanges occur at the whole growth period and only the effective irrigation used for crop transpiration can increase the crop yield however the yield is not always positive with transpiration biomass under the impact of the harvest index hi that is affected by water stress and thus the yield is comprehensive effects of the biomass and hi for example the total water allocation of seed corn with t2 are 610 mm 526 mm 508 mm and the transpiration is 513 9 mm 514 mm 513 6 mm and the biomass is 22 073 22 075 22 054 ton hm2 and the hi is 0 441 0 441 0 442 and the yield is 9 74 9 741 9 75 ton hm2 for high medium and low flow levels separately it indicates that the transpiration is mostly the same under three flow levels caused by soil water exchanges and the hi presents the different tendency with biomass under three flow levels the yield is not proportional to transpiration under three flow levels after the comprehensive effects of biomass and hi it indicates that the target yields of most crops are satisfied and the unsatisfied target yield such as the wheat with t4 decreases with the flow levels this can be explained by reasons the water stress between two irrigation date intervals will be alleviated with the increase of water allocation contributing to the increase in yield it illustrates that optimizing irrigation water resources based on the crop growth regulation contributes to improving the yield 4 2 2 scenario b the optimal water allocation and yield under different water availability violated probabilities scenarios the water availability violated probabilities q correspond to various available water resources and further affect the optimal water allocation and yield and thus the effects of q on water allocation and yield are analyzed and the variation process of the objective function with iterations numbers under three q levels is shown in fig 10 and there are two groups of optimal water allocation schemes corresponding to the maximum permissible level under possibility case and the maximum permissible level under the necessary case separately except for subsection about analyzing differences in permissible levels between possibility case and necessary case section 4 3 the result analysis in other subsections is based on the optimal water allocation corresponding to the permissible level under the possibility case fig 11 is the optimal water allocation schemes under three q levels to avoid excessive dp the maximum allowable dp are set as 180 mm 170 mm and 160 mm for q taking 0 2 0 15 and 0 05 respectively where the dp is generally below the 20 of the maximum water allocation fao 61 it reveals that water allocations of dmus have no obvious variation tendencies with changes of q this is because water availability constraints do not take effect under the impacts of maximum allowable water shortage risk and allowable dp constraints besides the actual evapotranspiration eta is almost the same for each dmu under three q levels for example the eta of seed corn with t3 is 546 7 mm as q varies through its three levels this is because the differences in the soil water content at the whole growth period under three q levels are relatively small and further generate the same evapotranspiration there are three kinds of relationships between yield and eta shown in fig 12 the first case is that the yield is positive with eta under three q levels and the second case is that the eta keeps unchanged but the yield changes with the variations of q and the third case is that the eta and yield both stay unchanged under three q levels taking the wheat with t1 as an example the eta is 430 8 mm 431 4 mm and 428 4 mm respectively and the yields are 5 572 ton hm2 5 578 ton hm2 and 5 531 ton hm2 separately for q as 0 05 0 15 and 0 2 the yield presents a positive relationship with eta which is because higher eta results in bigger biomass and water stress does not trigger the obvious difference in hi among three q levels taking the field corn with t3 as an example the eta are all 546 7 mm but the yields are 10 491 ton hm2 10 492 ton hm2 and 10 49 ton hm2 for q as 0 05 0 15 and 0 2 respectively this is because the hi are different as q changes through its three levels and the detailed reasons are that the various water allocation patterns under three q levels lead to different soil water contents and water stresses meanwhile the sensitivity degrees of eta and hi on water stress are different taking the seed corn with t4 as an example eta and yield are all 569 7 mm and 9 499 ton hm2 as q varies from its three levels this could be explained by reasons that the water allocation patterns under three q levels cause similar soil water content and water stress not triggering differences in eta and yield in summary the yield is not only affected by the irrigation but also the soil water content and water stress therefore the water allocation should avoid ineffective water loss promise sufficient soil water content and reduce water stress 4 2 3 scenario c the optimal water allocation and yield under different allowable water shortage risk scenarios the allowable water shortage risk levels r are set as 0 47 0 5 and 0 52 to figure out the responses of water allocation and the yield on r fig 13 is the variation process of the permissible level under possibility case with iteration numbers as r varies through its three levels and q takes 0 15 and θ is 0 3 fig 14 is the optimal water allocation schemes with three r levels under medium flow level it shows that the wusi under three flow levels is below 0 5 indicating the risk control constraints can effectively avoid the excessive water shortage risk besides the wusi decreases with the reduction of flow levels this is because the water shortage index and the information entropy of water structure enlarge with increasing water allocation and the former is positive with the wusi and the latter is negative with the wusi and thus the wusi decreases with the reduction of flow levels after the comprehensive effects of water shortage index and information entropy of water structure moreover water allocation presents no obvious variation tendency as the r changes from its three levels caused by the maximum allowable dp constraints and the relationship between yield and eta is similar with the scenario b the effects of water shortage risk levels on water allocation and permissible levels are explored by running 3 groups with 100 initial individuals and one r value e g 0 47 0 5 and 0 52 and recording the eligible individuals besides maximum allowable dp constraints are not included in the model because they affect the water shortage risk the results of total water allocation permissible levels and the numbers of qualified individuals are shown in table 3 it reveals that the numbers of eligible individuals and total water allocation increase with the enlargement of r this is because the increased water shortage risk level softens the maximum allowable water shortage risk constraints and more water resources can be allocated and the original unqualified individuals with higher water allocation become eligible individuals the dp of some eligible individual reaches 230 mm which is because higher water shortage risk level generates more water allocation and further results in the unacceptable dp this also illustrates that even though the allowable maximum water shortage risk constraints can promise the reasonable water shortage it cannot control effectively the excessive dp and thus the two kinds of constraints are essential to guide irrigation water allocation the effects of the q on the system s outputs without maximum allowable water shortage risk and maximum allowable dp constraints are analyzed by running the 100 individuals and recording the qualified individuals the results of water allocation dp wusi and permissible level are shown in table 4 it shows the total water allocation wusi dp under three flow levels enlarge with the rise of q and their values are higher than the individuals with these two risk control constraints this is because the bigger q leads to higher water allocation and wusi and dp meanwhile the maximum allowable shortage risk control constraints and dp constraints limit the water allocation and further reduce the wusi and dp it illustrates that the wusi of some qualified individuals exceeds 0 52 which is caused by excessive water allocation and also indicates the maximum allowable water shortage risk constraints can effectively avoid unacceptable water shortage risk in addition permissible level under the possibility case improves with the growth of q this is because more water allocation will generate higher economic benefit and thus the higher permissible level in summary the permissible level under possibility case water allocation wusi and dp increase with the rise of q without the water shortage risk control and allowable maximum dp constraints it also indicates that the water shortage risk is contradictory with the permissible level and higher permissible level economic benefit also corresponds to the bigger water shortage risk 4 3 the permissible level under different pre determined objective probabilities scenarios the permissible level changes with the pre determined objective probabilities θ and thus the optimal water allocation schemes when q equals 0 15 r takes 0 5 and θ varies through its three levels are compared fig 15 is the variations of permissible level with iteration numbers as θ varies through its three levels it indicates that the permissible level increases as θ decreases this could be explained by reasons that the economic profit is closer to given target economic benefit with the increase of confidence levels 1 θ and higher economic profit generates bigger permissible level the sensitivity degree of θ on the permissible level is 0 0654 under the possibility and necessary cases it implies that the permissible levels under two cases increase 0 065 when θ fluctuates through its three levels it also discloses that the permissible level under the possibility case is larger than the permissible level under the necessary case implying that the optimal decision will result in a higher level of fulfillment of objective than a risk aversion decision 4 4 the comparison of the system s outputs under different risk parameters and risk levels table 5 is the optimal total water allocation yield wusi permissible level under the possibility and necessary cases under different q and r it reveals the total water allocation yield and wusi decrease as the reduction of flow levels this is because the available water resources lessen with decreases of flow levels however the system s outputs have no obvious relationship with q or r which is because of the maximum allowable dp constraints besides the sensitivity analysis method is used to measure the influence of a single risk parameter e g q r on the system s outputs which is shown in table 6 it demonstrates that the total water allocation under high flow level changes 170 2 104 m3 as the q changes through its three levels similarly the total water allocation enlarges 92 2 104 m3 and 154 59 104 m3 under medium and low flow levels respectively this means that the variations of water availability violated probability and water shortage risk in these ranges will change the above water allocation amounts it illustrates that the water availability violated probability has a more obvious effect on total water allocation than water shortage risk the yields under high flow level change 2 40 104 kg and 2 79 104 kg when q and r change through their separate three levels it indicates the water shortage risk has a more apparent influence on yield than the water availability violated probability and the permissible levels and wusi also increase with the variations of q and r therefore the variations of q and r result into increases in water allocation yield permissible levels but also cause higher water shortage risk and thus the obtained optimal water allocation schemes could tradeoff relationship amid water shortage risk water allocation yield and permissible levels the decision maker could select the corresponding water allocation schemes based on their preferences and risk attitudes 5 conclusion in this paper the distributed aquacrop simulation model optimization model framework is developed for irrigation water resources risk management under uncertainty the probabilistic possibilistic programming with fuzzy random coefficients chance constrained programming and the water uniform scarcity index is integrated with the distributed aquacrop model it can deal with the fuzzy random variables stochastic variables and the relationship between the objective function with fuzzy random variables and fuzzy goals through the permissible level besides it can explore the effects of different risk parameters and risk levels on the system s outputs further conducting irrigation water resources risk management moreover it can provide the optimal water allocation schemes based on the crop growth process and with consideration of multiple kinds of uncertainties and risks for managers the developed model is applied to a case study of the yingke district to optimize irrigation water resources under uncertainty and the results show that the proposed model can be a reliable and effective tool for addressing irrigated water allocation simulation optimization problem however the actual water allocation schemes can be affected by future climate change which can be dealt with by combing the developed model with the downscaled scenarios of climate change besides the agricultural water resources risk management in this paper can only deal with the on farm water resources and the off farm water resources should be integrated with the on farm water resources to conduct the agricultural risk management the above two problems will be dealt with in further studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10301,broomcorn millet panicum miliaceum l has been cultivated in arid or semi arid area due to its high drought tolerance yet information on how elevated atmospheric co2 concentration co2 affects the responses to drought of the productivity photosynthesis water use efficiency and drought tolerance of broomcorn millet is lacking we investigated the effects of elevated co2 and drought on gas

north china in 2015 and 2016 broomcorn millet was grown in pots with or without drought stress under ambient or elevated co2 elevated co2 could compensate the negative effect of drought on the leaf area and aboveground biomass of broomcorn millet this was attributed to the direct stimulation in photosynthesis due to increased carbon uptake under elevated co2 elevated co2 significantly enhanced the water use efficiency of broomcorn millet at both leaf and plant levels especially under drought condition elevated co2 did not significantly affect evapotranspiration but increased water use

photosynthesis for some c4 species e g maize sorghum and sugarcane only under mild but not severe drought stress gray et al 2016 some studies attributed this to the direct effects of elevated co2 on photosynthesis which is closely related to the intercellular co2 below the saturation point of a ci curve bundle sheath leakiness and immature c4 leaves conley et al 2001 allen et al 2011 however more studies concluded that elevated co2 might alleviate the negative impact of drought on photosynthesis of c4 species predominantly through the indirect effects on leaf water potential or non stomatal factors due to soil water conservation wall et al 2001 ainsworth and long 2005 leakey et al 2006 2009 joseph and leon 2009 morgan et al 2011 li et al 2019 an abrupt saturation at a relatively low intercellular co2 might confer c4 species some advantages relative to c3 species in particular higher wue osmond et al 1982 long 1999 under elevated co2 c4 species use water more efficiently through enhanced photosynthesis and or reduced transpiration according to the theory of optimal stomatal behavior especially under drought barton et al 2012 it has been shown that elevated co2 could improve water use efficiency of maize and sorghum grown under water stress due to a direct or indirect stimulation in photosynthesis wall et al 2001 allen et al 2011 other studies reported that the enhanced water use efficiency of c4 species grown under elevated co2 was mainly determined by the reduction in crop water use due to reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration conley et al 2001 chun et al 2011 apart from improving water use efficiency c4 species also develop other adaptive strategies to cope with drought stress including alteration in antioxidative defense metabolism against reactive oxygen species and osmotic adjustment razavi et al 2008 rosa et al 2009 hatata et al 2013 zinta et al 2014 naudts et al 2014 elevated co2 might alleviate the need for antioxidative defense and osmotic adjustment against drought tausz posch et al 2013 leading to high drought tolerance in crops zinta et al 2014 these drought mitigating effects of elevated co2 are important for crops growth under drought condition however the underlying mechanisms remain unclear especially for c4 species broomcorn millet is a c4 plant with a short growth period of 6 12 weeks high tolerance to low nitrogen and drought and high water use efficiency han et al 2019 liu et al 2020 gong et al 2020 it has been shown that elevated co2 enhances photosynthesis growth and yield of c4 broomcorn millet under well watered condition morgan et al 2011 hao et al 2017 however we know little about how elevated co2 would influence the responses to drought of the productivity photosynthesis water use efficiency and drought tolerance of broomcorn millet we hypothesized that elevated co2 would 1 mitigate the adverse effect of drought on photosynthesis and growth 2 enhance water use efficiency especially under drought and 3 improve drought tolerance by changing defense and acclimation pathways including alteration in psii efficiency antioxidant defense and membrane fluidity for broomcorn millet these hypotheses were investigated by quantifying the responses of photosynthesis water use efficiency at the leaf and plant levels leaf area biomass accumulation to drought and elevated co2 and identifying relationship of drought tolerance with physiological traits such as fluorescence content psii efficiency peroxidase pod malondialdehyde mda soluble sugar content under elevated co2 this information will help guide water management or breeding through improving the understanding of the mechanisms toward the drought response to elevated co2 for broomcorn millet under future climate 2 materials and

table 3 4 discussion elevated co2 stimulated the yield unpublished data and aboveground biomass of c4 broomcorn millet especially under drought leading to a significant drought mitigating effect of elevated co2 on the productivity of broomcorn millet this was consistent with studies on maize sorghum and sugarcane conducted in open top chamber and free air co2 enrichment experiments conley et al 2001 joseph and leon 2009 chun et al 2011 manderscheid et al 2014 theoretically photosynthesis of c4 species is saturated at the current co2 and thus might not be stimulated by elevated co2 ainsworth and long 2005 however we found a significant stimulation in photosynthesis due to increased co2 uptake as intercellular co2 rising especially under ambient co2 and a c4 like leaf anatomy for broomcorn millet this might imply broomcorn millet is a c3 c4 intermediate species von caemmerer 2000 also observed in foxtail millet li et al 2019 in the current study elevated co2 resulted in a direct simulation in p n due to increased the carbon uptake for broomcorn millet especially under drought this was consistent with previous studies on sorghum cousins et al 2001 ghannoum et al 2000 allen et al 2011 but not with other studies that attributed the stimulation in photosynthesis of sorghum under elevated co2 to the indirect effects of improved water status plant and or soil as a result of decreased stomatal conductance and leaf transpiration wall et al 2001 in the current study the drought mitigating effect of elevated co2 on photosynthesis might partially be associated with a feedback regulation by limited sink strength wilson et al 1999 zong and shangguan 2016 which might be related to limited root growth in a pot leakey et al 2009 this is evidenced by the reduced chlorophyll content but increased soluble sugar content and starch grains in chloroplast under normal water supply which was not observed under drought in the current study elevated co2 improved the water use efficiency of broomcorn millet especially under drought stress this was mainly ascribed to increased carbon uptake rather than reduced water use this was consistent with some studies wall et al 2001 barton et al 2012 manderscheid et al 2014 morgan et al 2011 but not with others conley et al 2001 chun et al 2011 we found that the improvement in water use efficiency at the leaf level was caused by both increased carbon uptake and reduced transpiration in contrast the improvement in water use efficiency at the plant level was mainly attributed to increased carbon uptake rather than reduced water use this was because elevated co2 did not significantly reduce evapotranspiration of broomcorn millet which was compensated by enhanced leaf growth especially under drought conditions this might imply that broomcorn millet may adapt to drought stress by reallocating carbon e g adjusting leaf area or partitioning more biomass towards root avila et al 2020 choudhary et al 2020 the response of psii

current study elevated co2 did not improve φ psii etr or qp of broomcorn millet which is in agreement with previous studies on alfalfa plants aranjuelo et al 2005 2008 elevated co2 has been shown to exert a drought mitigating effect on psii efficiency and further improve the defensive mechanism by altering antioxidative ability and osmotic adjustment for c3 plants salazar parra et al 2012 zinta et al 2014 naudts et al 2014 wang et al 2018 in contrast to these studies we found that drought caused a down regulation of psii efficiency of broomcorn millet by decreasing φ psii etr and qp but this negative effect was not offset by elevated co2 besides elevated co2 did not significantly affect pod mda proline or soluble sugar content under drought compared with under normal water supply therefore broomcorn millet did not improve its drought tolerance through changing defense and acclimation pathways under elevated co2 this might be as a result of a tradeoff between light absorbtion due to improved leaf growth i e increased leaf area and chlorophyll content and light dissipation due to increased carbon uptake stewart et al 2020 an in depth investigation of the underlying mechanisms should be warranted 5 conclusion elevated co2 can indeed compensate the negative effect of drought on growth of broomcorn millet leading to a drought mitigating effect on aboveground biomass this was mainly attributed to elevated co2 induced increase in carbon uptake which maintained a relatively high photosynthetic rate of broomcorn millet under drought elevated co2 enhanced the water use efficiency of broomcorn millet at the leaf and plant levels especially under drought owing to increased carbon uptake rather than reduced water use it appears unlikely that elevated co2 would improve the drought tolerance of broomcorn millet by changing defense and acclimation pathways including alteration in psii efficiency antioxidative defense capacity and membrane fluidity the productivity of dryland broomcorn millet will likely increase owing to enhanced water use efficiency through increasing carbon uptake in the future high co2 environment declaration of competing

north china in 2015 and 2016 broomcorn millet was grown in pots with or without drought stress under ambient or elevated co2 elevated co2 could compensate the negative effect of drought on the leaf area and aboveground biomass of broomcorn millet this was attributed to the direct stimulation in photosynthesis due to increased carbon uptake under elevated co2 elevated co2 significantly enhanced the water use efficiency of broomcorn millet at both leaf and plant levels especially under drought condition elevated co2 did not significantly affect evapotranspiration but increased water use

co2 concentration co2 is predicted to double by the end of the 21st century which might be accompanied by shifting precipitation patterns and increasing extreme precipitation events i e drought ghannoum 2009 ipcc 2013 elevated co2 has been widely shown to compensate the drought induced negative impact on growth and yield of c4 species leakey et al 2009 joseph and leon 2009 allen et al 2011 xu et al 2013 zinta et al 2014 van der kooi et al 2016 this compensation effect has been attributed to changes in the primary physiological and biochemical processes of co2 uptake poorter et al 1996 long 1999 but which is relatively less well understood for c4 species the c4 species possess a distinct pathway of photosynthesis from c3 species through which low atmospheric co2 could be concentrated to enable more efficient carboxylation reaction ameye et al 2012 liu et al 2013 naudts et al 2013 li et al 2013 drought causes inhibition of c4 photosynthesis due to stomatal limitation i

photosynthesis for some c4 species e g maize sorghum and sugarcane only under mild but not severe drought stress gray et al 2016 some studies attributed this to the direct effects of elevated co2 on photosynthesis which is closely related to the intercellular co2 below the saturation point of a ci curve bundle sheath leakiness and immature c4 leaves conley et al 2001 allen et al 2011 however more studies concluded that elevated co2 might alleviate the negative impact of drought on photosynthesis of c4 species predominantly through the indirect effects on leaf water potential or non stomatal factors due to soil water conservation wall et al 2001 ainsworth and long 2005 leakey et al 2006 2009 joseph and leon 2009 morgan et al 2011 li et al 2019 an abrupt saturation at a relatively low intercellular co2 might confer c4 species some advantages relative to c3 species in particular higher wue osmond et al 1982 long 1999 under elevated co2 c4 species use water more efficiently through enhanced photosynthesis and or reduced transpiration according to the theory of optimal stomatal behavior especially under drought barton et al 2012 it has been shown that elevated co2 could improve water use efficiency of maize and sorghum grown under water stress due to a direct or indirect stimulation in photosynthesis wall et al 2001 allen et al 2011 other studies reported that the enhanced water use efficiency of c4 species grown under elevated co2 was mainly determined by the reduction in crop water use due to reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration conley et al 2001 chun et al 2011 apart from improving water use efficiency c4 species also develop other adaptive strategies to cope with drought stress including alteration in antioxidative defense metabolism against reactive oxygen species and osmotic adjustment razavi et al 2008 rosa et al 2009 hatata et al 2013 zinta et al 2014 naudts et al 2014 elevated co2 might alleviate the need for antioxidative defense and osmotic adjustment against drought tausz posch et al 2013 leading to high drought tolerance in crops zinta et al 2014 these drought mitigating effects of elevated co2 are important for crops growth under drought condition however the underlying mechanisms remain unclear especially for c4 species broomcorn millet is a c4 plant with a short growth period of 6 12 weeks high tolerance to low nitrogen and drought and high water use efficiency han et al 2019 liu et al 2020 gong et al 2020 it has been shown that elevated co2 enhances photosynthesis growth and yield of c4 broomcorn millet under well watered condition morgan et al 2011 hao et al 2017 however we know little about how elevated co2 would influence the responses to drought of the productivity photosynthesis water use efficiency and drought tolerance of broomcorn millet we hypothesized that elevated co2 would 1 mitigate the adverse effect of drought on photosynthesis and growth 2 enhance water use efficiency especially under drought and 3 improve drought tolerance by changing defense and acclimation pathways including alteration in psii efficiency antioxidant defense and membrane fluidity for broomcorn millet these hypotheses were investigated by quantifying the responses of photosynthesis water use efficiency at the leaf and plant levels leaf area biomass accumulation to drought and elevated co2 and identifying relationship of drought tolerance with physiological traits such as fluorescence content psii efficiency peroxidase pod malondialdehyde mda soluble sugar content under elevated co2 this information

10302,a reasonable estimation of crop water uptake depth wud provides vital prerequisites for determining scientific irrigation scheduling however real time acquisition of crop wud to guide irrigation has not been reported in the current study a smart irrigation system based on real time soil moisture data was developed in which the dynamic crop wud was estimated using the spatiotemporal characteristics of soil moisture distributions subsequently the data of crop wud were acquired using a central irrigation controller to achieve a precise irrigation depth at each irrigation event a drip irrigation experiment for tomato lycopersicum esculentum planting was conducted in a greenhouse in northern china wireless soil moisture sensors were installed to collect real time soil moisture

published results the findings of this study highlight the importance of reasonable water saving irrigation scheduling and provide insights into the development of an efficient and automatic irrigation system keywords water saving irrigation automatic irrigation water uptake greenhouse tomato remote control 1 introduction the sustainable development of irrigated farming has been challenged by the increase in water resource shortages chen et al 2019 freire gonzález et al 2017 further global warming and the frequent occurrences of extreme climates have escalated the severity of this situation guo and shen 2016 henley et al 2019 knežević et al 2018 todorovic 2018 meanwhile with the rapid development of the global economy and large scale population migration from the countryside to the city the inevitable acceleration of industrialization and urbanization has considerably increased water resources requirements frisvold and konyar 2012 piao et al 2010 xu et al 2020 increasing industrial and urban water supply by reducing agricultural water use has gradually been recognized as an acceptable solution because approximately 70 of water withdrawals and more than 80 of water consumption originate from agricultural irrigation jägermeyr et al 2015 however population growth in turn demands the sustained growth of food production in the future which necessitates water inputs that can support irrigated agriculture although the application of desalinated seawater and reclaimed water can facilitate agricultural irrigation the high cost of desalination and the safety risk of reclaimed water hinder these irrigation applications gonzales gustavson et al 2019 martínez alvarez et al 2016 ventura et al 2019 wang et al 2017 therefore we should strive to ensure adequate food production by reducing irrigation water inputs efficient water saving irrigation schemes provide alternative opportunities to address this challenge albasha et al 2016 bell 2014 du et al 2008a li 2017 schiattone et al 2018 schwartz et al 2019 with these schemes owing to the considerably improved water use efficiency of crops the yield of crops is guaranteed even if irrigation water is insufficient numerous extant studies have confirmed the effectiveness of using water saving irrigation schemes for improving crop production with limited irrigation water inputs bell et al 2020 cantore et al 2016 capra et al 2008 du et al 2015 gajić et al 2018 li 2018 shi et al 2020 the theoretical basis for efficient water saving schemes is to enhance irrigation water use efficiency iwue through flexible and planned irrigation modes such as partial rootzone drying and regulated deficit irrigation the most significant advantage of these irrigation modes over traditional full irrigation is that they improve the soil water uptake performance of crop roots capra et al 2011 du et al 2006 2008b giuliani et al 2017 mary et al 2019 stagno et al 2015 theoretically the increased water uptake performance of crop roots is attributed to enhanced fine root development and regulated leaf stomatal conductance which are observed owing to the accumulation of root and leaf aba when partial roots are exposed to severe soil drying pérez pérez et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the aforementioned efficient irrigation schemes considerably help improve the water use efficiency of crops particularly in areas with water shortage and lack of automatic irrigation facilities however the development of these irrigation schemes requires complete consideration of the physiological water requirements of crops at different growth stages rendering it difficult to formulate these schemes bell et al 2018 benjamin et al 2015 campi et al 2019 tari 2016 furthermore mastering the specialized knowledge required is difficult for farmers several recent efforts to develop smart or intelligent irrigation systems have helped considerably improve the iwue of crops and reduced the requirements of farmers

an automatic irrigation system using electronic tensiometers in which the soil matric potential of 25 kpa was determined to obtain a commercial greenhouse zucchini yield of 15 kg m2 using an automatic irrigation system rodriguez ortega et al 2017 evaluated the effects of different temperatures on greenhouse tomato growth to suggest an optimal irrigation strategy for improving the iwue evidently the development of an automatic irrigation system combined with an efficient irrigation scheme can remarkably influence irrigated farming quantifying the dynamic variations of water uptake depth wud during the growth period of crops is critical to accurately determine the designed irrigation depth in a water saving irrigation event cai et al 2018 liao et al 2018 yadav and mathur 2008 irrigation performed at a reasonable designed irrigation depth can effectively avoid under or over irrigation in previous studies the designed irrigation depth was often empirically determined based on the crop variety and growth period in which the designed depth typically remains constant during different growth periods in fact the root of the crop grows constantly and the empirical simplification of the designed irrigation depth is inconsistent with the real growth rule of crops even in the same growth period the root length is as dynamic as the crop growth resulting in dynamic changes in the crop wud of the root therefore it may be feasible and promising to ensure high iwue via optimizing irrigation decision schemes e g performing precise irrigation according to the dynamic crop wud to achieve stabilized crop yield with reduced irrigation volume in this study we used real time soil moisture data to estimate the dynamic crop wud for guiding irrigation events where the entire process was controlled remotely by an automatic irrigation system tomato lycopersicum esculentum a globally important greenhouse economic crop was selected as the research object to verify the reliability of the established system the objectives of this study were to 1 propose a water saving irrigation decision scheme in which the dynamic tomato wud was used as the depth threshold of every irrigation event to avoid under or over irrigation 2 develop a smart irrigation system that automatically collected real time data and controlled every irrigation event following the irrigation decision scheme the significance of this study is the real time prediction of the dynamic wud of roots and precise irrigation through an automatic irrigation system which renders the irrigation operation easier for farmers and provides a novel direction for the development of irrigated agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental treatments we conducted a study in a tomato greenhouse 30 5 m 15 m in xiaotangshan beijing china fig 1a where the local average annual temperature is 10 13 c daily average sunshine hours are 6 5 8 5 h frost free period is approximately 186 200 d and annual average rainfall is 602 2 mm the south of the greenhouse was covered with transparent plastic film and the north was built with an insulation wall the transparent plastic film was equipped with an air inlet and a top window which were controlled via a motor to ventilate the greenhouse and adjust the temperature and humidity in addition the greenhouse was equipped with sunshade which can be used to vary the amount of light in the greenhouse the indoor meteorological data of the greenhouse were automatically recorded by a weather station ws1800 nertica china the average temperature and air humidity in the greenhouse were 25 6 c and 63 9 respectively during the experiment the field soil 0 80 cm in the greenhouse was classified as loam soil based on usda soil taxonomy with a kjeldahl n of 1 32 g kg olesen p of 54 53 mg kg available k of 117 5 mg kg ec of 31 88 ms m ph of 7 8 volumetric field capacity of 30 8 and soil density of 1 40 g cm3 the chemical properties of soil were determined following the procedures described in the handbook of soil agrochemical analysis bao 2000 in the perennial rotation of tomato and cucumber crop cycles a plastic film covered jiaxina tomato lycopersicum esculentum drip irrigation experiment controlled by an automatic irrigation system was conducted from april 2017 to july 2017 the greenhouse was partitioned equally into three plots each of which comprised six ridges area of 24 m2 length of 10 m and width of 2 4 m for each tomato was planted via a local traditional manner i e narrow wide rows cultivation in which the width of the ridge shoulder was 0 70 m and its height was 0 20 m further the spacing between the narrow rows was 0 50 m and that between the wide rows was 0 70 m fig 1b two rows of tomatoes were planted per ridge with a spacing of 0 30 m drip irrigation was applied to supply water where the drip belt was laid near the tomato root area along the length of the plot and each drip belt irrigated one row of tomato the emitters were of the non pressure compensating plated type with a flow rate of 0 95 l h and a spacing of 0 3 m on the laterals the operating pressure of the drip irrigation was 0 1 mpa and the irrigation water was filtered by a disc and screen filters each plot was equipped with a wireless valve control node and data acquisition node to control the irrigation events fig 1c a central irrigating controller was installed to process all the data collected and send the irrigation orders fig 1d each irrigation volume was measured using an ultrasonic flow meter diameter of φ2 5 resolution of 0 1 l and accuracy of 1 in the first field plot multiple layer soil moisture data of 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm were automatically collected using a 100 cm long wireless profile moisture sensor tmh 2000 china to obtain real time soil moisture distributions enabling the estimation of the dynamic tomato wud in this treatment the initial designed irrigation depth was set to 20 cm i e the irrigation event was conducted when the soil moisture at a depth of 20 cm reached the lower limit of the soil moisture 70 of the field water capacity the irrigation volume for each irrigation event was calculated using eqs 1 and 2 which will be described in detail later in the subsequent irrigation events the tomato wud was pre estimated based on real time soil moisture data to obtain the dynamic designed irrigation depth for guiding every irrigation event the second plot was set as an isolated zone to separate the experimental and control groups the third plot was equipped with a single layer soil moisture sensor stm 100 nercita china at a constant designed irrigation depth of 50 cm which was set as the control group for the treatment and control groups the irrigation scheduling methods were different however the other agronomic management measures of tomato were the same 2 2 water saving irrigation scheduling in this study real time soil moisture data were collected to estimate the dynamic crop wud and a smart and precise irrigation scheme was achieved by supplying water to the crop wud threby avoiding under or over irrigation the proposed irrigation decision scheme relies on the available soil moisture theory i e only the soil available water can be effectively utilized by crops the designed irrigation depth for each irrigation event was quantified using eq 1 and the associated irrigation volume was calculated using eq 2 to ensure an available soil moisture condition 90 and 70 of the field water capacity was set as the upper limit and the lower limit of each irrigation respectively 1 z w u d i where z is the designed irrigation depth cm wud i is the dynamic crop wud estimated from the real time soil moisture data at the ith irrigation event cm which is determined by calculating the consumption rate of moisture in this soil profile over a period of time for instance when the soil moisture at the designed irrigation depth in this study the initial designed irrigation depth was set as 20 cm reached the lower limit of soil moisture at time t a conditional equation i e θ tmax θ t t 0 01 was employed to estimate the crop wud using the collected real time soil moisture data for depths in the range of 0 80 cm where θ t is the soil moisture distributions for depths 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm at time t when the irrigation events should be conducted θ tmax is the maximum soil moisture distributions for depths 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm after the last irrigation event and t is the time elapsed h from tmax to t the threshold of 0 01 was determined by the test resolution of the moisture sensor we used this threshold may need to be adjusted if other moisture sensors used the conditional equation means that when the water uptake rate per hour between θ tmax and θ t at a certain soil depth is greater than 0 01 then the cropwud can be considered as to have reached this specific soil depth more details regarding the irrigation decision scheme in this study are as follows if the conditional equation θ tmax θ t t 0 01 holds for any specific soil depth e g 20 cm this specific depth is regarded as the crop wud i e wud i 20 cm if more than one depth satisfies the conditional equation the deepest depth is set as the crop wud e g if the conditional equation holds both at 20 40 and 60 cm then 60 cm will be set as the crop wud i e wud i 60 cm all the real time data were collected using wireless profile moisture sensors and the conditional equation was validated using the central irrigating controller hence we can estimate the tomato wud to determine the dynamic designed irrigation depth in real time enabling precise irrigation the volume for each irrigation event was calculated as follows 2 i 0 1 z γ p θ max θ min η where i is the irrigation volume mm z is the designed irrigation depth cm z wud i cm γ is the soil density g cm3 p is the percentage of wetted soil area that is based on the emitters outflow rates drip lines lay out and soil characteristics which was set as 60 in this study θ max and θ min are the upper and lower limits of each irrigation event respectively i e the irrigation event is performed when the soil moisture at the designed irrigation depth is reduced to θ min and the soil moisture at the designed irrigation depth is expected to be θ max after irrigation and η is the coefficient of drip irrigation water utilization which was 0 95 in this study 2 3 automatic irrigation system the automatic irrigation system comprises a central irrigation controller wireless sensor nodes wireless control nodes an irrigation system server and a remote irrigation monitoring app in which each component unit was arranged appropriately to ensure the timely efficient and intelligent management of irrigation events fig 2 the wireless profile moisture sensor nodes installed in the field first collected the real time soil moisture data and the collected data were transmitted to the central irrigation controller for evaluating the opportunity for irrigation when the soil moisture reaches the designed lower limit the central irrigation controller sends a reminder message to the user via the mobile app in the mobile app users can remotely perform an irrigation event through the wireless control nodes installed in the field in each irrigation event the irrigation volume is determined by the built in water saving irrigation decision scheme in other words the irrigation volume is automatically calculated by the central irrigation controller as per eq 2 furthermore the irrigation system server can record all these details and its data sharing capability enables a visual management via the mobile app hence users can monitor and manage the entire irrigation process through a smartphone which adapts to the fact that people engaged in agricultural production in the future can use a smartphone skillfully a logic diagram is shown below to illustrate the entire irrigation procedure fig 3 2 4 crop evapotranspiration etc yield and iwuey in this study et c mm d was calculated based on indoor meteorological im data of greenhouse and soil

real time monitoring of the soil moisture data in the profile the soil moisture distributions indicated evident spatiotemporal characteristics i e with the growth of tomato the soil moisture exhibited a ladder trend for 0 60 cm and a stable trend for 60 100 cm fig 4 the tomato wud can be determined using the characteristics of soil moisture distributions this approach is a better alternative to performing time consuming and labor intensive work to measure the root data as shown in fig 4 in the seeding stage all the soil moisture distributions maintained a relatively stable trend because of the limited water demand by tomato over time the increasing water demand by tomato caused variations in the soil moisture distributions i e the soil moisture for depths in the range of 0 20 cm started to decrease and that of other depths remained stable subsequently in the flowering and fruiting stages evident fluctuation characteristics were observed for depths in the range of 40 60 cm indicating that the tomato water uptake reached this depth accordingly the designed irrigation depth was determined to be 60 cm in the late fruiting and red ripe stages with further water demand by tomato evident fluctuation over a period of time were observed for depths in the range of 60 80 cm which demonstrated that the tomato water uptake might reach 80 cm therefore a depth of 80 cm was suggested to be a reasonable irrigation depth during this period based on the spatiotemporal characteristics of soil moisture distributions a fitted regression equation wud i 0 0119d 2 1 9387d 6 5795 r 2 0 89 was obtained to depict the dynamic tomato wud fig 4 a typical period from 5 3 5 11 which was between two irrigation events was selected to illustrate an example during this growth stage the tomato wud can be estimated to be 60 cm since the real time soil moisture distributions decrease below 60 cm and were constant for depths in the range of 60 100 cm fig 5 the water uptake property of tomato contributed to the variation in the soil moisture distributions below 60 cm in addition based on the collected soil moisture data the amount of water consumed by tomato in one day was calculated via the water balance method the results demonstrated that the amount of water consumed by tomato during the day 3 13 mm was 22 fold higher than that at night 0 14 mm 3 2 etc to validate the reliability of utilizing the soil moisture data to estimate the tomato wud real time soil moisture data collected every hour for 4 d of different growth stages were used as examples the tomato evapotranspiration et c was calculated based on real time soil moisture data and real time im data and a comparative analysis was conducted the soil water balance method was used to estimate the sm et c the modified penman monteith equation was applied to calculate the im et c which is typically regarded as a credible value to calculate the et c the obtained results including the sm et c and im et c are shown in fig 6 in the seeding stage the sm et c of tomato was relatively small at its initial period because the tomato had just been planted and the requirement for water was not completely activated however the sm et c increased gradually as the tomato grew on april 20th the sm et c 4 46 mm of tomato exceeded the corresponding im et c 1 34 mm and this trend was maintained throughout the subsequent growth periods in this study the im et c indicated characteristics of regular fluctuations whereas unstable fluctuations i e serrated shape features were observed in the sm et c several factors may cause an unstable sm et e including the test accuracy and frequency of the sensors although the values calculated using the two methods were not exactly the same the statistical results exhibited a significant p 0 01 linear regression relationship between the sm et e and im et c values at different growth stages verifying the reliability of using soil moisture data to estimate the tomato wud for guiding irrigation events 3 3 yield and iwue the yield and iwue of tomatoes are listed in table 1 in the automatic experiment plot based on the developed irrigation decision scheme i e the designed irrigation depth was determined at every irrigation event based on the dynamic tomato wud irrigation events were performed 11 times 231 mm during the entire growth period resulting in a yield of 9 51 kg m2 owing to less root growth the soil moisture for determining irrigation at the seedling stage was higher than the designed lower limit which was favorable for the early growth of roots in the control experiment plot based on the traditional irrigation decision scheme i e the designed irrigation depth was maintained at a constant value of 50 cm 13 irrigation events 238 mm were performed during the entire growth period resulting in a yield of 7 53 kg m2 consequently the iwue of the automatic irrigation 41 23 kg m3 was higher than that of the control treatment 31 58 kg m3 in addition several similar cases involving tomato irrigation experiments were summarized to present contrasting results table 2 for all these cases the iwue was less than 42 7 kg m3 except for one treatment wherein an iwue of 51 15 kg m3 was obtained the obtained iwue value 41 23 kg m3 of the developed irrigation system was relatively higher compared with those of the previous studies thereby further verifying the effectiveness and superiority of the automatic irrigation system over traditional methods from case 1 to case 3 although the irrigation events in case 4 were controlled by an automatic irrigation system its irrigation decision scheme based on a constant soil moisture threshold and the dynamic changes in tomato wud during different growth periods were not considered resulting in a lower iwue than that obtained in this study 4 discussion automatic irrigation equipment is critical for the development of irrigation agriculture in the future in recent years irrigation systems embedded with water saving irrigation decision schemes have been further developed to improve iwue giusti and marsili libelli 2015 osroosh et al 2015 xiao et al 2010 xu et al 2011 in this study a synthetic irrigation strategy combining an automatic irrigation equipment with a water saving irrigation decision scheme was developed to in turn facilitate the development of an automatic irrigation system a reasonable design was created to ensure the validity of the logical relationship and the orderly cooperation among various automatic irrigation equipment enabling laboratory scale user friendly and precise irrigation control compared with the constant designed irrigation depth estimated by experimental experience in previously published reports jianhui and shuzhen 2003 xuejun et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 the irrigation decision scheme indicated improvements as evident from the dynamic irrigation depth versus crop growth in every irrigation event although setting a constant irrigation depth can simplify and ease irrigation operation disregarding the actual depth of crop water uptake often results in less or more irrigation fiebig and dodd 2016 sakai et al 2015 in addition owing to the lack of wireless profile moisture sensors in the past wired probes with a datalogger were generally used to collect soil moisture data dos santos et al 2016 satchithanantham et al 2014 srivastava et al 2017 installing these wired probes in the soil profile is a time consuming and labor intensive work moreover the disjunction between the sensors and controller will result in an untimely and inadequate irrigation which hinders the development of automatic irrigation systems in this study wireless profile moisture sensors were employed to obtain real time soil moisture data these data were used to estimate the dynamic tomato wud which may be a reliable reference for the design of irrigation depth subsequently a precise irrigation decision scheme was established by supplying water to real time tomato wud to avoid under or over irrigation the proposed water saving irrigation decision scheme using dynamic tomato wud as the designed irrigation depth threshold for every irrigation event was based on the principle of available soil water content generally only water available in soil which can be effectively utilized by crop roots contributes to the crop yield whereas over irrigation water or under irrigation water will negatively affect the water use efficiency or yield liao et al 2019a salter and haworth 1961 replacing the empirically obtained values with the tomato wud greatly improved the irrigation accuracy and iwue the yields achieved for tomato in this study were 9 51 and 7 53 kg m2 for the developed automatic irrigation system using the dynamic irrigation depth and the control treatment applying the constant irrigation depth respectively furthermore the developed automatic irrigation system resulted in an enhanced iwue 41 23 kg m3 of the developed automatic irrigation system vs 31 58 kg m3 of the control treatment and required lesser irrigation volume 231 mm than the control treatment 238 mm in addition similar cases applying irrigation systems including automatic and manual irrigation systems to produce tomatoes have further confirmed the superiority of using the developed automatic irrigation system jianhui and shuzhen 2003 xuejun et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 zotarelli et al 2009 for example nine groups of treatments were designed with different irrigation times and irrigation volumes for a greenhouse tomato irrigation experiment in which the highest iwue of 51 15 kg m3 was obtained after 15 irrigation events 250 5 mm and that of the remaining eight groups were between 19 42 and 43 00 kg m3 with an average of 34 8 kg m3 xuejun et al 2010 other greenhouse tomato experiments applying various irrigation decision schemes including those based on et 0 zhang et al 2017 empirical irrigation regime jianhui and shuzhen 2003 and dynamic moisture zotarelli et al 2009 to produce tomatoes achieved the highest iwues of 37 26 20 25 and 42 7 kg m3 respectively which were lower than the iwue obtained in this study in summary compared with other irrigation decision schemes the developed smart drip irrigation system based on dynamic irrigation depth provides a promising solution for addressing the challenges of water shortage and food security 5 conclusion an automatic drip irrigation system including wireless moisture sensors wireless control nodes and a central irrigation controller was developed to perform irrigation events in a greenhouse tomato cultivation experiment compared with the previous irrigation decision schemes the designed irrigation depth was determined at every irrigation event based on the dynamic irrigation depth estimated from real time soil moisture data the spatiotemporal characteristics of soil moisture distributions helped obtain a reliable estimation of the tomato wud thereby enabling a precise and automatic control of the effective irrigation depth to avoid water leakage or deficiency a significant linear regression relationship p 0 01 between sm et c and im et c values was observed confirming the reliability of using real time soil moisture data to estimate the tomato wud the developed irrigation system realizes remote monitoring and control through the use of a mobile network and the network data sharing capability offered users a simple method i e using a smartphone to manage the irrigation events using this automatic irrigation system more yield was obtained with less irrigation water inputs and the iwue of tomatoes reached 41 23 kg m3 which was higher than that of the control treatment of 31 58 kg m3 moreover a comparative study demonstrated that the iwue of the developed irrigation system was almost higher than that reported in other studies this study reasonably estimated the tomato wud from the distribution characteristics of soil moisture in the profile providing a real time and effortless method to determine the dynamic designed irrigation depth for guiding irrigation events the performance of the profile moisture sensor is the key to achieving precision irrigation therefore the improvement of sensor test accuracy and resolution can further enhance the irrigation efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

10302,a reasonable estimation of crop water uptake depth wud provides vital prerequisites for determining scientific irrigation scheduling however real time acquisition of crop wud to guide irrigation has not been reported in the current study a smart irrigation system based on real time soil moisture data was developed in which the dynamic crop wud was estimated using the spatiotemporal characteristics of soil moisture distributions subsequently the data of crop wud were acquired using a central irrigation controller to achieve a precise irrigation depth at each irrigation event a drip irrigation experiment for tomato lycopersicum esculentum planting was conducted in a greenhouse in northern china wireless soil moisture sensors were installed to collect real time soil moisture data from a 0 100 cm soil profile soil moisture exhibited a ladder trend for 0 60 cm and a stable trend for 60 100 cm a regression equation wud i 0 0119d 2 1 9387d 6 5795 r 2 0 89 quantifying the dynamic depth of crop water uptake was successfully obtained based on the characteristics of soil moisture distribution and a water saving scheme i e irrigation to real time crop wud was determined to guide every irrigation event via a remote automatic irrigation system tomato evapotranspiration et calculated using soil moisture data was consistent with that calculated using indoor meteorological data confirming the reliability of real time soil moisture data for estimating the tomato wud the tomato irrigation water use efficiency iwue of the established system reached 41 23 kg m3 which was an evident improvement compared with that obtained using a traditional irrigation scheme 31 58 kg m3 in addition the iwue of tomato in the established system was almost approached that of the previously published results the findings of this study highlight the importance of reasonable water saving irrigation scheduling and provide insights into the development of an efficient and automatic irrigation system keywords water saving irrigation automatic irrigation water uptake greenhouse tomato remote control 1 introduction the sustainable development of irrigated farming has been challenged by the increase in water resource shortages chen et al 2019 freire gonzález et al 2017 further global warming and the frequent occurrences of extreme climates have escalated the severity of this situation guo and shen 2016 henley et al 2019 knežević et al 2018 todorovic 2018 meanwhile with the rapid development of the global economy and large scale population migration from the countryside to the city the inevitable acceleration of industrialization and urbanization has considerably increased water resources requirements frisvold and konyar 2012 piao et al 2010 xu et al 2020 increasing industrial and urban water supply by reducing agricultural water use has gradually been recognized as an acceptable solution because approximately 70 of water withdrawals and more than 80 of water consumption originate from agricultural irrigation jägermeyr et al 2015 however population growth in turn demands the sustained growth of food production in the future which necessitates water inputs that can support irrigated agriculture although the application of desalinated seawater and reclaimed water can facilitate agricultural irrigation the high cost of desalination and the safety risk of reclaimed water hinder these irrigation applications gonzales gustavson et al 2019 martínez alvarez et al 2016 ventura et al 2019 wang et al 2017 therefore we should strive to ensure adequate food production by reducing irrigation water inputs efficient water saving irrigation schemes provide alternative opportunities to address this challenge albasha et al 2016 bell 2014 du et al 2008a li 2017 schiattone et al 2018 schwartz et al 2019 with these schemes owing to the considerably improved water use efficiency of crops the yield of crops is guaranteed even if irrigation water is insufficient numerous extant studies have confirmed the effectiveness of using water saving irrigation schemes for improving crop production with limited irrigation water inputs bell et al 2020 cantore et al 2016 capra et al 2008 du et al 2015 gajić et al 2018 li 2018 shi et al 2020 the theoretical basis for efficient water saving schemes is to enhance irrigation water use efficiency iwue through flexible and planned irrigation modes such as partial rootzone drying and regulated deficit irrigation the most significant advantage of these irrigation modes over traditional full irrigation is that they improve the soil water uptake performance of crop roots capra et al 2011 du et al 2006 2008b giuliani et al 2017 mary et al 2019 stagno et al 2015 theoretically the increased water uptake performance of crop roots is attributed to enhanced fine root development and regulated leaf stomatal conductance which are observed owing to the accumulation of root and leaf aba when partial roots are exposed to severe soil drying pérez pérez et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the aforementioned efficient irrigation schemes considerably help improve the water use efficiency of crops particularly in areas with water shortage and lack of automatic irrigation facilities however the development of these irrigation schemes requires complete consideration of the physiological water requirements of crops at different growth stages rendering it difficult to formulate these schemes bell et al 2018 benjamin et al 2015 campi et al 2019 tari 2016 furthermore mastering the specialized knowledge required is difficult for farmers several recent efforts to develop smart or intelligent irrigation systems have helped considerably improve the iwue of crops and reduced the requirements of farmers

2017 these advantages include labor cost effectiveness water saving flexible irrigation schemes and easy controllability of irrigation recently osroosh et al 2015 developed an automated irrigation system based on an adaptive control algorithm to optimize the crop water stress index enabling the efficient water saving irrigation scheduling of apple trees further contreras et al 2017 established an automatic irrigation system using electronic tensiometers in which the soil matric potential of 25 kpa was determined to obtain a commercial greenhouse zucchini yield of 15 kg m2 using an automatic irrigation system rodriguez ortega et al 2017 evaluated the effects of different temperatures on greenhouse tomato growth to suggest an optimal irrigation strategy for improving the iwue evidently the development of an automatic irrigation system combined with an efficient irrigation scheme can remarkably influence irrigated farming quantifying the dynamic variations of water uptake depth wud during the growth period of crops is critical to accurately determine the designed irrigation depth in a water saving irrigation event cai et al 2018 liao et al 2018 yadav and mathur 2008 irrigation performed at a reasonable designed irrigation depth can effectively avoid under or over irrigation in previous studies the designed irrigation depth was often empirically determined based on the crop variety and growth period in which the designed depth typically remains constant during different growth periods in fact the root of the crop grows constantly and the empirical simplification of the designed irrigation depth is inconsistent with the real growth rule of crops even in the same growth period the root length is as dynamic as the crop growth resulting in dynamic changes in the crop wud of the root therefore it may be feasible and promising to ensure high iwue via optimizing irrigation decision schemes e g performing precise irrigation according to the dynamic crop wud to achieve stabilized crop yield with reduced irrigation volume in this study we used real time soil moisture data to estimate the dynamic crop wud for guiding irrigation events where the entire process was controlled remotely by an automatic irrigation system tomato lycopersicum esculentum a globally important greenhouse economic crop was selected as the research object to verify the reliability of the established system the objectives of this study were to 1 propose a water saving irrigation decision scheme in which the dynamic tomato wud was used as the depth threshold of every irrigation event to avoid under or over irrigation 2 develop a smart irrigation system that automatically collected real time data and controlled every irrigation event following the irrigation decision scheme the significance of this study is the real time prediction of the dynamic wud of roots and precise irrigation through an automatic irrigation system which renders the irrigation operation easier for farmers and provides a novel direction for the development of irrigated agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental treatments we conducted a study in a tomato greenhouse 30 5

vary the amount of light in the greenhouse the indoor meteorological data of the greenhouse were automatically recorded by a weather station ws1800 nertica china the average temperature and air humidity in the greenhouse were 25 6 c and 63 9 respectively during the experiment the field soil 0 80 cm in the greenhouse was classified as loam soil based on usda soil taxonomy with a kjeldahl n of 1 32 g kg olesen p of 54 53 mg kg available k of 117 5 mg kg ec of 31 88 ms m ph of 7 8 volumetric field capacity of 30 8 and soil density of 1 40 g cm3 the chemical properties of soil were determined following the procedures described in the handbook of soil agrochemical analysis bao 2000 in the perennial rotation of tomato and cucumber crop cycles a plastic film covered jiaxina tomato lycopersicum esculentum drip irrigation experiment controlled by an automatic irrigation system was conducted from april 2017 to july 2017 the greenhouse was partitioned equally into three plots each of which comprised six ridges area of 24 m2 length of 10 m and width of 2 4 m for each tomato was planted via a local traditional manner i e narrow wide rows cultivation in which the width of the ridge shoulder was 0 70 m and its height was 0 20 m further the spacing between the narrow rows was 0 50 m and that between the wide rows was 0 70 m fig 1b two rows of tomatoes were planted per ridge with a spacing of 0 30 m drip irrigation was applied to supply water where the drip belt was laid near the tomato root area along the length of the plot and each drip belt irrigated one row of tomato the emitters were of the non pressure compensating plated type with a flow rate of 0 95 l h and a spacing of 0 3 m on the laterals the operating pressure of the drip irrigation was 0 1 mpa and the irrigation water was filtered by a disc and screen filters each plot was equipped with a wireless valve control node and data acquisition node to control the irrigation events fig 1c a central irrigating controller was installed to process all the data collected and send the irrigation orders fig 1d each irrigation volume was measured using an ultrasonic flow meter diameter of φ2 5 resolution of 0 1 l and accuracy of 1 in the first field plot multiple layer soil moisture data of 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm were automatically collected using a 100 cm long wireless profile moisture sensor tmh 2000 china to obtain real time soil moisture distributions enabling the estimation of the dynamic tomato wud in this treatment the initial designed irrigation depth was set to 20 cm i e the irrigation event was conducted when the soil moisture at a depth of 20 cm reached the lower limit of the soil moisture 70 of the field water capacity the irrigation volume for each irrigation event was calculated using eqs 1 and 2 which will be described in detail later in the subsequent irrigation events the tomato wud was pre estimated based on real time soil moisture data to obtain the dynamic designed irrigation depth for guiding every irrigation event the second plot was set as an isolated zone to separate the experimental and control groups the third plot was equipped with a single layer soil moisture sensor stm 100 nercita china at a constant designed irrigation depth of 50 cm which was set as the control group for the treatment and control groups the irrigation scheduling methods were different however the other agronomic management measures of tomato were the same 2 2 water saving irrigation scheduling in this study real time soil moisture data were collected to estimate the dynamic crop wud and a smart and precise irrigation scheme was achieved by supplying water to the crop wud threby avoiding under or over irrigation the proposed irrigation decision scheme relies on the available soil moisture theory i e only the soil available water can be effectively utilized by crops the designed irrigation depth for each irrigation event was quantified using eq 1 and the associated irrigation volume was calculated using eq 2 to ensure an available soil moisture condition 90 and 70 of the field water capacity was set as the upper limit and the lower limit of each irrigation respectively 1 z w u d i where z is the designed irrigation depth cm wud i is the dynamic crop wud estimated from the real time soil moisture data at the ith irrigation event cm which is determined by calculating the consumption rate of moisture in this soil profile over a period of time for instance when the soil moisture at the designed irrigation depth in this study the initial designed irrigation depth was set as 20 cm reached the lower limit of soil moisture at time t a conditional equation i e θ tmax θ t t 0 01 was employed to estimate the crop wud using the collected real time soil moisture data for depths in the range of 0 80 cm where θ t is the soil moisture distributions for depths 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm at time t when the irrigation events should be conducted θ tmax is the maximum soil moisture distributions for depths 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm after the last irrigation event and t is the time elapsed h from tmax to t the threshold of 0 01 was determined by the test resolution of the moisture sensor we used this threshold may need to be adjusted if other moisture sensors used the conditional equation means that when the water uptake rate per hour between θ tmax and θ t at a certain soil depth is greater than 0 01 then the cropwud can be considered as to have reached this specific soil depth more details regarding the irrigation decision scheme in this study are as follows if the conditional equation θ tmax θ t t 0 01 holds for any specific soil depth e g 20 cm this specific depth is regarded as the crop wud i e wud i 20 cm if more than one depth satisfies the conditional equation the deepest depth is set as the crop wud e g if the conditional equation holds both at 20 40 and 60 cm then 60 cm will be set as the crop wud i e wud i 60 cm all the real time data were collected using wireless profile moisture sensors and the conditional equation was validated using the central irrigating controller hence we can estimate the tomato wud to determine the dynamic designed irrigation depth in real time enabling precise irrigation the volume for each irrigation event was calculated as follows 2 i 0 1 z γ p θ max θ min η where i is the irrigation volume mm z is the designed irrigation depth cm z wud i cm γ is the soil density g cm3 p is the percentage of wetted soil area that is based on the emitters outflow rates drip lines lay out and soil characteristics which was set as 60 in this study θ max and θ min are the upper and lower limits of each irrigation event respectively i e the irrigation event is performed when the soil moisture at the designed irrigation depth is reduced to θ min and the soil moisture at the designed irrigation depth is expected to be θ max after irrigation and η is the coefficient of drip irrigation water utilization which was 0 95 in this study 2 3 automatic irrigation system the automatic irrigation system comprises a central irrigation controller wireless sensor nodes wireless control nodes an irrigation system server and a remote irrigation monitoring app in which each component unit was arranged appropriately to ensure the timely efficient and intelligent management of irrigation events fig 2 the wireless profile moisture sensor nodes installed in the field first collected the real time soil moisture data and the collected data were transmitted to the central irrigation controller for evaluating the opportunity for irrigation when the soil moisture reaches the designed lower limit the central irrigation controller sends a reminder message to the user via the mobile app in the mobile app users can remotely perform an irrigation event through the wireless control nodes installed in the field in each irrigation event the irrigation volume is determined by the built in water saving irrigation decision scheme in other words the irrigation volume is automatically calculated by the central irrigation controller as per eq 2 furthermore the irrigation system server can record all these details and its data sharing capability enables a visual management via the mobile app hence users can monitor and manage the entire irrigation process through a smartphone which adapts to the fact that people engaged in agricultural production in the future can use a smartphone skillfully a logic diagram is shown below to illustrate the entire irrigation procedure fig 3 2 4 crop evapotranspiration etc yield and iwuey in this study et c mm d was calculated based on indoor meteorological im data of greenhouse and soil

real time monitoring of the soil moisture data in the profile the soil moisture distributions indicated evident spatiotemporal characteristics i e with the growth of tomato the soil moisture exhibited a ladder trend for 0 60 cm and a stable trend for 60 100 cm fig 4 the tomato wud can be determined using the characteristics of soil moisture distributions this approach is a better alternative to performing time consuming and labor intensive work to measure the root data as shown in fig 4 in the seeding stage all the soil moisture distributions maintained a relatively stable trend because of the limited water demand by tomato over time the increasing water demand by tomato caused variations in the soil moisture distributions i e the soil moisture for depths in the range of 0 20 cm started to decrease and that of other depths remained stable subsequently in the flowering and fruiting stages evident fluctuation characteristics were observed for depths in the range of 40 60 cm indicating that the tomato water uptake reached this depth accordingly the designed irrigation depth was determined to be 60 cm in the late fruiting and red ripe stages with further water demand by tomato evident fluctuation over a period of time were observed for depths in the range of 60 80 cm which demonstrated that the tomato water uptake might reach 80 cm therefore a depth of 80 cm was suggested to be a reasonable irrigation depth during this period based on the spatiotemporal characteristics of soil moisture distributions a fitted regression equation wud i 0 0119d 2 1 9387d 6 5795 r 2 0 89 was obtained to depict the dynamic tomato wud fig 4 a typical period from 5 3 5 11 which was between two irrigation events was selected to illustrate an example during this growth stage the tomato wud can be estimated to be 60 cm since the real time soil moisture distributions decrease below 60 cm and were constant for depths in the range of 60 100 cm fig 5 the water uptake property of tomato contributed to the variation in the soil moisture distributions below 60 cm in addition based on the collected soil moisture data the amount of water consumed by tomato in one day was calculated via the water balance method the results demonstrated that the amount of water consumed by tomato during the day 3 13 mm was 22 fold higher than that at night 0 14 mm 3 2 etc to validate the reliability of utilizing the soil moisture data to estimate the tomato wud real time soil moisture data collected every hour for 4 d of different growth stages were used as examples the tomato evapotranspiration et c was calculated based on real time soil moisture data and real time im data and a comparative analysis was conducted the soil water balance method was used to estimate the sm et c the modified penman monteith equation was applied to calculate the im et c which is typically regarded as a credible value to calculate the et c the obtained results including the sm et c and im et c are shown in fig 6 in the seeding stage the sm et c of tomato was relatively small at its initial period because the tomato had just been planted and the requirement for water was not completely activated however the sm et c increased gradually as the tomato grew on april 20th the sm et c 4 46 mm of tomato exceeded the corresponding im et c 1 34 mm and this trend was maintained throughout the subsequent growth periods in this study the im et c indicated characteristics of regular fluctuations whereas unstable fluctuations i e serrated shape features were observed in the sm et c several factors may cause an unstable sm et e including the test accuracy and frequency of the sensors although the values calculated using the two methods were not exactly the same the statistical results exhibited a significant p 0 01 linear regression relationship between the sm et e and im et c values at different growth stages verifying the reliability of using soil moisture data to estimate the tomato wud for guiding irrigation events 3 3 yield and iwue the yield and iwue of tomatoes are listed in table 1 in the automatic experiment plot based on the developed irrigation decision scheme i e the designed irrigation depth was determined at every irrigation event based on the dynamic tomato wud irrigation events were performed 11 times 231 mm during the entire growth period resulting in a yield of 9 51 kg m2 owing to less root growth the soil moisture for determining irrigation at the seedling stage was higher than the designed lower limit which was favorable for the early growth of roots in the control experiment plot based on the traditional irrigation decision scheme i e the designed irrigation depth was maintained at a constant value of 50 cm 13 irrigation events 238 mm were performed during the entire growth period resulting in a yield of 7 53 kg m2 consequently the iwue of the automatic irrigation 41 23 kg m3 was higher than that of the control treatment 31 58 kg m3 in addition several similar cases involving tomato irrigation experiments were summarized to present contrasting results table 2 for all these cases the iwue was less than 42 7 kg m3 except for one treatment wherein an iwue of 51 15 kg m3 was obtained the obtained iwue value 41 23 kg m3 of the developed irrigation system was relatively higher compared with those of the previous studies thereby further verifying the effectiveness and superiority of the automatic irrigation system over traditional methods from case 1 to case 3 although the irrigation events in case 4 were controlled by an automatic irrigation system its irrigation decision scheme based on a constant soil moisture threshold and the dynamic changes in tomato wud during different growth periods were not considered resulting in a lower iwue than that obtained in this study 4 discussion automatic irrigation equipment is critical for the development of irrigation agriculture in the future in recent years irrigation systems embedded with water saving irrigation decision schemes have been further developed to improve iwue giusti and marsili libelli 2015 osroosh et al 2015 xiao et al 2010 xu et al 2011 in this study a synthetic irrigation strategy combining an automatic irrigation equipment with a water saving irrigation decision scheme was developed to in turn facilitate the development of an automatic irrigation system a reasonable design was created to ensure the validity of the logical relationship and the orderly cooperation among various automatic irrigation equipment enabling laboratory scale user friendly and precise irrigation control compared with the constant designed irrigation depth estimated by experimental experience in previously published reports jianhui and shuzhen 2003 xuejun et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 the irrigation decision scheme indicated improvements as evident from the dynamic irrigation depth versus crop growth in every irrigation event although setting a constant irrigation depth can simplify and ease irrigation operation disregarding the actual depth of crop water uptake often results in less or more irrigation fiebig and dodd 2016 sakai et al 2015 in addition owing to the lack of wireless profile moisture sensors in the past wired probes with a datalogger were generally used to collect soil moisture data dos santos et al 2016 satchithanantham et al 2014 srivastava et al 2017 installing these wired probes in the soil profile is a time consuming and labor intensive work moreover the disjunction between the sensors and controller will result in an untimely and inadequate irrigation which hinders the development of automatic irrigation systems in this study wireless profile moisture sensors were employed to obtain real time soil moisture data these data were used to estimate the dynamic tomato wud which may be a reliable reference for the design of irrigation depth subsequently a precise irrigation decision scheme was established by supplying water to real time tomato wud to avoid under or over irrigation the proposed water saving irrigation decision scheme using dynamic tomato wud as the designed irrigation depth threshold for every irrigation event was based on the principle of available soil water content generally only water available in soil which can be effectively utilized by crop roots contributes to the crop yield whereas over irrigation water or under irrigation water will negatively affect the water use efficiency or yield liao et al 2019a salter and haworth 1961 replacing the empirically obtained values with the tomato wud greatly improved the irrigation accuracy and iwue the yields achieved for tomato in this study were 9 51 and 7 53 kg m2 for the developed automatic irrigation system using the dynamic irrigation depth and the control treatment applying the constant irrigation depth respectively furthermore the developed automatic irrigation system resulted in an enhanced iwue 41 23 kg m3 of the developed automatic irrigation system vs 31 58 kg m3 of the control treatment and required lesser irrigation volume 231 mm than the control treatment 238 mm in addition similar cases applying irrigation systems including automatic and manual irrigation systems to produce tomatoes have further confirmed the superiority of using the developed automatic irrigation system jianhui and shuzhen 2003 xuejun et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 zotarelli et al 2009 for example nine groups of treatments were designed with different irrigation times and irrigation volumes for a greenhouse tomato irrigation experiment in which the highest iwue of 51 15 kg m3 was obtained after 15 irrigation events 250 5 mm and that of the remaining eight groups were between 19 42 and 43 00 kg m3 with an average of 34 8 kg m3 xuejun et al 2010 other greenhouse tomato experiments applying various irrigation decision schemes including those based on et 0 zhang et al 2017 empirical irrigation regime jianhui and shuzhen 2003 and dynamic moisture zotarelli et al 2009 to produce tomatoes achieved the highest iwues of 37 26 20 25 and 42 7 kg m3 respectively which were lower than the iwue obtained in this study in summary compared with other irrigation decision schemes the developed smart drip irrigation system based on dynamic irrigation depth provides a promising solution for addressing the challenges of water shortage and food security 5 conclusion an automatic drip irrigation system including wireless moisture sensors wireless control nodes and a central irrigation controller was developed to perform irrigation events in a greenhouse tomato cultivation experiment compared with the previous irrigation decision schemes the designed irrigation depth was determined at every irrigation event based on the dynamic irrigation depth estimated from real time soil moisture data the spatiotemporal characteristics of soil moisture distributions helped obtain a reliable estimation of the tomato wud thereby enabling a precise and automatic control of the effective irrigation depth to avoid water leakage or deficiency a significant linear regression relationship p 0 01 between sm et c and im et c values was observed confirming the reliability of using real time soil moisture data to estimate the tomato wud the developed irrigation system realizes remote monitoring and control through the use of a mobile network and the network data sharing capability offered users a simple method i e using a smartphone to manage the irrigation events using this automatic irrigation system more yield was obtained with less irrigation water inputs and the iwue of tomatoes reached 41 23 kg m3 which was higher than that of the control treatment of 31 58 kg m3 moreover a comparative study demonstrated that the iwue of the developed irrigation system was almost higher than that reported in other studies this study reasonably estimated the tomato wud from the distribution characteristics of soil moisture in the profile providing a real time and effortless method to determine the dynamic designed irrigation depth for guiding irrigation events the performance of the profile moisture sensor is the key to achieving precision irrigation therefore the improvement of sensor test accuracy and resolution can further enhance the irrigation efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

10303,the reuse of treated wastewater for olive irrigation is becoming a common practice in areas with limited water resources however this water may contain high level of salts na and cl that could affect plant performances when used for a long period in order to enhance the tolerance of plants to salt stress induced by treated wastewater the application of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf may be a suitable solution in this study the ability of different amf inoculums to improve young olive plants olea europaea l cv chetoui performances under long term irrigation with treated wastewater was studied one year old olive trees inoculated with glomus deserticola and or gigaspora margarita were irrigated with treated wastewater for one year as compared to plants irrigated with tap water treated wastewater irrigation caused a significant decrease in relative water content rwc total fresh and dry weights gas exchange parameters and chlorophyll and starch contents nevertheless a significant increase in na and cl proline soluble sugars total polyphenols as well as flavonoids contents was observed under treated wastewater irrigation interestingly colonization with different amf inoculums particularly the 1 1 mixture of g deserticola and g margarita alleviated the negative effect of saline treated wastewater on young olive plants and significantly improved the above parameters in fact mycorrhizal symbiosis decreased the na and cl contents and improved the rwc the total fresh and dry weights and the photosynthetic activity furthermore mycorrhizal plants showed higher concentrations of proline and soluble sugars as well as higher antioxidant defense systems as compared to the non inoculated plants keywords olea europaea treated wastewater arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi salt stress gas exchange antioxidant defense system 1 introduction in mediterranean countries and especially in tunisia fresh water is a scarce resource whereas its demand is continuously increasing in these areas the reuse of treated wastewater in agricultural irrigation is an important management strategy to preserve water of high quality for domestic purposes pedrero et al 2013 this water is a rich source of macro and micronutrients that may improve plant growth and reduce the use of chemical fertilizers nicolás et al 2018 elfanssi et al 2018 reported that irrigation with treated wastewater during nine months increased the soil organic matter and n content which induced an increase in the leaf area plant length as well as the fresh and dry weights of alfalfa medicago sativa nevertheless treated wastewater may contain high concentration of salts such as na cl and heavy metals that may affect the physicochemical property of soil and cause deleterious effect on plant growth and productivity gómez bellot et al 2015a nicolás et al 2018 acosta motos et al 2017a expressed that the salinity of treated wastewater is considered as a harmful element that may cause disturbance in plant development in this context many authors had studied the effect of saline treated wastewater on several plants such as mandarin citrus clementina nicolás et al 2016 pedrero et al 2013 geranium pelargonium hortorum l h valdés et al 2015 and eugenia eugenia myrtifolia acosta motos et al 2017a these authors showed that irrigation with treated wastewater increased the soil salinization and sodification which resulted in reduced water absorption ability as well as disruption in the major metabolic processes of plants in such situation plants develop several mechanisms like osmolyte accumulation to alleviate the damage produced by salts or heavy metals present in irrigation water gómez bellot et al 2013 talaat and shawky 2014 in this respect to mitigate the negative effects induced by treated wastewater irrigation biological intervention such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf inoculation would be a sustainable option gómez bellot et al 2015a according to many authors amf may enhance plant growth and vigor through improving water and nutrient uptake smith and read 2008 kapoor et al 2017 furthermore amf have the potential to alleviate the negative effects induced by several abiotic stresses such as drought abbaspour et al 2012 ouledali et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a salinity porcel et al 2015 hashem et al 2018 and heavy metal contamination wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b under stressful conditions mycorrhizal symbiosis could improve plant tolerance by employing several mechanisms such as i increasing water and nutrient acquisition ii preventing the translocation of toxic ions and iii inducing biochemical and physiological changes abdel fattah and asrar 2012 talaat and shawky 2014 the effectiveness of amf association in protecting host plants against environmental stresses is highly dependent on the appropriate selection of the amf species and their interaction with host plants moreover it depends on the soil characteristics and the type of stress and its duration porras soriano et al 2009 gómez bellot et al 2015b olive tree olea europaea l is among the most important crops in the mediterranean basin and particularly in tunisia currently tunisia is the second largest producer of olive oil in the world after the european union with 83 million of olive trees grown on about 1 83 million hectares of land jackson et al 2015 boussadia et al 2018 ouledali et al 2018 the application of irrigation is becoming expanded in olive orchards and has led to the use of water of lower quality ghrab et al 2013 recently the volume of treated wastewater in tunisia increased from 6 million m3 in 1975 to 274 million m3 in 2018 and its use in agricultural purposes is becoming a common practice onas 2019 thus this alternative water resource could be used for olive crop irrigation the tunisian treated wastewater is a valuable source of nutrients but it contains high levels of salts 5 6 ds m 1 bedbabis and ferrara 2018 ben hassena et al 2018 therefore olive plant inoculation with amf could be effective in mitigating the negative effect of salinity caused by wastewater irrigation in fact this species is known to form arbuscular mycorrhizal associations and many studies have shown that amf inoculation improves the performance of olive tree under stressful conditions porras soriano et al 2009 khabou et al 2014 ouledali et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge there is no information regarding the effect of amf on olive plants performance under treated wastewater irrigation therefore this study focused on the impact of irrigation with treated wastewater on some physiological and biochemical responses of young olive plants o europaea cv chetoui the effectiveness of different amf inoculum including single glomus deserticola or gigaspora margarita and mixed amf a 1 1 mixture of g deserticola and g margarita in protecting young olive plants against salinity of treated wastewater was studied 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material mycorrhizal inoculation and water irrigation treatments the experiment was conducted at the olive tree institute of sfax tunisia 34 43 n 10 41 e uniform one year old olive plants olea europaea l cv chetoui previously cultivated on sterilized peat were transplanted into 20 l pots one plant per pot filled with sieved soil 75 88 sand 16 29 silt and 7 83 clay collected from the first 20 cm layer of the taous experimental station of the olive tree institute of sfax tunisia the soil was characterized by a ph of 8 1 an electrical conductivity of 0 626 ds m 1 and an organic matter content of 0 92 the soil was air dried and sterilized by autoclaving tuttnauer model 2540 usa for 30 min at 121 c before starting the experiment the roots of all plants were examined to verify the absence of endogenous mycorrhiza by staining the fine roots referring to the method of phillips and hayman 1970 at the time of transplanting young olive plants were individually inoculated with amf each pot was supplemented with 5 g of i glomus deserticola inoculum m1 ii gigaspora margarita inoculum m2 iii a 1 1 mixture of g deserticola and g margarita inoculum m1 m2 and iv 5 g of autoclaved m1 m2 inoculum for non mycorrhizal plants nm the amf used for young olive plants inoculation are commercial inoculum obtained from agrauxine biorize dijon france which consisted of spores and fragments of hyphae the inoculum was placed directly below the roots of each plant these two amf species were chosen as inoculum in this study due to their beneficial effect in mitigating the harmful effect of salt stress in many plants abdel fattah and asrar 2012 elhindi et al 2017 haque and matsubara 2018 after transplanting pots were kept under ambient environmental conditions with natural sunlight and temperature and they were covered with plastic film to prevent rain from affecting the experiment during the investigation the mean minimum air temperature ranged between 14 and 20 c and the mean maximum temperature ranged between 29 and 35 c the relative humidity varied from 53 to 74 all young olive plants were irrigated with tap water during two months of acclimation after this period the amf colonization was verified by staining the fine roots of inoculated and non inoculated olive plants according to the method described by phillips and hayman 1970 then plants were divided into 5 groups and subjected to the following treatments for one year may 2015 april 2016 i nm w1 non mycorrhizal olive plants irrigated with tap water ii nm w2 non mycorrhizal olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater iii m1 w2 olive plants inoculated with g deserticola and irrigated with treated wastewater iv m2 w2 olive plants inoculated with g margarita and irrigated with treated wastewater v m1 m2 w2 olive plants inoculated with a 1 1 mixture of g deserticola and g margarita and irrigated with treated wastewater the experiment was performed in a completely randomized design and each treatment was conducted with 7 young olive plants each plant was cultivated in a separate pot to give a total of 35 pots the tap water was the normal drinking water supplied by the tunisian national water distribution utility the treated wastewater was collected from the wastewater treatment plant located in the south of sfax this water comes from domestic and industrial effluents and is treated at the secondary level using biological processes at the beginning of the experimental period the maximum water holding capacity of used soil was determined each pot was irrigated with an excess volume of water covered with plastic film to prevent water evaporation and then left to equilibrate overnight until the drainage became negligible all pots were then weighed and the weight at field capacity was recorded acosta motos et al 2015 2017a during the experiment each plant was irrigated twice a week below the weight at field capacity to avoid the drainage it should be noted that drainage was applied only once during the experiment the absence of drainage induces an increase in the salinity of soil due to the long experimental period one year such practice will allow us to look at the ability of mycorrhizal symbiosis in alleviating the salt stress caused by treated wastewater irrigation in potted olive plants when no drainage was allowed 2 2 irrigation water analyses samples of tap water and treated wastewater were collected then filtered through the whatman no 42 filter paper and the chemical characteristics was determined according to the method of pauwels et al 1992 the ph and the electrical conductivity ec were measured with a ph meter istek ph 240l seoul korea and a conductivity meter wtw inolab cond 720 weilheim germany respectively the macronutrients concentrations na k and ca2 were determined by a flame spectrophotometry jenway pfp7 milan italy and the mg2 was determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometry perkinelmer wellesley ma usa moreover the micronutrient zn2 cu2 and fe2 and heavy metals cd2 and pb2 were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometry perkinelmer total phosphorus was measured by ultraviolet spectrometry jenway 6405 uv vis spectrophotometer milan italy inorganic nitrogen nh4 and no3 content was determined by titration with hcl after distillation and the chloride concentration was analyzed by mohr method pauwels et al 1992 2 3 soil analyses at the end of the experiment soil samples were collected from each treatment the soil moisture content was determined immediately after sampling by drying the sample in an oven at 105 c until a constant weight the loss in weight relative to oven dry weight constitute the soil moisture content concerning the other soil analysis soil samples were

the duncan test 3 results 3 1 irrigation water quality chemical analysis of irrigation water revealed that the ph of both tap water and treated wastewater were within the usual range 6 50 8 40 of fao guidelines for irrigation water fao 2003 the electrical conductivity of treated wastewater was higher than the corresponding value of tap water and above the threshold recommended by fao compared to tap water the treated wastewater contained high amounts of na and cl which may cause salinity problems for olive plants according to the guidelines suggested by chartzoulakis 2005 for olive irrigation in addition in comparison to tap water the obtained results showed that treated wastewater contained considerable amounts of n p and k which are essential for the growth and productivity of plants furthermore treated wastewater was rich in ca2 and mg2 but the concentration of micronutrients cu2 zn2 and fe2 and heavy metals cd2 and pb2 were relatively low and below the recommended concentrations of fao the chemical characteristics of irrigation water were provided as supplementary material 3 2 soil quality the quality of the soil collected from the different treatments was determined at the end of the experimental period results showed a significance increase in the moisture content of soil irrigated with treated wastewater as compared to nm w1 in nm w2 this increase was 18 in comparison to the value recorded in the nm w1 treatment soil inoculation with amf did not significantly affect the soil moisture content in all mycorrhizal treatments for the soil electrical conductivity irrigation with treated wastewater with high ec and without drainage application for a long period one year had induced a significant increase in the soil ec in comparison to the treatment irrigated with tap water in nm w1 treatment the ec was 4 29 ds m 1 while it was 12 13 ds m 1 in nm w2 the na and cl contents were significantly increased in all the soils irrigated with treated wastewater as compared to the nm w1 treatment the highest accumulation of na and cl were observed in nm w2 treatment 900 mg kg 1 na 488 66 mg kg 1 cl the inoculation of soil with amf had significantly reduced both the na and cl contents the reductions of na content in the soil were 15 17 and 9 in m1w2 m2w2 and m1 m2 w2 treatments respectively in comparison to nm w2 the cl concentration in the soil was declined by 10 18 and 21 respectively in the same treatments the soil quality parameters were also provided as supplementary material 3 3 mycorrhizal colonization the percentage of arbuscular mycorrhizal root colonization was determined at the end of the experiment no mycorrhizal colonization was found in the roots of non inoculated olive plants inoculation with m1 m2 or m1 m2 colonized successfully the roots of young olive plants the highest percentage of root colonization was recorded in young olive plants inoculated with m1 m2 the percentage of root colonization was also given as supplementary material 3 4 relative water content rwc fig 1 shows that irrigation with treated wastewater affected slightly the leaf relative water content rwc of young olive plants in fact although the rwc was significantly reduced the values remained relatively high as compared to the nm w1 treatment inoculation with different amf inoculums particularly m1 m2 contributed to an improvement in leaves rwc of plants irrigated with treated wastewater 3 5 na and cl contents in leaves and roots at the end of the experiment irrigation with treated wastewater caused a significant increase in both contents of na and cl in the leaves and roots of young olive plants as compared to the nm w1 plants the increment of na was about 114 and 96 respectively in the leaves and roots of nm w2 treated plants in comparison to the nm w1 treated plants in the same treatments the cl content increased by 131 and 108 respectively in the leaves and roots of young olive plants interestingly amf colonization resulted in the reduction of na and cl contents in young olive plant tissues among the amf treatments olive inoculation with m1 m2 was more effective in reducing the na and cl contents for instance the decrease of na and cl contents in the roots of young olive plants were about 31 and 39 respectively in comparison to the non mycorrhizal olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater the na and cl contents in the tissues of young olive plants were provided as supplementary material 3 6 total fresh and dry weights and mycorrhizal dependency results presented in table 1 showed that irrigation with treated wastewater significantly reduced the total fresh and dry weights of non mycorrhizal olive plants interestingly inoculation with m2 or m1 m2 significantly improved the total fresh and dry weights of olive plants irrigated with the treated wastewater the greater increase was recorded in olive plants inoculated with m1 m2 in fact the improvements of total fresh and dry weights in m1 m2 w2 treated plants were 47 and 36 respectively concerning young olive plants inoculated with m1 results showed a slight increase in both total fresh and dry weights as compared to the nm w2 treated plants but differences were not significant the improvement of total fresh and dry weights was highlighted by mycorrhizal dependency md in fact table 1 shows that young olive plants were dependent on amf colonization to mitigate the inhibitory effect of the irrigation with treated wastewater despite the non significant differences between the m2 w2 and m1 m2 w2 treatments the percentages of md based on fresh and dry weights were slightly higher in m1 m2 inoculated plants 3 7 gas exchange and chlorophyll content the net photosynthesis pn stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate e are presented in table 2 the obtained results showed that treated wastewater irrigation significantly decreased the gas exchange parameters of young olive plants as compared to the nm w1 plants the reduction rates of pn gs and e in nm w2 plants were 37 53 and 64 respectively interestingly mycorrhizal colonization significantly alleviated the adverse effects of the irrigation with treated wastewater among the amf treatments inoculation with m1 m2 was more effective in improving the gas exchange parameters of young olive plants in m1 m2 w2 treatment the improvement of pn gs and e were 37 73 and 112 respectively in comparison to the nm w2 treated plants the chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents in leaves of young olive plants under different irrigation treatments are presented in table 2 irrigation with treated wastewater during one year caused a significant decrease in the chlorophyll a and b synthesis in all young olive plants however the reduction was more apparent in non mycorrhizal than in mycorrhizal olive plants compared to nm w1 plants the decrease of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents were 50 and 62 respectively in nm w2 while it was only about 20 and 26 in m1 m2 w2 treatment 3 8 soluble sugars and starch contents the soluble sugars and starch contents in leaf and root tissues of young olive plants are presented in fig 2 in comparison to the nm w1 treatment young olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater showed a significant accumulation of soluble sugars content whereas the starch content was significantly decreased the highest soluble sugars content was observed in leaves and roots of the inoculated plants however mycorrhizal olive plants had the lowest starch content in both leaves and roots in the m1 m2 w2 treatment and in comparison to the nm w1 treatment the soluble sugars content increased in leaves by 76 and in roots by 94 in the m1 w2 treated plants the increase of soluble sugars content was 44 and 67 respectively in leaves and roots as compared to the nm w1 treated plants for starch content in comparison to nm w1 treatment the decrease was about 53 and 58 in leaves and 48 and 37 in the roots of m1 m2 w2 and m1 w2 treated plants respectively 3 9 proline content the proline content significantly increased in leaves and roots of both mycorrhizal and non mycorrhizal young olive plants under irrigation with treated wastewater fig 3 nevertheless the higher proline content was recorded in the mycorrhizal olive plants and this increase was more when plants were inoculated with m1 m2 in fact in nm w2 treated plants the increase of proline content was 42 and 34 in leaves and roots respectively as compared to nm w1 treatment however in comparison to nm w1 treated plants this increase was about 85 and 120 in leaves and 60 and 105 in roots respectively in m2 w2 and m1 m2 w2 treated plants 3 10 non enzymatic antioxidants contents fig 4 shows that irrigation with treated wastewater induced a greater synthesis of carotenoids total polyphenols and flavonoids in both leaves and roots of young olive plants this increase was more pronounced in mycorrhizal olive plants particularly in plants inoculated with m1 m2 in fact in leaves of the m1 m2 w2 treatment the mycorrhization significantly increased carotenoids by 19 total polyphenols by 36 and total flavonoids by 53 when compared to the nm w2 treated plants the increase of these non enzymatic antioxidants in leaves of m2 w2 treated plants were 14 24 and 26 for carotenoids total polyphenols and total flavonoids contents respectively as compared to the nm w2 plants 4 discussion in the current study irrigation during one year with saline treated wastewater has affected some soil chemical properties the soil ec and the na and cl contents were increased in comparison to the soil irrigated with tap water and as a result a reduction in the water absorption by roots of young olive plants was observed in fact compared to nm w1 treatment an increase in the moisture content of soil irrigated with treated wastewater was detected generally the increase of soil salinity generates osmotic pressure around the plants roots which consequently prevents an efficient uptake of water rahimi et al 2019 gómez bellot et al 2020 however amf inoculation decreased the na and cl concentrations in the soil irrigated with treated wastewater in comparison to the non inoculated treatment thus inoculated olive plants have absorbed more na and cl from the soil which consequently contributed in detoxifying the soil and improving its quality similar observations were reported by yan et al 2012 in degraded soil cultivated by mycorrhizal cucumber cucumis sativus many studies investigating the role of amf colonization in protecting host plants against salinity have showed that amf may develop several mechanisms like i selective uptake of toxic ions na and cl from the soil ii compartmentalization of toxic ions in vacuoles iii storing of toxic ions in the fungus or iv dilution of na and cl due to a higher biomass of host plants porcel et al 2012 evelin et al 2019 as the soil salinity prevents the absorption of water and nutrients by plants some physiological disorders can be imposed in the present study after one year of saline treated wastewater irrigation a slight reduction of rwc was observed in leaves of young olive plants similar results were observed by acosta motos et al 2014 in myrtus communis plants irrigated with three levels of saline reclaimed water ec 1 7 4 and 8 ds m 1 generally salinity cause an osmotic stress and perturbs the uptake of water by plant roots however in this study the rwc was maintained relatively high 88 this result may confirm the capacity of olive tree in preserving an appropriate leaf water status elloumi et al 2016 such response could be due to an effective stomatal control or a high accumulation of compatible solutes that provides cellular osmotic adjustment interestingly amf inoculation has increased the rwc in leaves of young olive plants in fact many researchers showed that amf symbiosis could improve the water uptake ability in host plants chen et al 2017 hashem et al 2018 this improvement could be due to better extraction of water by extra radical hyphae that exploit smaller soil pores ouledali et al 2018 furthermore the bioavailability of na and cl in the soil irrigated by wastewater as well as the absence of drainage during the investigation have resulted in higher uptake and accumulation of these toxic ions in leaves and roots of young olive plants this accumulation was similarly reported by acosta motos et al 2017a in eugenia irrigated with saline treated wastewater during 23 weeks in the present work the na and cl distribution also showed a higher accumulation of these ions in roots than in leaves of young olive plants such behavior was likewise observed by several authors studying the response of olive tree under salt conditions chartzoulakis 2005 bader et al 2015 elloumi et al 2016 according to these authors olive tree is characterized by its efficient mechanism in the retention of toxic ions in roots to limit its transport into the aerial parts photosynthetically active the decrease of na and cl contents observed in the roots and mainly in the leaves of the mycorrhizal plants showed that amf are able to prevent the cellular accumulation of toxic ions which is very beneficial for the development of host plants under saline conditions caused by the treated wastewater irrigation these results corroborate previous findings of vicente sánchez et al 2014 in lettuce lactuca sativa irrigated with saline treated wastewater ec 4 19 ds m 1 na 662 30 ppm and inoculated with glomus iranicum in addition according to the obtained results the reduction of na and cl contents observed both in the soil and tissues of all mycorrhizal treatments indicate that the ability of mycorrhizal olive plants to tolerate the salinity may be explained by the high biomass that lead to a dilution of toxic ions the osmotic and ionic disorders caused by salinity of treated wastewater has induced various growth problems in fact at the end of the experiment the total fresh and dry weights of young olive plants cultivated in pots were reduced several authors have studied the effect of treated wastewater irrigation on biomass production of many species tak et al 2013 belhaj et al 2016 houda et al 2016 acosta motos et al 2017a elfanssi et al 2018 but different results were recorded according to these studies the effect of treated wastewater irrigation on plants seems to be dependent to many factors such as the species the chemical characteristics of treated wastewater the surrounding environmental conditions and the irrigation period gómez bellot et al 2013 as was reported by rugini and fedeli 1990 and chartzoulakis 2005 olive tree is considered as moderately tolerant to salinity and irrigation water with ec above 5 5 ds m 1 may cause serious problems therefore in the present study osmotic and ionic disorders observed in the treatments irrigated with wastewater could be explained by the high level of salts and the absence of drainage during the experiment which caused a reduction in cell division and elongation and consequently a decrease in biomass of young olive plants in the present work under wastewater treatments amf colonization has significantly improved the total fresh and dry weights of young olive plants in comparison to the non mycorrhizal ones this improvement proved the positive effect of mycorrhizal symbiosis in alleviating the negative effect produced by the salinity of treated wastewater on the plant biomass in this context many researchers have reported the beneficial effect of amf in improving the plant biomass production under saline conditions porcel et al 2015 chen et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in accordance with the obtained results this improvement in mycorrhizal olive plants could be due to the enhancement of water uptake by external mycelium and the reduction of na and cl accumulation in the aerial parts of young olive plants indeed referring to hameed et al 2014 the extraradical mycelium network that surround the root system of host plants enlarge the soil surface explored by the roots for a better acquisition of water and essential nutrients this high uptake will thereby enhance the plant growth and development under stressful conditions in this study mixed amf inoculation resulted in a greater fresh and dry weight values in comparison to single amf inoculation which suggest the presence of a synergistic interaction between m1 and m2 in accordance with results of total fresh and dry weights young olive plants showed a significant decline in gas exchange parameters pn gs and e and chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents under irrigation with treated wastewater such results could be related to the salt stress caused by this water similar findings were observed by valdés et al 2015 in geranium exposed to four levels of saline treated wastewater irrigation ec 5 5 5 6 and 6 5 ds m 1 during three months generally under salinity conditions the decrease of photosynthesis may be the result of stomatal closure to limit water loss by transpiration which may alter the stomatal conductance and thereby the co2 diffusion gómez bellot et al 2013 besides the decrease of photosynthetic capacity may also be related to non stomatal factors such as alteration of photosynthetic electron chain inactivation of the activity of enzyme like rubisco and decrease in photosynthetic proteins concentration hu et al 2013 valdés et al 2015 acosta motos et al 2017b furthermore for the chlorophyll biosynthesis the decline of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents could be the result of i increase in the activity of degrading enzyme chlorophyllase and ii inhibition of the biosynthesis of delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis valdés et al 2015 belhaj et al 2016 interestingly the obtained results showed a significant improvement in gas exchange parameters and chlorophyll contents of mycorrhizal olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater in comparison to the non mycorrhizal ones thus the present findings showed that mycorrhizal inoculation may mitigate the salt stress caused by treated wastewater irrigation as previously reported by gómez bellot et al 2015a in laurustinus viburnum tinus and vicente sánchez et al 2014 in lettuce irrigated by saline treated wastewater ec above 4 ds m 1 for ten months and three months respectively the improvement in photosynthetic capacity of mycorrhizal olive plants might be due to the enhancement of rwc and biomass production as well as the decrease of na and cl contents in olive tissues similarly gómez bellot et al 2015b suggest that amf inoculation improve the chlorophyll content and gas exchange parameters by suppressing the uptake of na moreover the high concentrations of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in mycorrhizal olive plants reflected the high rate of photosynthesis which is considered necessary to support the carbon cost of mycorrhizal symbiosis talaat and shawky 2014 in the present work the enhancement of gas exchange parameters and chlorophyll biosynthesis was more appreciable in olive plants inoculated with m1 m2 which is positively linked to the level of colonization with amf thereby it may be concluded that m1 m2 colonization would result of a synergistic interaction in improving the photosynthetic capacity of young olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater in response to the harmful effect of saline treated wastewater young olive plants tend to enhance the osmoprotectants synthesis such behavior is an important mechanism of plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses indeed in this investigation irrigation with treated wastewater significantly increased the soluble sugars and proline contents but decreased the starch content both in leaves and roots of young olive plants similarly gupta et al 2010 and saad allah and elhaak 2017 noted an enhancement in soluble sugars contents respectively in taro colocasia esculenta and black nightshade solanum nigrum irrigated with treated wastewater in the other hand hashem et al 2013 observed an accumulation of proline in tomato solanum lycopersicum adversely affected by treated wastewater irrigation during 100 days according to these authors accumulation of soluble sugars and proline in wastewater irrigated plants could be considered as an indicator of physiological disorder due to osmotic stress and may serve as osmoregulators to enhance water uptake and maintain water homeostasis thus in this study the soluble sugars generation by starch degradation and the proline accumulation explain the maintained proper hydration level of young olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater interestingly mycorrhization significantly enhanced the soluble sugars and proline contents both in leaves and roots of young olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater in contrast the starch content has decreased the obtained findings suggest that amf could mitigate the adverse effect of salinity caused by treated wastewater irrigation by inducing the accumulation of soluble sugars and proline in young olive plants tissues referring to measurements of rwc the accumulation of these osmolytes has maintained an adequate water status in plants due to their important role in osmoregulation which had consequently improved the photosynthetic capacity and the physiological performance of stressed plants the soluble sugars accumulation was similarly observed by ismaiel et al 2014 in faba bean vicia faba irrigated with wastewater and inoculated with amf such behavior could be due to i the sink effect of amf demanding sugars from host plants tissues and ii the hydrolysis of starch into soluble sugars in colonized olive plants evelin et al 2009 for proline talaat and shawky 2014 explained the accumulation of this osmolyte in mycorrhizal wheat triticum aestivum exposed during 70 days to salinity 4 7 and 9 4 ds m 1 as an improvement of plant fitness to salt conditions many researchers have shown that stressed plants possess a number of antioxidant mechanisms like non enzymatic antioxidants that serve as reactive oxygen species ros scavengers to prevent oxidative damage ksouri et al 2007 abbaspour et al 2012 the obtained results showed that young olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater significantly accumulated higher contents of total polyphenols and total flavonoids than the nm w1 treatment similar increment of total polyphenols and flavonoids contents was reported by saad allah and elhaak 2017 in black nightshade that was negatively affected by wastewater irrigation the high amounts of total polyphenols may be explained by the increase in the production of some enzymes responsible for phenolic metabolism michalak 2006 besides the flavonoids are the main and most complex subgroup of total polyphenols and the genes involved in its biosynthesis are also induced under stressful conditions winkel shirley 2002 mycorrhizal colonization significantly enhanced the carotenoids the total polyphenols and the total flavonoids contents in young olive plants particularly when inoculated with m1 m2 such enhancement may prove the beneficial role of amf in alleviating the oxidative injuries occurring in young olive plants irrigated with saline treated wastewater the positive role played by mycorrhizal symbiosis in improving the carotenoids content of plants under saline conditions was also reported by hashem et al 2016 in mycorrhizal soybean glycine max plants cultivated in saline soil 7 12 ds m 1 for 60 days referring to fester et al 2002 the increase of carotenoids content in this work could be due to the fact that amf stimulate the transcription of a specific gene involved in carotenoid biosynthesis furthermore hart et al 2015 showed that amf act as a carbon drain on host plants which consequently increase the carotenoids biosynthesis in addition many reports have showed that amf induced the accumulation of total polyphenols and flavonoids under several stressful conditions abbaspour et al 2012 chen et al 2013 indeed chen et al 2013 reported that high amounts of these compounds in mycorrhizal plants is due to i inducing effect of amf on the activity of enzymes associated with secondary metabolism ii stimulating effect of amf on the expression of genes related to secondary metabolites synthesis 5 conclusions the irrigation with saline treated wastewater for one year altered the physiological performances of potted young olive plants cv chetoui in fact accumulation of salts in soil of the treatments irrigated with wastewater caused an osmotic and ionic disorders in young olive plants as a result a decrease in biomass production and photosynthetic capacity were observed in those plants in response to these harmful effects young olive plants tend to accumulate proline and soluble sugars and activate their non enzymatic antioxidant defense system carotenoids total polyphenols and flavonoids interestingly amf inoculation improved the tolerance of olive plants to the high level of salinity in treated wastewater in fact amf increased the biomass production through suppressing the uptake of toxic ions and ameliorating the water status photosynthetic capacity osmoticum contents and non enzymatic antioxidant defense system of inoculated plants the alleviation of the negative effects was more efficient when young olive plants were inoculated with m1 m2 which may prove the presence of a synergistic interaction between m1 and m2 therefore to avoid salinity problems caused by continuous irrigation with treated wastewater in olive fields the application of amf as a biological process could be a sustainable solution to guarantee an optimal growth and productivity of olive trees furthermore colonization with dual amf species would be more efficient in ameliorating olive plants

10303,the reuse of treated wastewater for olive irrigation is becoming a common practice in areas with limited water resources however this water may contain high level of salts na and cl that could affect plant performances when used for a long period in order to enhance the tolerance of plants to salt stress induced by treated wastewater the application of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf may be a suitable solution in this study the ability of different amf inoculums to improve young olive plants olea europaea l cv chetoui performances under long term irrigation with treated wastewater was studied one year old olive trees inoculated with glomus deserticola and or gigaspora margarita were irrigated with treated wastewater for one year as compared to plants irrigated with tap water treated wastewater irrigation caused a significant decrease in relative water content rwc total fresh and dry weights gas exchange parameters and chlorophyll and starch contents nevertheless a significant increase in na and cl proline soluble sugars total polyphenols as well as flavonoids contents was observed under treated wastewater irrigation interestingly colonization with different amf inoculums particularly the 1 1 mixture of g deserticola and g margarita alleviated the negative effect of saline treated wastewater on young olive plants and significantly improved the above parameters in fact mycorrhizal symbiosis decreased the na and cl contents and improved the rwc the total fresh and dry weights and the photosynthetic activity furthermore mycorrhizal plants showed higher concentrations of proline and soluble sugars as well as higher antioxidant defense systems as compared to the non inoculated plants keywords olea europaea treated wastewater arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi salt stress gas exchange antioxidant defense system 1 introduction in mediterranean countries and especially in tunisia fresh water is a scarce resource whereas its demand is

al 2013 this water is a rich source of macro and micronutrients that may improve plant growth and reduce the use of chemical fertilizers nicolás et al 2018 elfanssi et al 2018 reported that irrigation with treated wastewater during nine months increased the soil organic matter and n content which induced an increase in the leaf area plant length as well as the fresh and dry weights of alfalfa medicago sativa nevertheless treated wastewater may contain high concentration of salts such as na cl and heavy metals that may affect the physicochemical property of soil and cause deleterious effect on plant growth and productivity gómez bellot et al 2015a nicolás et al 2018 acosta motos et al 2017a expressed that the salinity of treated wastewater is considered as a harmful element that may cause disturbance in plant development in this context many authors had studied the effect of saline treated wastewater on several plants such as mandarin citrus clementina nicolás et al 2016 pedrero et al 2013 geranium pelargonium hortorum l h valdés et al 2015 and eugenia eugenia myrtifolia acosta motos et al 2017a these authors showed that irrigation with treated wastewater increased the soil salinization and sodification which resulted in reduced water absorption ability as well as disruption in the major metabolic processes of plants in such situation plants develop several mechanisms like osmolyte accumulation to alleviate the damage produced by salts or heavy metals present in irrigation water gómez bellot et al 2013 talaat and shawky 2014 in this respect to mitigate the negative effects induced by treated wastewater irrigation biological intervention such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf inoculation would be a sustainable option gómez bellot et al 2015a according to many authors amf may enhance plant growth and vigor through improving water and nutrient uptake smith and read 2008 kapoor et al 2017 furthermore amf have the potential to alleviate the negative effects induced by several abiotic stresses such as drought abbaspour et al 2012 ouledali et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a salinity porcel et al 2015 hashem et al 2018 and heavy metal contamination wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b under stressful conditions mycorrhizal symbiosis could improve plant tolerance by employing several mechanisms such as i increasing water and nutrient acquisition ii preventing the translocation of toxic ions and iii inducing biochemical and physiological changes abdel fattah and asrar 2012 talaat and shawky 2014 the effectiveness of amf association in protecting host plants against environmental stresses is highly dependent on the appropriate selection of the amf species and their interaction with host plants moreover it depends on the soil characteristics and the type of stress and its duration porras soriano et al 2009 gómez bellot et al 2015b olive tree olea europaea l is among the most important crops in the mediterranean basin and particularly in tunisia currently tunisia is the second largest producer of olive oil in the world after the european union with 83 million of olive trees grown on about 1 83 million hectares of land jackson et al 2015 boussadia et al 2018 ouledali et al 2018 the application of irrigation is becoming expanded in olive orchards and has led to the use of water of lower quality ghrab et al 2013 recently the volume of treated wastewater in tunisia increased from 6 million m3 in 1975 to 274 million m3 in 2018 and its use in agricultural purposes is becoming a common practice onas 2019 thus this alternative water resource could be used for olive crop irrigation the tunisian treated wastewater is a valuable source of nutrients but it contains high levels of salts 5 6 ds m 1 bedbabis and ferrara 2018 ben hassena et al 2018 therefore olive plant inoculation with amf could be effective in mitigating the negative effect of salinity caused by wastewater irrigation in fact this species is known to form arbuscular mycorrhizal associations and many studies have shown that amf inoculation improves the performance of olive tree under stressful conditions porras soriano et al 2009 khabou et al 2014 ouledali et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge there is no information regarding the effect of amf on olive plants performance under treated wastewater irrigation therefore this study focused on the impact of irrigation with treated wastewater on some physiological and biochemical responses of young olive plants o europaea cv chetoui the effectiveness of different amf inoculum including single glomus deserticola or gigaspora margarita and mixed amf a 1 1 mixture of g deserticola and g margarita in protecting young olive plants against salinity of treated wastewater was studied 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material mycorrhizal inoculation and water irrigation treatments the experiment was conducted at the olive tree institute of sfax tunisia 34 43 n 10 41 e uniform one year old olive plants olea europaea l cv chetoui previously cultivated on sterilized peat were transplanted into 20 l pots one plant per pot filled with sieved soil 75 88 sand 16 29 silt and 7 83 clay collected from the first 20 cm layer of the taous experimental station of the olive tree institute of sfax tunisia the soil was characterized by a ph of 8 1 an electrical conductivity of 0 626 ds m 1 and an organic matter content of 0 92 the soil was air dried and sterilized by autoclaving tuttnauer model 2540 usa for 30 min at 121 c before starting the experiment the roots of all plants were examined to verify the absence of endogenous mycorrhiza by staining the fine roots referring to the method of phillips and hayman 1970 at the time of transplanting young olive plants were individually inoculated with amf each pot was supplemented with 5 g of i glomus deserticola inoculum m1 ii gigaspora margarita inoculum m2 iii a 1 1 mixture of g deserticola and g margarita inoculum m1 m2 and iv 5 g of autoclaved m1 m2 inoculum for non mycorrhizal plants nm the amf used for young olive plants inoculation are commercial inoculum obtained from agrauxine biorize dijon france which consisted of spores and fragments of hyphae the inoculum was placed directly below the roots of each plant these two amf species were chosen as inoculum in this study due to their beneficial effect in mitigating the harmful effect of salt stress in many plants abdel fattah and asrar 2012 elhindi et al 2017 haque and matsubara 2018 after transplanting pots were kept under ambient environmental conditions with natural sunlight and temperature and they were covered with plastic film to prevent rain from affecting the experiment during the investigation the mean minimum air temperature ranged between 14 and 20 c and the mean maximum temperature ranged between 29 and 35 c the relative humidity varied from 53 to 74 all young olive plants were irrigated with tap water during two months of acclimation after this period the amf colonization was verified by staining the fine roots of inoculated and non inoculated olive plants according to the method described by phillips and hayman 1970 then plants were divided into 5 groups and subjected to the following treatments for one year may 2015 april 2016 i nm w1 non mycorrhizal olive plants irrigated with tap water ii nm w2 non mycorrhizal olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater iii m1 w2 olive plants inoculated with g deserticola and irrigated with treated wastewater iv m2 w2 olive plants inoculated with g margarita and irrigated with treated wastewater v m1 m2 w2 olive plants inoculated with a 1 1 mixture of g deserticola and g margarita and irrigated with treated wastewater the experiment was performed in a completely randomized design and each treatment was conducted with 7 young olive plants each plant was cultivated in a separate pot to give a total of 35 pots the tap water was the normal drinking water supplied by the tunisian national water distribution utility the treated wastewater was collected from the wastewater treatment plant located in the south of sfax this water comes from domestic and industrial effluents and is treated at the secondary level using biological processes at the beginning of the experimental period the maximum water holding capacity of used soil was determined each pot was irrigated with an excess volume of water covered with plastic film to prevent water evaporation and then left to equilibrate overnight until the drainage became negligible all pots were then weighed and the weight at field capacity was recorded acosta motos et al 2015 2017a during the experiment each plant was irrigated twice a week below the weight at field capacity to avoid the drainage it should be noted that drainage was applied only once during the experiment the absence of drainage induces an increase in the salinity of soil due to the long experimental period one year such practice will allow us to look at the ability of mycorrhizal symbiosis in alleviating the salt stress caused by treated wastewater irrigation in potted olive plants when no drainage was allowed 2 2 irrigation water analyses samples of tap water and treated wastewater were collected then filtered through the whatman no 42 filter paper and the chemical characteristics was determined according to the method of pauwels et al

the duncan test 3 results 3 1 irrigation water quality chemical analysis of irrigation water revealed that the ph of both tap water and treated wastewater were within the usual range 6 50 8 40 of fao guidelines for irrigation water fao 2003 the electrical conductivity of treated wastewater was higher than the corresponding value of tap water and above the threshold recommended by fao compared to tap water the treated wastewater contained high amounts of na and cl which may cause salinity problems for olive plants according to the guidelines suggested by chartzoulakis 2005 for olive irrigation in addition in comparison to tap water the obtained results showed that treated wastewater contained considerable amounts of n p and k which are essential for the growth and productivity of plants furthermore treated wastewater was rich in ca2 and mg2 but the concentration of micronutrients cu2 zn2 and fe2 and heavy metals cd2 and pb2 were relatively low and below the recommended concentrations of fao the chemical characteristics of irrigation water were provided as supplementary material 3 2 soil quality the quality of the soil collected from the different treatments was determined at the end of the experimental period results showed a significance increase in the moisture content of soil irrigated with treated wastewater as compared to nm w1 in nm w2 this increase was 18 in comparison to the value recorded in the nm w1 treatment soil inoculation with amf did not significantly affect the soil moisture content in all mycorrhizal treatments for the soil electrical conductivity irrigation with treated wastewater with high ec and without drainage application for a long period one year had induced a significant increase in the soil ec in comparison to the treatment irrigated with tap water in nm w1 treatment the ec was 4 29 ds m 1 while it was 12 13 ds m 1 in nm w2 the na and cl contents were significantly increased in all the soils irrigated with treated wastewater as compared to the nm w1 treatment the highest accumulation of na and cl were observed in nm w2 treatment 900 mg kg 1 na 488 66 mg kg 1 cl the inoculation of soil with amf had significantly reduced both the na and cl contents the reductions of na content in the soil were 15 17 and 9 in m1w2 m2w2 and m1 m2 w2 treatments respectively in comparison to nm w2 the cl concentration in the soil was declined by 10 18 and 21 respectively in the same treatments the soil quality parameters were also provided as supplementary material 3 3 mycorrhizal colonization the percentage of arbuscular mycorrhizal root colonization was determined at the end of the experiment no mycorrhizal colonization was found in the roots of non inoculated olive plants inoculation with m1 m2 or m1 m2 colonized successfully the roots of young olive plants the highest percentage of root colonization was recorded in young olive plants inoculated with m1 m2 the percentage of root colonization was also given as supplementary material 3 4 relative water content rwc fig 1 shows that irrigation with treated wastewater affected slightly the leaf relative water content rwc of young olive plants in fact although the rwc was significantly reduced the values remained relatively high as compared to the nm w1 treatment inoculation with different amf inoculums particularly m1 m2 contributed to an improvement in leaves rwc of plants irrigated with treated wastewater 3 5 na and cl contents in leaves and roots at the end of the experiment irrigation with treated wastewater caused a significant increase in both contents of na and cl in the leaves and roots of young olive plants as compared to the nm w1 plants the increment of na was about 114 and 96 respectively in the leaves and roots of nm w2 treated plants in comparison to the nm w1 treated plants in the same treatments the cl content increased by 131 and 108 respectively in the leaves and roots of young olive plants interestingly amf colonization resulted in the reduction of na and cl contents in young olive plant tissues among the amf treatments olive inoculation with m1 m2 was more effective in reducing the na and cl contents for instance the decrease of na and cl contents in the roots of young olive plants were about 31 and 39 respectively in comparison to the non mycorrhizal olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater the na and cl contents in the tissues of young olive plants were provided as supplementary material 3 6 total fresh and dry weights and mycorrhizal dependency results presented in table 1 showed that irrigation with treated wastewater significantly reduced the total fresh and dry weights of non mycorrhizal olive plants interestingly inoculation with m2 or m1 m2 significantly improved the total fresh and dry weights of olive plants irrigated with the treated wastewater the greater increase was recorded in olive plants inoculated with m1 m2 in fact the improvements of total fresh and dry weights in m1 m2 w2 treated plants were 47 and 36 respectively concerning young olive plants inoculated with m1 results showed a slight increase in both total fresh and dry weights as compared to the nm w2 treated plants but differences were not significant the improvement of total fresh and dry weights was highlighted by mycorrhizal dependency md in fact table 1 shows that young olive plants were dependent on amf colonization to mitigate the inhibitory effect of the irrigation with treated wastewater despite the non significant differences between the m2 w2 and m1 m2 w2 treatments the percentages of md based on fresh and dry weights were slightly higher in m1 m2 inoculated plants 3 7 gas exchange and chlorophyll content the net photosynthesis pn stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate e are presented in table 2 the obtained results showed that treated wastewater irrigation significantly decreased the gas exchange parameters of young olive plants as compared to the nm w1 plants the reduction rates of pn gs and e in nm w2 plants were 37 53 and 64 respectively interestingly mycorrhizal colonization significantly alleviated the adverse effects of the irrigation with treated wastewater among the amf treatments inoculation with m1 m2 was more effective in improving the gas exchange parameters of young olive plants in m1 m2 w2 treatment the improvement of pn gs and e were 37 73 and 112 respectively in comparison to the nm w2 treated plants the chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents in leaves of young olive plants under different irrigation treatments are presented in table 2 irrigation with treated wastewater during one year caused a significant decrease in the chlorophyll a and b synthesis in all young olive plants however the reduction was more apparent in non mycorrhizal than in mycorrhizal olive plants compared to nm w1 plants the decrease of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents were 50 and 62 respectively in nm w2 while it was only about 20 and 26 in m1 m2 w2 treatment 3 8 soluble sugars and starch contents the soluble sugars and starch contents in leaf and root tissues of young olive plants are presented in fig 2 in comparison to the nm w1 treatment young olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater showed a significant accumulation of soluble sugars content whereas the starch content was significantly decreased the highest soluble sugars content was observed in leaves and roots of the inoculated plants however mycorrhizal olive plants had the lowest starch content in both leaves and roots in the m1 m2 w2 treatment and in comparison to the nm w1 treatment the soluble sugars content increased in leaves by 76 and in roots by 94 in the m1 w2 treated plants the increase of soluble sugars content was 44 and 67 respectively in leaves and roots as compared to the nm w1 treated plants for starch content in comparison to nm w1 treatment the decrease was about 53 and 58 in leaves and 48 and 37 in the roots of m1 m2 w2 and m1 w2 treated plants respectively 3 9 proline content the proline content significantly increased in leaves and roots of both mycorrhizal and non mycorrhizal young olive plants under irrigation with treated wastewater fig 3 nevertheless the higher proline content was recorded in the mycorrhizal olive plants and this increase was more when plants were inoculated with m1 m2 in fact in nm w2 treated plants the increase of proline content was 42 and 34 in leaves and roots respectively as compared to nm w1 treatment however in comparison to nm w1 treated plants this increase was about 85 and 120 in leaves and 60 and 105 in roots respectively in m2 w2 and m1 m2 w2 treated plants 3 10 non enzymatic antioxidants contents fig 4 shows that irrigation with treated wastewater induced a greater synthesis of carotenoids total polyphenols and flavonoids in both leaves and roots of young olive plants this increase was more pronounced in mycorrhizal olive plants particularly in plants inoculated with m1 m2 in fact in leaves of the m1 m2 w2 treatment the mycorrhization significantly increased carotenoids by 19 total polyphenols by 36 and total flavonoids by 53 when compared to the nm w2 treated plants the increase of these non enzymatic antioxidants in leaves of m2 w2 treated plants were 14 24 and 26 for carotenoids total polyphenols and total flavonoids contents respectively as compared to the nm w2 plants 4 discussion in the current study irrigation during one year with saline treated wastewater has affected some soil chemical properties the soil ec and the na and cl contents were increased in comparison to the soil irrigated with tap water and as a result a reduction in the water absorption by roots of young olive plants was observed in fact compared to nm w1 treatment an increase in the moisture content of soil irrigated with treated wastewater was detected generally the increase of soil salinity generates osmotic pressure around the plants roots which consequently prevents an efficient uptake of water rahimi et al 2019 gómez bellot et al 2020 however amf inoculation decreased the na and cl concentrations in the soil irrigated with treated wastewater in comparison to the non inoculated treatment thus inoculated olive plants have absorbed more na and cl from the soil which consequently contributed in detoxifying the soil and improving its quality similar observations were reported by yan et al 2012 in degraded soil cultivated by mycorrhizal cucumber cucumis sativus many studies investigating the role of amf colonization in protecting host plants against salinity have showed that amf may develop several mechanisms like i selective uptake of toxic ions na and cl from the soil ii compartmentalization of toxic ions in vacuoles iii storing of toxic ions in the fungus or iv dilution of na and cl due to a higher biomass of host plants porcel et al 2012 evelin et al 2019 as the soil salinity prevents the absorption of water and nutrients by plants some physiological disorders can be imposed in the present study after one year of saline treated wastewater irrigation a slight reduction of rwc was observed in leaves of young olive plants similar results were observed by acosta motos et al 2014 in myrtus communis plants irrigated with three levels of saline reclaimed water ec 1 7 4 and 8 ds m 1 generally salinity cause an osmotic stress and perturbs the uptake of water by plant roots however in this study the rwc was maintained relatively high 88 this result may confirm the capacity of olive tree in preserving an appropriate leaf water status elloumi et al 2016 such response could be due to an effective stomatal control or a high accumulation of compatible solutes that provides cellular osmotic adjustment interestingly amf inoculation has increased the rwc in leaves of young olive plants in fact many researchers showed that amf symbiosis could improve the water uptake ability in host plants chen et al 2017 hashem et al 2018 this improvement could be due to better extraction of water by extra radical hyphae that exploit smaller soil pores ouledali et al 2018 furthermore the bioavailability of na and cl in the soil irrigated by wastewater as well as the absence of drainage during the investigation have resulted in higher uptake and accumulation of these toxic ions in leaves and roots of young olive plants this accumulation was similarly reported by acosta motos et al 2017a in eugenia irrigated with saline treated wastewater during 23 weeks in the present work the na and cl distribution also showed a higher accumulation of these ions in roots than in leaves of young olive plants such behavior was likewise observed by several authors studying the response of olive tree under salt conditions chartzoulakis 2005 bader et al 2015 elloumi et al 2016 according to these authors olive tree is characterized by its efficient mechanism in the retention of toxic ions in roots to limit its transport into the aerial parts photosynthetically active the decrease of na and cl contents observed in the roots and mainly in the leaves of the mycorrhizal plants showed that amf are able to prevent the cellular accumulation of toxic ions which is very beneficial for the development of host plants under saline conditions caused by the treated wastewater irrigation these results corroborate previous findings of vicente sánchez et al 2014 in lettuce lactuca sativa irrigated with saline treated wastewater ec 4 19 ds m 1 na 662 30 ppm and inoculated with glomus iranicum in addition according to the obtained results the reduction of na and cl contents observed both in the soil and tissues of all mycorrhizal treatments indicate that the ability of mycorrhizal olive plants to tolerate the salinity may be explained by the high biomass that lead to a dilution of toxic ions the osmotic and ionic disorders caused by salinity of treated wastewater has induced various growth problems in fact at the end of the experiment the total fresh and dry weights of young olive plants cultivated in pots were reduced several authors have studied the effect of treated wastewater irrigation on biomass production of many species tak et al 2013 belhaj et al 2016 houda et al 2016 acosta motos et al 2017a elfanssi et al 2018 but different results were recorded according to these studies the effect of treated wastewater irrigation on plants seems to be dependent to many factors such as the species the chemical characteristics of treated wastewater the surrounding environmental conditions and the irrigation period gómez bellot et al 2013 as was reported by rugini and fedeli 1990 and chartzoulakis 2005 olive tree is considered as moderately tolerant to salinity and irrigation water with ec above 5 5 ds m 1 may cause serious problems therefore in the present study osmotic and ionic disorders observed in the treatments irrigated with wastewater could be explained by the high level of salts and the absence of drainage during the experiment which caused a reduction in cell division and elongation and consequently a decrease in biomass of young olive plants in the present work under wastewater treatments amf colonization has significantly improved the total fresh and dry weights of young olive plants in comparison to the non mycorrhizal ones this improvement proved the positive effect of mycorrhizal symbiosis in alleviating the negative effect produced by the salinity of treated wastewater on the plant biomass in this context many researchers have reported the beneficial effect of amf in improving the plant biomass production under saline conditions porcel et al 2015 chen et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in accordance with the obtained results this improvement in mycorrhizal olive plants could be due to the enhancement of water uptake by external mycelium and the reduction of na and cl accumulation in the aerial parts of young olive plants indeed referring to hameed et al 2014 the extraradical mycelium network that surround the root system of host plants enlarge the soil surface explored by the roots for a better acquisition of water and essential nutrients this high uptake will thereby enhance the plant growth and development under stressful conditions in this study mixed amf inoculation resulted in a greater fresh and dry weight values in comparison to single amf inoculation which suggest the presence of a synergistic interaction between m1 and m2 in accordance with results of total fresh and dry weights young olive plants showed a significant decline in gas exchange parameters pn gs and e and chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents under irrigation with treated wastewater such results could be related to the salt stress caused by this water similar findings were observed by valdés et al 2015 in geranium exposed to four levels of saline treated wastewater irrigation ec 5 5 5 6 and 6 5 ds m 1 during three months generally under salinity conditions the decrease of photosynthesis may be the result of stomatal closure to limit water loss by transpiration which may alter the stomatal conductance and thereby the co2 diffusion gómez bellot et al 2013 besides the decrease of photosynthetic capacity may also be related to non stomatal factors such as alteration of photosynthetic electron chain inactivation of the activity of enzyme like rubisco and decrease in photosynthetic proteins concentration hu et al 2013 valdés et al 2015 acosta motos et al 2017b furthermore for the chlorophyll biosynthesis the decline of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents could be the result of i increase in the activity of degrading enzyme chlorophyllase and ii inhibition of the biosynthesis of delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis valdés et al 2015 belhaj et al 2016 interestingly the obtained results showed a significant improvement in gas exchange parameters and chlorophyll contents of mycorrhizal olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater in comparison to the non mycorrhizal ones thus the present findings showed that mycorrhizal inoculation may mitigate the salt stress caused by treated wastewater irrigation as previously reported by gómez bellot et al 2015a in laurustinus viburnum tinus and vicente sánchez et al 2014 in lettuce irrigated by saline treated wastewater ec above 4 ds m 1 for ten months and three months respectively the improvement in photosynthetic capacity of mycorrhizal olive plants might be due to the enhancement of rwc and biomass production as well as the decrease of na and cl contents in olive tissues similarly gómez bellot et al 2015b suggest that amf inoculation improve the chlorophyll content and gas exchange parameters by suppressing the uptake of na moreover the high concentrations of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in mycorrhizal olive plants reflected the high rate of photosynthesis which is considered necessary to support the carbon cost of mycorrhizal symbiosis talaat and shawky 2014 in the present work the enhancement of gas exchange parameters and chlorophyll biosynthesis was more appreciable in olive plants inoculated with m1 m2 which is positively linked to the level of colonization with amf thereby it may be concluded that m1 m2 colonization would result of a synergistic interaction in improving the photosynthetic capacity of young olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater in response to the harmful effect of saline treated wastewater young olive plants tend to enhance the osmoprotectants synthesis such behavior is an important mechanism of plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses indeed in this investigation irrigation with treated wastewater significantly increased the soluble sugars and proline contents but decreased the starch content both in leaves and roots of young olive plants similarly gupta et al 2010 and saad allah and elhaak 2017 noted an enhancement in soluble sugars contents respectively in taro colocasia esculenta and black nightshade solanum nigrum irrigated with treated wastewater in the other hand hashem et al 2013 observed an accumulation of proline in tomato solanum lycopersicum adversely affected by treated wastewater irrigation during 100 days according to these authors accumulation of soluble sugars and proline in wastewater irrigated plants could be considered as an indicator of physiological disorder due to osmotic stress and may serve as osmoregulators to enhance water uptake and maintain water homeostasis thus in this study the soluble sugars generation by starch degradation and the proline accumulation explain the maintained proper hydration level of young olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater interestingly mycorrhization significantly enhanced the soluble sugars and proline contents both in leaves and roots of young olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater in contrast the starch content has decreased the obtained findings suggest that amf could mitigate the adverse effect of salinity caused by treated wastewater irrigation by inducing the accumulation of soluble sugars and proline in young olive plants tissues referring to measurements of rwc the accumulation of these osmolytes has maintained an adequate water status in plants due to their important role in osmoregulation which had consequently improved the photosynthetic capacity and the physiological performance of stressed plants the soluble sugars accumulation was similarly observed by ismaiel et al 2014 in faba bean vicia faba irrigated with wastewater and inoculated with amf such behavior could be due to i the sink effect of amf demanding sugars from host plants tissues and ii the hydrolysis of starch into soluble sugars in colonized olive plants evelin et al 2009 for proline talaat and shawky 2014 explained the accumulation of this osmolyte in mycorrhizal wheat triticum aestivum exposed during 70 days to salinity 4 7 and 9 4 ds m 1 as an improvement of plant fitness to salt conditions many researchers have shown that stressed plants possess a number of antioxidant mechanisms like non enzymatic antioxidants that serve as reactive oxygen species ros scavengers to prevent oxidative damage ksouri et al 2007 abbaspour et al 2012 the obtained results showed that young olive plants irrigated with treated wastewater significantly accumulated higher contents of total polyphenols and total flavonoids than the nm w1 treatment similar increment of total polyphenols and flavonoids contents was reported by saad allah and elhaak 2017 in black nightshade that was negatively affected by wastewater irrigation the high amounts of total polyphenols may be explained by the increase in the production of some enzymes responsible for phenolic metabolism michalak 2006 besides the flavonoids are the main and most complex subgroup of total polyphenols and the genes involved in its biosynthesis are also induced under stressful conditions winkel shirley 2002 mycorrhizal colonization significantly enhanced the carotenoids the total polyphenols and the total flavonoids contents in young olive plants particularly when inoculated with m1 m2 such enhancement may prove the beneficial role of amf in alleviating the oxidative injuries occurring in young olive plants irrigated with saline treated wastewater the positive role played by mycorrhizal symbiosis in improving the carotenoids content of plants under saline conditions was also reported by hashem et al 2016 in mycorrhizal soybean glycine max plants cultivated in saline soil 7 12 ds m 1 for 60 days referring to fester et al 2002 the increase of carotenoids content in this work could be due to the fact that amf stimulate the transcription of a specific gene involved in carotenoid biosynthesis furthermore hart et al 2015 showed that amf act as a carbon drain on host plants which consequently increase the carotenoids biosynthesis in addition many reports have showed that amf induced the accumulation of total polyphenols and flavonoids under several stressful conditions abbaspour et al 2012 chen et al 2013 indeed chen et al 2013 reported that high amounts of these compounds in mycorrhizal plants is due to i inducing effect of amf on the activity of enzymes associated with secondary metabolism ii stimulating effect of amf on the expression of genes related to secondary metabolites synthesis 5 conclusions the irrigation with saline treated wastewater for one year altered the physiological performances of potted young olive plants cv chetoui in fact accumulation of salts in soil of the treatments irrigated with wastewater caused an osmotic and ionic disorders in young olive plants as a result a decrease in biomass production and photosynthetic capacity were observed in those plants in response to these harmful effects young olive plants tend to accumulate proline and soluble sugars and activate their non enzymatic antioxidant defense system carotenoids total polyphenols and flavonoids interestingly amf inoculation improved the tolerance of olive plants to the high level of salinity in treated wastewater in fact amf increased the biomass production through suppressing the uptake of toxic ions and ameliorating the water status photosynthetic capacity osmoticum contents and non enzymatic antioxidant defense system of inoculated plants the alleviation of the negative effects was more efficient when young olive plants were inoculated with m1 m2 which may prove the presence of a synergistic interaction between m1 and m2 therefore to avoid salinity problems caused by continuous irrigation with treated wastewater in olive fields the application of amf as a biological process could be a sustainable solution to guarantee an optimal growth and productivity of olive trees furthermore colonization with dual amf species would be more efficient in ameliorating olive plants

10304,remote sensing technology can cost effectively access to a wide range of real time land surface spatial information therefore it is widely used in agricultural crops monitoring and timely assessment of drought stress using remote sensing is valuable for improving the crop management level in this study the drought stress was evaluated in the maize planting areas of the northeast and north china plain using satellite remote sensing technology the absolute distance index was used to identify the spatial pattern of the maize planting areas using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis derived enhanced vegetation index data that processed with savitzky golay filter the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi was derived from modis normalized difference vegetation index and land surface temperature data simultaneously soil moisture content smc was obtained for an eight day period and matched with satellite remote sensing data to characterize the drought stress of maize after estimating the field capacity and wilting point the smc was further transformed into the real available water content r awc of the soil our results indicated that negative correlations between r awc and tvdi was observed for the 0 10 cm r 2 0 594 and 20 30 cm r 2 0 641 soil layers respectively which was significantly better than the correlation between the smc and tvdi in the 0 10 r 2 0 396 and 20 30 cm r 2 0 499 soil layers moreover the sensitive period regarding the maize water demand were identified day of year 161 169 233 241 and 249 via the linear regression analysis of the measured maize yield and tvdi for eight day intervals furthermore the weights of the water demand of maize in different growth stages was determined via multiple linear regression analysis and a comprehensive drought index tvdisw was established to evaluate the drought stress in the whole maize growth period eventually a comprehensive analysis for the drought stress in the study area was conducted combined with various environmental factors furthermore the performance of this method was independent of the meteorological and field survey data which may facilitate the mapping of drought monitoring of crops planting areas at a large scale abbreviations adi absolute distance index awc available water content dem digital elevation model dfr ncp dryland farming

global warming have a great influence on the crop yield and crop quality in agricultural production lesk et al 2016 li et al 2009 the frequency and intensity of droughts which represent one of the most serious natural disasters affecting the sustainable development of agriculture are increasing hao et al 2012 wu et al 2011 maize is a typical rain fed upland crop and the dryland farming region of the northeast and north china plain is the most productive maize cultivation region in china wan et al 2019 therefore the drought stress in the whole maize growth period as well as the occurrence development and regression processes of maize drought over time must be critically studied to enhance the ability to mitigate the disasters in maize production and guide future maize cultivation at present two research methods are widely used for agricultural drought monitoring one is to construct a series of evaluation systems to analyze the drought status based on ground observation data such as pedologic uwizeyimana et al 2018 or meteorological masupha and moeletsi 2017 wang et al 2016a indicators in combination with growth and development characteristics of crops kocsis et al 2020 rigden et al 2020 however these indicators are observational data on the point scale and their spatial representation is limited even if spatial interpolation is used for data grid processing the monitoring accuracy is still extremely limited in regions with sparse observation stations distributions complex terrain and high spatial heterogeneity in contrast another method remote sensing which has the advantages of spatial continuity a wide monitoring space range and time and labor saving therefore the degree of crop drought can be determined based on the correlation of the remote sensing indices with indicators such as the crop phenotype soil moisture content smc and canopy temperature yang et al 2017 crop drought stress retrieved by remote sensing can be divided into three types including indices constructed based on i temperature indices ti cai et al 2007 mallick et al 2009 wang et al 2001 ii vegetation indices vi quiring and ganesh 2010 zarco tejada et al 2003 and iii the combination of the ti with vi chen et al 2020b kogan 2002 wang et al 2004 wang and qu 2007 simply use of the ti to construct drought indices is affected by altitude and topography factors additionally there is hysteresis when only using vegetation indices to investigate crop growth wang et al 2020a contrastingly the evaluation accuracy is more accurate to construct drought indices based on the combination of the ti with vi for instance sandholt et al 2002 reported that the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi formed by combination of lst ndvi can reflect the smc well because of the definite physical meaning and low requirement of complex parameters of remote sensing data tvdi has been widely applied in agricultural drought monitoring and extensive studies have confirmed its advantages wang et al 2004 li et al 2010 chen et al 2011 gao et al 2011 wei et al 2020 based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data crop drought can be monitored over large ranges and time series however limited by the larger range there is a lack of studies about crop drought with enough verification data in large spatial range which could be matched with multitemporal modis data besides a variety of studies on crop drought monitoring by remote sensing generally focused on the whole research region rather than crop planting areas son et al 2012 limiting the pertinence and practical guidance of the results the yield can directly evaluate crop growth and degree of drought however it is labor intensive and difficult to obtain a wide range of crop yield data accurately therefore real yield data are usually replaced by statistical data liu et al 2018 or remote sensing indexes e g normalized difference vegetation index ndvi gross primary productivity gpp net primary productivity npp li et al 2009 however the timeliness and accuracy of statistical data are limited in addition the spatial scope represented by statistical data is usually at the administrative region scale and thus it is impossible to clarify the crop growth status at the raster pixel scale although the remote sensing index can be obtained timely and on a large scale these indexes cannot fully represent the real yield and thus the verification of crop drought is limited furthermore few studies focused on the identification of the sensitive period regarding the water demand of a certain crop on the large scale thus it remains unclear how the drought stress affects a certain crop in different growth stages in this study we estimated the drought stress of the maize planting areas in the dryland farming region of the northeast and north china plain in 2019 the primary goal was to timely assess the drought stress using newly available modis soil sampling and maize yield data the major objectives of our study were to 1 accurately extract maize planting areas using the savitzky golay s g filter and absolute distance index adi 2 classify the maize growth stages under different water demand conditions using enhanced vegetation index evi time series data 3 clarify the relationship between the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi and real available water content r awc and between the tvdi and maize yield and 4 identify the sensitive period of maize regarding the water demand and effect of water stress on different maize growth stages our study provides a foundation for the improvement of crop drought stress evaluations based on satellite remote sensing indices soil moisture parameters and measured crop yields 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area the dryland farming region of the northeast and north china plain 32 8 48 23 n 112 34 134 46 e covers a total area of 71 2 104 km2 fig 1a its scope is defined as follows 1 it locates in the northern part of china including northeast and north china 2 the geomorphologic types include plains and tableland and 3 the dryland area within a 1 km2 grid accounts for 40 of the cultivated land the climate of the study area is mainly semi humid and arid and the dominant land cover type is cultivated land fig 1b it consists of seven provinces i e heilongjiang jilin liaoning hebei shandong henan and anhui and two municipalities beijing and tianjin including 525 counties the study area spans six secondary agricultural regions the sanjiang plain agricultural region sj songnen plain agricultural region sn and liaoning plain hilly agroforestry region ln belong to the dryland farming region of the northeast china plain dfr necp and the yan taihang mountain foothill plain agricultural region yt ji lu yu low lying plain agricultural region jly and huang huai plain agricultural region hh belong to the dryland farming region of the north china plain dfr ncp fig 1c the study area accounts for 7 42 for china s land area and the maize yield reached up to 8904 39 and 5299 33 104 t in dfr necp and dfr ncp respectively accounting for 55 23 of china s maize yield in 2018 therefore this study area is one of the most important grain production areas in china calculated from national bureau of statistics 2019 the overall profile of the study area is a long and narrow strip extending from northeast to southwest with the longest span of 2438 km and notable zonal characteristics and regional differentiation the annual average temperature in the study area decreases from 16 to 0 c and the annual precipitation of the dfr necp and dfr ncp is 400 600 mm and 600 800 mm respectively phaeozems chernozems and meadow soils are the main soil types in the dfr necp and fluvio aquatic cinnamon sandy saline alkali and lime concretion black soils are the main soil types in the dfr ncp the precipitation is mostly distributed in summer with large evapotranspiration because of the monsoon climate chen and xie 2012 and the precipitation does not meet the water demand of the crops in the key growth period leading to a water shortage and drought stress of crops smit and cai 1996 xu et al 2013 and thus affecting the growth and yield of crops therefore the dryland farming region of the northeast and north china plain was selected as the research object 2 2 materials 2 2 1 modis data we used terra modis eight day gridded level 3 global surface reflectance products mod09a1 at 500 m spatial resolution to calculate the vi including ndvi and evi terra modis eight day gridded level 3 global land surface temperature lst emissivity products mod11a2 at 1 km spatial resolution were used to calculate the lst the study area was covered by four image tiles h27v5 h27v4 h26v5 and h26v4 a total of 368 images was collected in 2019 all modis data were acquired from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov 2 2 2 soil sampling data to verify the reliability of the drought stress retrieval we collected soil samples from three typical maize planting counties from north to south lishu jingxian and yongqiao to acquire soil moisture data lishu with spring maize as the dominant crop is located in the dfr necp jingxian and yongqiao with summer maize as the main crop are located in the dfr ncp in our study the modis data which is a product synthesized in eight days were used to calculate the tvdi to match the soil sampling data with modis data we accomplished the soil sampling in lishu within eight days subsequently we collected soil samples in yongqiao and jingxian within eight days one cycle of soil moisture data collection in the study area was completed within 16 days fig 2a the sowing time of spring maize in northeast china is approximately may 1 earlier than that of summer maize in north china therefore lishu was selected to be the first soil sampling location the phenological period of summer maize in yongqiao starts earlier than that in jingxian due to the lower latitude of yongqiao therefore we collected the soil samples from lishu yongqiao and jingxian sequentially lishu yongqiao jingxian overall seven rounds of soil sampling were completed from mid june to the end of september the specific times of soil sampling in the three regions are shown in fig 2b c and d the distance among soil sampling points was 1 km to ensure that all sampling points were located within different modis raster pixel we collected soil samples from depths of 0 10 and 20 30 cm using the cutting ring 5 cm diameter 100 cm3 volume at 11 00 am 16 00 pm local time the smc is generally higher due to dew deposition in the morning or evening therefore we avoided collecting soil samples at those time the samples were stored in sealed bags and then immediately transported back to the laboratory to analyze smc 2 2 3 maize yield and maize planting areas verification data after the dough stage of maize the dry matter of the maize grains no longer increases therefore we carried out a large scale yield measurement of maize in the dfr necp the central longitude and latitude of the maize plot were recorded with handheld global position system gps receivers during the field yield measurement the determination rules for the maize plots were as follows 1 we selected plots covered with maize with different growth conditions to acquire different yield data 2 to avoid large deviations between the measured yield data and real yield we avoided the edges of roads irrigation ditches and terrace ridges as well as the facilities or objects that have an impact on the growth such as trees telegraph poles and wells while measuring the yield and 3 the plot area for the yield measurement should be larger than 500 500 m to link the measured yield data to satellite remote sensing data finally 69 effective plots of maize yield data were obtained fig 2e verification data for maize planting areas included field survey remote sensing interpretation and statistical data see supplementary material s1 for details 2 2 4 soil texture and organic matter data the soil texture and organic matter data 0 30 cm with 250 m spatial resolution were downloaded from soilgrids v0 5 3 global gridded soil information a system for digital soil mapping based on a global compilation of soil profile data and environmental layers https soilgrids org machine learning and spatial data mining were used to determine the relationships between the spatial change of the soil attributes and environmental variables and estimate the spatial distribution of the soil attributes based on these relationships hengl et al 2017 3 methods the research framework of this study was shown in fig 3 which includes four parts data collection and processing index calculation data verification and data application the first two steps are the foundation of the last two steps the fourth step is the core which revealed the maize moisture sensitive period and evaluated the drought stress spatiotemporally 3 1 modis vi and lst calculation the red blue and near infrared bands of mod09a1 data were extracted mosaicked and reprojected the pixels were resampled to 500 m resolution and the data were clipped to the extent of the study area all these processes were completed using the modis reprojection tool mrt dwyer and schmidt 2006 subsequently the modis ndvi tucker 1979 and modis evi huete et al 2002 data were calculated from the mod09a1 product for 2019 based on the following equations 1 n d v i ρ nir ρ r ρ nir ρ r 2 e v i 2 5 ρ nir ρ r l ρ nir c 1 ρ r c 2 ρ b where ρ nir ρ r and ρ b are the reflectance values of the near infrared 841 876 nm red 620 670 nm and blue bands 459 479 nm respectively l is the canopy background adjustment factor and c 1 and c 2 are the aerosol resistance weights the coefficients of the modis equation are l 1 c 1 6 and c 2 7 5 we extracted mosaicked and reprojected the mod11a2 data using the mrt software too to retrieve tvdi by combining vi and lst data the lst data were resampled to a spatial resolution of 500 m using the nearest neighbor method to match with the mod09a1 datasets liu et al 2018 hu et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 the lst data of the modis eight day synthesized product include a small number of invalid values due to cloud contamination and other factors therefore revised modis lst data were obtained by replacing the invalid values with peripheral normal values using the spatial interpolation tool of arcgis10 5 software 3 2 savitzky golay filter algorithm a polynomial function fitting method was established by savitzky and golay 1964 based on a weighted least squares regression approach the features e g maxima minima and widths of the dataset can be preserved by using this method kim et al 2014 the s g filter can be applied to any consecutive data when the data points are distributed at fixed and uniform intervals along the chosen abscissa the curve generated by graphing the points must be continuous and more or less smooth in our study the continuous points were evi values recorded every eight days because the evi values were distributed in eight day composites the application of the s g filter in this study can eliminate the influence of outliers of the vi caused by cloud contamination and thus the regular feature of evi can be extracted from time series data the s g filter algorithm is as follows chen et al 2004 3 y j i m i m c i y j 1 n where y is the original evi value y j is the filtered evi value c i is the coefficient for the i th evi value of the filter smoothing window and n is the number of convoluting integers equal to the smoothing window size 2m 1 the index j is a running index of the original ordinate data table the smoothing array filter size consists of 2m 1 points where m is the halfwidth of the smoothing window a larger value of m produces a smoother result at the expense of sharp peaks which are flattened 3 3 dividing maize growth stage under different water demand conditions moisture is one of the most important environmental factors affecting the maize growth drought will affect the maize yield and maize has different sensitivities to drought stress in different growth stages cakir 2004 from the seedling emergence stage to the jointing stage sixth ninth leaf stage ⅰ the maize is relatively fragile and very sensitive to moisture water shortage will directly affect the subsequent growth of maize wei et al 2019 from the bell mouthed stage tenth eleventh leaf to the tasseling stage stage ⅱ the large leaf area and high temperature lead to a large amount of evapotranspiration however this period is the most vigorous maize growth stage therefore enough water supply is required to ensure the maize growth ribaut et al 2009 the maize grain filling and rapid accumulation occur from the silking stage to the blister stage stage ⅲ an appropriate amount of water is still needed to guarantee the high yield of maize wang et al 2016b from the milk stage to the maturity stage stage ⅳ the total amount of dry matter of maize reach the maxima and the plants gradually wither and become yellow in this stage a decrease of the water supply has no significant influence on the maize yield and maize is not sensitive to drought stress subedi and ma 2009 in addition stages ⅰ and ⅱ are vegetative growth stages with increasing maize plant height and leaf area during which the evi varies from the minimum to the maximum stages ⅲ and ⅳ are reproductive growth stages during which the plant dries out and gradually turns yellow fig 4 the evi increases the most maximum slope of the evi curve in the bell mouthed stage and decreases the most minimum slope of the evi curve in the milk stage fig 4 zhang et al 2014 five key nodes of maize i e seedling emergence fastest growth peak growth rapid drying and full maturity were used to determine the four growth stages stages i ⅳ fig 4 wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2019a the maximum value of the evi time series data corresponds to the peak growth of maize after the first derivative of the evi time series data the maximum and minimum values correspond to the fastest growth and rapid drying of maize respectively most of the summer maize planting region in our study area is the cropping pattern of winter wheat and summer maize rotation that is summer maize is planted immediately after the winter wheat harvest therefore the evi time series of summer maize pixels presents an annual bimodal pattern the first and second minima of the evi correspond to the emergence and full maturity of the summer maize respectively practically nearly no other crops are planted following spring maize cultivation zhang et al 2019b due to the long growth period of spring maize from mid april to late october and limited accumulated temperature therefore the evi time series of spring maize pixels shows a single peak per year the time series curve of the spring maize pixel had no significant changes after applying the s g filter and the slope is close to 0 in the non growth period in contrast the slope of the evi significantly increases decreases after seeding before full maturity of the spring maize therefore based on several training samples we determined the date of spring maize emergence when inequality 4 was satisfied for the first time 4 e v i 1 8 m 1 1 m 1 1 m 1 e v i 1 8 m 1 where evi is the first derivative of the evi after application of the s g filter m is the m th eight day and m is 13 the 97th day of the julian calendar april 7 because spring maize is not sown until april similarly the date of full maturity of the spring maize was defined when inequality 5 was satisfied for the last time 5 e v i 1 8 n 1 1 46 n n 1 46 e v i 1 8 n where evi is the same as that specified in inequality 4 n is the n th eight day and n is 31 the 241th day of the julian calendar august 29 because spring maize does not fully mature after september 46 represents a total of 46 annual eight day periods 3 4 maize planting areas extraction and yield estimation the absolute distance index adi jing et al 2013 wang et al 2020b was used to extract the maize planting areas see supplementary material s2 for details the maize yield depends on three factors that is the ears per unit area kernels per ear and kernel weight lu et al 2017 mature maize was harvested by hand from two adjacent center rows in each plot we determined the ear density of the maize and measured 20 plants randomly selected from each plot the harvest samples were sun dried for approximately seven days and weighed after threshing the kernel number per ear was then counted we calculated the hundred grain weight hgw when the water content of the sundried grain was 15 measured with the oven drying method finally the real maize yield in the field was estimated using the following equation 6 y m n e n k h w 0 85 10 5 where y m is the maize yield kg ha 1 n e is the number of ears per ha n k is the number of kernels per ear h w is the hgw of one ear of maize g and 0 85 is the correction coefficient 3 5 retrieval of tvdi to investigate the drought stress in study area we applied the tvdi sandholt et al 2002 which is based on the empirical interpretation of the conceptual ndvi lst triangle fig 5 the ndvi strongly correlates with the growth of vegetation but it hardly reflects the moisture conditions of the vegetation and soil chen et al 2014 ji and peters 2003 the lst is more sensitive to water stress hu et al 2020 due to the relationship between the evapotranspiration and leaf temperature sharratt et al 1983 plant water deficit can cause the reduction of the transpiration rate and in turn the increase in the leaf temperature in the case of relatively low vegetation coverage the lst increase will aggravate the drought stress of vegetation boegh et al 1999 therefore the combination of the ndvi and lst to retrieve tvdi can provide more comprehensive information on the drought stress tvdi varies with different land cover for example woodland and cultivated land with better vegetation cover have higher smc and lower lst so tvdi value is at a low level generally whereas bare land and saline alkali land with poor vegetation cover have low smc and high lst and tvdi value is at a higher level fig 5 similar conclusions have been confirmed by relevant studies wang et al 2010 gao et al 2011 the tvdi is calculated as follows 7 t v d i l s t l s t min l s t max l s t min l s t max a dry b dry n d v i l s t min a wet b wet n d v i where lst and ndvi are the observed lst and ndvi calculated from a modis pixel respectively lst max and lst min are the maximum and minimum lst observations for a given ndvi respectively a dry and b dry are the intercept and slope of the dry edge upper straight line in the triangle respectively calculated from the ndvi lst space regression with small intervals of ndvi fig 5 line ac of the triangle and a wet and b wet are the intercept and slope of the wet edge lower straight line in the triangle respectively calculated from the ndvi lst space regression with small intervals of ndvi fig 5 line bc of the triangle the tvdi values range from 0 to 1 tvdi 1 at the dry edge indicating the lack of evapotranspiration from the soil vegetation system or limited moisture supply and tvdi 0 at the wet edge indicating maximum evapotranspiration from the soil vegetation system or unlimited moisture supply 3 6 calculation of the smc and rawc the smc was determined by oven drying the fresh soil samples and cutting ring at 105 c over 24 h volumetric smc was calculated using the following equation 8 θ v m w m d 100 where θ v is the volumetric smc cm3 cm3 m w is the wet weight of the soil samples and cutting ring g m d is the dry weight of the soil samples and cutting ring g and 100 is the volume of the cutting ring cm3 to evaluate the drought stress more accurately the measured smc was converted to the r awc to eliminate

2020c guo and shen 2015 liu et al 2017 3 7 evaluation of the drought stress the relationship between the measured maize yield and tvdi of each eight day phase during the growth period in the dfr necp was evaluated with the unary linear regression ulr ye et al 2019 deng et al 2020 to determine the sensitive period of drought stress for maize which is statistically significant and has a high r 2 we quantified the impact of the tvdi on the maize yield in different water demand stages using a multiple linear regression mlr model this model has been frequently used as empirical model or approximating function and to establish a mathematical model to describe the contribution of each factor independent variable to a real world phenomenon dependent variable jung et al 2017 lee et al 2019 in our study the maize yield measurement data were considered as the dependent variable whereas the tvdi of the raster pixels in the four water demand stages was considered to be the independent variable the mlr model used in our study is presented in eq 11 11 y c β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β 4 x 4 where y is the measured maize yield c is a constant x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 are the mean tvdi values in stages i ii ⅲ and ⅳ of maize growth respectively and β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 are the regression coefficients corresponding to x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 respectively after we acquired β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 by using the mlr model we converted the values to weight coefficients using eq 12 12 w i β i i 1 4 β i where w i are the weights of the tvdi in the i th maize growth stage and β i are the regression coefficients derived from eq 11 we applied the weight parameters derived from eq 12 multiplied by the tvdi of the four water demand stages using arcgis 10 5 software finally the spatial pattern of the maize drought stress in 2019 was obtained 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial patterns of the maize growth stages the spatial patterns of five key nodes of the maize growth period in the dfr necp were shown in fig 6a the southern and northern dfr necp were seeded and emerged first from mid to late april and the typical phaeozem belt in the middle of the dfr necp was seeded and emerged relatively late from early to mid may therefore there is no notable delay in the seedling emergence of maize with increasing latitude in the dfr necp this finding corroborated with the results of previous studies zhang et al 2014 one possible reason for this phenomenon is that the higher latitude limits the accumulation temperature in the northern part of the dfr necp such that the growth period of maize is longer than that in other regions therefore the seedling emergence occurs relatively earlier than in the center of the dfr necp in addition maize cultivars tillage systems and the rice spectral interference in the maize data of the northern part of the dfr necp may be factors causing this phenomenon the fastest growth period has notable latitudinal variations namely this growth period was gradually delayed from south to north the fastest peak and fully mature growth periods of the ln occur earlier than those of sn and sj regions in the ln and sj regions the rapid drying period starts earlier than in the typical phaeozem belt of sn region similar results were obtained by zhang et al 2014 when they correlated the phenological phase tasseling and milk ripening with the latitudes of maize planting areas they found that there was no regularity in the delay of the phenological period with the increase in the latitude because september 6 21 of the quick drying period were in the typical phaeozem belt of the dfr necp we suggest that this phenomenon might be related to the soil factors the spatial patterns of five key nodes of the maize growth period in the dfr ncp were shown in fig 6b summer maize planting areas were observed in the dfr ncp except for the northern part of the yt region which was spring maize planting areas therefore the seeding and emergence stages in the northern part of the yt region started earlier from late april to the end of may whereas they start in june in the summer maize planting areas of the dfr ncp the five key nodes of the maize growth period showed several latitudinal variations in the dfr ncp that is each growth period of the summer maize planting areas was delayed with the increase in the latitude similar results were observed by wang et al 2020b 4 2 spatiotemporal patterns of the tvdi in maize planting areas the spatial pattern of the mean tvdi value of each stage in the dfr necp is shown in fig 7a affected by the geographical zonation the temperature in the study area is high in the southern region and low in the northern region and the precipitation is high in the eastern part and low in the western part of the study area during the maize growing period jiang 1993 hartmann and wang 2014 therefore the difference of the tvdi is higher in the southern than in the northern part of the region and higher in the western than in the eastern region of the dfr necp similar patterns were also observed in the dfr ncp fig 7b in the dfr necp the peak value of the tvdi pixel frequency distribution were observed in stage ⅱ 0 35 0 40 followed by stage ⅰ 0 30 0 35 stage ⅲ 0 25 0 30 and stage ⅳ 0 20 0 25 fig 7a whereas it has the following order in the dfr ncp stage ⅰ 0 45 0 50 stages ⅲ and ⅳ 0 40 0 45 and stage ⅱ 0 30 0 35 fig 7b the pixel value of the tvdi in the dfr ncp was larger than that in the dfr necp this means that the drought stress of maize in the dfr ncp is more severe than that in the dfr necp which can be explained by the higher evapotranspiration and less surface water and groundwater resources in the dfr ncp compared with the dfr necp tang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 in the dfr necp the mean value of the tvdi increases first and then decreases and the maximum value can be observed in stage ⅱ fig 7c in the dfr ncp the mean value of the tvdi fluctuates and the tvdi reaches the maximum and minimum values in stages ⅰ and ⅱ respectively fig 7c in addition the variation of the peak value of the tvdi pixel frequency distribution was consistent with the mean value of the tvdi of the four maize growth stages in each secondary agricultural region in the dfr necp stage i occurred from mid april to late june this stage is not the rainy season therefore a certain degree of drought was observed during stage ii which occurred in july the water consumption for maize growth improved and the temperature and transpiration increased as a result the drought stress and tvdi continuously increased stage iii occurred from late july to early september the rain belt moved from north china to northeast china and a typhoon made landfall which led to a large amount of precipitation in late august consequently the drought stress and tvdi decreased stage iv occurred from september to mid october when the temperature dropped evapotranspiration weakened and the intensity of water consumption for crops decreased thus the drought stress and tvdi declined further fig 7c in the dfr ncp stage i occurred in june with little precipitation based on local farmers the survey area was relatively dry at that time and many locations required artificial irrigation to ensure maize emergence therefore the tvdi in this stage was relatively high stage ii occurred from early july to mid july with the beginning of the rainy season in north china thus the tvdi and drought stress decreased stage iii occurred from late july to mid august the rain belt continued to move to northeast china accelerating the drought and increasing the tvdi in north china stage iv occurred from late august to mid october the rain belt retreated southward and the intensity of water consumption of crops decreased therefore the drought stress was relieved and the tvdi started to decrease again fig 7c the vegetation index ndvi evi varies greatly in different crop growth period and the drought degree of the crop easily fluctuated with meteorological factors high temporal resolution is particularly important for accurate retrieval for maize drought monitoring therefore we uniformly selected the eight day vi and lst datasets to retrieve tvdi and the lst dataset was resampled from 1 km to 500 m resolution this processing method can keep that tvdi has both high temporal 8 day and spatial 500 m resolution which has been used in many studies liu et al 2018 hu et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 previous studies of the crop drought retrieval based on the tvdi generally focused on the whole research area arekhi et al 2019 chen et al 2011 son et al 2012 2019 rather than the crop pixel evaluation therefore the results usually lack pertinence and hardly reveal the true drought stress of the crops in contrast our study focused on the maize pixels in the whole growth period to analyze the tvdi and thus has the advantage of precision 4 3 relationship between the tvdi and soil moisture in total 189 measured smc datapoints of seven phases in lishu jingxian and yongqiao were used to verify the accuracy of the tvdi retrieval the regression coefficient between the tvdi and smc of 0 10 cm and 20 30 cm soil layers was 0 396 and 0 499 respectively p 0 01 fig 8a and b a previous study showed that the r 2 value of the 0 10 cm soil layers was less than in 20 30 cm in the ncp chen et al 2011 which could be explained as follows the roots of the maize are mostly distributed at a depth of 30 cm wiesler and horst 1994 therefore smc of the 20 30 cm layer correlates more with the drought of maize compared with that of the 0 10 cm layer in addition the variation of smc decreases with increasing soil depth qiu et al 2001 therefore the smc of the 20 30 cm soil layer fluctuates 15 35 fig 8b less than that of the 0 10 cm soil layer 10 40 fig 8a which better reflects the natural soil water properties the r 2 value obtained in our study is slightly higher than that of previous studies chen et al 2011 li et al 2010 we suggest that this may be related to the multitemporal and large spatial range of the soil data we collected to reduce the systematic error of the data in our study however the effect of the smc on crop growth varies depending on the soil type due to the influence of the soil texture bescansa et al 2006 for example hygroscopic water which accounts for a high proportion in clay hardly absorbed and utilized by crops chen et al 2020a thus this part of water should be eliminated from the smc to better characterize the water supply conditions of the crops the wp represents the base level at which crop roots can absorb moisture from the soil sánchez et al 2012 in addition due to the influence of artificial irrigation precipitation terrain and other factors the smc may exceed the fc the excessive water will then be quickly lost due to gravity and cannot be timely utilized by crops cowan 1965 the correlation between r awc and tvdi is higher than that between the smc and tvdi the r 2 of the linear regression between the tvdi and r awc of the 0 10 cm and 20 30 cm soil layers is 0 594 and 0 641 respectively p 0 01 fig 8c and d which indicates that the r awc are relatively reliable and reasonably reflect the drought stress of the crops however the r 2 value of the linear regression between the tvdi and r awc in our study fig 8c and d is lower than that reported by garcia et al 2008 we speculate that the empirical models used to calculate the fc and wp may have resulted in a decline of the accuracy of r awc in our study in addition the soil texture and organic matter data used in the models were derived from remote sensing with a spatial resolution of 250 m rather than data measured in the field which also could cause the lower r 2 in our study however we suggest that the conversion of the smc to r awc will significantly improve the accuracy of future crop drought research 4 4 drought stress of maize to confirm the sensitive period of drought stress for maize the time series for r 2 based on the ulr analysis is shown in fig 9 the r 2 value fluctuates throughout the maize growing season it reached 0 4 0 5 p 0 01 on doy 161 169 225 233 and 241 the yield measurement plots of maize on doy 161 and 169 june 10 25 fig 6a were pixels in the maize jointing stage which was the fastest growth period maize requires a sufficient water supply as its rapid growth consumes more water for the photosynthesis of leaves leading to the rapid growth of the roots and above ground leaves the yield measurement plots of maize on doy 225 233 and 241 august 13 to september 5 fig 6a are in pixels between the peak growth and quick drying period which belong to the maize grain filling stage stage ⅲ at that time the lack of water supply affected the growth of maize kernels which further influenced the maize yield on doy 105 281 and 289 the r 2 was low and statistically insignificant we assume that this may be due to the fact that the seedling emergence time and full maturity harvest time of maize of different plots are not consistent therefore there was no notable correlation between the tvdi and maize yield on the rest of the doy r 2 ranges from 0 1 to 0 3 roughly p 0 05 this indicates that the drought will affect the maize yield however these periods are not the most sensitive periods of drought stress for maize the mlr analysis between the measured maize yield and mean tvdi value in each of the four water demand stages in the dfr necp shows that the β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 are 39 320 38 677 41 071 and 28 415 respectively r 2 0 548 p 0 01 the mlr coefficients were all negative indicating a negative correlation between the tvdi drought stress and maize yield the absolute value of the regression coefficient was maximal in stage ⅲ suggesting that this was the most critical period regarding maize water requirements which was consistent with the maximum r 2 value on doy 233 249 based on ulr analysis fig 9 the higher absolute value of the regression coefficient in stage ⅰ compared with stage ⅱ showed that the seedling emergence stage to jointing stage was another critical period regarding the water requirements which was consistent with another maximum r 2 value obtained by ulr analysis on doy 161 169 fig 9 the minimum absolute regression coefficient was obtained in stage ⅳ indicating that the maize becomes insensitive to drought stress with gradual maturation the diseases e g puccinia polysora and anthracnose and pests e g armyworm and ostrinia nubilalis will also affect the maize yield but according to our field investigation diseases and pests in different regions and growth seasons did not severely influence the maize growth due to farmer s fine management macroscopically moreover previous studies have shown that drought and heat damage were the main natural factors affecting maize yield in northeast and north china plain ren et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 therefore we believe that maize diseases and pests certainly exist but drought stress may be still the main limiting factor affecting maize yield in our study area accordingly the disturbance of diseases and pests can be ignored under the premise of limited data the tvdisw in the dfr necp gradually decreases with increasing latitude fig 10a the latitude in the sj agricultural region is relatively high therefore the surface evapotranspiration is weak in this region in addition the surface water resources are abundant due to numerous rivers songhua amur and ussuri rivers fig 10a and wetlands based on the low lying terrain fig 10c in this region thus the drought stress of maize was relatively low compared with that in the sn and ln agricultural regions in addition the tvdisw was larger in the southcentral part of the sj agricultural region which was consistent with the area with the mean annual precipitation of less than 500 mm fig 10e and spatial distribution of the semi humid region fig 10d the tvdisw was higher in the western part of the sn agricultural region which was consistent with the spatial pattern of the semi humid area fig 10d in addition sandy soils are widely distributed in this region fig 10b the poor water retention of sandy soils is also an important factor leading to the drought of maize the maize planting areas in the ln agricultural region are consistent with the spatial pattern of the semi humid area therefore the tvdisw was higher in the ln agricultural region the tvdisw was the highest in the southwestern part of the ln agricultural region which belongs to hilly area fig 10c with poor irrigation conditions the limited water supply of maize results in a very high tvdisw 5 conclusions it is of great significance to obtain agricultural drought information on a large scale in a timely and accurate manner in this study we evaluated the drought stress in maize planting areas in the dryland farming region of the northeast and north china plain in 2019 using remote sensing methods in combination with various types of ground measurements based on the evi time series data and s g filtering the spatial distribution patterns of maize planting areas was obtained by using the adi method we used eight day synthetic modis ndvi and lst data to retrieve the tvdi that characterizes the drought stress of maize the results showed that the tvdi had a strong negative correlation with r awc r 2 of 0 594 and 0 641 in the 0 10 cm and 20 30 cm soil layers respectively we conducted ulr analysis for each period of tvdi with the maize yield data measured in the dfr necp the results indicated the water demand sensitive periods of maize which were the fastest growth period vegetative growth and peak growth quick drying periods reproductive growth after dividing the tvdi based on the four water demand stages of maize we performed an mlr between the tvdi and measured maize yield data in the dfr necp and converted the regression coefficients into weights to obtain the tvdisw we combined the tvdisw with environmental factors to analyze the drought stress our results demonstrate the merit of a method by using eight day modis ndvi and lst data for regional drought monitoring which can be extended to other global locations for the timely monitoring of droughts over large scale regions the results improve our knowledge about the spatiotemporal process of maize drought stress and its driving mechanisms in addition the accurate mapping of maize planting areas and the tvdi will help to understand the effects of agroecosystems and their relationships with water resources and climate change credit authorship contribution statement zhong liu and wei wan conceived the research wei wan wrote the manuscript wei wan hanqing wu and zhong liu edited the manuscript

10304,remote sensing technology can cost effectively access to a wide range of real time land surface spatial information therefore it is widely used in agricultural crops monitoring and timely assessment of drought stress using remote sensing is valuable for improving the crop management level in this study the drought stress was evaluated in the maize planting areas of the northeast and north china plain using satellite remote sensing technology the absolute distance index was used to identify the spatial pattern of the maize planting areas using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis derived enhanced vegetation index data that processed with savitzky golay filter the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi was derived from modis normalized difference vegetation index and land surface temperature data simultaneously soil moisture content smc was obtained for an eight day period and matched with satellite remote sensing data to characterize the drought stress of maize after estimating the field capacity and wilting point the smc was further transformed into the real available water content r awc of the soil our results indicated that negative correlations between r awc and tvdi was observed for the 0 10 cm r 2 0 594 and 20 30 cm r 2 0 641 soil layers respectively which was significantly better than the correlation between the smc and tvdi in the 0 10 r 2 0 396 and 20 30 cm r 2 0 499 soil layers moreover the sensitive period regarding the maize water demand were identified day of year 161 169 233 241 and 249 via the linear regression analysis of the measured maize yield and tvdi for eight day intervals furthermore the weights of the water demand of maize in different growth stages was determined via multiple linear regression analysis and a comprehensive drought index tvdisw was established to evaluate the drought stress in the whole maize growth period eventually a comprehensive analysis for the drought stress in the study area was conducted combined with various environmental factors furthermore the performance of this method was independent of the meteorological and field survey data which may facilitate

global warming have a great influence on the crop yield and crop quality in agricultural production lesk et al 2016 li et al 2009 the frequency and intensity of droughts which represent one of the most serious natural disasters affecting the sustainable development of agriculture are increasing hao et al 2012 wu et al 2011 maize is a typical rain fed upland crop and the dryland farming region of the northeast and north china plain is the most productive maize cultivation region in china wan et al 2019 therefore the drought stress in the whole maize growth period as well as the occurrence development and regression processes of maize drought over time must be critically studied to enhance the ability to mitigate the disasters in maize production and guide future maize cultivation at present two research methods are widely used for agricultural drought monitoring one is to construct a series of evaluation systems to analyze the drought status based on ground observation data such as pedologic uwizeyimana et al 2018 or meteorological masupha and moeletsi 2017 wang et al 2016a indicators in combination with growth and development characteristics of crops kocsis et al 2020 rigden et al 2020 however these indicators are observational data on the point scale and their spatial representation is limited even if spatial interpolation is used for data grid processing the monitoring accuracy is still extremely limited in regions with sparse observation stations distributions complex terrain and high spatial heterogeneity in contrast another method remote sensing which has the advantages of spatial continuity a wide monitoring space range and time and labor saving therefore the degree of crop drought can be determined based on the correlation of the remote sensing indices with indicators such as the crop phenotype soil moisture content smc and canopy temperature yang et al 2017 crop drought stress retrieved by remote sensing can be divided into three types including indices constructed based on i temperature indices ti cai et al 2007 mallick et al 2009 wang et al 2001 ii vegetation indices vi quiring and ganesh 2010 zarco tejada et al 2003 and iii the combination of the ti with vi chen et al 2020b kogan 2002 wang et al 2004 wang and qu 2007 simply use of the ti to construct drought indices is affected by altitude and topography factors additionally there is hysteresis when only using vegetation indices to investigate crop growth wang et al 2020a contrastingly the evaluation accuracy is more accurate to construct drought indices based on the combination of the ti with vi for instance sandholt et al 2002 reported that the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi formed by combination of lst ndvi can reflect the smc well because of the definite physical meaning and low requirement of complex parameters of remote sensing data tvdi has been widely applied in agricultural drought monitoring and extensive studies have confirmed its advantages wang et al 2004 li et al 2010 chen et al 2011 gao et al 2011 wei et al 2020 based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data crop drought can be monitored over large ranges and time series however limited by the larger range there is a lack of studies about crop drought with enough verification data in large spatial range which could be matched with multitemporal modis data besides a variety of studies on crop drought monitoring by remote sensing generally focused on the whole research region rather than crop planting areas son et al 2012 limiting the pertinence and practical guidance of the results the yield can directly evaluate crop growth and degree of drought however it is labor intensive and difficult to obtain a wide range of crop yield data accurately therefore real yield data are usually replaced by statistical data liu et al 2018 or remote sensing indexes e g normalized difference vegetation index ndvi gross primary productivity gpp net primary productivity npp li et al 2009 however the timeliness and accuracy of statistical data are limited in addition the spatial scope represented by statistical data is usually at the administrative region scale and thus it is impossible to clarify the crop growth status at the raster pixel scale although the remote sensing index can be obtained timely and on a large scale these indexes cannot fully represent the real yield and thus the verification of crop drought is limited furthermore few studies focused on the identification of the sensitive period regarding the water demand of a certain crop on the large scale thus it remains unclear how the drought stress affects a certain crop in different growth stages in this study we estimated the drought stress of the maize planting areas in the dryland farming region of the northeast and north china plain in 2019 the primary goal was to timely assess the drought stress using newly available modis soil sampling and maize yield data the major objectives of our study were to 1 accurately extract maize planting areas using the savitzky golay s g filter and absolute distance index adi 2 classify the maize growth stages under different water demand conditions using enhanced vegetation index evi time series data 3 clarify the relationship between the temperature vegetation drought index tvdi and real available water content r awc and between the tvdi and maize yield and 4 identify the sensitive period of maize regarding the water demand and effect of water stress on different maize growth stages our study provides a foundation for the improvement of crop drought stress evaluations based on satellite remote sensing indices soil moisture parameters and measured crop yields 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area the dryland farming region of the northeast and north china plain 32 8 48 23 n 112 34 134 46 e covers a total area of 71 2 104 km2 fig 1a its scope is defined as follows 1 it locates in the northern part of china including northeast and north china 2 the geomorphologic types include plains and tableland and 3 the dryland area within a 1 km2 grid accounts for 40 of the cultivated land the climate of the study area is mainly semi humid and arid and the dominant land cover type is cultivated land fig 1b it consists of seven provinces i e heilongjiang jilin liaoning hebei shandong henan and anhui and two municipalities beijing and tianjin including 525 counties the study area spans six secondary agricultural regions the sanjiang plain agricultural region sj songnen plain agricultural region sn and liaoning plain hilly agroforestry region ln belong to the dryland farming region of the northeast china plain dfr necp and the yan taihang mountain foothill plain agricultural region yt ji lu yu low lying plain agricultural region jly and huang huai plain agricultural region hh belong to the dryland farming region of the north china plain dfr ncp fig 1c the study area accounts for 7 42 for china s land area and the maize yield reached up to 8904 39 and 5299 33 104 t in dfr necp and dfr ncp respectively accounting for 55 23 of china s maize yield in 2018 therefore this study area is one of the most important grain production areas in china calculated from national bureau of statistics 2019 the overall profile of the study area is a long and narrow strip extending from northeast to southwest with the longest span of 2438 km and notable zonal characteristics and regional differentiation the annual average temperature in the study area decreases from 16 to 0 c and the annual precipitation of the dfr necp and dfr ncp is 400 600 mm and 600 800 mm respectively phaeozems chernozems and meadow soils are the main soil types in the dfr necp and fluvio aquatic cinnamon sandy saline alkali and lime concretion black soils are the main soil types in the dfr ncp the precipitation is mostly distributed in summer with large evapotranspiration because of the monsoon climate chen and xie 2012 and the precipitation does not meet the water demand of the crops in the key growth period leading to a water shortage and drought stress of crops smit and cai 1996 xu et al 2013 and thus affecting the growth and yield of crops therefore the dryland farming region of the northeast and north china plain was selected as the research object 2 2 materials 2 2 1 modis data we used terra modis eight day gridded level 3 global surface reflectance products mod09a1 at 500 m spatial resolution to calculate the vi including ndvi and evi terra modis eight day gridded level 3 global land surface temperature lst emissivity products mod11a2 at 1 km spatial resolution were used to calculate the lst the study area was covered by four image tiles h27v5 h27v4 h26v5 and h26v4 a total of 368 images was collected in 2019 all modis data were acquired from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov 2 2 2 soil sampling data to verify the reliability of the drought stress retrieval we collected soil samples from three typical maize planting counties from north to south lishu jingxian and yongqiao to acquire soil moisture data lishu with spring maize as the dominant crop is located in the dfr necp jingxian and yongqiao with summer maize as the main crop are located in the dfr ncp in our study the modis data which is a product synthesized in eight days were used to calculate the tvdi to match the soil sampling data with modis data we accomplished the soil sampling in lishu within eight days subsequently we collected soil samples in yongqiao and jingxian within eight days one cycle of soil moisture data collection in the study area was completed within 16 days fig 2a the sowing time of spring maize in northeast china is approximately may 1 earlier than that of summer maize in north china therefore lishu was selected to be the first soil sampling location the phenological period of summer maize in yongqiao starts earlier than that in jingxian due to the lower latitude of yongqiao therefore we collected the soil samples from lishu yongqiao and jingxian sequentially lishu yongqiao jingxian overall seven rounds of soil sampling were completed from mid june to the end of september the specific times of soil sampling in the three regions are shown in fig 2b c and d the distance among soil sampling points was 1 km to ensure that all sampling points were located within different modis raster pixel we collected soil samples from depths of 0 10 and 20 30 cm using the cutting ring 5 cm diameter 100 cm3 volume at 11 00 am 16 00 pm local time the smc is generally higher due to dew deposition in the morning or evening therefore we avoided collecting soil samples at those time the samples were stored in sealed bags and then immediately transported back to the laboratory to analyze smc 2 2 3 maize yield and maize planting areas verification data after the dough stage of maize the dry matter of the maize grains no longer increases therefore we carried out a large scale yield measurement of maize in the dfr necp the central longitude and latitude of the maize plot were recorded with handheld global position system gps receivers during the field yield measurement the determination rules for the maize plots were as follows 1 we selected plots covered with maize with different growth conditions to acquire different yield data 2 to avoid large deviations between the measured yield data and real yield we avoided the edges of roads irrigation ditches and terrace ridges as well as the facilities or objects that have an impact on the growth such as trees telegraph poles and wells while measuring the yield and 3 the plot area for the yield measurement should be larger than 500 500 m to link the measured yield data to satellite remote sensing data finally 69 effective plots of maize yield data were obtained fig 2e verification data for maize planting areas included field survey remote sensing interpretation and statistical data see supplementary material s1 for details 2 2 4 soil texture and organic matter data the soil texture and organic matter data 0 30 cm with 250 m spatial resolution were downloaded from soilgrids v0 5 3 global gridded soil information a system for digital soil mapping based on a global compilation of soil profile data and environmental layers https soilgrids org machine learning and spatial data mining were used to determine the relationships between the spatial change of the soil attributes and environmental variables and estimate the spatial distribution of the soil attributes based on these relationships hengl et al 2017 3 methods the research framework of this study was shown in fig 3 which includes four parts data collection and processing index calculation data verification and data application the first two steps are the foundation of the last two steps the fourth step is the core which revealed the maize moisture sensitive period and evaluated the drought stress spatiotemporally 3 1 modis vi and lst calculation the red blue and near infrared bands of mod09a1 data were extracted mosaicked and reprojected the pixels were resampled to 500 m resolution and the data were clipped to the extent of the study area all these processes were completed using the modis reprojection tool mrt dwyer and schmidt 2006 subsequently the modis ndvi tucker 1979 and modis evi huete et al 2002 data were calculated from the mod09a1 product for 2019 based on the following equations 1 n d v i ρ nir ρ r ρ nir ρ r 2 e v i 2 5 ρ nir ρ r l ρ nir c 1 ρ r c 2 ρ b where ρ nir ρ r and ρ b are the reflectance values of the near infrared 841 876 nm red 620 670 nm and blue bands 459 479 nm respectively l is the canopy background adjustment factor and c 1 and c 2 are the aerosol resistance weights the coefficients of the modis equation are l 1 c 1 6 and c 2 7 5 we extracted mosaicked and reprojected the mod11a2 data using the mrt software too to retrieve tvdi by combining vi and lst data the lst data were resampled to a spatial resolution of 500 m using the nearest neighbor method to match with the mod09a1 datasets liu et al 2018 hu et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 the lst data of the modis eight day synthesized product include a small number of invalid values due to cloud contamination and other factors therefore revised modis lst data were obtained by replacing the invalid values with peripheral normal values using the spatial interpolation tool of arcgis10 5 software 3 2 savitzky golay filter algorithm a polynomial function fitting method was established by savitzky and golay 1964 based on a weighted least squares regression approach the features e g maxima minima and widths of the dataset can be preserved by using this method kim et al 2014 the s g filter can be applied to any consecutive data when the data points are distributed at fixed and uniform intervals along the chosen abscissa the curve generated by graphing the points must be continuous and more or less smooth in our study the continuous points were evi values recorded every eight days because the evi values were distributed in eight day composites the application of the s g filter in this study can eliminate the influence of outliers of the vi caused by cloud contamination and thus the regular feature of evi can be extracted from time series data the s g filter algorithm is as follows chen et al 2004 3 y j i m i m c i y j 1 n where y is the original evi value y j is the filtered evi value c i is the coefficient for the i th evi value of the filter smoothing window and n is the number of convoluting integers equal to the smoothing window size 2m 1 the index j is a running index of the original ordinate data table the smoothing array filter size consists of 2m 1 points where m is the halfwidth of the smoothing window a larger value of m produces a smoother result at the expense of sharp peaks which are flattened 3 3 dividing maize growth stage under different water demand conditions moisture is one of the most important environmental factors affecting the maize growth drought will affect the maize yield and maize has different sensitivities to drought stress in different growth stages cakir 2004 from the seedling emergence stage to the jointing stage sixth ninth leaf stage ⅰ the maize is relatively fragile and very sensitive to moisture water shortage will directly affect the subsequent growth of maize wei et al 2019 from the bell mouthed stage tenth eleventh leaf to the tasseling stage stage ⅱ the large leaf area and high temperature lead to a large amount of evapotranspiration however this period is the most vigorous maize growth stage therefore enough water supply is required to ensure the maize growth ribaut et al 2009 the maize grain filling and rapid accumulation occur from the silking stage to the blister stage stage ⅲ an appropriate amount of water is still needed to guarantee the high yield of maize wang et al 2016b from the milk stage to the maturity stage stage ⅳ the total amount of dry matter of maize reach the maxima and the plants gradually wither and become yellow in this stage a decrease of the water supply has no significant influence on the maize yield and maize is not sensitive to drought stress subedi and ma 2009 in addition stages ⅰ and ⅱ are vegetative growth stages with increasing maize plant height and leaf area during which the evi varies from the minimum to the maximum stages ⅲ and ⅳ are reproductive growth stages during which the plant dries out and gradually turns yellow fig 4 the evi increases the most maximum slope of the evi curve in the bell mouthed stage and decreases the most minimum slope of the evi curve in the milk stage fig 4 zhang et al 2014 five key nodes of maize i e seedling emergence fastest growth peak growth rapid drying and full maturity were used to determine the four growth stages stages i ⅳ fig 4 wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2019a the maximum value of the evi time series data corresponds to the peak growth of maize after the first derivative of the evi time series data the maximum and minimum values correspond to the fastest growth and rapid drying of maize respectively most of the summer maize planting region in our study area is the cropping pattern of winter wheat and summer maize rotation that is summer maize is planted immediately after the winter wheat harvest therefore the evi time series of summer maize pixels presents an annual bimodal pattern the first and second minima of the evi correspond to the emergence and full maturity of the summer maize respectively practically nearly no other crops are planted following spring maize cultivation zhang et al 2019b due to the long growth period of spring maize from mid april to late october and limited accumulated temperature therefore the evi time series of spring maize pixels shows a single peak per year the time series curve of the spring maize pixel had no significant changes after applying the s g filter and the slope is close to 0 in the non growth period in contrast the slope of the evi significantly increases decreases after seeding before full maturity of the spring maize therefore based on several training samples we determined the date of spring maize emergence when inequality 4 was satisfied for the first time 4 e v i 1 8 m 1 1 m 1 1 m 1 e v i 1 8 m 1 where evi is the first derivative of the evi after application of the s g filter m is the m th eight day and m is 13 the 97th day of the julian calendar april 7 because spring maize is not sown until april similarly the date of full maturity of the spring maize was defined when inequality 5 was satisfied for the last time 5 e v i 1 8 n 1 1 46 n n 1 46 e v i 1 8 n where evi is the same as that specified in inequality 4 n is the n th eight day and n is 31 the 241th day of the julian calendar august 29 because spring maize does not fully mature after september 46 represents a total of 46 annual eight day periods 3 4 maize planting areas extraction and yield estimation the absolute distance index adi jing et al 2013 wang et al 2020b was used to extract the maize planting areas see supplementary material s2 for details the maize yield depends on three factors that is the ears per unit area kernels per ear and kernel weight lu et al 2017 mature maize was harvested by hand from two adjacent center rows in each plot we determined the ear density of the maize and measured 20 plants randomly selected from each plot the harvest samples were sun dried for approximately seven days and weighed after threshing the kernel number per ear was then counted we calculated the hundred grain weight hgw when the water content of the sundried grain was 15 measured with the oven drying method finally the real maize yield in the field was estimated using the following equation 6 y m n e n k h w 0 85 10 5 where y m is the maize yield kg ha 1 n e is the number of ears per ha n k is the number of kernels per ear h w is the hgw of one ear of maize g and 0 85 is the correction coefficient 3 5 retrieval of tvdi to investigate the drought stress in study area we applied the tvdi sandholt et al 2002 which is based on the empirical interpretation of the conceptual ndvi lst triangle fig 5 the ndvi strongly correlates with the growth of vegetation but it hardly reflects the moisture conditions of the vegetation and soil chen et al 2014 ji and peters 2003 the lst is more sensitive to water stress hu et al 2020 due to the relationship between the evapotranspiration and leaf temperature sharratt et al 1983 plant water deficit can cause the reduction of the transpiration rate and in turn the increase in the leaf temperature in the case of relatively low vegetation coverage the lst increase will aggravate the drought stress of vegetation boegh et al 1999 therefore the combination of the ndvi and lst to retrieve tvdi can provide more comprehensive information on the drought stress tvdi varies with different land cover for example woodland and cultivated land with better vegetation cover have higher smc and lower lst so tvdi value is at a low level generally whereas bare land and saline alkali land with poor vegetation cover have low smc and high lst and tvdi value is at a higher level fig 5 similar conclusions have been confirmed by relevant studies wang et al 2010 gao et al 2011 the tvdi is calculated as follows 7 t v d i l s t l s t min l s t max l s t min l s t max a dry b dry n d v i l s t min a wet b wet n d v i where lst and ndvi are the observed lst and ndvi calculated from a modis pixel respectively lst max and lst min are the maximum and minimum lst observations for a given ndvi respectively a dry and b dry are the intercept and slope of the dry edge upper straight line in the triangle respectively calculated from the ndvi lst space regression with small intervals of ndvi fig 5 line ac of the triangle and a wet and b wet are the intercept and slope of the wet edge lower straight line in the triangle respectively calculated from the ndvi lst space regression with small intervals of ndvi fig 5 line bc of the triangle the tvdi values range from 0 to 1 tvdi 1 at the dry edge indicating the lack of evapotranspiration from the soil vegetation system or limited moisture supply and tvdi 0 at the wet edge indicating maximum evapotranspiration from the soil vegetation system or unlimited moisture supply 3 6 calculation of the smc and rawc the smc was determined by oven drying the fresh soil samples and cutting ring at 105 c over 24 h volumetric smc was calculated using the following equation 8 θ v m w m d 100 where θ v is the volumetric smc cm3 cm3 m w is the wet weight of the soil samples and cutting ring g m d is the dry weight of the soil samples and cutting ring g and 100 is the volume of the cutting ring cm3 to evaluate the drought stress more accurately the measured smc was converted to the r awc to eliminate the unavailable water for crops the awc is determined based on the difference between the field capacity fc and wilting point wp ahmed et al 2010 koupai et al 2008 in our study the following rules were used to calculate the r awc i f smc w p f c t h e n r awc s m c w p i f smc f c t h e n r awc f c w p we obtained the fc and wp using a multivariate nonlinear regression estimation model developed based on 220 chinese soil samples zhou 2003 zhou et al 2005 9 f c 4 337 0 087 s a n d 0 002 s a n d 2 1 078 s i l t 0 012 s i l t 2 0 15 4 c l a y 0 011 c l a y 2 1 033 o m 0 435 o m 2 10 w

are the relative percentages of sand silt and clay in the soil respectively and om is the percentage of organic matter in the soil these two equations have been applied by many authors chen et al 2020c guo and shen 2015 liu et al 2017 3 7 evaluation of the drought stress the relationship between the measured maize yield and tvdi of each eight day phase during the growth period in the dfr necp was evaluated with the unary linear regression ulr ye et al 2019 deng et al 2020 to determine the sensitive period of drought stress for maize which is statistically significant and has a high r 2 we quantified the impact of the tvdi on the maize yield in different water demand stages using a multiple linear regression mlr model this model has been frequently used as empirical model or approximating function and to establish a mathematical model to describe the contribution of each factor independent variable to a real world phenomenon dependent variable jung et al 2017 lee et al 2019 in our study the maize yield measurement data were considered as the dependent variable whereas the tvdi of the raster pixels in the four water demand stages was considered to be the independent variable the mlr model used in our study is presented in eq 11 11 y c β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β 4 x 4 where y is the measured maize yield c is a constant x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 are the mean tvdi values in stages i ii ⅲ and ⅳ of maize growth respectively and β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 are the regression coefficients corresponding to x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 respectively after we acquired β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 by using the mlr model we converted the values to weight coefficients using eq 12 12 w i β i i 1 4 β i where w i are the weights of the tvdi in the i th maize growth stage and β i are the regression coefficients derived from eq 11 we applied the weight parameters derived from eq 12 multiplied by the tvdi of the four water demand stages using arcgis 10 5 software finally the spatial pattern of the maize drought stress in 2019 was obtained 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial patterns of the maize growth stages the spatial patterns of five key nodes of the maize growth period in the dfr necp were shown in fig 6a the southern and northern dfr necp were seeded and emerged first from mid to late april and the typical phaeozem belt in the middle of the dfr necp was seeded and emerged relatively late from early to mid may therefore there is no notable delay in the seedling emergence of maize with increasing latitude in the dfr necp this finding corroborated with the results of previous studies zhang et al 2014 one possible reason for this phenomenon is that the higher latitude limits the accumulation temperature in the northern part of the dfr necp such that the growth period of maize is longer than that in other regions therefore the seedling emergence occurs relatively earlier than in the center of the dfr necp in addition maize cultivars tillage systems and the rice spectral interference in the maize data of the northern part of the dfr necp may be factors causing this phenomenon the fastest growth period has notable latitudinal variations namely this growth period was gradually delayed from south to north the fastest peak and fully mature growth periods of the ln occur earlier than those of sn and sj regions in the ln and sj regions the rapid drying period starts earlier than in the typical phaeozem belt of sn region similar results were obtained by zhang et al 2014 when they correlated the phenological phase tasseling and milk ripening with the latitudes of maize planting areas they found that there was no regularity in the delay of the phenological period with the increase in the latitude because september 6 21 of the quick drying period were in the typical phaeozem belt of the dfr necp we suggest that this phenomenon might be related to the soil factors the spatial patterns of five key nodes of the maize growth period in the dfr ncp were shown in fig 6b summer maize planting areas were observed in the dfr ncp except for the northern part of the yt region which was spring maize planting areas therefore the seeding and emergence stages in the northern part of the yt region started earlier from late april to the end of may whereas they start in june in the summer maize planting areas of the dfr ncp the five key nodes of the maize growth period showed several latitudinal variations in the dfr ncp that is each growth period of the summer maize planting areas was delayed with the increase in the latitude similar results were observed by wang et al 2020b 4 2 spatiotemporal patterns of the tvdi in maize planting areas the spatial pattern of the mean tvdi value of each stage in the dfr necp is shown in fig 7a affected by the geographical zonation the temperature in the study area is high in the southern region and low in the northern region and the precipitation is high in the eastern part and low in the western part of the study area during the maize growing period jiang 1993 hartmann and wang 2014 therefore the difference of the tvdi is higher in the southern than in the northern part of the region and higher in the western than in the eastern region of the dfr necp similar patterns were also observed in the dfr ncp fig 7b in the dfr necp the peak value of the tvdi pixel frequency distribution were observed in stage ⅱ 0 35 0 40 followed by stage ⅰ 0 30 0 35 stage ⅲ 0 25 0 30 and stage ⅳ 0 20 0 25 fig 7a whereas it has the following order in the dfr ncp stage ⅰ 0 45 0 50 stages ⅲ and ⅳ 0 40 0 45 and stage ⅱ 0 30 0 35 fig 7b the pixel value of the tvdi in the dfr ncp was larger than that in the dfr necp this means that the drought stress of maize in the dfr ncp is more severe than that in the dfr necp which can be explained by the higher evapotranspiration and less surface water and groundwater resources in the dfr ncp compared with the dfr necp tang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 in the dfr necp the mean value of the tvdi increases first and then decreases and the maximum value can be observed in stage ⅱ fig 7c in the dfr ncp the mean value of the tvdi fluctuates and the tvdi reaches the maximum and minimum values in stages ⅰ and ⅱ respectively fig 7c in addition the variation of the peak value of the tvdi pixel frequency distribution was consistent with the mean value of the tvdi of the four maize growth stages in each secondary agricultural region in the dfr necp stage i occurred from mid april to late june this stage is not the rainy season therefore a certain degree of drought was observed during stage ii which occurred in july the water consumption for maize growth improved and the temperature and transpiration increased as a result the drought stress and tvdi continuously increased stage iii occurred from late july to early september the rain belt moved from north china to northeast china and a typhoon made landfall which led to a large amount of precipitation in late august consequently the drought stress and tvdi decreased stage iv occurred from september to mid october when the temperature dropped evapotranspiration weakened and the intensity of water consumption for crops decreased thus the drought stress and tvdi declined further fig 7c in the dfr ncp stage i occurred in june with little precipitation based on local farmers the survey area was relatively dry at that time and many locations required artificial irrigation to ensure maize emergence therefore the tvdi in this stage was relatively high stage ii occurred from early july to mid july with the beginning of the rainy season in north china thus the tvdi and drought stress decreased stage iii occurred from late july to mid august the rain belt continued to move to northeast china accelerating the drought and increasing the tvdi in north china stage iv occurred from late august to mid october the rain belt retreated southward and the intensity of water consumption of crops decreased therefore the drought stress was relieved and the tvdi started to decrease again fig 7c the vegetation index ndvi evi varies greatly in different crop growth period and the drought degree of the crop easily fluctuated with meteorological factors high temporal resolution is particularly important for accurate retrieval for maize drought monitoring therefore we uniformly selected the eight day vi and lst datasets to retrieve tvdi and the lst dataset was resampled from 1 km to 500 m resolution this processing method can keep that tvdi has both high temporal 8 day and spatial 500 m resolution which has been used in many studies liu et al 2018 hu et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 previous studies of the crop drought retrieval based on the tvdi generally focused on the whole research area arekhi et al 2019 chen et al 2011 son et al 2012 2019 rather than the crop pixel evaluation therefore the results usually lack pertinence and hardly reveal the true drought stress of the crops in contrast our study focused on the maize pixels in the whole growth period to analyze the tvdi and thus has the advantage of precision 4 3 relationship between the tvdi and soil moisture in total 189 measured smc datapoints of seven phases in lishu jingxian and yongqiao were used to verify the accuracy of the tvdi retrieval the regression coefficient between the tvdi and smc of 0 10 cm and 20 30 cm soil layers was 0 396 and 0 499 respectively p 0 01 fig 8a and b a previous study showed that the r 2 value of the 0 10 cm soil layers was less than in 20 30 cm in the ncp chen et al 2011 which could be explained as follows the roots of the maize are mostly distributed at a depth of 30 cm wiesler and horst 1994 therefore smc of the 20 30 cm layer correlates more with the drought of maize compared with that of the 0 10 cm layer in addition the variation of smc decreases with increasing soil depth qiu et al 2001 therefore the smc of the 20 30 cm soil layer fluctuates 15 35 fig 8b less than that of the 0 10 cm soil layer 10 40 fig 8a which better reflects the natural soil water properties the r 2 value obtained in our study is slightly higher than that of previous studies chen et al 2011 li et al 2010 we suggest that this may be related to the multitemporal and large spatial range of the soil data we collected to reduce the systematic error of the data in our study however the effect of the smc on crop growth varies depending on the soil type due to the influence of the soil texture bescansa et al 2006 for example hygroscopic water which accounts for a high proportion in clay hardly absorbed and utilized by crops chen et al 2020a thus this part of water should be eliminated from the smc to better characterize the water supply conditions of the crops the wp represents the base level at which crop roots can absorb moisture from the soil sánchez et al 2012 in addition due to the influence of artificial irrigation precipitation terrain and other factors the smc may exceed the fc the excessive water will then be quickly lost due to gravity and cannot be timely utilized by crops cowan 1965 the correlation between r awc and tvdi is higher than that between the smc and tvdi the r 2 of the linear regression between the tvdi and r awc of the 0 10 cm and 20 30 cm soil layers is 0 594 and 0 641 respectively p 0 01 fig 8c and d which indicates that the r awc are relatively reliable and reasonably reflect the drought stress of the crops however the r 2 value of the linear regression between the tvdi and r awc in our study fig 8c and d is lower than that reported by garcia et al 2008 we speculate that the empirical models used to calculate the fc and wp may have resulted in a decline of the accuracy of r awc in our study in addition the soil texture and organic matter data used in the models were derived from remote sensing with a spatial resolution of 250 m rather than data measured in the field which also could cause the lower r 2 in our study however we suggest that the conversion of the smc to r awc will significantly improve the accuracy of future crop drought research 4 4 drought stress of maize to confirm the sensitive period of drought stress for maize the time series for r 2 based on the ulr analysis is shown in fig 9 the r 2 value fluctuates throughout the maize growing season it reached 0 4 0 5 p 0 01 on doy 161 169 225 233 and 241 the yield measurement plots of maize on doy 161 and 169 june 10 25 fig 6a were pixels in the maize jointing stage which was the fastest growth period maize requires a sufficient water supply as its rapid growth consumes more water for the photosynthesis of leaves leading to the rapid growth of the roots and above ground leaves the yield measurement plots of maize on doy 225 233 and 241 august 13 to september 5 fig 6a are in pixels between the peak growth and quick drying period which belong to the maize grain filling stage stage ⅲ at that time the lack of water supply affected the growth of maize kernels which further influenced the maize yield on doy 105 281 and 289 the r 2 was low and statistically insignificant we assume that this may be due to the fact that the seedling emergence time and full maturity harvest time of maize of different plots are not consistent therefore there was no notable correlation between the tvdi and maize yield on the rest of the doy r 2 ranges from 0 1 to 0 3 roughly p 0 05 this indicates that the drought will affect the maize yield however these periods are not the most sensitive periods of drought stress for maize the mlr analysis between the measured maize yield and mean tvdi value in each of the four water demand stages in the dfr necp shows that the β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 are 39 320 38 677 41 071 and 28 415 respectively r 2 0 548 p 0 01 the mlr coefficients were all negative indicating a negative correlation between the tvdi drought stress and maize yield the absolute value of the regression coefficient was maximal in stage ⅲ suggesting that this was the most critical period regarding maize water requirements which was consistent with the maximum r 2 value on doy 233 249 based on ulr analysis fig 9 the higher absolute value of the regression coefficient in stage ⅰ compared with stage ⅱ showed that the seedling emergence stage to jointing stage was another critical period regarding the water requirements which was consistent with another maximum r 2 value obtained by ulr analysis on doy 161 169 fig 9 the minimum absolute regression coefficient was obtained in stage ⅳ indicating that the maize becomes insensitive to drought stress with gradual maturation the diseases e g puccinia polysora and anthracnose and pests e g armyworm and ostrinia nubilalis will also affect the maize yield but according to our field investigation diseases and pests in different regions and growth seasons did not severely influence the maize growth due to farmer s fine management macroscopically moreover previous studies have shown that drought and heat damage were the main natural factors affecting maize yield in northeast and north china plain ren et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 therefore we believe that maize diseases and pests certainly exist but drought stress may be still the main limiting factor affecting maize yield in our study area accordingly the disturbance of diseases and pests can be ignored under the premise of limited data the tvdisw in the dfr necp gradually decreases with increasing latitude fig 10a the latitude in the sj agricultural region is relatively high therefore the surface evapotranspiration is weak in this region in addition the surface water resources are abundant due to numerous rivers songhua amur and ussuri rivers fig 10a and wetlands based on the low lying terrain fig 10c in this region thus the drought stress of maize was relatively low compared with that in the sn and ln agricultural regions in addition the tvdisw was larger in the southcentral part of the sj agricultural region which was consistent with the area with the mean annual precipitation of less than 500 mm fig 10e and spatial distribution of the semi humid region fig 10d the tvdisw was higher in the western part of the sn agricultural region which was consistent with the spatial pattern of the semi humid area fig 10d in addition sandy soils are widely distributed in this region fig 10b the poor water retention of sandy soils is also an important factor leading to the drought of maize the maize planting areas in the ln agricultural region are consistent with the spatial pattern of the semi humid area therefore the tvdisw was higher in the ln agricultural region the tvdisw was the highest in the southwestern part of the ln agricultural region which belongs to hilly area fig 10c with poor irrigation conditions the limited water supply of maize results in a very high tvdisw 5 conclusions it is of great significance to obtain agricultural drought information on a large scale in a timely and accurate manner in this study we evaluated the drought stress in maize planting areas in the dryland farming region of the northeast and north china plain in 2019 using remote sensing methods in combination with various types of ground measurements based on the evi time series data and s g filtering the spatial distribution patterns of maize planting areas was obtained by using the adi method we used eight day synthetic modis ndvi and lst data to retrieve the tvdi that characterizes the drought stress of maize the results showed that the tvdi had a strong negative correlation with r awc r 2 of 0 594 and 0 641 in the 0 10 cm and 20 30 cm soil layers respectively we conducted ulr analysis for each period of tvdi with the maize yield data measured in the dfr necp the results indicated the water demand sensitive periods of maize which were the fastest growth period vegetative growth and peak growth quick drying periods reproductive growth after dividing the tvdi based on the four water demand stages of maize we performed an mlr between the tvdi and measured maize yield data in the dfr necp and converted the regression coefficients into weights to obtain the tvdisw we combined the tvdisw with environmental factors to analyze the drought stress our results demonstrate the merit of a method by using eight day modis ndvi and lst data for regional drought monitoring which can be extended to other global locations for the timely monitoring of droughts over large scale regions the results improve our knowledge about the spatiotemporal process of maize drought stress and its driving mechanisms in addition the accurate mapping of maize planting areas and the tvdi will help to understand the effects of agroecosystems and their relationships with water resources and climate change credit authorship contribution statement zhong liu and wei wan conceived the research wei wan wrote the manuscript wei wan hanqing wu and zhong liu edited the manuscript
