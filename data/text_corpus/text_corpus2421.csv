environmental design faculty of collaborative regional innovation graduate school of science and engineering ehime university matsuyama ehime japan corresponding author groundwater aquifer vulnerability to nitrate has become a major concern to all stakeholders involved in managing the quality of water in relation to human health this paper presents fuzzy inference system fis as an alternative to the conventional overlay index methods for the evaluation of groundwater vulnerability to nitrate pollution in watershed scale within gis environment a multilayer fis model is developed taking advantage of expert knowledge based drastic system in order to overcome the problem of rule explosion a case study relating to groundwater vulnerability assessment in shallow aquifer of kathmandu basin in nepalis accomplished the correlations between groundwater vulnerability indices and nitrate n concentration values were carried out for the validation of vulnerability models the result shows that the best combination is obtained from fuzzy vulnerability model r 0 52 followed by drastic method r 0 38 we have also developed a groundwater nitrate n risk map by integrating groundwater aquifer vulnerability the nitrate n distribution map pollution severity and the probability of occurrence map based on the limiting threshold value of nitrate n spatial distribution map of nitrate n shows that nearly 10 of the study area lies within high hazard class which exceeds limiting value of 10 mg l nitrate n value and nearly 50 of the shallow aquifer fall within medium hazard class which has impacted level of nitrate n i e between 2 mg l and 10 mg l these results also indicate that the northern part of the kathmandu basin and highly permeable alluvial deposits are dominated by very high vulnerability level and are also under a threat of high nitrate n risk groundwater aquifer vulnerability and nitrate risk maps are expected to facilitate design and development strategies towards protecting environment and preventing further deterioration of the affected aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater vulnerability nitrate risk multilayer fis model drastic nepal 1 introduction removal of nitrate from groundwater aquifers is often technically problematic and costly and finding alternative sources for water supply is not always possible strategies for protecting groundwater aquifer from contaminations like nitrate n rather than developing new water resources and water supply projects may in many cases prove to be the optimal policy therefore groundwater aquifer vulnerability to nitrate has become a major concern to all stakeholders involved in managing water quality in relation to human health in recognition of the need for effective and efficient methods for protecting groundwater resources from future contamination scientists and water resource managers have sought to develop techniques of predicting which areas are more likely than others to get contaminated as a result of human activities on or near the ground surface national research council 1993 this concept has been widely termed as groundwater vulnerability to contamination many overlay index methods are used to evaluate groundwater vulnerability to contamination but the most widely used techniques include drastic aller et al 1987 god foster 1987 avi stempvoort et al 1993 sintacs verba and zaporozec 1994 and epik technique doerfliger et al 1999 drastic is a method that considers the main hydrological and geological factors which affect the downward migration of pollutants in aquifers its acronym stands for the seven hydrogeological parameters depth to water recharge aquifer media soil type topography slope impact on the vadose zone media and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer god is also an overlay and index method designed to map groundwater vulnerability over large regions based on three parameters groundwater confinement overlying strata and depth to groundwater ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 according to stempvoort et al 1993 the aquifer vulnerability index avi method is developed in canada for mapping the vulnerability of groundwater is based on two key parameters 1 thickness of each sedimentary unit above the uppermost aquifer and 2 estimated hydraulic conductivity of each of these layers epik is a point count system method developed in switzerland doerfliger et al 1999 and was the first attempt of vulnerability mapping specifically for karstic environments it consists of four parameters epikarst e protective cover p infiltration conditions and i and the degree of karstic network development k the sintacs method was developed by civita 1994 for improving and adapting the drastic model to the particularities of italy and the letters in sintacs are the first letters of the italian words that define the models factors barbulescu 2020 they are the depth to the water table soggicenza effective infiltration infiltrazione attenuation capacity of the unsaturated zone nonsaturo type of the soil media tipologia della copertura characteristics of the saturated zone acquifero hydraulic conductivity conducibilità and topographic slope superficie topografica among these methods drastic has been frequently used by many researchers either in its original form or in modified form e g lynch et al 1997 fritch et al 2000 babiker et al 2005 rahman 2008 pathak et al 2009 yin et al 2013 malik and shukla 2019 noori et al 2019 jia et al 2019 liang et al 2019 etc several researchers have also evaluated the performance of different overlay index methods for example shrestha et al 2017 report that drastic and god methods are comparable as understood from the perspective of risk to pollution results out of shallow groundwater aquifer in the kathmandu valley in nepal similarly abdullah et al 2020 evaluated the performance of two different index models namely vlda lithology of vadose zone v pattern of land use l groundwater depth d and aquifer characteristics a and cop flow concentration c overly layers o and precipitation p and confirmed that the vlda vulnerability model reflects the real vulnerability situation in the halabja saidsadiq basin compared to the cop model although they are widely used in various parts of the world overlay index methods have several limitations generally speaking an overlay index method like drastic is unable to describe a continuous transition from the easiest to be polluted to the most difficult to be polluted which is fuzzy nature of the groundwater vulnerability to contamination in this method the nature of the vulnerability is taken into account by dividing the values of each affecting factor into ranges and then giving a rating value to each range however groundwater vulnerability function should be continuous if a factor value can be measured numerically moreover insufficient hydrogeologic database and inherent uncertainty of groundwater vulnerability also make the overlay index methods difficult to use for assessing groundwater aquifer vulnerability a fuzzy model can solve this problem and it has been used by incorporating non linear mapping of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability concept benefiting from fuzzy engine and expert knowledge based drastic parameters such as by dixon 2005 nobre et al 2007 afshar et al 2007 pathak and hiratsuka 2011 rezai et al 2013 dixon et al 2005 reported that the fuzzy rule based model generated with 40 less data than in the drastic method produced better coincidence results when compared with contaminated sources nevertheless conventional fuzzy inference systems are often problematic due to exponential increase in rules in a fuzzy model having n number of input parameters each input parameter is defined to have i membership functions mfs so for a full fuzzy inference system in number of fuzzy rules are required for a fuzzy inference system designed to have 7 input variables and 3 numbers of mfs for each variable the entire number of rules obligatory to completely implement the system will be 37 it is particularly difficult for an expert to incorporate those large numbers of rules with enough attention any abnormality in rule designing may lead to human casualties or wastage of money or both hence minimization of rules is always an important issue a solution is to divide the fuzzy inference system in sub modules in a hierarchical form to overcome the issue of rule explosion hierarchical fuzzy inference system hfis reduces the total number of rules required and these methods have been used by different authors in their work for various applications for instance yager et al 1998 constructed a hierarchical type fuzzy system model called hierarchical prioritized structure and studied its structure in detail likewise ikbal et al 2015 used this approach to evaluate groundwater vulnerability map and fayaz et al 2017 has developed a technique for underground risk assessment using hierarchical fuzzy logic hfl ikbal et al 2015 use interpolation techniques based on selected sample point values from the study area obtained from hfis model here in this work we present a hierarchical fuzzy inference system hfis for computing groundwater vulnerability index in a pixel size of 30 m by developing a matlab code and integrating it with geographic information system gis so as to generate fuzzy groundwater vulnerability map of the study area a multilayer fis model has been developed benefitting from expert knowledge based drastic system to produce groundwater vulnerability maps showing the likelihood of groundwater pollution caused by different hydrogeological factors as a result a case of groundwater vulnerability assessment study in relation to shallow aquifer of kathmandu basin in nepal has been created we also validate the multilayer fis model with drastic method and nitrate n data of the study area moreover nitrate n risk map was made by integrating the validated groundwater vulnerability map obtained from hfis model nitrate n hazard map and the probability of occurrence calculated by indicator kriging ik interpolation based on the specified tolerable nitrate n concentration we used ordinary kriging ok method a geostatistical interpolation technique for the interpolation of the nitrate concentration from 100 groundwater sources to develop nitrate n pollution map 2 material and methods 2 1 fuzzy logic approach first introduced by zadeh 1965 fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory have been extensively used in ambiguity and uncertainty modeling in decision making the basic concept in fuzzy logic is quite simple statements are not only true or false but also represent the degree of truth or degree of falseness for each input fuzzy sets are defined by their membership function which are therefore the core of the entire concept there are different types of membership functions such as continuous piecewise linear functions triangular and trapezoidal shape and continuous piecewise exponential membership functions such as gaussian functions fuzzy sets and fuzzy operators are the subjects and verbs of fuzzy logic the if then rule statements are used to formulate the conditional statements that comprise fuzzy logic the standard operations correspond to a logical if then base with and or and not operators for instance if x is a and y is b then z is c where a b and c are linguistic values defined by fuzzy sets on the ranges universes of discourse x y and z respectively the if part of the rule is called the antecedent or premise while the then part of the rule is called the consequent or conclusion fuzzy inference is the process of formulating the mapping from a given input to an output using fuzzy logic that employs the rules upon which decisions are made the process of fuzzy inference involves membership functions logical operations and if then rules generally a fuzzy rule based model is comprised of fuzzification of input variables application of fuzzy operator in the antecedent degree of fulfilment implication from antecedent to the consequent inference aggregation of the consequents across the rules and defuzzification a large number of input variables results in an exponential increase in rules which will be problematic in the use of single layer fuzzy inference system in order to overcome the problem of rule explosion a multilayer fuzzy inference system i e hierarchical rule technique in the fuzzy system design was selected in this study a methodological outline of hierarchical fuzzy inference system and drastic method for evaluating groundwater aquifer vulnerability maps and nitrate n risk map is shown in fig 1 the membership functions can be constructed from several basic functions such as piecewise linear functions the gaussian distribution function the sigmoid curve quadratic and cubic polynomial curves the triangular and trapezoidal membership functions are the simplest and have been used in this study due to their modelling flexibility each input domain was divided into three sub domains i e low medium and high and output domain divided into five sub domains i e very low low medium high and very high in general fuzzy rule based systems benefit from rule bases which are mainly organized using experts knowledge in this study we employ expert knowledge from the general knowledge of the experts who developed the drastic system but one may benefit from knowledge of local experts and knowledge obtained from computer simulation to improve the rules and system performances for example the rules are of the form if d depth to groundwater is l low and r recharge is h high then fis1 is vh very high 2 2 preparation of input parameters the study area covers nearly whole of the kathmandu valley approximate area 337 sq km the main urban centre of nepal and a part of upper bagmati river basin as shown in fig 2 because of inadequate and intermittent piped water supply people use a variety of groundwater sources from shallow aquifer of kathmandu basin including dug wells tube wells and stone spouts dhunge dhara the quality of shallow groundwater sources is severely degraded due to nitrate n coliform bacteria and iron contamination led by anthropogenic activities so groundwater aquifer vulnerability map will be a useful tool to protect shallow aquifers from further contamination all seven input data layers used in creating vulnerability maps in this work were generated and or obtained from their original source as a point line or polygon layer of the study area these seven parameters contributing to the groundwater vulnerability were then converted into raster datasets of 30 m 30 m grid resolution using gis platform as shown in fig 3 the input matrix in any fuzzy subsystem is an 859 744 matrix covering the whole study area the details of acquisition the individual data layers and method of generating input parameters are reported in pathak and hiratsuka 2011 2 3 groundwater vulnerability nitrate n hazard and risk maps the drastic vulnerability index is a weighted sum of the seven previously mentioned hydrogeological parameters after multiplying each parameter with rates and weights respectively details on groundwater vulnerability mapping using drastic method are given elsewhere in pathak et al 2009 drastic indices were normalized to compare them with fuzzy indexes the multi layer fuzzy inference system based vulnerability map was developed by using the same drastic input parameters in this process at first all the input raster map layers were converted into ascii format to feed as input parameter to fis model for the design of multilayer fuzzy model matlab r fuzzy toolbox was employed where a matlab code was developed for computing the fuzzy vulnerability value in each pixel the output of this fis model was then integrated with gis to develop the groundwater vulnerability map fig 1 above clearly shows multilayer fuzzy inference system works where the first two input parameters i e depth to water table and net recharge are aggregated in first model fis1 and next two input parameters i e aquifer media and soil type are aggregated in the second model fis2 then the outputs from first and second models are aggregated in the next stage model in the subsequent manner the groundwater vulnerability to pollution index is obtained from final model fis6 fuzzy inference used here in this study is a minimum mamdani inference and a central defuzzification method groundwater contamination risk can be defined as the probability that groundwater in the aquifer will become contaminated to an unacceptable level due to human activities on the immediately overlaying land surface vu et al 2019 morris and foster 2000 defined the risk of aquifer pollution as probability values of groundwater pollution exceeding the tolerable level caused by activities above the plain surface therefore the groundwater risk map depends on three factors groundwater vulnerability pollution and probability of pollution occurrence employing this concept the nitrate n risk was calculated as in eq 1 1 risk vulnerability ground water pollution probability of pollution occurrence where vulnerability and groundwater pollution represent the consequential damage of groundwater aquifer and probability of pollution occurrence is the likelihood of occurrence of a pollution that damages the aquifer in this study the criterion considered for the damage of the aquifer was the limiting value of nitrate n for drinking water quality i e 10 mg l the study employed the geostatistical interpolation methods like ordinary kriging ok method for the interpolation of the nitrate concentration from 100 groundwater sources to develop nitrate n pollution map for the calculation of the probability of exceeding the tolerable nitrate n concentration of 10 mg l for drinking water we conducted indicator kriging ik interpolation based on the specified threshold in the study the selection of the ok variogram model relied on the best fit of the experimental variograms obtained from the data both drastic and fuzzy groundwater vulnerability models were also validated using nitrate n data of shallow groundwater aquifer of kathmandu valley 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater aquifer vulnerability maps both drastic and fuzzy groundwater vulnerability maps were made for shallow aquifer of kathmandu basin as a case study as presented in fig 4 the range of the vulnerability indices was classified into five classes using jenk s natural break method very low low medium high and very high the result shows that 36 of study area lies under high class while 22 and 21 area fall under very high and medium class in drastic vulnerability map in case of fuzzy vulnerability map it predicted 29 22 23 and 21 of study area as very high high medium and low class respectively in the study area high to very high vulnerability class is dominant which is probably due to high recharge rate resulting in shallow water table 10m with almost flat area 2 slope fig 4 a and b show relative degree of groundwater vulnerability to contamination a high index indicates the capacity of the hydrogeologic environment and the landscape factors to readily move waterborne contaminants into the groundwater and consequently need to be managed more closely low index represents groundwater that is better protected from contaminant leaching by natural environment 3 2 validation of multilayer fis model as the proposed fuzzy models area decision making tool benefitted from experts knowledge the model validation is very important however validation of any general hydrogeological knowledge based groundwater vulnerability models with field measured contaminants information in any aquifer systems is quite difficult due to the qualitative nature of vulnerability and inherent uncertainty the modelled results should validate from field observations in this study we validate the model performance by comparing the results with those of drastic index to compare the fuzzy vulnerability index with the drastic index the correlation coefficient was calculated which depicts the relationship between two datasets the purpose of the correlation analysis here is to see whether the multilayer fis model follows the same trend as that of drastic output or not in this case the correlation coefficient determines the cell values from one map i e output of fuzzy model as they relate to the cell values of another map layer i e output of drastic method the correlation between two vulnerability maps is a measure of dependency between the map layers the output of multilayer fuzzy rule based vulnerability model is well correlated with drastic output r 0 82 as shown in fig 5 since the proposed fuzzy rule based model employs expert knowledge from the general knowledge of the experts who developed the drastic system its output should follow the same trend as that of drastic output since nitrate n is commonly used as an environmental indicator to trace the impact of anthropogenic activities on groundwater the output of vulnerability models were tested using measured nitrate data from the shallow aquifer of kathmandu the sampled groundwater wells were overlaid on the groundwater vulnerability maps in order to see how many wells with high concentration of nitrate are found in different vulnerable zones a groundwater vulnerability map based on aquifer characteristics does not consider contaminants sources loading and transport mechanism into groundwater systems but it is encouraging to find that majority of sampled sources which exceeded the permissible limit value of nitrate n are located in the high to very high vulnerable zones moreover the correlations between vulnerability indices produced by both models and nitrate n concentration values were carried out fig 6 a clearly shows a significant positive correlation between nitrate concentration and the fuzzy groundwater vulnerability indices with a coefficient value of 0 52 it seems fuzzy vulnerability indices have better correlation with nitrate n value rather than drastic index 0 38 as shown in fig 6 b these results suggest that the groundwater vulnerability map of shallow groundwater aquifer in the kathmandu basin is generally consistent with observed nitrate contamination near the water table this result also confirms the validation and reliability of multilayer fis model which reflects an aquifer s inherent capacity to become contaminated 3 3 nitrate n risk map of the study area a total of 100 nitrate n values from the groundwater wells of shallow aquifer in the kathmandu basin were interpolated using ordinary kriging ok method a geostatistical interpolation method to develop nitrate n pollution map as shown in fig 7 a the nitrate n distribution map of study area was divided into three classes low 0 2 mg l medium 2 10 mg l and high 10 mg l the nitrate n distribution map shows that nearly 10 of the study area lies within the high hazard area which exceeds the limiting value of 10 mg l nitrate n value and nearly 50 of shallow aquifer falls within the medium hazard level which has impacted level of nitrate n i e between 2 and 10 mg l based on the indicator kriging ik algorithm applied to the observations the probability map of nitrate occurrence in the shallow groundwater aquifer of the kathmandu valley were obtained and the probability mapis shown in fig 7 b in the study the calculations of probability relied on the nitrate n concentration threshold i e 10 mg l defined the groundwater contamination risk is a probability that the groundwater in an aquifer will get contaminated up to an unacceptable level the risk represents the combination of the aquifer vulnerability nitrate n pollution and probability of occurrence of nitrate n pollution therefore using eq 1 above we integrated groundwater vulnerability map nitrate n pollution map and probability map to obtain the risk map as shown in fig 7 c the nitrate n risk map was classified into three classes using jenk s natural break method the results also clearly show that the northern part of the kathmandu basin and highly permeable alluvial deposits are dominated by very high vulnerability level with high risk of nitrate pollution and the water quality in these areas could affect the health of the inhabitants the nitrate n risk maps can also be used to identify areas that currently are at risk and they help identify areas where groundwater has been affected by human activities 4 conclusions the drastic parameters were introduced to a multilayer fuzzy inference system in order to develop groundwater vulnerability map which helps to rank the highly vulnerable area or low vulnerable area in shallow groundwater aquifer of kathmandu basin in nepal the model proposed in this study is very useful in overcoming the problem of exponential increase in rules due to a large number of input variables it significantly improved the results over traditional overlay index method like drastic the drastic vulnerability map shows that 36 of study area lies under high vulnerable class while 22 and 21 area fall under very high and medium vulnerable class in case of fuzzy vulnerability model it has predicted 29 22 23 and 21 of study area as very high high medium and low vulnerable class respectively the correlations between vulnerability indices produced by both the models and nitrate n concentration values measured from shallow aquifer show that the best combination is obtained from fuzzy vulnerability model r 0 52 followed by drastic method r 0 38 it suggests that the groundwater vulnerability map of shallow groundwater aquifer in the kathmandu basin is generally consistent with observed nitrate contamination near the water table in addition to the development of groundwater vulnerability map the groundwater risk map due to nitrate n has been generated by integrating groundwater aquifer vulnerability the nitrate n distribution map pollution severity and the probability of occurrence map based on the limiting threshold value of nitrate n the nitrate n risk map shows the areas that currently are at risk and help identify areas where groundwater has been affected by human activities groundwater vulnerability and nitrate n risk maps can be used by policy makers and water managers to protect groundwater sources and to implement best management practices bmps in the vulnerable areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

vulnerability to nitrate has become a major concern to all stakeholders involved in managing the quality of water in relation to human health this paper presents fuzzy inference system fis as an alternative to the conventional overlay index methods for the evaluation of groundwater vulnerability to nitrate pollution in watershed scale within gis environment a multilayer fis model is developed taking advantage of expert knowledge based drastic system in order to overcome the problem of rule explosion a case study relating to groundwater vulnerability assessment in shallow aquifer of kathmandu basin in nepalis accomplished the correlations between groundwater vulnerability indices and nitrate n concentration values were carried out for the validation of vulnerability models the result shows that the best combination is obtained from fuzzy vulnerability model r 0 52 followed by drastic method r 0 38 we have also developed a groundwater nitrate n risk map by integrating groundwater aquifer vulnerability the nitrate n distribution map pollution severity and the probability of occurrence map based on the limiting threshold value of nitrate n spatial distribution map of nitrate n shows that nearly 10 of the study area lies within high hazard class which exceeds limiting value of 10 mg l nitrate n value and nearly 50 of the shallow aquifer fall within medium hazard class which has impacted level of nitrate n i e between 2 mg l and 10 mg l these results also indicate that the northern part of the kathmandu basin and highly permeable alluvial deposits are dominated by very high vulnerability level and are also under a threat of high nitrate n risk groundwater aquifer vulnerability and nitrate risk maps are expected to facilitate design and development strategies towards protecting environment and preventing further deterioration of the affected aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater vulnerability nitrate risk multilayer fis model drastic nepal 1 introduction removal of nitrate from groundwater aquifers is often technically problematic and costly and finding alternative sources for water supply is not always possible strategies for protecting groundwater aquifer from contaminations like nitrate n rather than developing new water resources and water supply projects may in many cases prove to be the optimal policy therefore groundwater aquifer vulnerability to nitrate has become a major concern to all stakeholders involved in managing water quality in relation to human health in recognition of the need for effective and efficient methods for protecting groundwater resources from future contamination scientists and water resource managers have sought to develop techniques of predicting which areas are more likely than others to get contaminated as a result of human activities on or near the ground surface national research council 1993 this concept has been widely termed as groundwater vulnerability to contamination many overlay index methods are used to evaluate groundwater vulnerability to contamination but the most widely used techniques include drastic aller et al 1987 god foster 1987 avi stempvoort et al 1993 sintacs verba and zaporozec 1994 and epik technique doerfliger et al 1999 drastic is a method that considers the main hydrological and geological factors which affect the downward migration of pollutants in aquifers its acronym stands for the seven hydrogeological parameters depth to water recharge aquifer media soil type topography slope impact on the vadose zone media and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer god is also an overlay and index method designed to map groundwater vulnerability over large regions based on three parameters groundwater confinement overlying strata and depth to groundwater ghazavi and ebrahimi 2015 according to stempvoort et al 1993 the aquifer vulnerability index avi method is developed in canada for mapping the vulnerability of groundwater is based on two key parameters 1 thickness of each sedimentary unit above the uppermost aquifer and 2 estimated hydraulic conductivity of each of these layers epik is a point count system method developed in switzerland doerfliger et al 1999 and was the first attempt of vulnerability mapping specifically for karstic environments it consists of four parameters epikarst e protective cover p infiltration conditions and i and the degree of karstic network development k the sintacs method was developed by civita 1994 for improving and adapting the drastic model to the particularities of italy and the letters in sintacs are the first letters of the italian words that define the models factors barbulescu 2020 they are the depth to the water table soggicenza effective infiltration infiltrazione attenuation capacity of the unsaturated zone nonsaturo type of the soil media tipologia della copertura characteristics of the saturated zone acquifero hydraulic conductivity conducibilità and topographic slope superficie topografica among these methods drastic has been frequently used by many researchers either in its original form or in modified form e g lynch et al 1997 fritch et al 2000 babiker et al 2005 rahman 2008 pathak et al 2009 yin et al 2013 malik and shukla 2019 noori et al 2019 jia et al 2019 liang et al 2019 etc several researchers have also evaluated the performance of different overlay index methods for example shrestha et al 2017 report that drastic and god methods are comparable as understood from the perspective of risk to pollution results out of shallow groundwater aquifer in the kathmandu valley in nepal similarly abdullah et al 2020 evaluated the performance of two different index models namely vlda lithology of vadose zone v pattern of land use l groundwater depth d and aquifer characteristics a and cop flow concentration c overly layers o and precipitation p and confirmed that the vlda vulnerability model reflects the real vulnerability situation in the halabja saidsadiq basin compared to the cop model although they are widely used in various parts of the world overlay index methods have several limitations generally speaking an overlay index method like drastic is unable to describe a continuous transition from the easiest to be polluted to the most difficult to be polluted which is fuzzy nature of the groundwater vulnerability to contamination in this method the nature of the vulnerability is taken into account by dividing the values of each affecting factor into ranges and then giving a rating value to each range however groundwater vulnerability function should be continuous if a factor value can be measured numerically moreover insufficient hydrogeologic database and inherent uncertainty of groundwater vulnerability also make the overlay index methods difficult to use for assessing groundwater aquifer vulnerability a fuzzy model can solve this problem and it has been used by incorporating non linear mapping of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability concept benefiting from fuzzy engine and expert knowledge based drastic parameters such as by dixon 2005 nobre et al 2007 afshar et al 2007 pathak and hiratsuka 2011 rezai et al 2013 dixon et al 2005 reported that the fuzzy rule based model generated with 40 less data than in the drastic method produced better coincidence results when compared with contaminated sources nevertheless conventional fuzzy inference systems are often problematic due to exponential increase in rules in a fuzzy model having n number of input parameters each input parameter is defined to have i membership functions mfs so for a full fuzzy inference system in number of fuzzy rules are required for a fuzzy inference system designed to have 7 input variables and 3 numbers of mfs for each variable the entire number of rules obligatory to completely implement the system will be 37 it is particularly difficult for an expert to incorporate those large numbers of rules with enough attention any abnormality in rule designing may lead to human casualties or wastage of money or both hence minimization of rules is always an important issue a solution is to divide the fuzzy inference system in sub modules in a hierarchical form to overcome the issue of rule explosion hierarchical fuzzy inference system hfis reduces the total number of rules required and these methods have been used by different authors in their work for various applications for instance yager et al 1998 constructed a hierarchical type fuzzy system model called hierarchical prioritized structure and studied its structure in detail likewise ikbal et al 2015 used this approach to evaluate groundwater vulnerability map and fayaz et al 2017 has developed a technique for underground risk assessment using hierarchical fuzzy logic hfl ikbal et al 2015 use interpolation techniques based on selected sample point values from the study area obtained from hfis model here in this work we present a hierarchical fuzzy inference system hfis for computing groundwater vulnerability index in a pixel size of 30 m by developing a matlab code and integrating it with geographic information system gis so as to generate fuzzy groundwater vulnerability map of the study area a multilayer fis model has been developed benefitting from expert knowledge based drastic system to produce groundwater vulnerability maps showing the likelihood of groundwater pollution caused by different hydrogeological factors as a result a case of groundwater vulnerability assessment study in relation to shallow aquifer of kathmandu basin in nepal has been created we also validate the multilayer fis model with drastic method and nitrate n data of the study area moreover nitrate n risk map was made by integrating the validated groundwater vulnerability map obtained from hfis model nitrate n hazard map and the probability of occurrence calculated by indicator kriging ik interpolation based on the specified tolerable nitrate n concentration we used ordinary kriging ok method a geostatistical interpolation technique for the interpolation of the nitrate concentration from 100 groundwater sources to develop nitrate n pollution map 2 material and methods 2 1 fuzzy logic approach first introduced by zadeh 1965 fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory have been extensively used in ambiguity and uncertainty modeling in decision making the basic concept in fuzzy logic is quite simple statements are not only true or false but also represent the degree of truth or degree of falseness for each input fuzzy sets are defined by their membership function which are therefore the core of the entire concept there are different types of membership functions such as continuous piecewise linear functions triangular and trapezoidal shape and continuous piecewise exponential membership functions such as gaussian functions fuzzy sets and fuzzy operators are the subjects and verbs of fuzzy logic the if then rule statements are used to formulate the conditional statements that comprise fuzzy logic the standard operations correspond to a logical if then base with and or and not operators for instance if x is a and y is b then z is c where a b and c are linguistic values defined by fuzzy sets on the ranges universes of discourse x y and z respectively the if part of the rule is called the antecedent or premise while the then part of the rule is called the consequent or conclusion fuzzy inference is the process of formulating the mapping from a given input to an output using fuzzy logic that employs the rules upon which decisions are made the process of fuzzy inference involves membership functions logical operations and if then rules generally a fuzzy rule based model is comprised of fuzzification of input variables application of fuzzy operator in the antecedent degree of fulfilment implication from antecedent to the consequent inference aggregation of the consequents across the rules and defuzzification a large number of input variables results in an exponential increase in rules which will be problematic in the use of single layer fuzzy inference system in order to overcome the problem of rule explosion a multilayer fuzzy inference system i e hierarchical rule technique in the fuzzy system design was selected in this study a methodological outline of hierarchical fuzzy inference system and drastic method for evaluating groundwater aquifer vulnerability maps and nitrate n risk map is shown in fig 1 the membership functions can be constructed from several basic functions such as piecewise linear functions the gaussian distribution function the sigmoid curve quadratic and cubic polynomial curves the triangular and trapezoidal membership functions are the simplest and have been used in this study due to their modelling flexibility each input domain was divided into three sub domains i e low medium and high and output domain divided into five sub domains i e very low low medium high and very high in general fuzzy rule based systems benefit from rule bases which are mainly organized using experts knowledge in this study we employ expert knowledge from the general knowledge of the experts who developed the drastic system but one may benefit from knowledge of local experts and knowledge obtained from computer simulation to improve the rules and system performances for example the rules are of the form if d depth to groundwater is l low and r recharge is h high then fis1 is vh very high 2 2 preparation of input parameters the study area covers nearly whole of the kathmandu valley approximate area 337 sq km the main urban centre of nepal and a part of upper bagmati river basin as shown in fig 2 because of inadequate and intermittent piped water supply people use a variety of groundwater sources from shallow aquifer of kathmandu basin including dug wells tube wells and stone spouts dhunge dhara the quality of shallow groundwater sources is severely degraded due to nitrate n coliform bacteria and iron contamination led by anthropogenic activities so groundwater aquifer vulnerability map will be a useful tool to protect shallow aquifers from further contamination all seven input data layers used in creating vulnerability maps in this work were generated and or obtained from their original source as a point line or polygon layer of the study area these seven parameters contributing to the groundwater vulnerability were then converted into raster datasets of 30 m 30 m grid resolution using gis platform as shown in fig 3 the input matrix in any fuzzy subsystem is an 859 744 matrix covering the whole study area the details of acquisition the individual data layers and method of generating input parameters are reported in pathak and hiratsuka 2011 2 3 groundwater vulnerability nitrate n hazard and risk maps the drastic vulnerability index is a weighted sum of the seven previously mentioned hydrogeological parameters after multiplying each parameter with rates and weights respectively details on groundwater vulnerability mapping using drastic method are given elsewhere in pathak et al 2009 drastic indices were normalized to compare them with fuzzy indexes the multi layer fuzzy inference system based vulnerability map was developed by using the same drastic input parameters in this process at first all the input raster map layers were converted into ascii format to feed as input parameter to fis model for the design of multilayer fuzzy model matlab r fuzzy toolbox was employed where a matlab code was developed for computing the fuzzy vulnerability value in each pixel the output of this fis model was then integrated with gis to develop the groundwater vulnerability map fig 1 above clearly shows multilayer fuzzy inference system works where the first two input parameters i e depth to water table and net recharge are aggregated in first model fis1 and next two input parameters i e aquifer media and soil type are aggregated in the second model fis2 then the outputs from first and second models are aggregated in the next stage model in the subsequent manner the groundwater vulnerability to pollution index is obtained from final model fis6 fuzzy inference used here in this study is a minimum mamdani inference and a central defuzzification method groundwater contamination risk can be defined as the probability that groundwater in the aquifer will become contaminated to an unacceptable level due to human activities on the immediately overlaying land surface vu et al 2019 morris and foster 2000 defined the risk of aquifer pollution as probability values of groundwater pollution exceeding the tolerable level caused by activities above the plain surface therefore the groundwater risk map depends on three factors groundwater vulnerability pollution and probability of pollution occurrence employing this concept the nitrate n risk was calculated as in eq 1 1 risk vulnerability ground water pollution probability of pollution occurrence where vulnerability and groundwater pollution represent the consequential damage of groundwater aquifer and probability of pollution occurrence is the likelihood of occurrence of a pollution that damages the aquifer in this study the criterion considered for the damage of the aquifer was the limiting value of nitrate n for drinking water quality i e 10 mg l the study employed the geostatistical interpolation methods like ordinary kriging ok method for the interpolation of the nitrate concentration from 100 groundwater sources to develop nitrate n pollution map for the calculation of the probability of exceeding the tolerable nitrate n concentration of 10 mg l for drinking water we conducted indicator kriging ik interpolation based on the specified threshold in the study the selection of the ok variogram model relied on the best fit of the experimental variograms obtained from the data both drastic and fuzzy groundwater vulnerability models were also validated using nitrate n data of shallow groundwater aquifer of kathmandu valley 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater aquifer vulnerability maps both drastic and fuzzy groundwater vulnerability maps were made for shallow aquifer of kathmandu basin as a case study as presented in fig 4 the range of the vulnerability indices was classified into five classes using jenk s natural break method very low low medium high and very high the result shows that 36 of study area lies under high class while 22 and 21 area fall under very high and medium class in drastic vulnerability map in case of fuzzy vulnerability map it predicted 29 22 23 and 21 of study area as very high high medium and low class respectively in the study area high to very high vulnerability class is dominant which is probably due to high recharge rate resulting in shallow water table 10m with almost flat area 2 slope fig 4 a and b show relative degree of groundwater vulnerability to contamination a high index indicates the capacity of the hydrogeologic environment and the landscape factors to readily move waterborne contaminants into the groundwater and consequently need to be managed more closely low index represents groundwater that is better protected from contaminant leaching by natural environment 3 2 validation of multilayer fis model as the proposed fuzzy models area decision making tool benefitted from experts knowledge the model validation is very important however validation of any general hydrogeological knowledge based groundwater vulnerability models with field measured contaminants information in any aquifer systems is quite difficult due to the qualitative nature of vulnerability and inherent uncertainty the modelled results should validate from field observations in this study we validate the model performance by comparing the results with those of drastic index to compare the fuzzy vulnerability index with the drastic index the correlation coefficient was calculated which depicts the relationship between two datasets the purpose of the correlation analysis here is to see whether the multilayer fis model follows the same trend as that of drastic output or not in this case the correlation coefficient determines the cell values from one map i e output of fuzzy model as they relate to the cell values of another map layer i e output of drastic method the correlation between two vulnerability maps is a measure of dependency between the map layers the output of multilayer fuzzy rule based vulnerability model is well correlated with drastic output r 0 82 as shown in fig 5 since the proposed fuzzy rule based model employs expert knowledge from the general knowledge of the experts who developed the drastic system its output should follow the same trend as that of drastic output since nitrate n is commonly used as an environmental indicator to trace the impact of anthropogenic activities on groundwater the output of vulnerability models were tested using measured nitrate data from the shallow aquifer of kathmandu the sampled groundwater wells were overlaid on the groundwater vulnerability maps in order to see how many wells with high concentration of nitrate are found in different vulnerable zones a groundwater vulnerability map based on aquifer characteristics does not consider contaminants sources loading and transport mechanism into groundwater systems but it is encouraging to find that majority of sampled sources which exceeded the permissible limit value of nitrate n are located in the high to very high vulnerable zones moreover the correlations between vulnerability indices produced by both models and nitrate n concentration values were carried out fig 6 a clearly shows a significant positive correlation between nitrate concentration and the fuzzy groundwater vulnerability indices with a coefficient value of 0 52 it seems fuzzy vulnerability indices have better correlation with nitrate n value rather than drastic index 0 38 as shown in fig 6 b these results suggest that the groundwater vulnerability map of shallow groundwater aquifer in the kathmandu basin is generally consistent with observed nitrate contamination near the water table this result also confirms the validation and reliability of multilayer fis model which reflects an aquifer s inherent capacity to become contaminated 3 3 nitrate n risk map of the study area a total of 100 nitrate n values from the groundwater wells of shallow aquifer in the kathmandu basin were interpolated using ordinary kriging ok method a geostatistical interpolation method to develop nitrate n pollution map as shown in fig 7 a the nitrate n distribution map of study area was divided into three classes low 0 2 mg l medium 2 10 mg l and high 10 mg l the nitrate n distribution map shows that nearly 10 of the study area lies within the high hazard area which exceeds the limiting value of 10 mg l nitrate n value and nearly 50 of shallow aquifer falls within the medium hazard level which has impacted level of nitrate n i e between 2 and 10 mg l based on the indicator kriging ik algorithm applied to the observations the probability map of nitrate occurrence in the shallow groundwater aquifer of the kathmandu valley were obtained and the probability mapis shown in fig 7 b in the study the calculations of probability relied on the nitrate n concentration threshold i e 10 mg l defined the groundwater contamination risk is a probability that the groundwater in an aquifer will get contaminated up to an unacceptable level the risk represents the combination of the aquifer vulnerability nitrate n pollution and probability of occurrence of nitrate n pollution therefore using eq 1 above we integrated groundwater vulnerability map nitrate n pollution map and probability map to obtain the risk map as shown in fig 7 c the nitrate n risk map was classified into three classes using jenk s natural break method the results also clearly show that the northern part of the kathmandu basin and highly permeable alluvial deposits are dominated by very high vulnerability level with high risk of nitrate pollution and the water quality in these areas could affect the health of the inhabitants the nitrate n risk maps can also be used to identify areas that currently are at risk and they help identify areas where groundwater has been affected by human activities 4 conclusions the drastic parameters were introduced to a multilayer fuzzy inference system in order to develop groundwater vulnerability map which helps to rank the highly vulnerable area or low vulnerable area in shallow groundwater aquifer of kathmandu basin in nepal the model proposed in this study is very useful in overcoming the problem of exponential increase in rules due to a large number of input variables it significantly improved the results over traditional overlay index method like drastic the drastic vulnerability map shows that 36 of study area lies under high vulnerable class while 22 and 21 area fall under very high and medium vulnerable class in case of fuzzy vulnerability model it has predicted 29 22 23 and 21 of study area as very high high medium and low vulnerable class respectively the correlations between vulnerability indices produced by both the models and nitrate n concentration values measured from shallow aquifer show that the best combination is obtained from fuzzy vulnerability model r 0 52 followed by drastic method r 0 38 it suggests that the groundwater vulnerability map of shallow groundwater aquifer in the kathmandu basin is generally consistent with observed nitrate contamination near the water table in addition to the development of groundwater vulnerability map the groundwater risk map due to nitrate n has been generated by integrating groundwater aquifer vulnerability the nitrate n distribution map pollution severity and the probability of occurrence map based on the limiting threshold value of nitrate n the nitrate n risk map shows the areas that currently are at risk and help identify areas where groundwater has been affected by human activities groundwater vulnerability and nitrate n risk maps can be used by policy makers and water managers to protect groundwater sources and to implement best management practices bmps in the vulnerable areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

12106,the study encompasses the application of fuzzy based multi criteria decision making mcdm geospatial framework gis fuzzy ahp for evaluating index based groundwater potential assessment in two differently urbanized clusters of northern kerala southern india the framework presents a very powerful way of managing groundwater at a regional and global level due to its succinct performance the study area is characterized by a coastal zone with a high rate of urban development and relying on groundwater supply to meet their basic needs in the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fuzzy ahp a three level hierarchical model is built using 8 criteria and 34 subcriteria of groundwater controlling factors weights and ratios of these factors have been generated by pairwise comparisons of fuzzified values in saaty s 9 point fundamental scale taking relative importance into account finally the integration of spatial and non spatial data into the gis platform created a groundwater potential zone map with a unique integer value known as the groundwater potential index gwpi the resulting groundwater potential map classified the study area into four zones using quantile method and has shown that the very good potential zone occupies 34 and 10 of the urban and peri urban zones of the study area respectively gentle slope gradient with coastal alluvium formation sandy loam to sandy clay textured soil type with moderate to rapid permeability favours aquifer recharge in these zones resulting in a very high potential zone the consistency analysis using the eigenvector method showed that the consistency was well within the tolerance limit and validation analysis using the average depth of water level data checked the statistical efficiency and reliability of results in the overall decision making phase a well balanced fuzzy framework has allowed the rapid and reliable assessment of hydrological behaviour of two differently urbanized environments graphical abstract image

with the ambient environment relative stability and well organized spatial flow distribution toth 1979 it is a critical but often underestimated resource for urban water supply a serious and expensive hazard to urban infrastructure and the invisible link between different facets of the urbanization process foster 2016 the united nations has estimated that over 2 billion people worldwide depend on gw for their diverse needs such as agriculture irrigation manufacturing domestic etc united nations 2015 since groundwater is an essential component of total water supply the situation was likely to worsen by drivers of change such as global population urbanization agricultural intensification or climate change which can be attributed directly or indirectly to human activity hutchins et al 2018 proskuryakova et al 2018 wen et al 2019 the impacts of these change drivers were more pronounced in an urban environment resulting in water table lowering drying up of springs and wells in several areas detrimental changes in water chemistry etc foster et al 1999 howard and gelo 2002 kløve et al 2014 boughariou et al 2018 le brocque et al 2018 howard and gerber 2018 reduced groundwater head can also contribute to poor water quality entering deeper parts of the aquifer from rivers and polluted shallow aquifer systems leading more seriously to land subsidence saline water flow from deeper geological formations or the sea buapeng 2006 ebrahimi et al 2016 katsanou and karapanagioti 2017 kakar et al 2019 therefore these scenarios substantially necessitating to carry out the groundwater

groundwater functional zoning gwfz including groundwater potential and vulnerability presents a very positive effect on groundwater management at a regional scale due to its concise results guo et al 2019 furthermore the combination of hydrogeological characteristics along with urban impressions such as landuse landcover changes groundwater developments have been able to assess the difference in groundwater occurrence along with the geo environment effect during groundwater extraction jesiya and gopinath 2015 jesiya and gopinath 2019a 2019b indiscriminate anthropogenic activities adversely interfered with the hydrogeology of coastal aquifers chachadi 2005 mcdm methods such as ann is more effective in delineating the groundwater protection area from the intrusion of saline water in coastal aquifers as the framework is flexible in reconstruction with changes in criteria such as well depth pumping conditions and groundwater levels etc kim 2020 many studies have been proved the power of ahp originally developed by saaty 1980 and gis as a tool mix to evaluate multiple criteria together saaty 2005 mandal et al 2016 girish et al 2016 swetha et al 2017 jesiya and gopinath 2019a at the same time a certain level of inconsistencies may occur while making pairwise comparisons of the criteria in the ahp the fuzzy ahp method firstly proposed by van laarhoven and pedrycz 1983 can be considered as best to fit alternative to overcoming these problems the fuzzy ahp is a fuzzy extension of ahp and is applied to solve the hierarchical fuzzy multicriteria decision making problems cho and lee et al 2013 calabrese et al 2019 ren et al 2019 this method uses the concept of fuzzy set theory and hierarchical structure analysis and it includes selection of an alternative and

ratios tan et al 2014 in the fuzzy ahp method fuzzy numbers are used instead of the weight values to achieve the most realistic and accurate results kahraman et al 2003 together the fuzzy ahp hybrid

patterns and agricultural practices in the state were brings out conversion of a considerable area of paddy cultivation mixed crops scrubland and evergreen forest into built up areas highly water intensive commercial crops rubber plantations etc chattopadhyay 2005 sheeja et al 2011 the high density of population and urban settlements in coastal areas of the region has reached such an unprecedented level and has intensified the demand for freshwater services in both urbanized and outer areas of the urban spectrum jesiya and gopinath 2015 presently along with this drastic change in landuse pattern the state practising exploitation of groundwater from unconfined aquifers through dug wells to uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater resources with the advent of technology high speed rigs and quality deterioration of surface water shaji 2011 central ground water board 2012 shaji et al 2018 the aforementioned these scenarios necessitate the implementation of an integrated framework for the assessment of the groundwater potential zone by combining all relevant parameters including land use land cover classes however the integration of fahp and gis has not been applied once to the delineation of groundwater potential zonation mapping in the study region as well in a different urbanized context the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the spatial data of the groundwater potential zones of the two differentially urbanized ensembles kozhikode districts northern kerala southern india through a comprehensive groundwater potential index gwpi and gis and a fuzzy based ahp functionality the integrated fuzzy ahp gis method has made it possible to interpret the hydrological response of areas with different types of development by incorporating geological hydrological and anthropogenic indicators 2 environmental settings 2 1 location and hydrometeorology of the study area urban and selected peri urban clusters of the kozhikode district located in the southwest coast of india has been selected for the study and has an areal extent of 524 km2 with 36 km seashore and lies between north latitudes 11 7 23 11 and 11 28 35 67 and east longitudes 75 42 0 87 and 75 57 47 49 fig 1 according to the state urbanisation report kerala 2012 demographic study basic amenities built up nature and administrative set up revealed the degree of further densification of population density and physical growth in and around the urban cluster therefore areas with high density spatial growth and with more than two closely associated higher order up to 5th order urban centers are delineated into the urban cluster of the study area jesiya and gopinath 2019a the areal extent of the urban cluster having an areal extent of 212 km2 with a population density of 3746 person km2 census of india 2011 and it is greater than the state average the urban cluster of the study area shows high potential for development contributing to the economic development of the entire northern region of the state nearby urban cluster areas which indicate a propensity to integrate into urban areas in the near future are categorized as peri urban centers and it covers 312 km2 of the study area the region encompasses with heavy rainfall and abundant surface water resources the availability of water resources especially groundwater is not uniform throughout shaji 2011 the urban and peri urban clusters are in a humid tropical region with an average annual rainfall of about 3400 mm the climate of the area is divided into four seasons summer south west tropical monsoon period north east tropical monsoon period and winter two monsoon seasons experienced by the study area are south west and north east monsoons and the sw and ne monsoons mainly contribute with 82 77 of the rainfall in the area the minimum and maximum temperatures are around 23 5 c and 34 c the relative humidity ranges from 74 to 92 during morning hours and from 64 to 89 in evening hours the annual potential evapotranspiration pet is 1505 7 mm the monthly pet ranges from 92 9 to 170 2 mm the pet is less than the rainfall during may to november and hence the possibility of recharge to groundwater regime is more during these months cgwb 2013 2 2 groundwater scenario groundwater abstraction structures like wells have increased to five million in kerala following urban expansion and area for shallow water

moderately shallow 2 4 mbgl moderately deep 4 6 mbgl and deep 6 12 mbgl well types the majority of the sample area was occupied by moderately deep wells with well depths varying from 0 7 to 13 m across the entire area majority of the urban zone was covered with 4 6 mbgl followed by 2 4 mbgl ranges of dwl in the peri urban zone major dwl classes occurred in 4 6 mbgl followed by 6 8 mbgl and 2

methodology gwpz mapping was performed in the study using an integrated approach to remote sensing and gis based fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp the index based gwpz achieved through three successive phases such as the preparation of the geo database of factors influencing the groundwater potential of the region the relative ranking of such features through the numerical ranking method fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp and the spatial and non spatial integration through arcgis 10 5 1 3 1 preparation of geo database for groundwater potential assessment in the present analysis based on expert s opinions literature reviews and field observations we considered three indicating groups to assess groundwater potential of the region i e geological hydrological and anthropogenic factors geology geomorphology and slope characteristics are factors considered to be part of the geological properties of the area whereas drainage density linear density soil texture proximity to water bodies and aquifer characteristics were classified as hydrological properties and land use landcover classes as anthropogenic factors geology hydrogeology and soil texture thematic data were derived using a series of geoprocessing functions such as georeferencing digitization etc on the corresponding data sources table 2 landuse landcover classes of the study area were derived from irs liss iii data with a spatial resolution 23 5 m drainage pattern was extracted from the 1 50 000 scale survey of india topographical maps and lineaments were delineated from thematic services of bhuvan web portal further line density analysis was carried out to prepare the lineament and drainage density data in km2 slope in analysis was performed with srtm dem 30 m data employing spatial analyst tool of arcgis 10 5 1 finally proximity to surface water bodies was generated through buffer analysis using proximity tool of analysis tools of arc gis 10 5 1 3 2 groundwater potential index gwpi the groundwater potential index is a dimensionless quantity that has been determined using the ratings and weight values obtained using the ratings and weights of each of the control parameters obtained by the fuzzy ahp structure as an initial stage each parameter assigned a subjective rating of 1 9 based on the expert opinion and the related scientific findings ranking 1 assigned to components with the least and 9 assigned to the maximum potential after the introduction of saaty s analytic hierarchy system ahp the dutch scholars van laarhoven and pedrycg have proposed a structure in which a fuzzy comparison is represented by a triangular judgment they used a fuzzy number with a triangular membership structure and basic operating rules chang 1996 proposed a new model for handling fuzzy ahp was used in the current study first of all triangular fuzzy numbers are used for a pairwise comparison scale of fuzzy ahp then by using the extent analysis method chang 1992 the synthetic extent value si of the pairwise comparison is introduced and by applying the principle of the comparison of fuzzy numbers chang 1992 i e v mi m2 i iff m1 m2 and v m 2 m hgt m i m 2 μ m1 d the weight vectors with respect to each element under a certain criterion can be represented by d ai minv si sk k l n k i the first task of the fuzzy ahp method is to determine the relative importance of each pair of factors in the same hierarchy the element i with the highest priority over element j under a certain criterion then aij l 9 u where l and u represent a fuzzy degree of judgment the greater u l the fuzzier the degree when u l 0 the judgment is a nonfuzzy number it remains the same for scale 9 in the general sense if strong importance of element j over element i retained then the pairwise comparison scale can be expressed by the fuzzy number aij l u l m l i using triangular fuzzy numbers a fuzzy evaluation matrix a aij n m is constructed by pairwise comparison principle of comparison for fuzzy numbers the theory of comparison for fuzzy numbers was used to estimate the vectors of weights according to each criterion the matrix for eight factors and its subcriteria are constructed

potential of the area 4 1 description of factors influencing groundwater occurrence 4 1 1 geological indicators the study area is divided into two physiographic regions viz coastal low land and midland terrain the predominant geological formations in the area are recent coastal alluvium sub recent laterite and archaean crystalline formations such as charnockite and hornblende biotite gneiss the narrow strip of low land coastal plain is situated in north south direction along the coast which consists of alluvium formation coastal alluvium has located in the western part of the study area and the riverine alluvium occurs along with river courses the riverine and coastal alluvium consists of sand silt and clay were covered an extent of 95 2 km2 18 1 alluvium formation has attributed to a very good potential groundwater region under phreatic conditions and major water abstraction structures are dug wells in these formations charnockite is the dominant geological formation in the region covering 305 2 km2 58 2 per cent of the total area laterite formations form moderate to good potential phreatic aquifers along with topographic lows and valleys cgwb 2013 swetha et al 2017 the coastal plain covering an area of 77 6 km2 i e 14 78 of the total area and low rolling terrain in the midland area consists of rolling laterite hills surrounded by valleys the lateritic forms and valley fills were covered 304 09 km2 58 and 79 85 km2 15 2 study area respectively the midland terrain consists of low rolling terrain and moderately undulating terrain valley fills have contributed good groundwater potential zones whereas lateritic terrain has been assigned with moderate potential to groundwater dinesh kumar et al 2007 good to very good potential of the valley fills are due to its topographical settings at the bottom of the hill and geological composition consisting of highly porous materials the other landforms such as water bodies and residual hills covers an area of 22 41 km2 4 27 and 10 33 km2 1 97 respectively the residual hills are poor in groundwater occurrence therefore least rating is allocated fig 3 another important parameter which is directly influencing groundwater occurrence is slope gradient the surface water runoff through the nearly flat to gentle slope terrain 0 5 is very slow allowing more residents time for rainwater to percolate and enhances the rate of infiltration therefore urban and peri urban zones of the study area fall in very good category for groundwater storage the areas with 5 25 slope terrain were consist of rolling lateritic hills and valley fills covered an area of 39 of the total area this slightly undulating topography allows some run off and consequently moderate infiltration rate in the terrain hence moderate ratings for groundwater storage the slope region of 25 of the category consists of steep slope terrain with less infiltration and enhanced high surface runoff thus with a low potential for groundwater occurrence arulbalaji et al 2019 fig 4 4 1 2 hydrologic indicators drainage density is an expression of the closeness of spacing of channels and it is expressed as length of stream within a square grid of the area in km km2 strahler 1957 as groundwater recharge is directly related to the drainage density the study region with higher drainage density 5 km km2 was given the lowest possible groundwater assessment ranking and vice versa high density areas are not suitable for groundwater potential due to increased surface runoff the area with a low level of drainage density i e 0 06 2 km km2 reduces surface runoff while increasing infiltration and thus recharge of groundwater fig 5 the prominent directions of the lineaments are nw and ne and it ranges from 0 to 4 6 km km2 since the intersection of lineaments and lineaments parallel to the drainage network areas is proof of the movement and storage of groundwater the lineament density pattern of the region may indirectly reveal

area with a lineament density range of 0 0 5 km km2 and it was assigned least ratings in groundwater potential assessment scores isolated patches in both urban and peri urban areas of the study region have a linear density level 2 km km2 hence the highest ranking fig 6 urban and peri urban aquifers of the study area consist of four major soil types viz sandy clay loam loam to clay sandy loam to clay loam and gravelly clay loam to gravelly clay the coastal plain covered with alluvial soil characterized by sandy loam and sandy loam texture low water holding capacity sand content 80 per cent of this soil and excessive draining with moderately rapid to rapid permeability generate a significant infiltration rate and are therefore very good for water potential lateritic soil with gravelly clay loam to gravelly clay textured soil occupied in the majority of areas marked by well drained relatively slow permeability the groundwater potential of this soil group is therefore moderate to poor groundwater potential of the area increases with increase in proximity to surface water bodies based on the proximity to surface water bodies study area can be categorized into three classes such as a 50 m b 50 100 m and c 100 m and which are covers 10 7 2 1 and 87 2 the area respectively areas within 50 m class assigned high ratings and with the decrease in proximity to surface water bodies such as 50 100 m and 100 m were assigned with moderate and east ratings in groundwater potential assessments fig 7 4 1 3 anthropogenic factors anthropogenic activities have a significant impact on the hydrological properties of the geographical landscape and changes in land use can be interpreted as indicators for anthropogenic activities land use classes have a direct influence on changes on soil properties including infiltration capability surface runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge dinesh kumar et al 2007 since the spatial change in urban extent and imperviousness in

rubber and other crops mixed trees and forest area which together covered an area of 330 9 km2 vegetation land has been assigned a moderate rating in the study because the rate of infiltration is directly proportional to the vegetation cover i e the increase in the vegetation cover will result in more infiltration and less runoff jesiya and gopinath 2019b fallow land mining industrial wasteland and barren rocky area came under others landuse landcover class and covered an area of 34 5 km2 water bodies and river channel were assigned with the highest rating whereas built up land

peri urban zones of the study area respectively gentle slope gradient with coastal alluvium formation sandy loam to sandy clay texture soil type with moderate to rapid permeability favours aquifer recharge in these zones thereby very high potential zone since rainfall is the main source of groundwater recharge in both the urban and peri urban ensemble high recharge index in this very high potential zone confirms the occurrence of groundwater open dug wells are suitable for water collecting structures for the shallow very good potential zones while the urban region is treated separately factors such as geology geomorphology slope soil composition and drainage and lineament patterns differentiate the region by moderate to very strong groundwater capacity table 2 moderate to steep sloping terrain along with lateritic plateau patches of residual hills together contribute moderate groundwater potential in peri urban zone 50 6 of the peri urban area steep slope gradients low linear density and weathered rocks and poor permeable soil conditions together will diminish the active function of high rainfall in potential groundwater recharge zones the undulating midland terrain leads variation in aquifer recharge hence affect groundwater flow direction evapotranspiration etc consequently 3 of urban and 19 8 of peri urban areas of the study region have a low groundwater potential level the spatial data of the aquifer vulnerability analysis using modified drastic l method which is discussed in a previous study jesiya and gopinath 2019b correlated with groundwater potential analysis was depicted that very good groundwater potential zones of the urban and peri urban areas were vulnerable to contamination from water pollutants the gwpz was validated using average depth to water level in mbgl collected from the field investigation by taking advantage of its spatial relationships the validation study showed that the very good groundwater potential region dominated by wells with an average depth of 3 9 mbgl and a shallow water level in the region indicated a high water yield the corresponding average water level of poor moderate and good potential zones is 7 4 5 6 and 5 mbgl respectively fig 9 5 conclusion the paper presents an index based framework through a fuzzy ahp gis technique to tackle fully organized decision making problems i e the groundwater potential assessment of two distinct urbanized areas the fuzzy ahp approach used in the study effectively integrated groundwater controlling criteria and sub criteria to a unique hierarchical level and applied a complete integral method for comparing geo environmental features the concise findings have shown that the fuzzy ahp paradigm significantly helps to emphasize not only hydrodynamics but also the incorporation of human interventions in urban and peri urban zones of districts of kozhikode to demonstrate the functioning of the aquifer system a judgment is drawn from the fuzzy ahp of linguistically articulated preferences between parameters shown that the geomorphology followed by slope was of the highest importance in gwpz decision making as a result of the difference in gw potential the study area was divided into four areas such as very good good moderate and poor majority of peri urban zone was characterized by poor to moderate gwpz owing to its hydrogeological and topographical characteristics despite that 65 of the urban area was characterized by good to very good gwpz the intense urban activities along with the hydrogeological settings in the area trigger the contaminant attenuation of the gw system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

12106,the study encompasses the application of fuzzy based multi criteria decision making mcdm geospatial framework gis fuzzy ahp for evaluating index based groundwater potential assessment in two differently urbanized clusters of northern kerala southern india the framework presents a very powerful way of managing groundwater at a regional and global level due to its succinct performance the study area is characterized by a coastal zone with a high rate of urban development and relying on groundwater supply to meet their basic needs in the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fuzzy ahp a three level hierarchical model is built using 8 criteria and 34 subcriteria of groundwater controlling factors weights and ratios of these factors have been generated by pairwise comparisons of fuzzified values in saaty s 9 point fundamental scale taking relative importance into account finally the integration of spatial and non spatial data into the gis platform created a groundwater potential zone map with a unique integer value known as the groundwater potential index gwpi the resulting groundwater potential map classified the study area into four zones using quantile method and has shown that the very good potential zone occupies 34 and 10 of the urban and peri urban zones of the study area respectively gentle slope gradient with coastal alluvium formation sandy loam to sandy clay textured soil type with moderate to rapid permeability favours aquifer recharge in these zones resulting in a very high potential zone the consistency analysis using the eigenvector method showed that the consistency was well within the tolerance limit and validation analysis using the average depth of water level data checked the statistical efficiency and reliability of results in the overall decision making phase a well balanced fuzzy framework has allowed the rapid and reliable assessment of hydrological behaviour of two differently urbanized environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater potential index fuzzy analytic hierarchy process geospatial technology 1 introduction the groundwater system plays a dynamic role in nature because of its ability to interact with the ambient environment relative stability and well organized spatial flow distribution toth 1979 it is a critical but often underestimated resource for urban water supply a serious and expensive hazard to urban infrastructure and the invisible link between different facets of the urbanization process foster 2016 the united nations has estimated that over 2 billion people worldwide depend on gw for their diverse needs such as agriculture irrigation manufacturing domestic etc united nations 2015 since groundwater is an essential component of total water supply the situation was likely to worsen by drivers of change such as global population urbanization agricultural intensification or climate change which can be attributed directly or indirectly to human activity hutchins et al 2018 proskuryakova et al 2018 wen et al 2019 the impacts of these change drivers were more pronounced in an urban environment resulting in water table lowering drying up of springs and wells in several areas detrimental changes in water chemistry etc foster et al 1999 howard and gelo 2002 kløve et al 2014 boughariou et al 2018 le brocque et al 2018 howard and gerber 2018 reduced groundwater head can also contribute to poor water quality entering deeper parts of the aquifer from rivers and polluted shallow aquifer systems leading more seriously to land subsidence saline water flow from deeper geological formations or the sea buapeng 2006 ebrahimi et al 2016 katsanou and karapanagioti 2017 kakar et al 2019 therefore these scenarios substantially necessitating to carry out the groundwater management with support of emerging techniques among these techniques spatial predictions using various groundwater influencing parameters viz geology geomorphology slope soil characteristics drainage parameters landuse landcover etc with the advent of geospatial and modified multi criteria decision making mcdm processes various combinations on mcdm process such as ahp ahp anp fuzzy based ahp etc were confirmed its accuracy in preparing index based frameworks for sustainable groundwater development swetha et al 2017 kaur et al 2020 arabameri et al 2020 as an index based evaluation methodology groundwater functional zoning gwfz including groundwater potential and vulnerability presents a very positive effect on groundwater management at a regional scale due to its concise results guo et al 2019 furthermore the combination of hydrogeological characteristics along with urban impressions such as landuse landcover changes groundwater developments have been able to assess the difference in groundwater occurrence along with the geo environment effect during groundwater extraction jesiya and gopinath 2015 jesiya and gopinath 2019a 2019b indiscriminate anthropogenic activities adversely interfered with the hydrogeology of coastal aquifers chachadi 2005 mcdm methods such as ann is more effective in delineating the groundwater protection area from the intrusion of saline water in coastal aquifers as the framework is flexible in reconstruction with changes in criteria such as well depth pumping conditions and groundwater levels etc kim 2020 many studies have been proved the power of ahp originally developed by saaty 1980 and gis as a tool mix to evaluate multiple criteria together saaty 2005 mandal et al 2016 girish et al 2016 swetha et al 2017 jesiya and gopinath 2019a at the same time a certain level of inconsistencies may occur while making pairwise comparisons of the criteria in the ahp the fuzzy ahp method firstly proposed by van laarhoven and pedrycz 1983 can be considered as best to fit alternative to overcoming these problems the fuzzy ahp is a fuzzy extension of ahp and is applied to solve the hierarchical fuzzy multicriteria decision making problems cho and lee et al 2013 calabrese et al 2019 ren et al 2019 this method uses the concept of fuzzy set theory and hierarchical structure analysis and it includes selection of an alternative and systematic approaches weighting şener and şener 2015 şener et al 2018 das and pal 2019 khashei siuki and sharifan 2020 the subjective judgments that belong to experts are used to determine weight ratios tan et al 2014 in the fuzzy ahp method fuzzy numbers are used instead of the weight values to achieve the most realistic and accurate results kahraman et al 2003 together the fuzzy ahp hybrid method has the capacity to overcome the irregularities associated with the decision maker s decisions kumar and krishna 2018 an integrated ahp fuzzy model is more reliable for estimating the groundwater potential and vulnerability analyses kumar and krishna 2018 şener at al 2018 chaudhry et al 2019 rajasekhar et al 2019 study on groundwater vulnerability in shallow aquifers of urbanized environment proved the reliability and accuracy of applying fuzzy ahp approach in groundwater studies jesiya and gopinath 2019b the study area has been experiencing drastic changes in land use patterns and agricultural practices in the state were brings out conversion of a considerable area of paddy cultivation mixed crops scrubland and evergreen forest into built up areas highly water intensive commercial crops rubber plantations etc chattopadhyay 2005 sheeja et al 2011 the high density of population and urban settlements in coastal areas of the region has reached such an unprecedented level and has intensified the demand for freshwater services in both urbanized and outer areas of the urban spectrum jesiya and gopinath 2015 presently along with this drastic change in landuse pattern the state practising exploitation of groundwater from unconfined aquifers through dug wells to uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater resources with the advent of technology high speed rigs and quality deterioration of surface water shaji 2011 central ground water board 2012 shaji et al 2018 the aforementioned these scenarios necessitate the implementation of an integrated framework for the assessment of the groundwater potential zone by combining all relevant parameters including land use land cover classes however the integration of fahp and gis has not been applied once to the delineation of groundwater potential zonation mapping in the study region as well in a different urbanized context the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the spatial data of the groundwater potential zones of the two differentially urbanized ensembles kozhikode districts northern kerala southern india through a comprehensive groundwater potential index gwpi and gis and a fuzzy based ahp functionality the integrated fuzzy ahp gis method has made it possible to interpret the hydrological response of areas with different types of development by incorporating geological hydrological and anthropogenic indicators 2 environmental settings 2 1 location and hydrometeorology of the study area urban and selected peri urban clusters of the kozhikode district located in the southwest coast of india has been selected for the study and has an areal extent of 524 km2 with 36 km seashore and lies between north latitudes 11 7 23 11 and 11 28 35 67 and east longitudes 75 42 0

of population density and physical growth in and around the urban cluster therefore areas with high density spatial growth and with more than two closely associated higher order up to 5th order urban centers are delineated into the urban cluster of the study area jesiya and gopinath 2019a the areal extent of the urban cluster having an areal extent of 212 km2 with a population density of 3746 person km2 census of india 2011 and it is greater than the state average the urban cluster of the study area shows high potential for development contributing to the economic development of the entire northern region of the state nearby urban cluster areas which indicate a propensity to integrate into urban areas in the near future are categorized as peri urban centers and it covers 312 km2 of the study area the region encompasses with heavy rainfall and abundant surface water resources the availability of water resources especially groundwater is not uniform throughout shaji 2011 the urban and peri urban clusters are in a humid tropical region with an average annual rainfall of about 3400 mm the climate of the area is divided into four seasons summer south west tropical monsoon period north east tropical monsoon period and winter two monsoon seasons experienced by the study area are south west and north east monsoons and the sw and ne monsoons mainly contribute with 82 77 of the rainfall in the area the minimum and maximum temperatures are around 23 5 c and 34 c the relative humidity ranges from 74 to 92 during morning hours and from 64 to 89 in evening hours the annual potential evapotranspiration pet is 1505 7 mm the monthly pet ranges from 92 9 to 170 2 mm the pet is less than the rainfall during may to november and hence the possibility of recharge to groundwater regime is more during these months cgwb 2013 2 2 groundwater scenario groundwater abstraction structures like wells have increased to five million in kerala following urban expansion and area for shallow water

moderately shallow 2 4 mbgl moderately deep 4 6 mbgl and deep 6 12 mbgl well types the majority of the sample area was occupied by moderately deep wells with well depths varying from 0 7 to 13 m across the entire area majority of the urban zone was covered with 4 6 mbgl followed by 2 4 mbgl ranges of dwl in the peri urban zone major dwl classes occurred in 4 6 mbgl followed by 6 8 mbgl and 2

methodology gwpz mapping was performed in the study using an integrated approach to remote sensing and gis based fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp the index based gwpz achieved through three successive phases such as the preparation of the geo database of factors influencing the groundwater potential of the region the relative ranking of such features through the numerical ranking method fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp and the spatial and non spatial integration through arcgis 10 5 1 3 1 preparation of geo database for groundwater potential assessment in the present analysis based on expert s opinions literature reviews and field observations we considered three indicating groups to assess groundwater potential of the region i e geological hydrological and anthropogenic factors geology geomorphology and slope characteristics are factors considered to be part of the geological properties of the area whereas drainage density linear density soil texture proximity to water bodies and aquifer characteristics were classified as hydrological properties and land use landcover classes as anthropogenic factors geology hydrogeology and soil texture thematic data were derived using a series of geoprocessing functions such as georeferencing digitization etc on the corresponding data sources table 2 landuse landcover classes of the study area were derived from irs liss iii data with a spatial resolution 23 5 m drainage pattern was extracted from the 1 50 000 scale survey of india topographical maps and lineaments were delineated from thematic services of bhuvan web portal further line density analysis was carried out to prepare the lineament and drainage density data in km2 slope in analysis was performed with srtm dem 30 m data employing spatial analyst tool of arcgis 10 5 1 finally proximity to surface water bodies was generated through buffer analysis using proximity tool of analysis tools of arc gis 10 5 1 3 2 groundwater potential index gwpi the groundwater potential index is a dimensionless quantity that has been determined using the ratings and weight values obtained using the ratings and weights of each of the control parameters obtained by the fuzzy ahp structure as an initial stage each parameter assigned a subjective rating of 1 9 based on the expert opinion and the related scientific findings ranking 1 assigned to components with the least and 9 assigned to the maximum potential after the introduction of saaty s analytic hierarchy system ahp the dutch scholars van laarhoven and pedrycg have proposed a structure in which a fuzzy comparison is represented by a triangular judgment they used a fuzzy number with a triangular membership structure and basic operating rules chang 1996 proposed a new model for handling fuzzy ahp was used in the current study first of all triangular fuzzy numbers are used for a pairwise comparison scale of fuzzy ahp then by using the extent analysis method chang 1992 the synthetic extent value si of the pairwise comparison is introduced and by applying the principle of the comparison of fuzzy numbers chang 1992 i e v mi m2 i iff m1 m2 and v m 2 m hgt m i m 2 μ m1 d the weight vectors with respect to each element under a certain criterion can be represented by d ai minv si sk k l n k i the first task of the fuzzy ahp method is to determine the relative importance of each pair of factors in the same hierarchy the element i with the highest priority over element j under a certain criterion then aij l 9 u where l and u represent a fuzzy degree of judgment the greater u l the fuzzier the degree when u l 0 the judgment is a nonfuzzy number it remains the same for scale 9 in the general sense if strong importance of element j over element i retained then the pairwise comparison scale can be expressed by the fuzzy number aij l u l m l i using triangular fuzzy numbers a fuzzy evaluation matrix a aij n m is constructed by pairwise comparison principle of comparison for fuzzy numbers the theory of comparison for fuzzy numbers was used to estimate the vectors of weights according to each criterion the matrix for eight factors and its subcriteria are constructed with triangular fuzzy elements and pairwise comparisons are made using extent analysis method the resultant weights and ratings without fuzziness for each factor were obtained by the eigenvector method for a pair wise comparison matrix fig 2 finally the non spatial data ratings weights are integrated with spatial data thematic layers through a series of spatial analyses such as reclassification and weighted overlay analysis within the gis platform arcgis 10 5 1 and generated spatial data of gwpi the study area was divided into four zones by categorization of gwpi using the

leads variation in aquifer recharge hence affect groundwater flow direction evapotranspiration etc consequently 3 of urban and 19 8 of peri urban areas of the study region have a low groundwater potential level the spatial data of the aquifer vulnerability analysis using modified drastic l method which is discussed in a previous study jesiya and gopinath 2019b correlated with groundwater potential analysis was depicted that very good groundwater potential zones of the urban and peri urban areas were vulnerable to contamination from water pollutants the gwpz was validated using average depth to water level in mbgl collected from the field investigation by taking advantage of its spatial relationships the validation study showed that the very good groundwater potential region dominated by wells with an average depth of 3 9 mbgl and a shallow water level in the region indicated a high water yield the corresponding average water level of poor moderate and good potential zones is 7 4 5 6 and 5 mbgl respectively fig 9 5 conclusion the paper presents an index based framework through a fuzzy ahp gis technique to tackle fully organized decision making problems i e the groundwater potential assessment of two distinct urbanized areas the fuzzy ahp approach used in the study effectively integrated groundwater controlling criteria and sub criteria to a unique hierarchical level and applied a complete integral method for comparing geo environmental features the concise findings have shown that the fuzzy ahp paradigm significantly helps to emphasize not only hydrodynamics but also the incorporation of human interventions in urban and peri urban zones of districts of kozhikode to demonstrate the functioning of the aquifer system a judgment is drawn from the fuzzy ahp of linguistically articulated preferences between parameters shown that the geomorphology followed by slope was of the highest importance in gwpz decision making as a result of the difference in gw potential the study area was divided into four areas such as very good good moderate and poor majority of peri urban zone was characterized by poor to moderate gwpz owing to its hydrogeological and topographical characteristics despite that 65 of the urban area was characterized by good to very good gwpz the intense urban activities along with the hydrogeological settings in the area trigger the contaminant attenuation of the gw system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

12107,the objectives of this work are to control the groundwater levels of the coastal aquifer of gareb bouareg from rif morocco using visual modflow techniques as part of the groundwater modeling system gms 7 0 to bring the water table back to safety limit and to prevent any further rise of this water table however the calibrated and validated model makes it possible to carry out several scenarios whose objective is to test the impact of various modes of exploitation on the water table in an area suffering from waterlogging problems such as the case of the gareb bouareg aquifer from morocco the results obtained according to the optimal and realistic scenario made it possible to lower the piezometric level of 5 42 m over an area of 14 km2 by applying a pumping of 300 l s on 10 wells with a flow rate of 30 l s well this technique could be improved by reducing inputs through water saving irrigation practices or by applying corrective measures to increase the outflows that will eventually be demineralized and exploited for drinking water consumption graphical abstract conceptual model of the studied aquifer image 1 keywords gareb bouareg aquifer modflow groundwater

drinking water supply and industrial bahir et al 2018 2019 baki et al 2017 carreira et al 2018 nouayti et al 2016 2020 a model is a simplified version of the real groundwater system that approximately simulates groundwater problems groundwater simulation models such as the well known modflow groundwater model mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 have been widely employed in general groundwater flow studies namely in applications of conjunctive water use which is often the cause for the named water logging problems in irrigation command areas bejranonda et al 2009 dafny et al 2010 xu et al 2011 koch et al 2012 these simulation models have been used by several authors and in different management water resource projects such as kim and sultan 2002 on the simulation impacts of an irrigation and drainage network on the nubian aquifer s egypt groundwater resources using modflow and kumar et al 2009 on the simulation of groundwater flow in a section of the western yamuna canal in haryana state india by visual modflow see fig 3 the gareb and bouareg plains which are a part of the northeastern region of morocco offers in 30 of its surface a potential of interesting agricultural land estimated at around 23 7 km2 nevertheless the existence of a phreatic brackish aquifer requires the irrigation of the plain from the surface water of moulouya wadi this aquifer has known in 2009 and 2010 a succession of rainy years exceeding the mean rainfall recorded in the past this situation associated with the development of irrigation systems of the plains resulted of increase in piezometric level of the coastal aquifer and the appearance of marshy areas these areas whose spatial and temporal extent are quite important cause significant damage to the crops in place and also required drainage to combat water logging and to prevent secondary salinization from shallow and saline coastal aquifer the gareb bouareg aquifer was selected as the study area for several reasons i a central valley having a large shallow groundwater basin with a potential of interesting agricultural land and an availability of surface water fed by rainfall of precipitation by runoff from the surrounding mountains by percolation from irrigated fields and by drainage from the overlying selouane wadi ii increased population growth and agriculture development are projected for this area in the future iii

understanding of the hydrodynamic functioning of the aquifer e water balance f model calibration for steady state and transient modes against measured observed data and model validation using other sets of data g sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of parameter uncertainty on model outputs h exploitation of the groundwater model by simulating future scenarios in order to predict the water table fluctuations under different stress periods the purposes of this study are to control the groundwater levels of the coastal aquifer of gareb bouareg using the visual modflow techniques in groundwater modeling system to bring the water table back to safety limit and to prevent any further rise of this water table 1 1 study area located in the moulouya basin the gareb bouareg aquifer is a shallow aquifer with an area of 522 km2 corresponding to the extension of the two gareb and bouareg plains this aquifer is limited to the north by the mediterranean sea and the bouareg sebkha to the southeastern by the kebdana anticline to the northwestern by the beni bouifrour and gourougou anticlines fig 1 see fig 2 the gareb and bouareg plains have been the subject of several studies aimed to characterize them on different levels especially the hydrological sedimentological hydrogeochemical el alami et al 1998 el yaouti et al 2008 and the biological plans lefebvre et al 1996 louzzi et al 2007 2 materials and methods 2 1 data acquisition for better management of groundwater resources it is necessary to have enough data about the physical and hydrogeological settings for the study area physical parameters include meteorological data aquifer thickness recharge and pumping rates hydraulic parameters and monitored groundwater levels hydrogeological properties includes the aquifer system geologic formations topographic map with locations of wells land use soil classification boundary conditions drainage as well as irrigation systems for the gareb bouareg coastal aquifer data from various sources were collected processed and organized in a spatial coordinate system allowing the development of a spatial and tabular database under the geographic information system arcgis version 10 3 lyazidi et al 2017 2019 2 2 hydro meteorological data the climate of the study area is mediterranean it is characterized by a low rainfall ranging from 116 to 430 mm year and average temperatures ranging from 11 c in january to 30 c in august el madani et al 2011 winds direction west and southwest in winter and north and northeast in summer influence the surface circulation of nador lagoon waters hilmi et al 2007 as for the direction of the littoral drift it shows a seasonal variability with a predominant direction se nw raji et al 2013 meteorological as well as hydrological data are required for the development and calibration of a groundwater model in the present study data recorded over a period of 50 years are employed the average annual values for the actual evapotranspiration can be estimated at 293 mm in table 1 the monthly and annual means values of precipitation and temperature are listed whereas table 2 shows the average monthly and annual outflow discharge values at the gauging station of selouane wadi used in the analysis hydrometer station discharge data is used to specify outflow boundary conditions in the groundwater model 2 3 irrigated agriculture data the gareb and bouareg plains offers in 30 of its surface a potential of interesting agricultural land estimated at around 23 7 km2 nevertheless the existence of a phreatic brackish aquifer requires the irrigation of the plain from the surface water of moulouya wadi that is why the irrigation systems networks of the gareb and bouareg plains has been installed a canal supplies from the surface waters of the moulouya wadi a yearly volume of 80 106 m3 to partially cover the agricultural needs of the region which are partly satisfied from the groundwater table 3 shows monthly and annual means values of the irrigation water supply and water recharge volumes in gareb and bouareg plains over a period of 50 years in 106 m3 2 4 hydrogeological data hydrologically the gareb bouareg aquifer unit corresponds to both interconnected aquifers with a potential of 50 106 m3 the gareb aquifer situated in the upstream part of the aquifer unit consists mainly of marly limestones of villafranchian at the south west of the aquifer a lenticular structure and impermeable layers may sometimes be located in the villafranchian lacustrine levels the impervious basement of the aquifer consists of yellow marl 25 carlier 1975 lacustrine limestones and silty consolidated land may be the site of karst circulation the thickness of the aquifer exceeds 80 m in the south but is reduced to less than 20 m between arrouit and selouane localities towards arrouit locality the thickness decreases again and hardly exceeds 5 m as for the bouareg aquifer it succeeds to the north towards gareb and has a thickness that varies from 5 to 60 m its impervious substratum is formed by the very thick continental quaternary the aquiferous formations are very heterogeneous quaternary silty soils with a permeability ranging from 7 2 10 3 to 1 9 10 7 m s carlier 1975 with regard to hydrogeological data there are 824 wells in the study area based on the water resources studies relating to gareb bouareg aquifer agriculture used yearly 15 3 106 m3 of groundwater reservoir to irrigate 19 50 km2 during 1967 which corresponds to an average pumping rate of 0 6 l s for each well due to the water salinity of the gareb bouareg aquifer unit there has been a gradual cessation of the agricultural water abstractions at this aquifer unit these abstractions estimated presently to be 4 106 m3 average yearly over the period 1967 2016 the value of 7 106 m3 during the month of january 2013 a complementary investigation campaign was conducted in the study area it consists of i establishing an updated state of piezometry by reading groundwater levels at the existing monitoring wells ii characterizing the groundwater abstraction and the productivities of different aquifer sectors iii carrying out a sampling campaign to update and supplement the available information on water quality 2 5 groundwater table and hydrodynamic parameters data as part of the dynamics monitoring of the gareb bouareg coastal aquifer a network of 45 monitoring wells selected to study the behavior of the aquifer has been set up table 4 shows the result of investigation campaign conducted in the study area during the month of january 2013 the groundwater level measurement campaign was carried out on all the monitoring wells by use of a graduated steel tape seba water level measurement system table 5 summarizes the characteristics deduced from the log data at these wells each hydraulic conductivity value associated with a well will be used and refined during the model calibration the jacob method is applied to obtain the values of transmissivity t and coefficient storage s 2 6 hydrogeochemistry data during the same investigation campaign in around 30 monitoring wells likely to be sampled for analysis were selected in the gareb bouareg aquifer table 6 the groundwater quality data will be analyzed and valued by the establishment of temporal and spatial evolution maps for each parameter analyzed these maps can tell us about the spatial extension of the quality problems encountered they then enable us to analyze for each parameter the causes of decreasing quality by comparing the state of quality with the sources of pollution and the hydrogeological functioning of the aquifer 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydro meteorological framework on the study area except for the gourougou reliefs kebdana and bni bouifrour mountains which benefit from rains exceeding 450 mm the average rainfall is fairly uniform and varies yearly around 325 mm the seasonal rainfall pattern is characterized by a maximum from november to january followed by a secondary maximum in april temperatures are regular from one year to another lastly the influence of the sea on the climate of the plain is emphasized the gareb plain is also fed by small wadis descending from the bni bouifrour and kerker ziata mountains these wadis converge to lagoon after a short travel in the mountains which does not allow them to branch out they take in the bouareg plain independent channels the selouane wadi the most important wadi of the plain has a base flow rate supported by the groundwater resources and the irrigation returns flow and flows toward the lagoon see fig 4 3 2 geological framework the geological description in the study area is summarized in various geological and hydrogeological reports carlier and zeryouhi 1964 the geological formations were recognized at the outcrop but also from the drilling log at 45 monitoring wells these formations are described from bottom to top as follows fig 5 i limestone formations of probable cretaceous highlighted by well 738 6 carried out in the south west sector of the gareb plain this well crosses 220 m of marl before intersecting the limestone formations with a thickness of 70 m ii miocene marl of the bedrock of the plain these gray blue marl formations are found in several places both in gareb and bouareg the marls have an average thickness of 100 m and exceed 150 m thick between selouane and jbel arroui they are covered by the quaternary clay loams at bouareg and the continental marls from pontico pliocene at gareb except of well 738 6 that crosses the miocene marl layer over its entire thickness and intersects the cretaceous formations the others wells in the study area remain in the miocene marl iii villafranchien deposits which contribute largely to filling the gareb depression they consist mainly of lacustrine formations and in the south west of the gareb plain of silts with pebble and gravel beds iv middle quaternary represented by intercalations of pebbles and gravel embedded in clay loams attributed to the amirian and ended with an encrustation white tuff attributed to the tensiftian 3 3 groundwater table depth fig 5 shows the groundwater table depth that has been established on the basis of 45 monitoring wells measurements the water table depth varies between 1 and 40 m it is shallow in the center of the study area 10 m and in the middle valley of the selouane wadi it becomes deeper by going towards the mountains which delimit it the average depth is of the order of 8 5 m over an area of almost 40 km2 around the arrouit tistoutine road and in the coastal fringe the water table surface is close to the land surface and is less than 2 m or even less than a meter in the vicinity of arrouit locality the water depth map of 2013 compared to that established in 1967 carlier 1975 shows a rise in groundwater table of about 4 10 m depending on the sector 3 4 piezometric head and structure of the flow the piezometric contours map of fig 6 obtained from the 45 points measurements made at january 2013 using kriging spatial interpolation showns a general groundwater flow from the southwest to the northeast the shape of the piezometric contours inflected upstream in the middle valley of the selouane wadi testifies the drainage of the aquifer by this wadi the fraction of the underground flows under the gareb plain non drained by the selouane wadi flows towards the bouareg plain through the passageway which separates the two plains the hydraulic gradient varies from 5 in the north east half of the gareb plain to 0 1 in the irrigated sector in the same plain it is around 1 2 in almost the entire bouareg plain the shape of the piezometric contours shows that the southern mountains surrounding the plain contribute to the aquifer supply the evolution of the piezometric contours in the study area varies from one sector to another the analysis of groundwater table fluctuation history measured at the monitoring well 517 6 located in the irrigated perimeter of the gareb plain shows an evolution of water level from 4 to 4 5 m this evolution is attached due to the total absence of abstractions to evolutions in rainfall and irrigation return flow fig 7 the variations are characterized by alternating cycles of decline and rise of the groundwater level the high levels of the water table are 2 3 m below the land surface representative of the irrigated area areas where the water table closes to the surface are subject to evaporation which may result in increasing salinization of the soil and groundwater see fig 8 3 5 hydrodynamic characteristics of the aquifer in gareb plain the measured transmissivity values seem to decrease from south to north they are higher in the south east of the road that connects arouit and tistoutine localities and range from 1 2 to 5 10 2 m2 s in the vicinity of selouane locality well 1036 6 gives a lower measured transmissivity value representative of low productivity in bouareg plain three sectors are individualized like the distribution of the dominant facies of the saturated zone the east sector has a measured transmissivity values range from 1 10 1 to 5 10 3 m2 s the west sector has values range from 5 to 10 2 m2 s while the central sector has the highest transmissivity values ranging from 1 to 1 2 10 1 m2 s mainly near the southern border of the aquifer the values of the storage coefficient are few eight pumping tests carried out with a follow up of the drawdown in nearby piezometers made it possible to calculate the storage coefficient the measured storage coefficient values vary slightly from upstream to downstream of the aquifer with an average value of about 2 table 5 the gareb bouareg aquifer has relatively good hydrodynamic characteristics which should give it a significant productivity 3 6 hydrogeochemistry of the aquifer during the investigation campaign of january 2013 in around twenty points likely to be sampled for analysis were selected in the study area table 6 groundwater quality data will be analyzed and valued by the establishment of temporal and spatial evolution maps for each parameter analyzed fig 9 the hydrogeochemical analysis results show that the groundwater quality problems of gareb bouareg aquifers are mainly related to the dissolved salts in particular calcium sulphates caso4 sodium chloride nacl and magnesium carbonate mgco3 in fact analyses carried out confirm the groundwater salinity problems already highlighted by the quality monitoring network and the studies carried out the conductivities vary for all sampling points between a minimum of 2710 μs cm and a maximum of 17 140 μs cm with an average of 7845 μs cm chloride contents range from 433 mg l to 6459 mg l with an average of 2342 mg l sodium contents range from 510 mg l to 3156 mg l with an average of 1447 mg l the sulphate contents are between 447 mg l and 1741 mg l with an average of 1447 mg l observation wells that record very poor quality in terms of salinity extend over most of the area they are found both in detritic and carbonate formations spatial distribution of electrical conductivity shows that the highest values are in the arouit area this zone is characterized by a remarkable rise in the piezometric level water depth 3 m due to the recharge by percolation from irrigated field which causes leaching of the already polluted subsoil 3 7 conceptual model in order to develop this conceptual model different reports related to hydrology hydrogeology of the gareb bouareg aquifer were used finally a schematic plan of the system was developed using data from observation wells hydrodynamic characteristics recharge resulting from precipitation recharge by percolation from irrigated fields recharge by runoff from the surrounding mountains recharge by selouane wadi drainage from the overlying selouane wadi drainage towards the lagoon discharge by evapotranspiration pump draining and as well as calculations of water balance 3 8 water balance relating to the gareb bouareg aquifer the calculation results of the average annual water balance components over the 50 years 1967 2016 are summarized as follows groundwater recharge components are i recharge by runoff of several streams draining the surrounding mountainous ii recharge resulting from precipitation iii recharge by percolation from irrigated fields this recharge represents the sum of irrigation volumes from surface and groundwater infiltrated the plain for surface water recharge volumes are calculated by adopting in gareb area an annual irrigation water supply volume of 36 106 m3 a re infiltration coefficient of 15 for spray irrigation a maximum for a much less intensive perimeter which leads to an average annual volume of around 5 106 m3 and by adopting in bouareg area an annual irrigation water supply volume of 42 106 m3 a re infiltration coefficient of 30 for gravity irrigation the relatively intensive perimeter which leads to an average annual volume of around 12 5 106 m3 for groundwater recharge volume is calculated by adopting re infiltration coefficients of 10 of the approximately groundwater abstractions of 7 106 m3 representing about 0 5 106 m3 in total the average annual volume of these re infiltrations is estimated to be 18 106 m3 iv recharge of the bouareg aquifer from the selouane wadi at its downstream section this wadi brought outside the flood period an average annual volume of about 3 106 m3 this volume can be considered as completely infiltrated even if part of it is taken downstream by evaporation groundwater discharge components are i pumping from wells in the gareb bouareg aquifer in the absence of precise information on the current abstractions from this aquifer we will consider that the irrigated perimeters of 8 km2 in 1967 had to extend but without exceeding today 20 of the total perimeter of the bouareg aquifer 100 km2 namely an area of 20 km2 recall that at present this abstraction is annually estimated to be 4 106 m3 ii underground outflow to the lagoon quantified by darcy s law using a hydraulic gradient a transmissivity and a width of the front flow on the basis of the available piezometric maps in particular that of the year 2013 the average gradient value measured between piezometric contours 0 and 10 m is 1 2 the average transmissivity in the downstream part of the aquifer is estimated to be 9 4 10 4 m2 s applied to the length of the water front 31 km these values provide for the gareb bouareg coastal aquifer an average annual underground outflow towards the lagoon in the order of 11 106 m3 iii discharge by evapotranspiration estimated on the basis of the water balance of the adjacent basins gauged in moulouya in the expression of the water balance in irrigated perimeters rainfall is replaced by the sum of rainfall and irrigation water supply volumes 36 106 m3 for gareb plain and 42 106 m3 for bouareg plain with an average rainfall of 325 mm on the gareb bouareg system the actual evapotranspiration is 300 mm the water table depth is less than 5 m on an average surface area of 73 km2 and the average depth is 3 m the evapotranspiration calculated at 3 m depth is about 150 mm year the average annual volume losses by evapotranspiration is about 0 15 m year x 73 106 m2 11 106 m3 iv drainage of the gareb aquifer by the selouane wadi this drainage has been evaluated by gauging the average annual volume drained by the upstream section of the selouane wadi at the gareb plain was estimated by gauging at 3 106 m3 with a minimum of 2 106 m3 gauged in 1985 and a maximum of 19 106 m3 gauged in 2010 table 7 summarizes the different components of the average annual water balance calculated over the period 1967 2016 3 9 model description the groundwater component of the flow model was represented using the transient 3 d groundwater flow equation eq 2 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 2 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z q s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are the values of hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinate axes lt 1 h is the piezometric head l q is the volumetric flux per unit volume and represents sources and or sinks of water t 1 ss is the specific storage of the porous medium l 1 and t is time t groundwater flow in gareb bouareg was simulated using the modular groundwater flow model modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 the gms 7 0 software is used as a graphical interface to build the hydrodynamic model then converted it into a digital mesh model for calculations the results obtained are exploited through the same graphic interface which permits on the one hand to facilitate calibration and on the other hand to maintain certain homogeneity of data and presentation the partial differential flow equation eq 2 can be approximated by replacing the derivatives with finite differences which are simultaneously solved to predict future water levels and fluxes loucks et al 1985 modflow 2000 solves the finite difference equations simultaneously using one of several numerical solver algorithms and by specifying boundary conditions soil properties aquifer hydraulic properties aquifer recharge groundwater withdrawal groundwater levels and other model input parameters 3 10 discretization of the model domain the gareb bouareg aquifer is represented by a monolayer reservoir in which lacustrine limestones gravel and conglomerates are included the impervious basement of fig 10 represents the isohypsum mapping substratum of this aquifer which consists of mio pliocene marls gareb and miocene bouareg and the top is similar to the topographic surface the piezometric surface evolves between these two limits the coastal aquifer is laterally limited by mountainous areas and to the north by the nador lagoon to simulate groundwater flow to gareb bouareg aquifer using a database developed in 2017 a regularly spaced finite difference model grid has been created in the gms environment each cell is 500 m 500 m size in the horizontal plane the final grid consists of 61 rows and 95 columns in the horizontal and one layer in the vertical direction the period from 1967 to 2016 was divided into 50 study periods one study period per year 3 11 boundary conditions the specification of the appropriate boundary conditions is another challenge in groundwater modeling studies boundary conditions are necessary to represent the groundwater system s interaction with the surrounding area boundary conditions considered in the implementation of the hydrodynamic model of gareb bouareg were determined using the geological and hydrogeological data fig 11 it can be summarized as follows i imposed inflow boundary at the limit of the supply zone of aquifer by runoff from the surrounding mountainous gourougou bni bouifrour kerker ziata and kebdana ii imposed outflow boundary to the upstream section of the selouane wadi which drains the gareb aquifer iii imposed inflow boundary to the downstream section of the selouane wadi that recharges the bouareg aquifer iv imposed potential draining boundary to the limit of the gareb bouareg aquifer with the lagoon and the mediterranean sea to explain the discharge of the aquifer v no flow boundary to the extension limit of the aquifer in contact with impervious layers without recharging the aquifer by runoff from the mountains 3 12 model calibration model calibration is the process where model parameter structure and parameter values are adjusted and refined to provide the best match between measured and simulated values of hydrodynamic heads and flows traditionally models are calibrated by trial and error processes in which model parameters are adjusted within reasonable limits from one simulation to the next to achieve the best model fit model fit is commonly evaluated by visual comparison of simulated and measured heads and flows or by comparing root mean square errors of heads and flows between simulations the observation process for modflow 2000 was used to aid in the calculation of the residuals the differences between the measured and simulated values hill 1998 the gareb bouareg groundwater model was calibrated in steady state mode to average conditions during 1967 and in transient mode for calibration from 1968 to 2016 whereby the hydraulic conductivity k has been calibrated for steady state conditions and the specific yield sy has been calibrated in the transient simulation mode the traditional trial and error method was used for the steady state and transient calibration in the steady state model calibrations the hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer were calibrated on the aquifer heads observed at the piezometric map of the gareb bouareg aquifer during the year 1967 the results are shown in fig 12 and it appears at the end of the calibration that a good agreement was observed between measured heads in the field and calculated heads by the model see fig 13 for the transient calibrations which represent a continuity of steady state calibrations the model was run for the 1968 to 2016 time period using the head results of the optimal steady state 1967 calibration run as starting head 3 13 sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the sensitivity of the model to changes in model input parameters the calibrated model was submitted to sensitivity analyses this procedure consisted of changing only one input parameter at a time while keeping all others fixed 3 14 model verification model verification serves to check if the calibrated model is able to predict observed hydraulic heads for later time periods not yet used in the calibration process as the transient calibration was performed for the 1968 to 2016 time period for verification the heads measured in the subsequent year 2017 is used a very good agreement between simulated and observed groundwater heads with a coefficient of determination r2 0 99 is also obtained for this year of verification 3 15 rational water resources management the management model which constitutes the final step of any modeling study will allow to predict the behavior of the gareb bouareg coastal aquifer according to different management scenarios and to simulate its reaction to specific events such as pump draining after calibration and verification of the model three planning scenarios schemes were designed to simulate the future changes in drawdown under different pumping rates at areas suffering of water logging problems scenario 1 pump draining of 750 l s in a series of 25 wells related to the gareb bouareg aquifer the first scenario assumes that the pump draining will be done in the water logging area of the agricultural sector ii this scenario consists of an abstraction of 750 l s in a series of 25 wells with a rate of 30 l s per well the result of this scenario shows at fig 14 that within the pumping zone the groundwater level decreases by a maximum of 17 m compared to the situation before abstractions and the abstraction sensitive zone generated extends over an area of approximately 30 km2 however the drawdown generated remains local hence the idea consists of increasing pumped wells number decreasing pumped rates and simulating the effect of pump draining at the entire sector ii of the coastal aquifer scenario 2 pump draining of 880 l s in a series of 220 wells the second scenario proposes the simulation of the entire sector ii of the coastal aquifer this scenario consists of an abstraction of 880 l s in a series of 220 wells at a rate of 4 l s per well the result of this simulation shows at fig 15 that the water table decreases by a maximum of 12 m after pump draining and the abstraction sensitive zone generated extends over an area of approximately 75 km2 on the basis of the previous scenario results it is well judged to apply the model to test the aquifer response of a progressive and realistic pump draining scenario 3 progressive pump draining of 150 200 250 and 300 l s the third scenario assumes that the pump draining will be done in the water logging area of the agricultural sector ii with a progressive pump draining of 150 200 250 and 300 l s table 8 shows the result of progressive pump draining simulations including the maximum drawdown and the abstraction sensitive zone generated likewise fig 16 shows the results of the best and realistic scenario revealed that a pump draining of 300 l s in a series of 10 wells at a rate of 30 l s per well the average well productivity in the region decreases the water table by a maximum of 5 42 m to recover the groundwater level before rising the abstraction sensitive zone generated extends over an area of approximately 14 km2 for the selected scenario it is important to note that if the pump draining solution is recommended it may face certain constraints such as the operating and maintenance costs of wells pumping stations as well as the evacuation problem of pumped water 4 conclusion water logging resulted of increase in groundwater levels has become an imminent problem in many irrigated agricultural areas in the world such has been the case for the gareb and bouareg plains located on the mediterranean coast of northeastern morocco the unfavorable situation there is further accentuated by the change in the mode of supplying the irrigated sectors namely the gradual reduced use of the brackish groundwater resources groundwater recharge analysis over the study period 1967 2016 revealed that percolation from irrigated fields was the main recharge component with 36 contributing to total recharge an average annual groundwater table rise of 0 17 m was estimated for the study area over the period 1980 2016 to simulate the impact of various exploitation schemes on the water table in areas suffering of water logging problems the groundwater flow model modflow within the gms 7 0 environment has been employed after calibration and verification of the model several scenarios have been conducted pump draining carried out in order to maintain the groundwater table at a safe depth will be done at the agricultural sector ii where the gareb bouareg aquifer suffers of water logging problems this consists of abstraction of 300 l s in a series of 10 wells at a rate flow of 30 l s per well the average well productivity in the region the result of the best and realistic scenario shows that the water table decreases by a maximum of 5 42 m to reach its initial level before rising the abstraction sensitive zone generated extends over an area of approximately 14 km2 the use of regional groundwater model based on the hydrodynamic modeling by using visual modflow techniques in groundwater modeling system for simulating the functioning of an agricultural drainage system has limitations in contrast to the regional models that can be used to judge the effectiveness of a vertical drainage system deep pumping well horizontal drainage is a process that will take place at local scales agricultural parcel and its modeling considers that the groundwater flows are horizontal this process could be adopted to keep the groundwater piezometry at a safe level allowing the plants to be developed in adequate conditions if available data allow we suggest to proceed to the modeling of flows towards the drainage systems by updating the modflow underground flow model using a very tight mesh a few meters also if available quality data allow the gareb bouareg

12107,the objectives of this work are to control the groundwater levels of the coastal aquifer of gareb bouareg from rif morocco using visual modflow techniques as part of the groundwater modeling system gms 7 0 to bring the water table back to safety limit and to prevent any further rise of this water table however the calibrated and validated model makes it possible to carry out several scenarios whose objective is to test the impact of various modes of exploitation on the water table in an area suffering from waterlogging problems such as the case of the gareb bouareg aquifer from morocco the results obtained according to the optimal and realistic scenario made it possible to lower the piezometric level of 5 42 m over an area of 14 km2 by applying a pumping of 300 l s on 10 wells with a flow rate of 30 l s well this technique could be improved by reducing inputs through water saving irrigation practices or by applying corrective measures to increase the outflows that will eventually be demineralized and exploited for drinking water consumption graphical abstract conceptual model of the studied aquifer image 1 keywords gareb bouareg aquifer modflow groundwater

drinking water supply and industrial bahir et al 2018 2019 baki et al 2017 carreira et al 2018 nouayti et al 2016 2020 a model is a simplified version of the real groundwater system that approximately simulates groundwater problems groundwater simulation models such as the well known modflow groundwater model mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 have been widely employed in general groundwater flow studies namely in applications of conjunctive water use which is often the cause for the named water logging problems in irrigation command areas bejranonda et al 2009 dafny et al 2010 xu et al 2011 koch et al 2012 these simulation models have been used by several authors and in different management water resource projects such as kim and sultan 2002 on the simulation impacts of an irrigation and drainage network on the nubian aquifer s egypt groundwater resources using modflow and kumar et al 2009 on the simulation of groundwater flow in a section of the western yamuna canal in haryana state india by visual modflow see fig 3 the gareb and bouareg plains which are a part of the northeastern region of morocco offers in 30 of its surface a potential of interesting agricultural land estimated at around 23 7 km2 nevertheless the existence of a phreatic brackish aquifer requires the irrigation of the plain from the surface water of moulouya wadi this aquifer has known in 2009 and 2010 a succession of rainy years exceeding the mean rainfall recorded in the past this situation associated with the development of irrigation systems of the plains resulted of increase in piezometric level of the coastal aquifer and the appearance of marshy areas these areas whose spatial and temporal extent are quite important cause significant damage to the crops in place and also required drainage to combat water logging and to prevent secondary salinization from shallow and saline coastal aquifer the gareb bouareg aquifer was selected as the study area for several reasons i a central valley having a large shallow groundwater basin with a potential of interesting agricultural land and an availability of surface water fed by rainfall of precipitation by runoff from the surrounding mountains by percolation from irrigated fields and by drainage from the overlying selouane wadi ii increased population growth and agriculture development are projected for this area in the future iii

understanding of the hydrodynamic functioning of the aquifer e water balance f model calibration for steady state and transient modes against measured observed data and model validation using other sets of data g sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of parameter uncertainty on model outputs h exploitation of the groundwater model by simulating future scenarios in order to predict the water table fluctuations under different stress periods the purposes of this study are to control the groundwater levels of the coastal aquifer of gareb bouareg using the visual modflow techniques in groundwater modeling system to bring the water table back to safety limit and to prevent any further rise of this water table 1 1 study area located in the moulouya basin the gareb bouareg aquifer is a shallow aquifer with an area of 522 km2 corresponding to the extension of the two gareb and bouareg plains this aquifer is limited to the north by the mediterranean sea and the bouareg sebkha to the southeastern by the kebdana anticline to the northwestern by the beni bouifrour and gourougou anticlines fig 1 see fig 2 the gareb and bouareg plains have been the subject of several studies aimed to characterize them on different levels especially the hydrological sedimentological hydrogeochemical el alami et al 1998 el yaouti et al 2008 and the biological plans lefebvre et al 1996 louzzi et al 2007 2 materials and methods 2 1 data acquisition for better management of groundwater resources it is necessary to have enough data about the physical and hydrogeological settings for the study area physical parameters include meteorological data aquifer thickness recharge and pumping rates hydraulic parameters and monitored groundwater levels hydrogeological properties includes the aquifer system geologic formations topographic map with locations of wells land use soil classification boundary conditions drainage as well as irrigation systems for the gareb bouareg coastal aquifer data from various sources were collected processed and organized in a spatial coordinate system allowing the development of a spatial and tabular database under the geographic information system arcgis version 10 3 lyazidi et al 2017 2019 2 2 hydro meteorological data the climate of the study area is mediterranean it is characterized by a low rainfall ranging from 116 to 430 mm year and average temperatures ranging from 11 c in january to 30 c in august el madani et al 2011 winds direction west and southwest in winter and north and northeast in summer influence the surface circulation of nador lagoon waters hilmi et al 2007 as for the direction of the littoral drift it shows a seasonal variability with a predominant direction se nw raji et al 2013 meteorological as well as hydrological data are required for the development and calibration of a groundwater model in the present study data recorded over a period of 50 years are employed the average annual values for the actual evapotranspiration can be estimated at 293 mm in table 1 the monthly and annual means values of precipitation and temperature are listed whereas table 2 shows the average monthly and annual outflow discharge values at the gauging station of selouane wadi used in the analysis hydrometer station discharge data is used to specify outflow boundary conditions in the groundwater model 2 3 irrigated agriculture data the gareb and bouareg plains offers in 30 of its surface a potential of interesting agricultural land estimated at around 23 7 km2 nevertheless the existence of a phreatic brackish aquifer requires the irrigation of the plain from the surface water of moulouya wadi that is why the irrigation systems networks of the gareb and bouareg plains has been installed a canal supplies from the surface waters of the moulouya wadi a yearly volume of 80 106 m3 to partially cover the agricultural needs of the region which are partly satisfied from the groundwater table 3 shows monthly and annual means values of the irrigation water supply and water recharge volumes in gareb and bouareg plains over a period of 50 years in 106 m3 2 4 hydrogeological data hydrologically the gareb bouareg aquifer unit corresponds to both interconnected aquifers with a potential of 50 106 m3 the gareb aquifer situated in the upstream part of the aquifer unit consists mainly of marly limestones of villafranchian at the south west of the aquifer a lenticular structure and impermeable layers may sometimes be located in the villafranchian lacustrine levels the impervious basement of the aquifer consists of yellow marl 25 carlier 1975 lacustrine limestones and silty consolidated land may be the site of karst circulation the thickness of the aquifer exceeds 80 m in the south but is reduced to less than 20 m between arrouit and selouane localities towards arrouit locality the thickness decreases again and hardly exceeds 5 m as for the bouareg aquifer it succeeds to the north towards gareb and has a thickness that varies from 5 to 60 m its impervious substratum is formed by the very thick continental quaternary the aquiferous formations are very heterogeneous quaternary silty soils with a permeability ranging from 7 2 10 3 to 1 9 10 7 m s carlier 1975 with regard to hydrogeological data there are 824 wells in the study area based on the water resources studies relating to gareb bouareg aquifer agriculture used yearly 15 3 106 m3 of groundwater reservoir to irrigate 19 50 km2 during 1967 which corresponds to an average pumping rate of 0 6 l s for each well due to the water salinity of the gareb bouareg aquifer unit there has been a gradual cessation of the agricultural water abstractions at this aquifer unit these abstractions estimated presently to be 4 106 m3 average yearly over the period 1967 2016 the value of 7 106 m3 during the month of january 2013 a complementary investigation campaign was conducted in the study area it consists of i establishing an updated state of piezometry by reading groundwater levels at the existing monitoring wells ii characterizing the groundwater abstraction and the productivities of different aquifer sectors iii carrying out a sampling campaign to update and supplement the available information on water quality 2 5 groundwater table and hydrodynamic parameters data as part of the dynamics monitoring of the gareb bouareg coastal aquifer a network of 45 monitoring wells selected to study the behavior of the aquifer has been set up table 4 shows the result of investigation campaign conducted in the study area during the month of january 2013 the groundwater level measurement campaign was carried out on all the monitoring wells by use of a graduated steel tape seba water level measurement system table 5 summarizes the characteristics deduced from the log data at these wells each hydraulic conductivity value associated with a well will be used and refined during the model calibration the jacob method is applied to obtain the values of transmissivity t and coefficient storage s 2 6 hydrogeochemistry data during the same investigation campaign in around 30 monitoring wells likely to be sampled for analysis were selected in the gareb bouareg aquifer table 6 the groundwater quality data will be analyzed and valued by the establishment of temporal and spatial evolution maps for each parameter analyzed these maps can tell us about the spatial extension of the quality problems encountered they then enable us to analyze for each parameter the causes of decreasing quality by comparing the state of quality with the sources of pollution and the hydrogeological functioning of the aquifer 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydro meteorological framework on the study area except for the gourougou reliefs kebdana and bni bouifrour mountains which benefit from rains exceeding 450 mm the average rainfall is fairly uniform and varies yearly around 325 mm the seasonal rainfall pattern is characterized by a maximum from november to january followed by a secondary maximum in april temperatures are regular from one year to another lastly the influence of the sea on the climate of the plain is emphasized the gareb plain is also fed by small wadis descending from the bni bouifrour and kerker ziata mountains these wadis converge to lagoon after a short travel in the mountains which does not allow them to branch out they take in the bouareg plain independent channels the selouane wadi the most important wadi of the plain has a base flow rate supported by the groundwater resources and the irrigation returns flow and flows toward the lagoon see fig 4 3 2 geological framework the geological description in the study area is summarized in various geological and hydrogeological reports carlier and zeryouhi 1964 the geological formations were recognized at the outcrop but also from the drilling log at 45 monitoring wells these formations are described from bottom to top as follows fig 5 i limestone formations of probable cretaceous highlighted by well 738 6 carried out in the south west sector of the gareb plain this well crosses 220 m of marl before intersecting the limestone formations with a thickness of 70 m ii miocene marl of the bedrock of the plain these gray blue marl formations are found in several places both in gareb and bouareg the marls have an average thickness of 100 m and exceed 150 m thick between selouane and jbel arroui they are covered by the quaternary clay loams at bouareg and the continental marls from pontico pliocene at gareb except of well 738 6 that crosses the miocene marl layer over its entire thickness and intersects the cretaceous formations the others wells in the study area remain in the miocene marl iii villafranchien deposits which contribute largely to filling the gareb depression they consist mainly of lacustrine formations and in the south west of the gareb plain of silts with pebble and gravel beds iv middle quaternary represented by intercalations of pebbles and gravel embedded in clay loams attributed to the amirian and ended with an encrustation white tuff attributed to the tensiftian 3 3 groundwater table depth fig 5 shows the groundwater table depth that has been established on the basis of 45 monitoring wells measurements the water table depth varies between 1 and 40 m it is shallow in the center of the study area 10 m and in the middle valley of the selouane wadi it becomes deeper by going towards the mountains which delimit it the average depth is of the order of 8 5 m over an area of almost 40 km2 around the arrouit tistoutine road and in the coastal fringe the water table surface is close to the land surface and is less than 2 m or even less than a meter in the vicinity of arrouit locality the water depth map of 2013 compared to that established in 1967 carlier 1975 shows a rise in groundwater table of about 4 10 m depending on the sector 3 4 piezometric head and structure of the flow the piezometric contours map of fig 6 obtained from the 45 points measurements made at january 2013 using kriging spatial interpolation showns a general groundwater flow from the southwest to the northeast the shape of the piezometric contours inflected upstream in the middle valley of the selouane wadi testifies the drainage of the aquifer by this wadi the fraction of the underground flows under the gareb plain non drained by the selouane wadi flows towards the bouareg plain through the passageway which separates the two plains the hydraulic gradient varies from 5 in the north east half of the gareb plain to 0 1 in the irrigated sector in the same plain it is around 1 2 in almost the entire bouareg plain the shape of the piezometric contours shows that the southern mountains surrounding the plain contribute to the aquifer supply the evolution of the piezometric contours in the study area varies from one sector to another the analysis of groundwater table fluctuation history measured at the monitoring well 517 6 located in the irrigated perimeter of the gareb plain shows an evolution of water level from 4 to 4 5 m this evolution is attached due to the total absence of abstractions to evolutions in rainfall and irrigation return flow fig 7 the variations are characterized by alternating cycles of decline and rise of the groundwater level the high levels of the water table are 2 3 m below the land surface representative of the irrigated area areas where the water table closes to the surface are subject to evaporation which may result in increasing salinization of the soil and groundwater see fig 8 3 5 hydrodynamic characteristics of the aquifer in gareb plain the measured transmissivity values seem to decrease from south to north they are higher in the south east of the road that connects arouit and tistoutine localities and range from 1 2 to 5 10 2 m2 s in the vicinity of selouane locality well 1036 6 gives a lower measured transmissivity value representative of low productivity in bouareg plain three sectors are individualized like the distribution of the dominant facies of the saturated zone the east sector has a measured transmissivity values range from 1 10 1 to 5 10 3 m2 s the west sector has values range from 5 to 10 2 m2 s while the central sector has the highest transmissivity values ranging from 1 to 1 2 10 1 m2 s mainly near the southern border of the aquifer the values of the storage coefficient are few eight pumping tests carried out with a follow up of the drawdown in nearby piezometers made it possible to calculate the storage coefficient the measured storage coefficient values vary slightly from upstream to downstream of the aquifer with an average value of about 2 table 5 the gareb bouareg aquifer has relatively good hydrodynamic characteristics which should give it a significant productivity 3 6 hydrogeochemistry of the aquifer during the investigation campaign of january 2013 in around twenty points likely to be sampled for analysis were selected in the study area table 6 groundwater quality data will be analyzed and valued by the establishment of temporal and spatial evolution maps for each parameter analyzed fig 9 the hydrogeochemical analysis results show that the groundwater quality problems of gareb bouareg aquifers are mainly related to the dissolved salts in particular calcium sulphates caso4 sodium chloride nacl and magnesium carbonate mgco3 in fact analyses carried out confirm the groundwater salinity problems already highlighted by the quality monitoring network and the studies carried out the conductivities vary for all sampling points between a minimum of 2710 μs cm and a maximum of 17 140 μs cm with an average of 7845 μs cm chloride contents range from 433 mg l to 6459 mg l with an average of 2342 mg l sodium contents range from 510 mg l to 3156 mg l with an average of 1447 mg l the sulphate contents are between 447 mg l and 1741 mg l with an average of 1447 mg l observation wells that record very poor quality in terms of salinity extend over most of the area they are found both in detritic and carbonate formations spatial distribution of electrical conductivity shows that the highest values are in the arouit area this zone is characterized by a remarkable rise in the piezometric level water depth 3 m due to the recharge by percolation from irrigated field which causes leaching of the already polluted subsoil 3 7 conceptual model in order to develop this conceptual model different reports related to hydrology hydrogeology of the gareb bouareg aquifer were used finally a schematic plan of the system was developed using data from observation wells hydrodynamic characteristics recharge resulting from precipitation recharge by percolation from irrigated fields recharge by runoff from the surrounding mountains recharge by selouane wadi drainage from the overlying selouane wadi drainage towards the lagoon discharge by evapotranspiration pump draining and as well as calculations of water balance 3 8 water balance relating to the gareb bouareg aquifer the calculation results of the average annual water balance components over the 50 years 1967 2016 are summarized as follows groundwater recharge components are i recharge by runoff of several streams draining the surrounding mountainous ii recharge resulting from precipitation iii recharge by percolation from irrigated fields this recharge represents the sum of irrigation volumes from surface and groundwater infiltrated the plain for surface water recharge volumes are calculated by adopting in gareb area an annual irrigation water supply volume of 36 106 m3 a re infiltration coefficient of 15 for spray irrigation a maximum for a much less intensive perimeter which leads to an average annual volume of around 5 106 m3 and by adopting in bouareg area an annual irrigation water supply volume of 42 106 m3 a re infiltration coefficient of 30 for gravity irrigation the relatively intensive perimeter which leads to an average annual volume of around 12 5 106 m3 for groundwater recharge volume is calculated by adopting re infiltration coefficients of 10 of the approximately groundwater abstractions of 7 106 m3 representing about 0 5 106 m3 in total the average annual volume of these re infiltrations is estimated to be 18 106 m3 iv recharge of the bouareg aquifer from the selouane wadi at its downstream section this wadi brought outside the flood period an average annual volume of about 3 106 m3 this volume can be considered as completely infiltrated even if part of it is taken downstream by evaporation groundwater discharge components are i pumping from wells in the gareb bouareg aquifer in the absence of precise information on the current abstractions from this aquifer we will consider that the irrigated perimeters of 8 km2 in 1967 had to extend but without exceeding today 20 of the total perimeter of the bouareg aquifer 100 km2 namely an area of 20 km2 recall that at present this abstraction is annually estimated to be 4 106 m3 ii underground outflow to the lagoon quantified by darcy s law using a hydraulic gradient a transmissivity and a width of the front flow on the basis of the available piezometric maps in particular that of the year 2013 the average gradient value measured between piezometric contours 0 and 10 m is 1 2 the average transmissivity in the downstream part of the aquifer is estimated to be 9 4 10 4 m2 s applied to the length of the water front 31 km these values provide for the gareb bouareg coastal aquifer an average annual underground outflow towards the lagoon in the order of 11 106 m3 iii discharge by evapotranspiration estimated on the basis of the water balance of the adjacent basins gauged in moulouya in the expression of the water balance in irrigated perimeters rainfall is replaced by the sum of rainfall and irrigation water supply volumes 36 106 m3 for gareb plain and 42 106 m3 for bouareg plain with an average rainfall of 325 mm on the gareb bouareg system the actual evapotranspiration is 300 mm the water table depth is less than 5 m on an average surface area of 73 km2 and the average depth is 3 m the evapotranspiration calculated at 3 m depth is about 150 mm year the average annual volume losses by evapotranspiration is about 0 15 m year x 73 106 m2 11 106 m3 iv drainage of the gareb aquifer by the selouane wadi this drainage has been evaluated by gauging the average annual volume drained by the upstream section of the selouane wadi at the gareb plain was estimated by gauging at 3 106 m3 with a minimum of 2 106 m3 gauged in 1985 and a maximum of 19 106 m3 gauged in 2010 table 7 summarizes the different components of the average annual water balance calculated over the period 1967 2016 3 9 model description the groundwater component of the flow model was represented using the transient 3 d groundwater flow equation eq 2 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 2 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z q s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are the values of hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z coordinate axes lt 1 h is the piezometric head l q is the volumetric flux per unit volume and represents sources and or sinks of water t 1 ss is the specific storage of the porous medium l 1 and t is time t groundwater flow in gareb bouareg was simulated using the modular groundwater flow model modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 the gms 7 0 software is used as a graphical interface to build the hydrodynamic model then converted it into a digital mesh model for calculations the results obtained are exploited through the same graphic interface which permits on the one hand to facilitate calibration and on the other hand to maintain certain homogeneity of data and presentation the partial differential flow equation eq 2 can be approximated by replacing the derivatives with finite differences which are simultaneously solved to predict future water levels and fluxes loucks et al 1985 modflow 2000 solves the finite difference equations simultaneously using one of several numerical solver algorithms and by specifying boundary conditions soil properties aquifer hydraulic properties aquifer recharge groundwater withdrawal groundwater levels and other model input parameters 3 10 discretization of the model domain the gareb bouareg aquifer is represented by a monolayer reservoir in which lacustrine limestones gravel and conglomerates are included the impervious basement of fig 10 represents the isohypsum mapping substratum of this aquifer which consists of mio pliocene marls gareb and miocene bouareg and the top is similar to the topographic surface the piezometric surface evolves between these two limits the coastal aquifer is laterally limited by mountainous areas and to the north by the nador lagoon to simulate groundwater flow to gareb bouareg aquifer using a database developed in 2017 a regularly spaced finite difference model grid has been created in the gms environment each cell is 500 m 500 m size in the horizontal plane the final grid consists of 61 rows and 95 columns in the horizontal and one layer in the vertical direction the period from 1967 to 2016 was divided into 50 study periods one study period per year 3 11 boundary conditions the specification of the appropriate boundary conditions is another challenge in groundwater modeling studies boundary conditions are necessary to represent the groundwater system s interaction with the surrounding area boundary conditions considered in the implementation of the hydrodynamic model of gareb bouareg were determined using the geological and hydrogeological data fig 11 it can be summarized as follows i imposed inflow boundary at the limit of the supply zone of aquifer by runoff from the surrounding mountainous gourougou bni bouifrour kerker ziata and kebdana ii imposed outflow boundary to the upstream section of the selouane wadi which drains the gareb aquifer iii imposed inflow boundary to the downstream section of the selouane wadi that recharges the bouareg aquifer iv imposed potential draining boundary to the limit of the gareb bouareg aquifer with the lagoon and the mediterranean sea to explain the discharge of the aquifer v no flow boundary to the extension limit of the aquifer in contact with impervious layers without recharging the aquifer by runoff from the mountains 3 12 model calibration model calibration is the process where model parameter structure and parameter values are adjusted and refined to provide the best match between measured and simulated values of hydrodynamic heads and flows traditionally models are calibrated by trial and error processes in which model parameters are adjusted within reasonable limits from one simulation to the next to achieve the best model fit model fit is commonly evaluated by visual comparison of simulated and measured heads and flows or by comparing root mean square errors of heads and flows between simulations the observation process for modflow 2000 was used to aid in the calculation of the residuals the differences between the measured and simulated values hill 1998 the gareb bouareg groundwater model was calibrated in steady state mode to average conditions during 1967 and in transient mode for calibration from 1968 to 2016 whereby the hydraulic conductivity k has been calibrated for steady state conditions and the specific yield sy has been calibrated in the transient simulation mode the traditional trial and error method was used for the steady state and transient calibration in the steady state model calibrations the hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer were calibrated on the aquifer heads observed at the piezometric map of the gareb bouareg aquifer during the year 1967 the results are shown in fig 12 and it appears at the end of the calibration that a good agreement was observed between measured heads in the field and calculated heads by the model see fig 13 for the transient calibrations which represent a continuity of steady state calibrations the model was run for the 1968 to 2016 time period using the head results of the optimal steady state 1967 calibration run as starting head 3 13 sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the sensitivity of the model to changes in model input parameters the calibrated model was submitted to sensitivity analyses this procedure consisted of changing only one input parameter at a time while keeping all others fixed 3 14 model verification model verification serves to check if the calibrated model is able to predict observed hydraulic heads for later time periods not yet used in the calibration process as the transient calibration was performed for the 1968 to 2016 time period for verification the heads measured in the subsequent year 2017 is used a very good agreement between simulated and observed groundwater heads with a coefficient of determination r2 0 99 is also obtained for this year of verification 3 15 rational water resources management the management model which constitutes the final step of any modeling study will allow to predict the behavior of the gareb bouareg coastal aquifer according to different management scenarios and to simulate its reaction to specific events such as pump draining after calibration and verification of the model three planning scenarios schemes were designed to simulate the future changes in drawdown under different pumping rates at areas suffering of water logging problems scenario 1 pump draining of 750 l s in a series of 25 wells related to the gareb bouareg aquifer the first scenario assumes that the pump draining will be done in the water logging area of the agricultural sector ii this scenario consists of an abstraction of 750 l s in a series of 25 wells with a rate of 30 l s per well the result of this scenario shows at fig 14 that within the pumping zone the groundwater level decreases by a maximum of 17 m compared to the situation before abstractions and the abstraction sensitive zone generated extends over an area of approximately 30 km2 however the drawdown generated remains local hence the idea consists of increasing pumped wells number decreasing pumped rates and simulating the effect of pump draining at the entire sector ii of the coastal aquifer scenario 2 pump draining of 880 l s in a series of 220 wells the second scenario proposes the simulation of the entire sector ii of the coastal aquifer this scenario consists of an abstraction of 880 l s in a series of 220 wells at a rate of 4 l s per well the result of this simulation shows at fig 15 that the water table decreases by a maximum of 12 m after pump draining and the abstraction sensitive zone generated extends over an area of approximately 75 km2 on the basis of the previous scenario results it is well judged to apply the model to test the aquifer response of a progressive and realistic pump draining scenario 3 progressive pump draining of 150 200 250 and 300 l s the third scenario assumes that the pump draining will be done in the water logging area of the agricultural sector ii with a progressive pump draining of 150 200 250 and 300 l s table 8 shows the result of progressive pump draining simulations including the maximum drawdown and the abstraction sensitive zone generated likewise fig 16 shows the results of the best and realistic scenario revealed that a pump draining of 300 l s in a series of 10 wells at a rate of 30 l s per well the average well productivity in the region decreases the water table by a maximum of 5 42 m to recover the groundwater level before rising the abstraction sensitive zone generated extends over an area of approximately 14 km2 for the selected scenario it is important to note that if the pump draining solution is recommended it may face certain constraints such as the operating and maintenance costs of wells pumping stations as well as the evacuation problem of pumped water 4 conclusion water logging resulted of increase in groundwater levels has become an imminent problem in many irrigated agricultural areas in the world such has been the case for the gareb and bouareg plains located on the mediterranean coast of northeastern morocco the unfavorable situation there is further accentuated by the change in the mode of supplying the irrigated sectors namely the gradual reduced use of the brackish groundwater resources groundwater recharge analysis over the study period 1967 2016 revealed that percolation from irrigated fields was the main recharge component with 36 contributing to total recharge an average annual groundwater table rise of 0 17 m was estimated for the study area over the period 1980 2016 to simulate the impact of various exploitation schemes on the water table in areas suffering of water logging problems the groundwater flow model modflow within the gms 7 0 environment has been employed after calibration and verification of the model several scenarios have been conducted pump draining carried out in order to maintain the groundwater table at a safe depth will be done at the agricultural sector ii where the gareb bouareg aquifer suffers of water logging problems this consists of abstraction of 300 l s in a series of 10 wells at a rate flow of 30 l s per well the average well productivity in the region the result of the best and realistic scenario shows that the water table decreases by a maximum of 5 42 m to reach its initial level before rising the abstraction sensitive zone generated extends over an area of approximately 14 km2 the use of regional groundwater model based on the hydrodynamic modeling by using visual modflow techniques in groundwater modeling system for simulating the functioning of an agricultural drainage system has limitations in contrast to the regional models that can be used to judge the effectiveness of a vertical drainage system deep pumping well horizontal drainage is a process that will take place at local scales agricultural parcel and its modeling considers that the groundwater flows are horizontal this process could be adopted to keep the groundwater piezometry at a safe level allowing the plants to be developed in adequate conditions if available data allow we suggest to proceed to the modeling of flows towards the drainage systems by updating the modflow underground flow model using a very tight mesh a few meters also if available quality data allow the gareb bouareg groundwater flow model can be used as the basis for further development of a contaminant transport model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12108,in this work the denitrification of nitrate contaminated groundwater by electrocoagulation ec method using aluminum electrodes has been studied for the production of drinking water tests were carried out on four samples collected from the casablanca settat region ec was investigated for a fixed applied voltage 30 v the submerged surface area of each electrode plate 33 75 cm2 and the inter electrode distance 1 8 cm the results obtained showed that the nitrate removal efficiency reached values between 88 48 and 94 1 after 120 min for the various studied groundwater samples also these results showed that sulfates are removed equally with nitrates during electrocoagulation treatment and that their removal efficiencies ranged from 58 24 to 97 86 for all studied samples after 120 min depending on the initial chloride concentration the bacterial charge has been completely eliminated by electrocoagulation for most of the bacteria present in the treated water finally x ray diffraction was used to characterize the sludge formed by aluminum electrodes during the ec process graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial charge electrocoagulation groundwater nitrate sulfate 1 introduction in recent years the increasing need for drinking water has resulted in increased use of groundwater which has become the main source of water supply for many countries in the world including in morocco intensive use of nitrogen fertilizers sewage disposal by drainage systems and high atmospheric deposition can cause contamination of shallow groundwater with nitrates burow et al 2010 abdel aziz et al 2020 li et al 2016 consumption of nitrate contaminated water might cause health problems including methaemoglobinemia also known as blue baby syndrome in infants due to the transformation of nitrates to nitrites cancers and malformations can occur when nitrate is converted to nitrosamines mousavi et al 2012 jung et al 2014 due to these adverse health effects of nitrate the world health organization who has set a maximum nitrate content of 50 mg no 3 l which is equal to 11 3 mg no 3 n l who 2011 to comply with the limits set by the legislation in force regarding the nitrate content in drinking water several techniques have been proposed for their elimination the most commonly used techniques are adsorption khan et al 2011 gupta and saleh 2013 biological

electrocoagulation majlesi et al 2016 malakootian et al 2011 garcia segura et al 2017 among the numerous techniques of nitrate removal electrocoagulation is advantageous because of its simplicity ease of automation high efficiency and cost effectiveness elazzouzi et al 2017 mohammed and aljaberi 2018 in emamjomeh and sivakumar 2005 study on the electrocoagulation treatment of synthetic water contaminated with nitrates the elimination efficiency obtained was about 90 however ghanbari et al 2014 investigated the nitrate removal by electrocoagulation of iron and aluminum anodes with three configurations al al fe fe and al fe the nitrate removal had its highest 81 5 and lowest 62 8 efficiencies in al fe and al al configurations after 40 min respectively in another study majlesi et al 2016 used a continuous electrocoagulation unit with vertical monopolar electrodes to remove nitrates and obtained a reduction rate of 96 abdel aziz et al 2020 also studied the nitrate removal from water by electrocoagulation using a cell with horizontally oriented al serpentine tube anode the removal efficiency of the cell reached 100 after 100 min the electrocoagulation method consists in applying an electric current to a cell containing sacrificial anode and an auxiliary cathode where the current produces an in situ coagulating species at the anode the generated species form a complex with the contaminants and then precipitate hakizimana et al 2017 the simplest construction of an electrocoagulation reactor is the following an electrolytic cell with an anode and a cathode emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 the anode provides metal ions to the system while the cathode releases hydrogen gas the most commonly used electrode materials are fe and al elazzouzi et al 2017 ouslimane et al 2017 when fe or al are used as anode fe3 or al3 are formed which will react with the cathodically formed oh and yield metal hydroxide mxohy that adsorb the contaminants during electrolysis the

study aims to evaluate the nitrate removal of real groundwater contaminated with nitrate ions by electrocoagulation after a study on synthetic waters the specific objectives were to 1 study the applicability of the electrocoagulation process for the treatment of groundwater contaminated by nitrate ions collected in the casablanca settat region and 2 evaluate the performance of this treatment system on other physicochemical parameters as well as on bacteriological parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater the physicochemical parameters of the four groundwater studied samples 500 ml with nitrate concentrations between 25 mg l and 100 mg l are exhibited in table 1 2 2 experimental set up the electrocoagulation assembly consists of a pyrex electrolytic cell with a volume of 500 ml of groundwater to be treated in which two aluminum electrodes were immersed to a depth of 7 5 cm spaced at 1 8 cm apart and connected to the poles of a dc electric generator with variable potential 0 30 v model al 823 with a 550 w power operating at an input voltage of 220 v fig 1 the active surface of the electrodes was 33 75 cm2 the homogenization of the solution was carried out using a magnetic stirrer to prevent the formation of deposits on the bottom and walls of the cell during each test the electrodes were mechanically polished with abrasive paper and washed with distilled water then the plates were cleaned with acetone to remove any traces of oily residue that may adhere during handling amarine et al 2020 during the tests samples were taken at regular intervals of time the monitored parameters were nitrate concentration nitrite concentration chloride concentration sulfate concentration and some bacteriological parameters present in the samples studied 2 3 design of experiments in this study three tests were performed on four groundwater samples with aluminum electrodes by electrocoagulation the first test studied the treatment by electrocoagulation at a fixed voltage 30 v using aluminum electrodes of dimensions 20 cm 4 5 cm 2 mm with an immersed surface of each electrode equal to 33 75 cm2 the second test studied the bacteriological analysis for groundwater gw3 and gw4 before and after treatment to highlight the bactericidal effect of the ec process the third test characterized the sludge obtained after drying at 105 c by x ray diffraction all these tests were performed at room temperature 2 4 analytical methods the ph was determined using a seven compact mettler toledo ph meter whose probe also measures the temperature conductivity was measured using a consort model c830 conductivity meter nitrates nitrites chlorides and sulfates concentrations were measured using an ion chromatography device of the type ωmetrohm 881 compact ic pro according to the standard nf en iso 10304 1 a metrosep a supp 5 250 4 0 column composed of an anion exchange resin was used for anion separation the mobile phase consisted of a mixed solution of 3 2 mm na2co3 and 1 mm nahco3 with a flow rate of 0 7 ml min the peaks of the different ions analyzed were identified and quantified by magic net software version 2 3 the nitrate or sulfate removal efficiency expressed as was calculated according to eq 5 5 r c i c t c i 100 where ci is the initial concentration and ct is the concentration at time t bacteriological analyses were carried out on raw and treated groundwater and covered total t c and fecal f c coliforms fecal streptococci f s sulfite reducing anaerobes revivifiable microorganisms and pseudomonas aeruginosa using the standard method of water and wastewater analysis using membrane filtration fm technology and the solid medium incorporation technique in surfusion the units of measurement chosen were ufc colony forming units 1 ml for mor22 and mor37 and ufc 100 ml for the other microorganisms analyzed table 2 presents the methods for the germs analysis required for well water gw3 and gw4 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph variation of four groundwater treated by ec table 3 shows the ph evolution before and after electrocoagulation treatment for the different types of treated waters we observed an increase in ph during the electrocoagulation process except for groundwater gw1 which remains almost stable this increase may be due to the production of o h ions and the consumption of h ions at the cathode eq 6 and eq 7 6 2h2o 2e h2 2oh 7 2h 2e h2 feng et al 2007 reported the same ph behavior and explained this change by the formation of hydroxide ions produced at the cathode by the reduction of water or by the release of o h ions from the partial exchange of c l with o h of al oh 3 3 2 evolution of nitrates their removal efficiencies and nitrites during the ec process fig 2 shows the evolution of nitrite and nitrate concentration during the ec process for different groundwater treated fig 3 shows the evolution of nitrate removal efficiencies for treated groundwater samples fig 3 shows that nitrate removal efficiency increases over time it varies between 88 48 and 94 1 after 120min for the different groundwatersamples studied the abatement of nitrates and the appearance of nitrites in low concentrations during treatment fig 2 show that the elimination of nitrates can be done either by adsorption on the various hydroxides formed and or by reduction to nitrites the total removal of nitrites at the end of the treatment can be explained by their adsorption on aluminum hydroxides and or by reduction to n2 abdel aziz et al 2020 the presence of chlorides reduces the formation of nitrites the present results are consistent with previous studies by amarine et al 2020 who investigated the removal of nitrates from synthetic waters nevertheless ghanim and ajjam 2013 have shown that nitrate removal can be achieved by converting high ph nitrates into other products such as ammonia according to eq 8 8 n o 3 6 h 2 o 8 e n h 3 9 o h they also showed that the presence of chlorides reduces nh3 formation 3 3 evolution of sulfate concentrations and their removal efficiencies fig 4 shows the evolution of the sulfates concentration and their removal efficiencies during ec treatment for the different treated waters the monitoring of the concentration of sulfate ions shows that the residual concentration decreases with time for all treated groundwater samples this can be explained by the adsorption of sulfates on the various aluminum hydroxides formed concerning the efficiency of sulfate removal by electrocoagulation an increase in efficiency with time is noticed and the efficiency of sulfate ion removal reaches a value between 58 24 and 97 86 for all groundwater samples after 120min and that these values depend on the initial chloride concentration our experimental results are in agreement with the study carried out by sandoval et al 2017 where the presence of sulfates in the analyzed flocs explains the elimination of sulfates by adsorption 3 4 evolution of chloride ion concentration fig 5 shows the evolution of chloride ions during the ec process of treated groundwater samples fig 5 exhibits an increase in chloride ion concentration in all treated waters except gw2 well water chloride ions of treated water can also be oxidized to give activated forms of chlorine such as hypochlorite anions which have a high oxidizing power over pollutants formation mechanism of the latter is as follows 9 cl2 2e 2cl 10 cl2 h2o cl clo 2h this behavior of chloride ions can be explained by the formation of chloride ions during the electrocoagulation process according to the reactions mentioned above eqs 9 and 10 3 5 reduction in the concentration of the analyzed germs the abatement rate of different studied bacterial species was significant reaching 100 for most of the analyzed microorganisms table 4 shows the concentrations of present germs in the studied well waters before and after treatment the results showed that the electrocoagulation process plays an important role in disinfecting the pathogenic microorganisms contaminated groundwaters these results also show the creation of a bactericidal effect by the formation of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or hypochlorous acids obtained during chloride oxidation during the electrocoagulation process the important elimination of germs by this process could be explained by the electric field created between the electrodes which play an important role it would have a bactericidal effect on all the microorganisms present in the environment patermarakis and fountoukidis 1990 using titanium electrodes confirmed this bactericidal effect without any formation of hypochlorous or other chlorine derivatives other studies have demonstrated the bactericidal effect of the electric field on bacterial flora by comparing the electrocoagulation process with the physicochemical process carried out by adding chemical coagulants such as aluminum sulfate al2 so4 3 and ferric chloride fecl3 several authors have used electrocoagulation as a disinfection method in urban wastewater treatment plants describing the almost total elimination 99 99 of escherichia coli cotillas et al 2013 llanos et al 2017 of total coliforms elazzouzi et al 2017 makwana and ahammed 2017 or staphylococcus aureus valero et al 2017 3 6 x ray diffraction analysis fig 6 a shows the x ray diffractogram given after the analysis of the sludge obtained dried at 105 c after the groundwater treatment gw3 after identifying the peaks it was considered that the precipitation is carried out according to two structures a polymeric structure al45o45 oh 45cl and a monomeric structure al oh 3 nevertheless analysis of the xr diffractogram of sludge dried at 105 c after electrocoagulation treatment fig 6b shows that the precipitate is in polymeric form al45o45 oh 45cl this figure shows the presence of a single structure 4 conclusion the treatment of nitrate contaminated groundwater by electrocoagulation was conducted in a batch cell with aluminum electrodes on the basis of the experimental results the following conclusions may be drawn the nitrate removal efficiencies reached values between 88 48 and 94 10 for 120min for all treated groundwaters sulfates were removed at the same time as nitrates and the sulfate removal efficiencies reached values between 58 24 and 97 86 for 120 min for all treated waters the high removal efficiency of sulfate ions indicates that their removal can be explained by their adsorption on aluminum hydroxide flocs the presence of chlorides promotes the elimination of sulfate ions by electrocoagulation bacteriological analysis before and after treatment clearly showed a bactericidal effect created by the ec method funding this research

12109,imazalil herbicide 1 2 2 4 dichlorophenyl 2 prop 2 enoxyethyl imidazole belongs to the enilconazole family of herbicides this compound is largely utilized on agricultural field crops in morocco soil properties greatly improve the adsorption of this chemical compound in soils but there is a need to understand their effect on said soils this current study evaluates the adsorption behavior of imazalil using four agricultural soils from morocco in batch systems and examines the impact of contact time and initial imazalil concentration the physico chemical properties of soils were characterized by several analytical methods the equilibrium isotherms of imazalil removal by moroccan soils were studied using batch tests the obtained data revealed that the adsorbed amount of pollutant increases with the increasing the organic matter and organic carbon contents in soils the adsorption kinetic process of different soils followed the pseudo second order kinetic model and the adsorption mechanism of herbicide using different soils was controlled by intraparticle diffusion model isotherm adsorption experiments of imazalil on four agricultural soils indicated that adsorption was best fitted by the langmuir and freundlich models our data suggest potential for reduced transfer of imazalil from agricultural soils to groundwater in morocco graphical abstract image 1 keywords imazalil herbicide moroccan soils characterization adsorption batch test 1 introduction the existence of herbicide in soil groundwater and surface water has become a critical environmental problem in the last few decades due to their generalized application in agriculture several fungicides have been used as agricultural herbicides such as diuron chlorotoluron inuron benoxacor and imazalil agbaogun and fischer 2020 lv et al 2016 of these imazalil is an agricultural fungicide which is widely applied in moroccan agriculture especially for the cultivation of citrus fruits imazalil is also called chloramizole fungaflor freshgard and nuzone in general the imazalil compound is a persistent contaminant present in the environment soil surface water and groundwater with a half life of more than 300 days this pollutant can enter groundwater in a variety of ways and pose potential risks for various aquatic organisms fauna and flora for these adverse effects on the ecosystem many techniques like electrocoagulation behloul et al 2013 bioremediation yan et al 2018 electrochemical advanced oxidation process yang et al 2019 ozonation cara et al 2017 photocatalysts santiago et al 2014 and adsorption vinhal et al 2017 were tested and employed individually or in combination for the removal and degradation of herbicides from the aquatic environment of these techniques adsorption is a key method because of its simplicity economic ease of use environmental characteristics degradation and retention efficiency alouani et al 2019 saufi et al 2020 several adsorbents were used in the adsorption process to remove of organic contaminant herbicides from water such as modified clays and phosphates konstantinou 2000 polyaniline derived carbons meso and microporous organosilica materials otero et al 2019 alkaline treated straw and a soil cara et al 2017 many scientists have investigated the use of soils as adsorbent materials for the elimination of pollutants from aquatic environments chen et al 2018 kaur kaur 2020 rodrigo et al 2018 since agricultural soils contain high organic matter and clay content that are useful for the removal of these hazardous compounds from fresh water in this connection the focus of this study was to investigate the adsorption capacity performance of herbicide namely imazalil using four moroccan agricultural soils the influence of organic matter content om organic carbon content oc and clay content in soils was evaluated factors affecting the adsorption efficiency of herbicide such as the contact time and initial herbicide concentration were also studied and discussed kinetic and isotherm adsorption tests were performed to have better understand by the adsorption mechanism 2 experimental 2 1 soil samples the four representative soils utilized in the current work were collected from four different agricultural sites in different cities of morocco namely larache soil a laouamra soil b tlata drissana soil c and ksar kbir soil d fig 1 the soils were collected from a surface layer between 0 and 20 cm deep air dried and sieved through a sieve smaller than 2 0 mm and stored without any pretreatment 2 2 herbicide

method the hydrometer method and the ammonium acetate method oufqir et al 2017 respectively the chemical compounds of different soils were determined by x ray fluorescence xrf via spectrometer type axios the clay mineralogy of the soil specimens was identified using x ray powder diffraction x pert pro system herbicide analysis the analysis of herbicide concentration before and after adsorption process by soils was performed with a varian prostar hplc system spain equipped with a diode array uv visible detector and kromasil c18 hplc columns length 100 mm particle size 5 μm imazalil herbicide was detected at a wavelength of 219 nm and had a retention time of 2 5 min the flow rate was 0 7 ml min 1 and the sample injection volume was 20 μl the mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile milli q water solution 60 40 v v 2 4 adsorption experiments the adsorption technique was employed by batch mode to evaluate the adsorption of imazalil by soil specimens at ambient temperature adsorption kinetic was performed in duplicate with a contact time ranging from 0 to 10 h and an initial herbicide concentration of 10 5 mol l 1 with a fixed soils amount of 25 g l 1 adsorption isotherms were carried out in duplicate with concentrations of the herbicide solutions between 10 6 mol l 1 and 10 4 mol l 1 prepared from a stock solution of 5 10 4 mol l 1 25 g soils l 1 the obtained suspensions

phase at equilibrium qe mg g 1 was obtained by the following eq 2 2 q e c i c e m v ce mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of samples 3 1 1 chemical analysis xrf the elements corresponding to the investigated soil samples are presented in table 2 analysis of the data indicates that the main elements in the different soils are oxygen calcium silicon aluminum carbon iron magnesium and other impurities the content of the elements calcium silicon aluminium carbon and iron can be correlated to the amount of calcite quartz clay organic matter organic carbon and iron oxide present in the various soils indeed the comparison of calcium content in different specimens generally reveals two types of soil thus laouamra and larache samples present a low calcium content of 4 2 and 5 3 respectively indicating that these soils are low in limestone while the samples of ksar kebir and tlata drissana show a high calcium content of 18 7 and 27 5 respectively suggesting that these soils are rich in limestone 3 1 2 soil ph organic matter content and clay content characterization physical chemical properties of the soils such as clay organic carbon content organic carbon ph and cation exchange capacity are summarized in table 3 particle size analysis revealed that a coarse texture mostly sandy for the majority of soils and that the soils in the ksar kbir and tlata drissana regions have a predominantly silty fraction the clay percentage ranged from 21 3 to 31 9 with soil c recording the highest content of clay percentage 31 9 followed by soil b 26 1 soil d 22 7 and soil a 21 3 the rate of organic matter om limestone in particular showed a great variability between specimens indeed om contents vary from 3 2 to 22 2 depending on the sample the larache and laouamra soils are distinguished by their particular richness in om 22 2 and 9 8 respectively for these two soils these high om contents logically translate into high cation exchange capacities cec 49 4 meq 100 g for larache and 33 0 meq 100 g for laouamra the om contents of the other two soils which are lower between 3 2 and 4 2 are still significant the clay percentage ranged from 21 3 to 31 9 and soil c had the highest content of clay percentage 31 9 followed by soil b soil d 22 7 and soil a 21 3 the results of ph measurement of different soils demonstrate that larache and laouamra samples are neutral soils and tlata drissana and ksar kbir samples are alkaline soils high percentage of limestone in tlata drissana and ksar kbir samples compared to other soils confirm alkaline character of these soils 3 1 3 x ray diffraction xrd analysis a mineralogical analysis of the four soil samples was done by x ray diffraction xrd in order to identify the main constituent phases of the mineral fraction of the soil the obtained diffractograms of soils are depicted in fig 3 these data showed that the dominant peaks correspond to calcite 2θ 36 5 39 6 47 2 48 4 and quartz 2θ 21 5 29 5 50 3 other peaks less intense show the presence of goethite 2θ 21 2 and mineralogical clays more precisely kaolinite 2θ 12 4 and illite 2θ 19 5 tio2 in the rutile 2θ 36 1 and anatase 2θ 25 3 forms are presented but in negligible quantities the analysis of these diffractograms by rietveld refinement led to a quantitative determination of the different constituents of the mineral fraction of the soils the obtained data are reported in table 4 analysis of the data in table 4 shows that the mineral fraction of the soils consists mainly of three phases quartz calcite and clay minerals associated with goethite the classification of the soils according to their total limestone content is confirmed by the xrd analysis in fact the same groups of soils are found this time classified according to the richness of their mineral fraction in calcite in low calcareous soils larache and tlata drissana calcite constitutes less than 11 of the mineral fraction in these soils quartz is the most abundant mineral 50 followed by the clay fraction 36 on average on the other hand in ksar kebir and laouamra soils calcite is the major constituent it represents up to 50 of the fraction finally titanium oxides which are negligible represent only a tiny part of the mineral fraction 2 3 2 removal of herbicide by soils 3 2 1 effect of contact time on adsorption the evolution of imazalil herbicide adsorption using different soils as a function of contact time was evaluated using a constant soil amount 25 g l 1 herbicide concentration 10 5 mol l 1 and temperature 20 c the influence of contact time on the removal of herbicide using soils is presented in fig 4 the uptake amount of imazalil increased significantly with increase in contact time from 0 to 10 h the equilibrium time is different depending on the soil it is about 7 9 9 and 9 h for the soils of larache a laouamra b tlata drissana c and ksar kbir d respectively the obtained data demonstrated that the removal of imazalil from aqueous solutions by different soils was three step kinetic process the first step i corresponds to the transfer of the herbicide molecules from the solution to the external surface of the soil the second stage ii is relatively rapid this step corresponds to the adsorption of the herbicide at the most accessible sites probably located on the outer surfaces of soil particles then in the third stage iii the adsorption of imazalil continues but in a slow manner this limitation of the adsorption rate during the third stage is due to molecular diffusion of the herbicide to less accessible sites such as soil micropores interfoliate spaces in clays and within organic matter the maximum herbicide uptake was observed in soil a cara et al 2017 this may be due to high cation exchange capacity high organic matter and organic carbon contents in the soil singh and cameotra 2013 3 2 2 adsorption kinetic and mechanism studies the adsorption kinetics are essential for evaluating and discussing the mechanism of fixation of the solute on the adsorbent surface and for describing the adsorption rate several models are used in the literature to describe the mechanism in this work the adsorption kinetics of herbicide using the soils were evaluated by pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models el alouani et al 2018 the linear equation of pseudo first order model is expressed as 3 l n q e q t l n q e k 1 t where qt mg g is the adsorption capacity at time t min qe mg g is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium k1 min 1 is the rate constant of pseudo first order the linear equation of pseudo second order model is given by equation 4 4 1 q t 1 t k 2 q e 2 1 q e where k2 g mg min is the rate constant of pseudo second order model the linear equation of intraparticle diffusion kinetic model is as follows 5 q t k i t 1 2 i where ki mg g mg1 2 is the rate constant of intraparticle diffusion model and i is mg g is the intraparticle diffusion constants the kinetic constants and regression coefficients r2 of pseudo first order and pseudo second order models are presented in tables 5 and 6 as shown in table 5 the kinetic data indicated a better fit to the pseudo second order kinetic model with r2 values of 0 97 0 97 0 93 and 0 99 for larache laouamra ksar kebir and tlata drissana soils respectively than to the pseudo first order kinetic model with r2 values of 0 96 0 97 0 89 and 0 94 for larache laouamra ksar kebir and tlata drissana soils respectively in addition the experimental values of adsorption capacity qe exp of pseudo second order model are closer to those of the calculated values of adsorption capacity qe cal these findings showed the adsorption of herbicide using different soils followed the pseudo second order model which indicating that the adsorption mechanism of herbicide using different soils is described by the chemisorption process saufi et al 2020 since pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were insufficient to interpret the mechanism of herbicide adsorption using soils due to its lack of rate limiting step therefore the adsorption kinetic data were evaluated by the intraparticle diffusion model to examine the adsorption mechanism and rate limiting step between adsorbate and adsorbents based on that the intraparticle diffusion model of adsorption of herbicide by different soils is illustrated and proposed in figs 5 and 6 three steps control the proposed adsorption mechanism the first step transfer of herbicide molecules from aqueous solution to the external surface of soils film diffusion second step transfer of herbicide molecules from the external surface of soils into the interior pores of soils intraparticle diffusion and third step adsorption of herbicide molecules onto the interior surface of soils adsorption wang et al 2020 the results show that the pseudo second order model is not the only adsorption step and that the adsorption mechanism is controlled by intraparticle diffusion model in combination with pseudo second order model 3 2 3 imazalil adsorption isotherms imazalil adsorption isotherms on agricultural soils were measured in distinct solutions with initial concentration of herbicide ranging from 10 6 mol l 1 to 10 4 mol l 1 and were evaluated using a constant soil amount 25 g l 1 contact time 10 h and temperature 20 c the obtained data are shown in fig 7 as seen when the imazalil herbicide concentration on equilibrium ce increase imazalil herbicide uptake capability of soils increase qe indicating the initial imazalil concentration was a driving force in adsorption process el alouani et al 2019a however based on the curve obtained it can be seen that the saturation of the soil surface has not been reached yet to assess the interaction mechanism between the adsorbent soils and adsorbate imazalil herbicide system at equilibrium various adsorption isotherm models are utilized el alouani et al 2019b el alouani et al 2018 in this work the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm equations were used to evaluate the experimental data the linear expression of the langmuir isotherm model is expressed as eq 6 6 1 q e 1 c e k l q m 1 q m the linear expression of the freundlich isotherm model is expressed as eq 7 7 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e the linear expression of the temkin isotherm model is expressed as eq 8 8 q e b t ln a t b t ln c e where qe mg g 1 is the amount of herbicide per unit gram of soil ce mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration of herbicide qm mg g 1 is the maximum adsorption capacity kl is the langmuir constant kf is the freundlich constant 1 n is the heterogeneity factor that indicates the adsorption intensity bt rt bt bt is the temkin constant related to heat of sorption j mol at is the temkin isotherm constant l g r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the absolute temperature k table 7 presents the constants and the correlation coefficients values r2 of the langmuir freundlich and temkin model parameters calculated from equations for all soils the correlation coefficients values r2 obtained from langmuir and freundlich models were greater than those from temkin model these results indicate that the adsorption isotherms of the herbicide on soils were best described by the langmuir and freundlich models over the herbicide concentration range tested which suggests that homogeneous and heterogeneous active sites existed on the surface of the soils and adsorption of herbicide was monolayer and multilayer adsorption prakash et al 2010 the all soils showed non liner isotherm n 1 which revealed that herbicide pollutant could adsorb to the organic matter the clay fraction and organic carbon present in the different soils singh and cameotra 2013 similar results were achieved by albarrán et al for the sorption of simazine on soils albarrán et al 2004 and krutz et al for the adsorption of desethylatrazine atrazine hydroxyatrazine and deisopropylatrazine on vegetated filter strip and cultivated soil krutz et al 2003 3 3 determination of distribution coefficient soils distribution coefficients kd is very important parameters for evaluating the infinity and distribution of herbicide and pesticide molecules in soil particles this distribution coefficient was studied to elucidate the infinity of herbicide distribution in the studied soils the adsorption distribution coefficients kd were calculated as eq 9 9 k d q e c e the adsorption coefficient kd was also determined as a function of the organic matter om and organic carbon oc content of the soil according to equations 10 and 11 respectively 10 k o m k d o m 100 11 k o c k d o c 100 the calculated distribution coefficients for the imazalil herbicide soils system are summarized in table 8 the obtained kd values are classified the soils into two groups according to their affinity for imazalil on the one hand larache and laouamra soils show a relatively high affinity for the herbicide with the highest kd values in this group adsorption decreases significantly in the following order kd larache kd laouamra which is in line with the decrease in om content 22 2 and 9 8 respectively and oc 12 9 and 5 7 respectively content in these soils table 2 recall that these two soils were classified as low in limestone 8 on average on the other hand tlata drissana and ksar kbir soils show relatively low affinities with kd of the same order of magnitude 2 7 and 4 1 l kg 1 om content varying between 3 2 and 4 2 and oc content ranging 1 9 and 2 4 respectively on the other hand these soils have significantly higher levels of limestone 49 6 for ksar kbir soil and 70 4 for tlata drissana soil than those in the first group these results demonstrate that soil with high organic matter organic carbon content and low limestone content exhibited better imazalil herbicide adsorption capacity 4 conclusion this current research contributes to the understanding of the imazalil herbicide adsorption process by four types of agricultural soils from different regions of morocco the removal of herbicide using soils was dependent of contact time and initial herbicide concentration the increase in contact time and herbicide concentration of the solution had a positive influence on the adsorption process the adsorption kinetic data were well correlated to the pseudo second order model and the adsorption mechanism is controlled by intraparticle diffusion model the isotherm studies revealed that the adsorption of herbicide contaminant is better described by langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the soil was high in organic carbon and organic matter with a better distribution coefficient suggesting the infinity for herbicide adsorption the findings of this study could help in designing of efficient imazalil herbicide management approach in larache laouamra tlata drissana and ksar kbir

imazalil herbicide moroccan soils characterization adsorption batch test 1 introduction the existence of herbicide in soil groundwater and surface water has become a critical environmental problem in the last few decades due to their generalized application in agriculture several fungicides have been used as agricultural herbicides such as diuron chlorotoluron inuron benoxacor and imazalil agbaogun and fischer 2020 lv et al 2016 of these imazalil is an agricultural fungicide which is widely applied in moroccan agriculture especially for the cultivation of citrus fruits imazalil is also called chloramizole fungaflor freshgard and nuzone in general the imazalil compound is a persistent contaminant present in the environment soil surface water and groundwater with a half life of more than 300 days this pollutant can enter groundwater in a variety of ways and pose potential risks for various aquatic organisms fauna and flora for these adverse effects on the ecosystem many

is a key method because of its simplicity economic ease of use environmental characteristics degradation and retention efficiency alouani et al 2019 saufi et al 2020 several adsorbents were used in the adsorption process to remove of organic contaminant herbicides from water such as modified clays and phosphates konstantinou 2000 polyaniline derived carbons meso and microporous organosilica materials otero et al 2019 alkaline treated straw and a soil cara et al 2017 many scientists have investigated the use of soils as adsorbent materials for the elimination of pollutants from aquatic environments chen et al 2018 kaur kaur 2020 rodrigo et al 2018 since agricultural soils contain high organic matter and clay content that are useful for the removal of these hazardous compounds from fresh water in this connection the focus of this study was to investigate the adsorption capacity performance of herbicide namely imazalil using four moroccan agricultural soils the influence of organic matter content om organic carbon content oc and clay content in soils was evaluated factors affecting the adsorption efficiency of herbicide such as the contact time and initial herbicide concentration were also studied and discussed kinetic and isotherm adsorption tests were performed to have better understand by the adsorption mechanism 2 experimental 2 1 soil samples the four representative soils utilized in the current work were collected from four different agricultural sites in different cities of morocco namely larache soil a laouamra soil b tlata drissana soil c and ksar kbir soil d fig 1 the soils were collected from a surface layer between 0 and 20 cm deep air dried and sieved through a sieve smaller than 2 0 mm and stored without any pretreatment 2 2 herbicide imazalil herbicide 1 2 2 4 dichlorophenyl 2 prop 2 enoxyethyl imidazole of 99 9 purity was obtained from sigma aldrich germany the physico chemical properties of the imazalil herbicide are presented in table 1 and the structure is shown in fig 2 2 3 characterization technique soils characterization the organic matter the clay and the cec parameters were determined via the chromic acid digestion

process by soils was performed with a varian prostar hplc system spain equipped with a diode array uv visible detector and kromasil c18 hplc columns length 100 mm particle size 5 μm imazalil herbicide was detected at a wavelength of 219 nm and had a retention time of 2 5 min the flow rate was 0 7 ml min 1 and the sample injection volume was 20 μl the mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile milli q water solution 60 40 v v 2 4 adsorption experiments the adsorption technique was employed by batch mode to evaluate the adsorption of imazalil by soil specimens at ambient temperature adsorption kinetic was performed in duplicate with a contact time ranging from 0 to 10 h and an initial herbicide concentration of 10 5 mol l 1 with a fixed soils amount of 25 g l 1 adsorption isotherms were carried out in duplicate with concentrations of the herbicide solutions between 10 6 mol l 1 and 10 4 mol l 1 prepared from a stock solution of 5 10 4 mol l 1 25 g soils l 1 the obtained suspensions were mixed at 20 c at the natural ph of the soil for a fixed period of time equal to the equilibrium time previously determined during the kinetic study after agitation the mixture was centrifuged at

analysis xrf the elements corresponding to the investigated soil samples are presented in table 2 analysis of the data indicates that the main elements in the different soils are oxygen calcium silicon aluminum carbon iron magnesium and other impurities the content of the elements calcium silicon aluminium carbon and iron can be correlated to the amount of calcite quartz clay organic matter organic carbon and iron oxide present in the various soils indeed the comparison of calcium content in different specimens generally reveals two types of soil thus laouamra and larache samples present a low calcium content of 4 2 and 5 3 respectively indicating that these soils are low in limestone while the samples of ksar kebir and tlata drissana show a high calcium content of 18 7 and 27 5 respectively suggesting that these soils are rich in limestone 3 1 2 soil ph organic matter content and clay content characterization physical chemical properties of the soils such as clay organic carbon content organic carbon ph and cation exchange capacity are summarized in table 3 particle size analysis revealed that a coarse texture mostly sandy for the majority of soils and that the soils in the ksar kbir and tlata drissana regions have a predominantly silty fraction the clay percentage ranged from 21 3 to 31 9 with soil c recording the highest content of clay percentage 31 9 followed by soil b 26 1 soil d 22 7 and soil a 21 3 the rate of organic matter om limestone in particular showed a great variability between specimens indeed om contents vary from 3 2 to 22 2 depending on the sample the larache and laouamra soils are distinguished by their particular richness in om 22 2 and 9 8 respectively for these two soils these high om contents logically translate into high cation exchange capacities cec 49 4 meq 100 g for larache and 33 0 meq 100 g for laouamra the om contents of the other two soils which are lower between 3 2 and 4 2 are still significant the clay percentage ranged from 21 3 to 31 9 and soil c had the highest content of clay percentage 31 9 followed by soil b soil d 22 7 and soil a 21 3 the results of ph measurement of different soils demonstrate that larache and laouamra samples are neutral soils and tlata drissana and ksar kbir samples are alkaline soils high percentage of limestone in tlata drissana and ksar kbir samples compared to other soils confirm alkaline character of these soils 3 1 3 x ray diffraction xrd analysis a mineralogical analysis of the four soil samples was done by x ray diffraction xrd in order to identify the main constituent phases of the mineral fraction of the soil the obtained diffractograms of soils are depicted in fig 3 these data showed that the dominant peaks correspond to calcite 2θ 36 5 39 6 47 2 48 4 and quartz 2θ 21 5 29 5 50 3 other peaks less intense show the presence of goethite 2θ 21 2 and mineralogical clays more precisely kaolinite 2θ 12 4 and illite 2θ 19 5 tio2 in the rutile 2θ 36 1 and anatase 2θ 25 3 forms are presented but in negligible quantities the analysis of these diffractograms by rietveld refinement led to a quantitative determination of the different constituents of the mineral fraction of the soils the obtained data are reported in table 4 analysis of the data in table 4 shows that the mineral fraction of the soils consists mainly of three phases quartz calcite and clay minerals associated with goethite the classification of the soils according to their total limestone content is confirmed by the xrd analysis in fact the same groups of soils are found this time classified according to the richness of their mineral fraction in calcite in low calcareous soils larache and tlata drissana calcite constitutes less than 11 of the mineral fraction in these soils quartz is the most abundant mineral 50 followed by the clay fraction 36 on average on the other hand in ksar kebir and laouamra soils calcite is the major constituent it represents up to 50 of the fraction finally titanium oxides which are negligible represent only a tiny part of the mineral fraction 2 3 2 removal of herbicide by soils 3 2 1 effect of contact time on adsorption the evolution of imazalil herbicide adsorption using different soils as a function of contact time was evaluated using a constant soil amount 25 g l 1 herbicide concentration 10 5 mol l 1 and temperature 20 c the influence of contact time on the removal of herbicide using soils is presented in fig 4 the uptake amount of imazalil increased significantly with increase in contact time from 0 to 10 h the equilibrium time is different depending on the soil it is about 7 9 9 and 9 h for the soils of larache a laouamra b tlata drissana c and ksar kbir d respectively the obtained data demonstrated that the removal of imazalil from aqueous solutions by different soils was three step kinetic process the first step i corresponds to the transfer of the herbicide molecules from the solution to the external surface of the soil the second stage ii is relatively rapid this step corresponds to the adsorption of the herbicide at the most accessible sites probably located on the outer surfaces of soil particles then in the third stage iii the adsorption of imazalil continues but in a slow manner this limitation of the adsorption rate during the third stage is due to molecular diffusion of the herbicide to less accessible sites such as soil micropores interfoliate spaces in clays and within organic matter the maximum herbicide uptake was observed in soil a cara et al 2017 this may be due to high cation exchange capacity high organic matter and organic carbon contents in the soil singh and cameotra 2013 3 2 2 adsorption kinetic and mechanism studies the adsorption kinetics are essential for evaluating and discussing the mechanism of fixation of the solute on the adsorbent surface and for describing the adsorption rate several models are used in the literature to describe the mechanism in this work the adsorption kinetics of herbicide using the soils were evaluated by pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models el alouani et al 2018 the linear equation of pseudo first order model is expressed as 3 l n q e q t l n q e k 1 t where qt mg g is the adsorption capacity at time t min qe mg g is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium k1

is the intraparticle diffusion constants the kinetic constants and regression coefficients r2 of pseudo first order and pseudo second order models are presented in tables 5 and 6 as shown in table 5 the kinetic data indicated a better fit to the pseudo second order kinetic model with r2 values of 0 97 0 97 0 93 and 0 99 for larache laouamra ksar kebir and tlata drissana soils respectively than to the pseudo first order kinetic model with r2 values of 0 96 0 97 0 89 and 0 94 for larache laouamra ksar kebir and tlata drissana soils respectively in addition the experimental values of adsorption capacity qe exp of pseudo second order model are closer to those of the calculated values of adsorption capacity qe cal these findings showed the adsorption of herbicide using different soils followed the pseudo second order model which indicating that the adsorption mechanism of herbicide using different soils is described by the chemisorption process saufi et al 2020 since pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were insufficient to interpret the mechanism of herbicide adsorption using soils due to its lack of rate limiting step therefore the adsorption kinetic data were evaluated by the intraparticle diffusion model to examine the adsorption mechanism and rate limiting step between adsorbate and adsorbents based on that the intraparticle diffusion model of adsorption of herbicide by different soils is illustrated and proposed in figs 5 and 6 three steps control the proposed adsorption mechanism the first step transfer of herbicide molecules from aqueous solution to the external surface of soils film diffusion second step transfer of herbicide molecules from the external surface of soils into the interior pores of soils intraparticle diffusion and third step adsorption of herbicide molecules onto the interior surface of soils adsorption wang et al 2020 the results show that the pseudo second order model is not the only adsorption step and that the adsorption mechanism is controlled by intraparticle diffusion model in combination with pseudo second order model 3 2 3 imazalil adsorption isotherms imazalil adsorption isotherms on agricultural soils were measured in distinct solutions with initial concentration of herbicide ranging from 10 6 mol l 1 to 10 4 mol l 1 and were evaluated using a constant soil amount 25 g l 1 contact time 10 h and temperature 20 c the obtained data are shown in fig 7 as seen when the imazalil herbicide concentration on equilibrium ce increase imazalil herbicide uptake capability of soils increase qe indicating the initial imazalil concentration was a driving force in adsorption process el alouani et al 2019a however based on the curve obtained it can be seen that the saturation of the soil surface has not been reached yet to assess the interaction mechanism between the adsorbent soils and adsorbate imazalil herbicide system at equilibrium various adsorption isotherm models are utilized el alouani et al 2019b el alouani et al 2018 in this work the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm equations were used to evaluate the experimental data the linear expression of the langmuir

correlation coefficients values r2 of the langmuir freundlich and temkin model parameters calculated from equations for all soils the correlation coefficients values r2 obtained from langmuir and freundlich models were greater than those from temkin model these results indicate that the adsorption isotherms of the herbicide on soils were best described by the langmuir and freundlich models over the herbicide concentration range tested which suggests that homogeneous and heterogeneous active sites existed on the surface of the soils and adsorption of herbicide was monolayer and multilayer adsorption prakash et al 2010 the all soils showed non liner isotherm n 1 which revealed that herbicide pollutant could adsorb to the organic matter the clay fraction and organic carbon present in the different soils singh and cameotra 2013 similar results were achieved by albarrán et al for the sorption of simazine on soils albarrán et al 2004 and krutz et al for the adsorption of desethylatrazine atrazine hydroxyatrazine and deisopropylatrazine on vegetated filter strip and cultivated soil krutz et al 2003 3 3 determination of distribution coefficient soils distribution coefficients kd is very important parameters for evaluating the infinity and distribution of herbicide and pesticide molecules in soil particles this distribution coefficient was studied to elucidate the infinity of herbicide distribution in the studied soils the adsorption distribution coefficients kd were calculated as eq 9 9 k d q e c e the adsorption coefficient kd was also determined as a function of the organic matter om and organic carbon oc content of the soil according to equations 10 and 11 respectively 10 k o m k d o m 100 11 k o c k d o c 100 the calculated distribution coefficients for the imazalil herbicide soils system are summarized in table 8 the obtained kd values are classified the soils into two groups according to their affinity for imazalil on the one hand larache and laouamra soils show a relatively high affinity for the herbicide with the highest kd values in this group adsorption decreases significantly in the following order kd larache kd laouamra which is in line with the decrease in om content 22 2 and 9 8 respectively and oc 12 9 and 5 7 respectively content in these soils table 2 recall that these two soils were classified as low in limestone 8 on average on the other hand tlata drissana and ksar kbir soils show relatively low affinities with kd of the same order of magnitude 2 7 and 4 1 l kg 1 om content varying between 3 2 and 4 2 and oc content ranging 1 9 and 2 4 respectively on the other hand these soils have significantly higher levels of limestone 49 6 for ksar kbir soil and 70 4 for tlata drissana soil than those in the first group these results demonstrate that soil with high organic matter organic carbon content and low limestone content exhibited better imazalil herbicide adsorption capacity 4 conclusion this current research contributes to the understanding of the imazalil herbicide adsorption process by four types of agricultural soils from different regions of morocco the removal of herbicide using soils was dependent of contact time and initial herbicide concentration the increase in contact time and herbicide concentration of the solution had a positive influence on the adsorption process the adsorption kinetic data were well correlated to the pseudo second order model and the adsorption mechanism is controlled by intraparticle diffusion model the isotherm studies revealed that the adsorption of herbicide contaminant is better described by langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the soil was high in organic carbon and organic matter with a better distribution coefficient suggesting the infinity for herbicide adsorption the findings of this study could help in designing of efficient imazalil herbicide management approach in larache laouamra tlata drissana and ksar kbir
