structural parameters 1 introduction in recent years urban waterlogging has occurred frequently in china which has caused serious casualties and economic losses urban waterlogging has become one of the major problems in the process of urbanization for example from 2010 to 2015 waterlogging had occurred in more than 300 large and medium sized cities in china on july 21 2012 a stormy weather hit beijing with mountain floods and mudslides in the suburban districts led to traffic congestion and killed 79 people which caused an economic loss of 11 64 billion rmb lu et al 2017 2018 xu et al 2020 waterlogging caused the river channel to be blocked for which it is necessary to clean up the silt and dredge the river channel generally the sediments deposited on the bottom of the river is turned into muddy mud by means of traditional mechanical equipment such as dredger wang et al 2019 the sediments flow away with the water in the river however there are some disadvantages existed in the method 1 manual work is generally employed to dredge in the recessing culverts the labor intensity of manual work in the sludge is high most people cannot bear that especially in the rainstorm weather which may be life threatening 2 the width of the urban inland river is limited which brings great difficulties to the dredger construction due to its large volume c zhang et al 2020 the uutb is a necessary equipment for dredging the inland river channel and removing the sediments on the river bed which is supposed to excavate dredge and fill in the constructions ding et al 2020 the uutb is affected by the water depth and waves on the surface of the water wu 2019 the sediments on the river bed have poor shear characteristics and weak bearing capacity the traditional wheel underwater bulldozers are prone to sag and slip on the sediments due to its excessive ground pressure and insufficient adhesion when it is working on the river bed shi et al 2020 the uutb has strong maneuverability and good trafficability which can significantly improve its traction performance tang et al 2019 the traction force is generated by the mechanical interaction between the uutb track and the sediment while it is operating on the river bed zhang et al 2019 moreover the sediment sinkage will be caused by the vertical load of the uutb which increases the resistance of the uutb it is necessary to improve the pass ability of the uutb with proper track structural parameter li et al 2020 at present many scholars have done lots of research on the influence of the traction performance of tracked vehicle operating on the deep sea bed herzog et al 2007 analyzed the operating performance of tracked mining vehicle based on the laboratory measured mechanical properties of seabed sediment wang et al 2016a b proposed soft plastic shear force displacement sps model based on the existing shear displacement empirical model and verified the model on the test platform li et al 2020 improved the problem of track slip by installing the track grouser on the track obliquely to investigate the mechanical characteristics of the soft sediment on the bottom of the polymetallic nodule mining area li 2020 conducted a soil trough shear test in the laboratory to simulate the mechanical properties of the soft bottom sediment as a result a shear model of soft sediment was established and the traction force under different track grouser height was obtained based on the experimental data however the model and qualitative description of the mechanical relationship between the height of the tracked grouser and traction force are not given yang et al 2013 have studied that the propulsion performance and passing capacity of the tracked vehicle can be improved by changing the track structure without the change of ground pressure by which it is an effective way to ensure the reliable operation yang et al 2014 analyzed the ratio between the track length the track width and the track grouser height when the tracked vehicle generates the maximum traction force li et al 2017 obtained the variation rule of traction performance under different structural parameters of the track the variation rule provided test basis for the track structure optimization and the improvement of improving the overall traction performance of the tracked vehicle xu and wu 2012 studied the influence of the track grouser height on the traction performance of the tracked mining vehicle and determined the height of track grouser to optimize the operating mechanism of the mining vehicle based on the shear displacement and stress model the driving force generated by the track and the soft sediment as well as the adhesion model of the mining machine were constructed in addition they studied the influence of the height of the track grouser on the traction performance of the mining vehicle the difference of track structural parameters have great effects to the track performance while the uutb is operating on the bed of the inland river ahmad et al 2020 however current research mainly focus on the mechanical properties between the track and the soft sediments there is few studies on the relationship between the track structure and traction performance especially the interaction properties from the perspective of track shoes structure and geometric parameters the contribution of this paper is to reveal the properties between the track structure and the traction performance of the uutb with different track length width and grouser height the curve of the resistance traction force and the slip ratio are obtained which provides dynamics reference for the operation and anti slip control of the uutb the paper is organized as follows first in section 2 different track structure are presented and the force of different track structural parameters are analysied by theoretical in section 3 the mechanics of track terrain interaction are discussed after that the experimental verification and analysis are detailed presented in section 4 besides the test platform is established and the experimental results are also presented and discussed section 5 is devoted to the conclusions of the work 2 track structural parameters analysis 2 1 force analysis with different track shape the traction force of uutb on the soft sediment is not only affected by the contact soft sediment but also by the structural parameters of the track wang et al 2020 the structural parameters of the track mainly include length width and grouser height yang et al 2015 there are lots of differences in the track shape for different equipment the π shaped track t shaped track and v shaped track are studied in this paper the force analysis of the t shaped track on the sediment is shown in fig 1 where w is the vertical load implemented on the track shoes p 1 is the force implemented by the sediment on the track shoes p 2 is the stress implemented on the track grouser l h and d are the length height and thickness of the track shoes respectively i is the shear displacement of track z is the sinkage displacement of the track shoes f max is the maximum traction force produced by the sediment according to the first law of newton the load on the vertical direction can be expressed as follows yin et al 2020 1 w p 1 d b p 2 l d l b where b is the length of track shoes according to the pressure settlement theory of bekker 1956 the force implemented on the track can be described as follows 2 p 1 k c b k h z φ n 3 p 2 k c b k φ z n where k c and k ϕ are the viscous deformation modulus of sediment and the friction deformation modulus of sediment respectively n is the sediment deformation index z is the sinkage displacement therefore the driving resistance caused by the sinkage is expressed as follows sun et al 2014 4 r d l b 0 z h p 1 d z 1 d l b 0 z p 2 d z assuming that the resistance coefficient is f the driving resistance also can be expressed as r wf substituting r wf into eq 4 the driving resistance coefficient can be expressed as follows 5 f k c b k φ n 1 w d l z h n 1 l d l z n 1 the three track shoes are analyzed in this paper have different shape considering the effect of track grouser the empirical formula of maximum traction force generated by the sediment can be described as follows ding et al 2020 6 f max b l c 1 2 h b w tan ϕ 1 0 64 h b arctan h b where c is the cohesion of the sediment ϕ is the internal friction angle of the sediment for the track of the v shaped the width of the track grouser can be equivalent to d according to the middle line of trapezoidal the stress on the surface of the track can be divided into p 1 and p 2 respectively therefore for the v shaped track the equivalent width of grouser can be estimated as follow 7 d d l d 2 d l 2 substituting into eq 5 can be obtained that 8 f k c b k φ n 1 w l d l d z h n 1 2 d l d z n 1 to study the influence of track structure parameters on mechanical properties between the track and soft sediment the parameter of the sediment and track are shown in the table 1 the value of sediment cohesion and the internal friction angle of sediment are obtained by a rapid direct shear test before experiment the values of the viscous deformation modulus of sediment the friction deformation modulus of sediment and sediment deformation index are referenced from wang et al 2017 the width of track shoes employed in our work is also listed in table 1 supposed that the total weight of uutb is 8t under the water tang et al 2019 the relationship among the track structural parameters the driving resistance coefficient and the maximum traction force are shown in fig 2 a figs 2 b and 3 a and fig 3 b respectively the track grouser of π shaped and t shaped track are rectangular the influence of track structural parameter on the traction force can be reflected by the grouser thickness and track length for π shaped and t shaped track the driving resistance coefficient can be calculation by eq 4 the difference of π shaped and t shaped track is thickness of the track shoes but they have the same equation of driving resistance coefficient as is shown in fig 2 a for the π shaped and t shaped track the driving resistance coefficient is positively correlated with the length change but negatively correlated with the height change it can be seen from the steepness of the variation that the track height has a greater influence on the driving resistance coefficient than the track length as is shown in fig 2 b for the π shaped and t shaped track the maximum traction force generated by sediment is positively correlated with the track length and track grouser height it can be seen from the variation trend that the track height has a greater influence on the maximum traction force produced by sediment than the track length for the v shaped track the driving resistance coefficient can be calculation by eq 8 which determines that it is different from π shaped and t shaped track as is shown in fig 3 a the driving resistance coefficient of the v shaped track is positively correlated with the length change but negatively correlated with the height change from the perspective of the steepness of the variation the grouser height has less influence on the driving resistance coefficient than the track length as shown in fig 3 b for the v shaped track shoes the maximum traction force generated by sediment is positively correlated with the track length and the track height from the variation trend the influence of the grouser height on the maximum traction force generated by sediment is smaller than that of the track length the v shaped track presents better mechanical properties than the π shaped track and t shaped track 2 2 track structural parameters the above mentioned three tracks with different structure investigated in this paper were processed to clearly reveal the influence of track structural parameter on the traction performance different track length width and grouser height are configured for π shaped track t shaped track and v shaped track respectively the tracks with different structural parameters employed in this paper are shown in fig 4 the track structural parameters are shown as table 2 table 3 and table 4 respectively 2 3 configured sediment to study the influence of structural parameters of different track on mechanical properties it is necessary to ensure that the sediment properties remain unchanged the configured sediment is mainly using bentonite sand and water the above mentioned materials were mixed with each other under a certain proportion before the experiment a rapid direct shear test was performed to obtain the mechanical properties of the testing sediment yang et al 2018 the testing results are shown in fig 5 supposing that the fitting equation shown in fig 5 can be expressed as y kx b according the test datas some connected coefficients are obtained as follows 9 b k c k tan k ϕ through further analysis and fitting the sediment cohesion of the modulated soil was obtained the value of kc is 9 61 kpa and the value of kϕ is 4 12 3 mechanics of track terrain interaction the traction force adhesion force and braking force are transmitted to the uutb through the interaction between the track and the sediment on the riverbed those force are necessary for the operation of the uutb the traction force and driving resistance directly affect the maneuverability of the uutb zhao et al 2020 the force between the uutb and the sediment is not only affected by the mechanical properties of the soft sediments but also has great relationship with the track structure the structural parameters of track play an essential role in improving the traction force between the uutb and the sediment the force implemented on one side track of the uutb while it is operating on the sediment of the river bed is shown in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 6 that the force implemented on one side track of the uutb mainly includes the maximum traction force generated by the sediment the driving resistance the water resistance and the operating resistance the water resistance and the operating resistance are mainly determined by the river water density the volume of uutb the area facing water and the bulldozer structure which have few relationships with the track structural parameters in this paper the variation of mechanical characteristic caused by the track structural parameters was mainly analyzed 3 1 traction force analysis according to the terramechanics theory of tracked vehicle the effective traction force of the uutb is the difference between the maximum traction force caused by the sediment the driving resistance and the water resistance jin et al 2019 which can be expressed as follows 10 m t x 2 f t 2 r d r b f w to research the influence of track structural parameters on traction performance the force implemented on the uutb is simplified supposing that the force center of all direction coincides with the geometric center of the uutb besides the contact specific pressure between the track on both side of tracks of the uutb uniformly distributed the tangential traction of on one side track of the uutb can be expressed as follows wang et al 2017 11 f t k p m k w 2 i 2 l h e i 2 l h k w 2 c p m 2 2 c p m 1 1 2 c p

the uutb is related to the slip rate i track shoes width b s track grouser height h and the ground contact length l h of the uutb c pm is the correction factor of soft plastic deformation loss in the peak zone c pr is the correction factor of friction deformation loss in the residual stress zone k pm is the adjustment factor in peak zone k pr is the adjustment factor in the residual stress zone k w is the shear displacement when the maximum shear stress occurs τ max is the maximum shear stress and τ res is the residual shear stress dai et al 2020 the value of these parameters was determined in the experiment of the shear stress shear displacement the coefficient k w τ max and τ res can be obtained from the experimental data and the coefficient c pm c pr k pm k pr are obtained by fitting the experiment data for the shear characteristics of the flexible and plastic soil the theoretical model is shown in fig 7 the shear force and shear displacement will be caused by the interaction force between the track and sediment when the uutb is operating on the inland riverbed miao et al 2020 the curve of shear force and shear displacement places an essential role to characterize the shear strength of the sediment many researchers have investigated the shear properties with different sediment li and li 2010 proposed their own model respectively wang proposed a new empirical model named soft plastic soil shear spss model for saturated soft plastic soil wang et al 2016a b the empirical model can be used to test the mechanical properties of seafloor soil the model can be presented the relationship between shear force and displacement it is modelled based on the maximum shear force the shear displacement at the maximum shear force the residual shear force respectively chen et al 2018 the relationship between the sharing force and the shear displacement can be obtained as follows 12 τ k p m e s k ω c p m 2 1 c p m 2 τ max k p r e s k ω c p r 2 1 c p r 2 τ r e s where s is the shear displacement 3 2 resistance analysis the effective traction force of the uutb is mainly affected by the following factors such as the maximum traction force generated by the sediment the driving resistance the water resistance and the operating resistance respectively to simplify the calculation of load the climbing resistance and acceleration resistance are ignored the compaction resistance the bulldozing resistance and the water resistance are calculated the maximum traction force and driving resistance studied in this paper are related to the structural parameters of track 3 2 1 compaction resistance the uutb sinks when it is operating on the sediment due to its weight according to the properties of the resistance the compaction resistance can be divided into static subsidence resistance caused by sediment deformation and slip subsidence resistance caused by deep subsidence during the shear sliding of the track wang et al 2019 the static pressure subsidence resistance is equivalent to the work done by the track with the same pressure the static pressure subsidence resistance can be expressed as follows reshma et al 2015 13 r s b s n 1 k c b s k φ 1 n p w n 1 n the slip subsidence resistance can be obtained by equivalent resistance according to the empirical formula of slip subsidence resistance proposed by reece reece 1965 the equation of slip subsidence resistance is presented as follows 14 r i p w b s h i 1 i the vertical equivalent load of single side track is fixed when the ground pressure distribution is uniform which can be expressed as p w g sw a bekker 1956 the compaction resistance can be obtained as follows 15 r d b s n 1 k c b s 1 n p w n 1 n p w b s h i 1 i 1 n 1 g s w k c 2 l h k φ a 1 n h i 1 i g s w 2 l h where g sw is vertical equivalent load of single track a is the area of track contract ground 3 2 2 bulldozing resistance the bulldozing resistance shown in fig 8 is similar with the horizontal component acting on the vertical retaining wall the passive soil pressure theory of rankine can be adopted for the bulldozing resistance calculation rankine et al 2013 the equation of the bulldozing resistance is presented as follows 16 r b 1 2 k p y γ s b s p w k c b s k φ 1 n h i 1 i 2 c k p c b s p w k c b s k φ 1 n h i 1 i where k py and k pc are the constant coefficient related to internal friction angle of soil respectively γ s is the soil weight the bulldozer resistance is determined by the structural parameters of the uutb and the physical properties of the soft sediment the relevant parameters are shown in the table 1 3 2 3 water resistance the water flowing force will have blocking effect on the uutb while it is operating under water chang et al 2019 the water resistance is mainly related to the water density the volume the facing water area and the operating speed of the uutb according to the fluid dynamics theory the water resistance can be calculated as follows guerrero et al 2020 17 f w 1 2 ρ v m a f v w x 2 c d where ρ is the water density a f is the projection area of the uutb on the vertical axis v m is the total volume of the uutb v wx is the relative speed of the bulldozer and seawater supposing that the speed of the bulldozer is set at 0 5 m s and the speed of the water in the river is set at 0 15 m s c d is the coefficient of water resistance 3 2 4 operation resistance for operation resistance f r of bulldozing blade it is composed of cutting resistance f 1 pushing resistance f 2 blade and soil friction resistance f 3 respectively the operation resistance can be obtained as follows wang and sun 2014 18 f r f 1 f 2 f 3 the force of the bulldozing blade is analyzed and shown in fig 9 the cutting resistance the pushing resistance and the soil friction resistance can be respectively expressed as follows 19 f 1 10 6 b 1 h p k b 20 f 2 g t u 1 cos α b 1 h h p 2 γ u 1 cos α k m 2 tan α 0 k s 21 f 3 10 6 b 1 x u 2 k y combining the eq 19 eq 20 and eq 21 the operation resistance can be rewritten as follows 22 f r 10 6 b 1 h p k b b 1 h h p 2 γ u 1 cos α k m 2 tan α 0 k s 10 6 b 1 x u 2 k y where b 1 is the width of the bulldozing blade h p is the cutting depth of the bulldozing blade k b is the cutting specific damping g t is the volume of the mound before the bulldozing blade k s is the loose coefficient of soil k m is the filling coefficient of soil

natural slope angle of the soil k y is the specific resistance of the cutting edge to the soil after the cutting edge is worn out 3 3 effective traction force the effective traction force is supposed to propel the uutb while it is operating on the soft sediment of the inland river which can be expressed as follows 23 f 2 f t 2 r d r b f w f r the effective traction of the uutb is mainly affected by the maximum soil thrust f t the bulldozing resistance r d and the compaction resistance r b caused by the change of track structural parameters respectively liang et al 2020 4 experimental verification and discussions 4 1 test bench setup in this paper the experiment of traction force characteristics of the uutb is carried out in a soil tank to simulate the interaction force between the track and sediment as is shown in fig 10 the experiment platform mainly consists of sediment tank and the traction system the mixture of bentonite sand and water is configured in a certain ratio to simulate the sediment which is employed as soft clay with plasticity cohesion and thixotropy li et al 2021 the sediment should be soaked in the water to simulate the real sediment on the inland riverbed the sediment should be left at least 24 h after each testing to ensure the pressure and shear force distribute evenly as is shown in fig 10 the traction system is driven by the motor after that the unit of transverse shear stress producing starts to work the tension line is pulled by the motor the track shoes are pulled by tension line to generate transverse shear stress on the sediment to simulate the pressure of the tracked vehicle on the ground the displacement sensor and the force sensor transmit the shear stress and shear displacement to the computer then the curve of the shear stress and displacement can be presented 4 2 experimental principle as is shown in fig 11 and fig 12 the experiment was carried out in the soil tank a certain depth of sediment was laid in the tank a track shoe is placed on the surface of the sediment the pressure is loaded on the track to simulate ground pressure when the track is depressing on the sediment the traction line fixed on the test soil tank drives the track grouser to shear the sediment the relationship between the shear force and the shear displacement is obtained by the displacement sensor and the tension sensor the schematic diagram of the shear force and shear displacement is shown in fig 11 the traction experiment is shown in fig 12 the track grouser will pierce into the sediment when the uutb is driving during which the horizontally compressed track is filled with the sediment the sediment is restricted by the upper of the track the track grouser and the lower compacted sediment for which the sediment inside the track grouser is compacted and squeezed to both sides the track will move forward against the resistance of the sediment with a vertical downward load and forward force produced by a traction motor three different tracks are tested in this paper 4 3 experimental scheme in this paper the relationship between the shear stress and the shear displacement was measured and analyzed quantitatively with different track structural parameters in the experiment 27 groups of effective and relatively reliable experimental data were obtained the experimental results often affected by some human factors which including 1 the center of gravity of the counterweight plate and experimental track shoes should be controlled on the same line in each testing 2 at the end of each experiment the soil is sheared and damaged the artificial restoration of the soil is different which will cause the change of soil mechanical properties in the next experiment 3 in the process of each shear experiment the depth of the track shoes pressed into the soil is different to eliminate the influence caused by the above mentioned human factors on the experimental results three testing were conducted on each track besides the following aspects should be noted to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data 1 the lateral displacement sensor and tension sensor should be demarcated before the experiment those sensors connected with the lms scadas data acquisition module and the experimental data can be obtained 2 during the experiment the speed of the traction motor was adjusted to 2000r min to ensure the traction force received by each track shoes unchanged 3 the smooth curve of shear force and shear displacement was selected among the three testing data the smoother the curve the fewer abnormal values in the data 4 4 shear force shear displacement testing results according to the changes of track shoes length track shoes width and track grouser height the track of each form was put into the same group for comparative analysis the shear empirical model soft plastic soil shear model in eq 11 is employed to fit the experimental data wang et al 2017 the experiment results have shown in fig 13 fig 14 and fig 15 respectively as is shown in figs 13 a 14 a and 15 a in terms of the track length the shear stress of π shaped track and t shaped track increases with the length however the shear stress of v shaped track decreases with the increase of track length the increasing of the length of the π shaped track and t shaped track has led to the increase of soil content between the grousers while the decrease of soil content of v shaped track it can be seen from figs 13 b 14 b and 15 b in terms of the track width the shear stress of π shaped track is the largest at the value of 500 mm the smallest value is 450 mm the middle value is 400 mm the shear stress influence by width shows no obvious rules the shear stress of t shaped track shows a trend of rising first and then falling which indicates that an optimal value of track width is exists between 400 mm and 520 mm the shear stress of v shaped track decreases when the track width increases which indicates that the optimal value of track width should not exceed 500 mm as is shown in figs 13 c 14 c and 15 c in terms of the track grouser height the shear stress of π shaped track rises first and then falls the result indicates that an optimal value of track grouser height is exists around 30 mm the shear stress of t shaped track decreases with the increase of track grouser height which indicates that the optimal value should not be larger than 60 mm the shear stress of v shaped track increases slightly with the increase of track grouser height while the residual shear stress has no obvious change it can be seen from figs 13 fig 14 and fig 15 that the sheer force of π shaped track t shaped track and v shaped track are different the shear stress produced by π shaped track is larger and the maximum shear stress appears at the early time while the shear stress produced by v shaped track is relatively small and the maximum shear stress appears later according to the experimental results of shear force and shear displacement the v shaped track have the least damage to the soil the v shaped track is more suitable for the tracked vehicles driving on soft sediments of the river or sea bed than the π shaped track and t shaped track according to the experimental data the fitting value of the correlation coefficient in the empirical formula are presented in table 5 table 6 and table 7 respectively 4 5 traction force slip ratio results substituting the fitting coefficient into the eq 12 the rule of track tangential traction force can be obtained as showed in fig 16 fig 17 and fig 18 respectively as it can be seen from the traction force and slip ratio curve in figs 16 17 and 18 the optimal value of slip ratio should be less than 20 it shows that the slip ratio should be controlled less than a certain value to ensure the traction performance of uutb we can see from figs 16 figs 17 and 18 the best value of slip ratio is about 7 fig 16 shows that the traction force produced by the π shaped track is proportional to the increase of track length width and grouser height the curve of traction slip rate is easily affected by the track width fig 17 shows that the traction force generated by the t shaped track is proportional to the increase of track length width and grouser height the curve of traction slip rate is easily affected by the track length fig 18 shows that the traction force produced by the v shaped track is proportional to the increase of track length width and grouser height the curve of traction slip rate is easily affected by the track width for traction force of different tracks it can be found that the track width has the greatest influence on π shaped track and v shaped track the track length has great influence on the t shaped track the track grouser height has the greatest influence than track width and length on traction force for t shaped track the traction force of t shaped track can be greatly affected by the track structural parameters while the π shaped track can be less affected by that 4 6 influence of dynamic characteristics according to the fitting results in section 4 4 seven mechanical characteristic parameters of three different structure shape of track shoes are obtained as is shown in table 8 since the length of the track constitutes of the grounding length of the track the track width and the grouser height are mainly considered when studying the mechanical properties of uutb substituting the datas in table 8 into the formula of tangent traction force compaction resistance bulldozer resistance and effective traction force the relationship was shown in the fig 19 fig 20 fig 21 and fig 22 respectively it can be seen from eq 17 that the parameters of track are independent of water resistance as a result the water resistance in this part can be seen as a decision value assuming that the intake density is 1 02 g cm3 the water resistance coefficient is 0 6 the upstream area is 5 98m 2 and the effective length of the vehicle body is 5m yan et al 2020 assuming that the underwater speed of uutb is 0 4 m s and the water speed is 0 2 m s substituting this value into eq 17 the value of water resistance is obtained with the value of 2 1885n as is shown in figs 19 20 21 and 22 the slip ratio of the three different surfaces from top to bottom is 3 6 and 9 respectively the results show that the lower of the slip ratio the lower of the maximum soil thrust and effective traction as is shown in figs 20 and 21 the slip ratio of the three different surfaces from bottom to top is 3 6 and 9 respectively the results show that the compaction resistance and bulldozing resistance increases with the increasing of slip ratio respectively the increase of slip ratio will lead to the decreasing of traction force therefore in practical application the slip ratio of the uutb should be controlled as much as possible the results in fig 19 show that the maximum traction force increases with the track width and grouser height for the π shaped track and v shaped track the influence of track width on the maximum traction force is more obvious than that of track grouser height for the t shaped track the track grouser height has more obvious influence on the maximum traction force than that of the track width the results shown in figs 20 and 21 indicate that the variation of the track structural parameters has a greater influence on the compaction resistance and the bulldozing resistance than traction force the track width has more influence on the compaction resistance and the bulldozing resistance than the grouser height the compaction resistance and the bulldozing resistance will increase rapidly with the track width however the compaction resistance and the bulldozing resistance do not change with the track grouser height the results in fig 22 show that the effective traction force will increase with the track width and track grouser height the influence of track width of π shaped track and v shaped track on the maximum soil thrust is more obvious than the track grouser height the influence of track grouser height of t shaped track on the maximum traction force is more obvious than that of the track width compared with the three types of track shoes with different structures the track grouser height of the π shaped track and t shaped track have greater effect on the maximum traction force than that of the track length the length of v shaped track has a greater influence on traction force than that of the track grouser height it is indicated that the v shaped track has a shallower settlement depth the mechanical properties of uutb are determined by the track structural parameters the π shaped track is stable and less affected by the track length width and grouser height the mechanical properties of the t shaped track are easily affected by its structural parameters above all it can be concluded that the v shaped track and π shaped track are more suitable for practical application than t shaped track due to its superior mechanical properties 5 conclusions the problems such as poor maneuverability and insufficient adhesion between the track and soft sediments always exist while the uutb is operating on the soft sediments of the river bed this paper mainly focuses on the optimization of the track structural parameters and the influence of track structural parameters on mechanical properties the research results obtained in this paper are as follows 1 the mechanical properties of track shoes mainly depend on its structural parameters the track with large structural parameters leads to large maximum traction force and driving resistance the shear efficiency of track shoes can be reflected by the shear stress 2 the width of π shaped track shoes has greater influence on mechanical properties than its length and grouser height which should be mainly considered for its structural parameter optimization the grouser height of t shaped track has great influence on mechanical properties than its length and width which should be mainly considered for its structural parameter optimization the length and width have greater influence than its grouser height 3 the structural parameters of track shoes should provide enough traction force with soft sediment while the uutb is operating on river bed the structural parameters of v shaped track shoes have less effect on the maximum traction force than the π shaped track and t shaped track the v shaped track shoes also have short vertical sinkage displacement under the same pitch and sinkage pressure moreover the length of v shaped track can be increased to provide more maximum traction force the dynamics of uutb while it is operating on the river bed is not only affected by the track structural parameters but also influenced by the underwater environment future work will focus on the effect of sediments with different particle size on

structural parameters 1 introduction in recent years urban waterlogging has occurred frequently in china which has caused serious casualties and economic losses urban waterlogging has become one of the major problems in the process of urbanization for example from 2010 to 2015 waterlogging had occurred in more than 300 large and medium sized cities in china on july 21 2012 a stormy weather hit beijing with mountain floods and mudslides in the suburban districts led to traffic congestion and killed 79 people which caused an economic loss of 11 64 billion rmb lu et al 2017 2018 xu et al 2020 waterlogging caused the river channel to be blocked for which it is necessary to clean up the silt and dredge the river channel generally the sediments deposited on the bottom of the river is turned into muddy mud by means of traditional mechanical equipment such as dredger wang et al 2019 the sediments flow away with the water in the river however there are some disadvantages existed in the method 1 manual work is generally employed to dredge in the recessing culverts the labor intensity of manual work in the sludge is high most people cannot bear that especially in the rainstorm weather which may be life threatening 2 the width of the urban inland river is limited which brings great difficulties to the dredger construction due to its large volume c zhang et al 2020 the uutb is a necessary equipment for dredging the inland river channel and removing the sediments on the river bed which is supposed to excavate dredge and fill in the constructions ding et al 2020 the uutb is affected by the water depth and waves on the surface of the water wu 2019 the sediments on the river bed have poor shear characteristics and weak bearing capacity the traditional wheel underwater bulldozers are prone to sag and slip on the sediments due to its excessive ground pressure and insufficient adhesion when it is working on the river bed shi et al 2020 the uutb has strong maneuverability and good trafficability which can significantly improve its traction performance tang et al 2019 the traction force is generated by the mechanical interaction between the uutb track and the sediment while it is operating on the river bed zhang et al 2019 moreover the sediment sinkage will be caused by the vertical load of the uutb which increases the resistance of the uutb it is necessary to improve the pass ability of the uutb with proper track structural parameter li et al 2020 at present many scholars have done lots of research on the influence of the traction performance of tracked vehicle operating on the deep sea bed herzog et al 2007 analyzed the operating performance of tracked mining vehicle based on the laboratory measured mechanical properties of seabed sediment wang et al 2016a b proposed soft plastic shear force displacement sps model based on the existing shear displacement empirical model and verified the model on the test platform li et al 2020 improved the problem of track slip by installing the track grouser on the track obliquely to investigate the mechanical characteristics of the soft sediment on the bottom of the polymetallic nodule mining area li 2020 conducted a soil trough shear test in the laboratory to simulate the mechanical properties of the soft bottom sediment as a result a shear model of soft sediment was established and the traction force under different track grouser height was obtained based on the experimental data however the model and qualitative description of the mechanical relationship between the height of the tracked grouser and traction force are not given yang et al 2013 have studied that the propulsion performance and passing capacity of the tracked vehicle can be improved by changing the track structure without the change of ground pressure by which it is an effective way to ensure the reliable operation yang et al 2014 analyzed the ratio between the track length the track width and the track grouser height when the tracked vehicle generates the maximum traction force li et al 2017 obtained the variation rule of traction performance under different structural parameters of the track the variation rule provided test basis for the track structure optimization and the improvement of improving the overall traction performance of the tracked vehicle xu and wu 2012 studied the influence of the track grouser height on the traction performance of the tracked mining vehicle and determined the height of track grouser to optimize the operating mechanism of the mining vehicle based on the shear displacement and stress model the driving force generated by the track and the soft sediment as well as the adhesion model of the mining machine were constructed in addition they studied the influence of the height of the track grouser on the traction performance of the mining vehicle the difference of track structural parameters have great effects to the track performance while the uutb is operating on the bed of the inland river ahmad et al 2020 however current research mainly focus on the mechanical properties between the track and the soft sediments there is few studies on the relationship between the track structure and traction performance especially the interaction properties from the perspective of track shoes structure and geometric parameters the contribution of this paper is to reveal the properties between the track structure and the traction performance of the uutb with different track length width and grouser height the curve of the resistance traction force and the slip ratio are obtained which provides dynamics reference for the operation and anti slip control of the uutb the paper is organized as follows first in section 2 different track structure are presented and the force of different track structural parameters are analysied by theoretical in section 3 the mechanics of track terrain interaction are discussed after that the experimental verification and analysis are detailed presented in section 4 besides the test platform is established and the experimental results are also presented and discussed section 5 is devoted to the conclusions of the work 2 track structural parameters analysis 2 1 force analysis with different track shape the traction force of uutb on the soft sediment is not only affected by the contact soft sediment but also by the structural parameters of the track wang et al 2020 the structural parameters of the track mainly include length width and grouser height yang et al 2015 there are lots of differences in the track shape for different equipment the π shaped track t shaped track and v shaped track are studied in this paper the force analysis of the t shaped track on the sediment is shown in fig 1 where w is the vertical load implemented on the track shoes p 1 is the force implemented by the sediment on the track shoes p 2 is the stress implemented on the track grouser l h and d are the length height and thickness of the track shoes respectively i is the shear displacement of track z is the sinkage displacement of the track shoes f max is the maximum traction force produced by the sediment according to the first law of newton the load on the vertical direction can be expressed as follows yin et al 2020 1 w p 1 d b p 2 l d l b where b is the length of track shoes according to the pressure settlement theory of bekker 1956 the force implemented on the track can be described as follows 2 p 1 k c b k h z φ n 3 p 2 k c b k φ z n where k c and k ϕ are the viscous deformation modulus of sediment and the friction deformation modulus of sediment respectively n is the sediment deformation index z is the sinkage displacement therefore the driving resistance caused by the sinkage is expressed as follows sun et al 2014 4 r d l b 0 z h p 1 d z 1 d l b 0 z p 2 d z assuming that the resistance coefficient is f the driving resistance also can be expressed as r wf substituting r wf into eq 4 the driving resistance coefficient can be expressed as follows 5 f k c b k φ n 1 w d l z h n 1 l d l z n 1 the three track shoes are analyzed in this paper have different shape considering the effect of track grouser the empirical formula of maximum traction force generated by the sediment can be described as follows ding et al 2020 6 f max b l c 1 2 h b w tan ϕ 1 0 64 h b arctan h b where c is the cohesion of the sediment ϕ is the internal friction angle of the sediment for the track of the v shaped the width of the track grouser can be equivalent to d according to the middle line of trapezoidal the stress on the surface of the track can be divided into p 1 and p 2 respectively therefore for the v shaped track the equivalent width of grouser can be estimated as follow 7 d d l d 2 d l 2 substituting into eq 5 can be obtained that 8 f k c b k φ n 1 w l d l d z h n 1 2 d l d z n 1 to study the influence of track structure parameters on mechanical properties between the track and soft sediment the parameter of the sediment and track are shown in the table 1 the value of sediment cohesion and the internal friction angle of sediment are obtained by a rapid direct shear test before experiment the values of the viscous deformation modulus of sediment the friction deformation modulus of sediment and sediment deformation index are referenced from wang et al 2017 the width of track shoes employed in our work is also listed in table 1 supposed that the total weight of uutb is 8t under the water tang et al 2019 the relationship among the track structural parameters the driving resistance coefficient and the maximum traction force are shown in fig 2 a figs 2 b and 3 a and fig 3 b respectively the track grouser of π shaped and t shaped track are rectangular the influence of track structural parameter on the traction force can be reflected by the grouser thickness and track length for π shaped and t shaped track the driving resistance coefficient can be calculation by eq 4 the difference of π shaped and t shaped track is thickness of the track shoes but they have the same equation of driving resistance coefficient as is shown in fig 2 a for the π shaped and t shaped track the driving resistance coefficient is positively correlated with the length change but negatively correlated with the height change it can be seen from the steepness of the variation that the track height has a greater influence on the driving resistance coefficient than the track length as is shown in fig 2 b for the π shaped and t shaped track the maximum traction force generated by sediment is positively correlated with the track length and track grouser height it can be seen from the variation trend that the track height has a greater influence on the maximum traction force produced by sediment than the track length for the v shaped track the driving resistance coefficient can be calculation by eq 8 which determines that it is different from π shaped and t shaped track as is shown in fig 3 a the driving resistance coefficient of the v shaped track is positively correlated with the length change but negatively correlated with the height change from the perspective of the steepness of the variation the grouser height has less influence on the driving resistance coefficient than the track length as shown in fig 3 b for the v shaped track shoes the maximum traction force generated by sediment is positively correlated with the track length and the track height from the variation trend the influence of the grouser height on the maximum traction force generated by sediment is smaller than that of the track length the v shaped track presents better mechanical properties than the π shaped track and t shaped track 2 2 track structural parameters the above mentioned three tracks with different structure investigated in this paper were processed to clearly reveal the influence of track structural parameter on the traction performance different track length width and grouser height are configured for π shaped track t shaped track and v shaped track respectively the tracks with different structural parameters employed in this paper are shown in fig 4 the track structural parameters are shown as table 2 table 3 and table 4 respectively 2 3 configured sediment to study the influence of structural parameters of different track on mechanical properties it is necessary to ensure that the sediment properties remain unchanged the configured sediment is mainly using bentonite sand and water the above mentioned materials were mixed with each other under a certain proportion before the experiment a rapid direct shear test was performed to obtain the mechanical properties of the testing sediment yang et al 2018 the testing results are shown in fig 5 supposing that the fitting equation shown in fig 5 can be expressed as y kx b according the test datas some connected coefficients are obtained as follows 9 b k c k tan k ϕ through further analysis and fitting the sediment cohesion of the modulated soil was obtained the value of kc is 9 61 kpa and the value of kϕ is 4 12 3 mechanics of track terrain interaction the traction force adhesion force and braking force are transmitted to the uutb through the interaction between the track and the sediment on the riverbed those force are necessary for the operation of the uutb the traction force and driving resistance directly affect the maneuverability of the uutb zhao et al 2020 the force between the uutb and the sediment is not only affected by the mechanical properties of the soft sediments but also has great relationship with the track structure the structural parameters of track play an essential role in improving the traction force between the uutb and the sediment the force implemented on one side track of the uutb while it is operating on the sediment of the river bed is shown in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 6 that the force implemented on one side track of the uutb mainly includes the maximum traction force generated by the sediment the driving resistance the water resistance and the operating resistance the water resistance and the operating resistance are mainly determined by the river water density the volume of uutb the area facing water and the bulldozer structure which have few relationships with the track structural parameters in this paper the variation of mechanical characteristic caused by the track structural parameters was mainly analyzed 3 1 traction force analysis according to the terramechanics theory of tracked vehicle the effective traction force of the uutb is the difference between the maximum traction force caused by the sediment the driving resistance and the water resistance jin et al 2019 which can be expressed as follows 10 m t x 2 f t 2 r d r b f w to research the influence of track structural parameters on traction performance the force implemented on the uutb is simplified supposing that the force center of all direction coincides with the geometric center of the uutb besides the contact specific pressure between the track on both side of tracks of the uutb uniformly distributed the tangential traction of on one side track of the uutb can be expressed as follows wang et al 2017 11 f t k p m k w 2 i 2 l h e i 2 l h k w 2 c p m 2 2 c p m 1 1 2 c p

the uutb is related to the slip rate i track shoes width b s track grouser height h and the ground contact length l h of the uutb c pm is the correction factor of soft plastic deformation loss in the peak zone c pr is the correction factor of friction deformation loss in the residual stress zone k pm is the adjustment factor in peak zone k pr is the adjustment factor in the residual stress zone k w is the shear displacement when the maximum shear stress occurs τ max is the maximum shear stress and τ res is the residual shear stress dai et al 2020 the value of these parameters was determined in the experiment of the shear stress shear displacement the coefficient k w τ max and τ res can be obtained from the experimental data and the coefficient c pm c pr k pm k pr are obtained by fitting the experiment data for the shear characteristics of the flexible and plastic soil the theoretical model is shown in fig 7 the shear force and shear displacement will be caused by the interaction force between the track and sediment when the uutb is operating on the inland riverbed miao et al 2020 the curve of shear force and shear displacement places an essential role to characterize the shear strength of the sediment many researchers have investigated the shear properties with different sediment li and li 2010 proposed their own model respectively wang proposed a new empirical model named soft plastic soil shear spss model for saturated soft plastic soil wang et al 2016a b the empirical model can be used to test the mechanical properties of seafloor soil the model can be presented the relationship between shear force and displacement it is modelled based on the maximum shear force the shear displacement at the maximum shear force the residual shear force respectively chen et al 2018 the relationship between the sharing force and the shear displacement can be obtained as follows 12 τ k p m e s k ω c p m 2 1 c p m 2 τ max k p r e s k ω c p r 2 1 c p r 2 τ r e s where s is the shear displacement 3 2 resistance analysis the effective traction force of the uutb is mainly affected by the following factors such as the maximum traction force generated by the sediment the driving resistance the water resistance and the operating resistance respectively to simplify the calculation of load the climbing resistance and acceleration resistance are ignored the compaction resistance the bulldozing resistance and the water resistance are calculated the maximum traction force and driving resistance studied in this paper are related to the structural parameters of track 3 2 1 compaction resistance the uutb sinks when it is operating on the sediment due to its weight according to the properties of the resistance the compaction resistance can be divided into static subsidence resistance caused by sediment deformation and slip subsidence resistance caused by deep subsidence during the shear sliding of the track wang et al 2019 the static pressure subsidence resistance is equivalent to the work done by the track with the same pressure the static pressure subsidence resistance can be expressed as follows reshma et al 2015 13 r s b s n 1 k c b s k φ 1 n p w n 1 n the slip subsidence resistance can be obtained by equivalent resistance according to the empirical formula of slip subsidence resistance proposed by reece reece 1965 the equation of slip subsidence resistance is presented as follows 14 r i p w b s h i 1 i the vertical equivalent load of single side track is fixed when the ground pressure distribution is uniform which can be expressed as p w g sw a bekker 1956 the compaction resistance can be obtained as follows 15 r d b s n 1 k c b s 1 n p w n 1 n p w b s h i 1 i 1 n 1 g s w k c 2 l h k φ a 1 n h i 1 i g s w 2 l h where g sw is vertical equivalent load of single track a is the area of track contract ground 3 2 2 bulldozing resistance the bulldozing resistance shown in fig 8 is similar with the horizontal component acting on the vertical retaining wall the passive soil pressure theory of rankine can be adopted for the bulldozing resistance calculation rankine et al 2013 the equation of the bulldozing resistance is presented as follows 16 r b 1 2 k p y γ s b s p w k c b s k φ 1 n h i 1 i 2 c k p c b s p w k c b s k φ 1 n h i 1 i where k py and k pc are the constant coefficient related to internal friction angle of soil respectively γ s is the soil weight the bulldozer resistance is determined by the structural parameters of the uutb and the physical properties of the soft sediment the relevant parameters are shown in the table 1 3 2 3 water resistance the water flowing force will have blocking effect on the uutb while it is operating under water chang et al 2019 the water resistance is mainly related to the water density the volume the facing water area and the operating speed of the uutb according to the fluid dynamics theory the water resistance can be calculated as follows guerrero et al 2020 17 f w 1 2 ρ v m a f v w x 2 c d where ρ is the water density a f is the projection area of the uutb on the vertical axis v m is the total volume of the uutb v wx is the relative speed of the bulldozer and seawater supposing that the speed of the bulldozer is set at 0 5 m s and the speed of the water in the river is set at 0 15 m s c d is the coefficient of water resistance 3 2 4 operation resistance for operation resistance f r of bulldozing blade it is composed of cutting resistance f 1 pushing resistance f 2 blade and soil friction resistance f 3 respectively the operation resistance can be obtained as follows wang and sun 2014 18 f r f 1 f 2 f 3 the force of the bulldozing blade is analyzed and shown in fig 9 the cutting resistance the pushing resistance and the soil friction resistance can be respectively expressed as follows 19 f 1 10 6 b 1 h p k b 20 f 2 g t u 1 cos α b 1 h h p 2 γ u 1 cos α k m 2 tan α 0 k s 21 f 3 10 6 b 1 x u 2 k y combining the eq 19 eq 20 and eq 21 the operation resistance can be rewritten as follows 22 f r 10 6 b 1 h p k b b 1 h h p 2 γ u 1 cos α k m 2 tan α 0 k s 10 6 b 1 x u 2 k y where b 1 is the width of the bulldozing blade h p is the cutting depth of the bulldozing blade k b is the cutting specific damping g t is the volume of the mound before the bulldozing blade k s is the loose coefficient of soil k m is the filling coefficient of soil

natural slope angle of the soil k y is the specific resistance of the cutting edge to the soil after the cutting edge is worn out 3 3 effective traction force the effective traction force is supposed to propel the uutb while it is operating on the soft sediment of the inland river which can be expressed as follows 23 f 2 f t 2 r d r b f w f r the effective traction of the uutb is mainly affected by the maximum soil thrust f t the bulldozing resistance r d and the compaction resistance r b caused by the change of track structural parameters respectively liang et al 2020 4 experimental verification and discussions 4 1 test bench setup in this paper the experiment of traction force characteristics of the uutb is carried out in a soil tank to simulate the interaction force between the track and sediment as is shown in fig 10 the experiment platform mainly consists of sediment tank and the traction system the mixture of bentonite sand and water is configured in a certain ratio to simulate the sediment which is employed as soft clay with plasticity cohesion and thixotropy li et al 2021 the sediment should be soaked in the water to simulate the real sediment on the inland riverbed the sediment should be left at least 24 h after each testing to ensure the pressure and shear force distribute evenly as is shown in fig 10 the traction system is driven by the motor after that the unit of transverse shear stress producing starts to work the tension line is pulled by the motor the track shoes are pulled by tension line to generate transverse shear stress on the sediment to simulate the pressure of the tracked vehicle on the ground the displacement sensor and the force sensor transmit the shear stress and shear displacement to the computer then the curve of the shear stress and displacement can be presented 4 2 experimental principle as is shown in fig 11 and fig 12 the experiment was carried out in the soil tank a certain depth of sediment was laid in the tank a track shoe is placed on the surface of the sediment the pressure is loaded on the track to simulate ground pressure when the track is depressing on the sediment the traction line fixed on the test soil tank drives the track grouser to shear the sediment the relationship between the shear force and the shear displacement is obtained by the displacement sensor and the tension sensor the schematic diagram of the shear force and shear displacement is shown in fig 11 the traction experiment is shown in fig 12 the track grouser will pierce into the sediment when the uutb is driving during which the horizontally compressed track is filled with the sediment the sediment is restricted by the upper of the track the track grouser and the lower compacted sediment for which the sediment inside the track grouser is compacted and squeezed to both sides the track will move forward against the resistance of the sediment with a vertical downward load and forward force produced by a traction motor three different tracks are tested in this paper 4 3 experimental scheme in this paper the relationship between the shear stress and the shear displacement was measured and analyzed quantitatively with different track structural parameters in the experiment 27 groups of effective and relatively reliable experimental data were obtained the experimental results often affected by some human factors which including 1 the center of gravity of the counterweight plate and experimental track shoes should be controlled on the same line in each testing 2 at the end of each experiment the soil is sheared and damaged the artificial restoration of the soil is different which will cause the change of soil mechanical properties in the next experiment 3 in the process of each shear experiment the depth of the track shoes pressed into the soil is different to eliminate the influence caused by the above mentioned human factors on the experimental results three testing were conducted on each track besides the following aspects should be noted to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data 1 the lateral displacement sensor and tension sensor should be demarcated before the experiment those sensors connected with the lms scadas data acquisition module and the experimental data can be obtained 2 during the experiment the speed of the traction motor was adjusted to 2000r min to ensure the traction force received by each track shoes unchanged 3 the smooth curve of shear force and shear displacement was selected among the three testing data the smoother the curve the fewer abnormal values in the data 4 4 shear force shear displacement testing results according to the changes of track shoes length track shoes width and track grouser height the track of each form was put into the same group for comparative analysis the shear empirical model soft plastic soil shear model in eq 11 is employed to fit the experimental data wang et al 2017 the experiment results have shown in fig 13 fig 14 and fig 15 respectively as is shown in figs 13 a 14 a and 15 a in terms of the track length the shear stress of π shaped track and t shaped track increases with the length however the shear stress of v shaped track decreases with the increase of track length the increasing of the length of the π shaped track and t shaped track has led to the increase of soil content between the grousers while the decrease of soil content of v shaped track it can be seen from figs 13 b 14 b and 15 b in terms of the track width the shear stress of π shaped track is the largest at the value of 500 mm the smallest value is 450 mm the middle value is 400 mm the shear stress influence by width shows no obvious rules the shear stress of t shaped track shows a trend of rising first and then falling which indicates that an optimal value of track width is exists between 400 mm and 520 mm the shear stress of v shaped track decreases when the track width increases which indicates that the optimal value of track width should not exceed 500 mm as is shown in figs 13 c 14 c and 15 c in terms of the track grouser height the shear stress of π shaped track rises first and then falls the result indicates that an optimal value of track grouser height is exists around 30 mm the shear stress of t shaped track decreases with the increase of track grouser height which indicates that the optimal value should not be larger than 60 mm the shear stress of v shaped track increases slightly with the increase of track grouser height while the residual shear stress has no obvious change it can be seen from figs 13 fig 14 and fig 15 that the sheer force of π shaped track t shaped track and v shaped track are different the shear stress produced by π shaped track is larger and the maximum shear stress appears at the early time while the shear stress produced by v shaped track is relatively small and the maximum shear stress appears later according to the experimental results of shear force and shear displacement the v shaped track have the least damage to the soil the v shaped track is more suitable for the tracked vehicles driving on soft sediments of the river or sea bed than the π shaped track and t shaped track according to the experimental data the fitting value of the correlation coefficient in the empirical formula are presented in table 5 table 6 and table 7 respectively 4 5 traction force slip ratio results substituting the fitting coefficient into the eq 12 the rule of track tangential traction force can be obtained as showed in fig 16 fig 17 and fig 18 respectively as it can be seen from the traction force and slip ratio curve in figs 16 17 and 18 the optimal value of slip ratio should be less than 20 it shows that the slip ratio should be controlled less than a certain value to ensure the traction performance of uutb we can see from figs 16 figs 17 and 18 the best value of slip ratio is about 7 fig 16 shows that the traction force produced by the π shaped track is proportional to the increase of track length width and grouser height the curve of traction slip rate is easily affected by the track width fig 17 shows that the traction force generated by the t shaped track is proportional to the increase of track length width and grouser height the curve of traction slip rate is easily affected by the track length fig 18 shows that the traction force produced by the v shaped track is proportional to the increase of track length width and grouser height the curve of traction slip rate is easily affected by the track width for traction force of different tracks it can be found that the track width has the greatest influence on π shaped track and v shaped track the track length has great influence on the t shaped track the track grouser height has the greatest influence than track width and length on traction force for t shaped track the traction force of t shaped track can be greatly affected by the track structural parameters while the π shaped track can be less affected by that 4 6 influence of dynamic characteristics according to the fitting results in section 4 4 seven mechanical characteristic parameters of three different structure shape of track shoes are obtained as is shown in table 8 since the length of the track constitutes of the grounding length of the track the track width and the grouser height are mainly considered when studying the mechanical properties of uutb substituting the datas in table 8 into the formula of tangent traction force compaction resistance bulldozer resistance and effective traction force the relationship was shown in the fig 19 fig 20 fig 21 and fig 22 respectively it can be seen from eq 17 that the parameters of track are independent of water resistance as a result the water resistance in this part can be seen as a decision value assuming that the intake density is 1 02 g cm3 the water resistance coefficient is 0 6 the upstream area is 5 98m 2 and the effective length of the vehicle body is 5m yan et al 2020 assuming that the underwater speed of uutb is 0 4 m s and the water speed is 0 2 m s substituting this value into eq 17 the value of water resistance is obtained with the value of 2 1885n as is shown in figs 19 20 21 and 22 the slip ratio of the three different surfaces from top to bottom is 3 6 and 9 respectively the results show that the lower of the slip ratio the lower of the maximum soil thrust and effective traction as is shown in figs 20 and 21 the slip ratio of the three different surfaces from bottom to top is 3 6 and 9 respectively the results show that the compaction resistance and bulldozing resistance increases with the increasing of slip ratio respectively the increase of slip ratio will lead to the decreasing of traction force therefore in practical application the slip ratio of the uutb should be controlled as much as possible the results in fig 19 show that the maximum traction force increases with the track width and grouser height for the π shaped track and v shaped track the influence of track width on the maximum traction force is more obvious than that of track grouser height for the t shaped track the track grouser height has more obvious influence on the maximum traction force than that of the track width the results shown in figs 20 and 21 indicate that the variation of the track structural parameters has a greater influence on the compaction resistance and the bulldozing resistance than traction force the track width has more influence on the compaction resistance and the bulldozing resistance than the grouser height the compaction resistance and the bulldozing resistance will increase rapidly with the track width however the compaction resistance and the bulldozing resistance do not change with the track grouser height the results in fig 22 show that the effective traction force will increase with the track width and track grouser height the influence of track width of π shaped track and v shaped track on the maximum soil thrust is more obvious than the track grouser height the influence of track grouser height of t shaped track on the maximum traction force is more obvious than that of the track width compared with the three types of track shoes with different structures the track grouser height of the π shaped track and t shaped track have greater effect on the maximum traction force than that of the track length the length of v shaped track has a greater influence on traction force than that of the track grouser height it is indicated that the v shaped track has a shallower settlement depth the mechanical properties of uutb are determined by the track structural parameters the π shaped track is stable and less affected by the track length width and grouser height the mechanical properties of the t shaped track are easily affected by its structural parameters above all it can be concluded that the v shaped track and π shaped track are more suitable for practical application than t shaped track due to its superior mechanical properties 5 conclusions the problems such as poor maneuverability and insufficient adhesion between the track and soft sediments always exist while the uutb is operating on the soft sediments of the river bed this paper mainly focuses on the optimization of the track structural parameters and the influence of track structural parameters on mechanical properties the research results obtained in this paper are as follows 1 the mechanical properties of track shoes mainly depend on its structural parameters the track with large structural parameters leads to large maximum traction force and driving resistance the shear efficiency of track shoes can be reflected by the shear stress 2 the width of π shaped track shoes has greater influence on mechanical properties than its length and grouser height which should be mainly considered for its structural parameter optimization the grouser height of t shaped track has great influence on mechanical properties than its length and width which should be mainly considered for its structural parameter optimization the length and width have greater influence than its grouser height 3 the structural parameters of track shoes should provide enough traction force with soft sediment while the uutb is operating on river bed the structural parameters of v shaped track shoes have less effect on the maximum traction force than the π shaped track and t shaped track the v shaped track shoes also have short vertical sinkage displacement under the same pitch and sinkage pressure moreover the length of v shaped track can be increased to provide more maximum traction force the dynamics of uutb while it is operating on the river bed is not only affected by the track structural parameters but also influenced by the underwater environment future work will focus on the effect of sediments with different particle size on the traction performance anti slip control and stability of the uutb credit authorship contribution statement yong li methodology writing review editing investigation funding acquisition project

20346,in the earlier stage of hull form optimization design a series of design variables is usually needed to control the hull shape so as to find optimal hull forms with better performance in the surrogate based hydrodynamic performance optimization for ships with the increase of the dimensionality of design space the number of new sample hulls to construct surrogate model needs to be larger which will bring a large amount of calculation through reduced order method the dimensionality of the optimization design space can be reduced while keeping the deformation range of the original design space to a great extent for instance using the linear combination of a smaller number of bases to represent the deformation range in addition in the later stage of hull form optimization design flow field results of the new sample hulls can be fully utilized to do the dimensionality reduction multi physics field learning in this paper the principle of the proper orthogonal decomposition method is used and briefly introduced the steps of dimensionality reduction of the design space are shown then and some important problems for the design space dimensionality reduction in the specific field of hull form optimization such as retainability of fixed control points irrelevance of the relative order of data to dimensionality reduction results and decision of the new design space range after dimensionality reduction are deep analyzed furthermore taking the resistance optimization of the modified wigley ship as an example the specific application and error analysis of the dimensionality reduction method for design space dimensionality reduction in the earlier stage of hull form optimization and the multi physics field learning in the later stage of hull form optimization are given and the applicability and reliability of the method are demonstrated by analyzing the influence of mode order and sample number on reconstruction effect of the hull shape or flow field and the prediction effect of flow field for not in the database new hull form in detail results show that the linear dimensionality reduction method can reduce samples needed for optimization thus reduce the amount of calculation for the surrogate based hull form optimization and be used for quick prediction of multi physics fields of any new form in the design space furthermore it can not only be applied to the sensitivity analysis or a pareto frontier selection in comprehensive performance optimization of hull form based on cfd but also be implemented in the real time forecast of the flow field and influence analysis of the ship performance when adjusting the hull form or hull appendages keywords dimensionality reduction hull form optimization proper orthogonal decomposition design space multi physics field learning sensitivity analysis 1 introduction for the hull form optimization problem if the number of design variables that control the hull form deformation is small the hull shape change may be small in a certain design space that is the geometry variation is not enough therefore the improvement of the performance index of the optimal hull is relatively limited on the contrary if there are more parameters controlling the change of hull shape the possible changes of hull form will be more abundant that is to say in the high dimensional design space more diverse geometry variations will be generated and the optimal hull with much better performance can be found theoretically in order to avoid the difficulty of solving the optimization problems in the high dimensional design space caused by the curse of dimensionality different kinds of dimensionality reduction technologies for the design space have been proposed and widely applied including online dimensionality reduction technology and off line dimensionality reduction technology the so called dimensionality reduction means to reduce the data dimension as far as possible on the premise that it basically includes all the information involved in the set of high dimensional data vectors that is to basically represent all possible changes in the higher dimensional design space using a lower dimensional design space through the dimensionality reduction of the design space of hull form deformation parameters design variables a smaller number of design variables in the lower dimensional design space can represent any possible hull shape change without losing much geometry variation information in original high dimensional design space therefore the design of experiment can be implemented in the new lower dimensional design space where the new design variables can basically represent all possible changes in the higher dimensional design space for the surrogate based optimization the number of new sample hulls needed to evaluate will be reduced due to the reduction of design space dimensionality so the calculation cost will be reduced and then the optimization efficiency will be improved online design space dimensionality reduction technology needs to evaluate the objective function such as hydrodynamic performance index or its gradient lukaczyk et al 2014 proposed a search strategy for active dimensionality reduction subspace however such methods could not evaluate and reduce dimensionality of the design space for various hull form deformation methods in advance that is they cannot consider the strong relationship that may exist in the hull shape changes controlled only by different design variables off line design space dimensionality reduction technology mainly considers the variability of the design space which does not need the evaluation of the objective functions let alone the gradient information of them in terms of the decision of the new feature independent variable in the new dimensionality reduced design space the off line dimensionality reduction methods can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction methods feature selection is just a filtering of the original features that is a subset of independent variables in the original high dimensional space is chosen which usually have the greatest influence on the dependent variables feature extraction is to condense and construct a new set of features on the basis of original features that is it converts the old set of high dimensional variables into a new set of low dimensional variables by data analysis in this paper the dimensionality reduction method of feature extraction is further elaborated and studied proper orthogonal decomposition pod also known as principal component analysis pca or karhunen loève expansion kle pearson 1901 wold et al 1987 jollife 1986 diez et al 2015 is one of the most classic but still most widely used linear reduced order methods the basic idea of this method is to construct a lower dimensional linear space making the projection of a certain number of high dimensional data set on it as large as possible in other words mapping the high dimensional data set into a low dimensional data set by constructing a transformation while making the low dimensional data set keep the change variance information of the original high dimensional data set as much as possible however when there are complex nonlinear relationships between design variables some linear dimensionality reduction methods may not work well in order to reduce the dimensionality of the design space under the premise of capturing the nonlinear information in the original high dimensional design space the nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods were proposed and developed successively after the linear method such as local pca lpca lloyd 1982 kambhatla et al 1997 luxburg 2004 kernel pca kpca scholkopf 1998 and deep auto encoder dae hinton et al 2006 both linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods have their advantages and disadvantages the main advantage of the nonlinear method is that it can capture the nonlinear relationship between the original high dimensional data while reducing the dimensionality however it may need some additional parameter settings and debugging in the calculation to ensure that the relative error before and after dimensionality reduction is small enough so the calculation stability is not as good as the linear method in addition the basis in the linear method usually has a clear physical concept and the new samples can be reconstructed through its linear superposition conveniently such as the changes of hull geometry while the nonlinear mapping relationship in the nonlinear method is only on the mathematical level and its physical significance is not obvious furthermore both linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods have been widely used in image compression signal processing text classification and many other engineering fields however the application of dimensionality reduction technology in the field of hull form optimization is relatively rare chen et al 2014 optimized the delft catamaran calm water drag under a certain speed by using kle method on two design spaces of 20 free form deformation ffd parameters the dimensionalities of the new design spaces after dimensionality reduction become 4 and 6 respectively and the optimal hulls in the two new design spaces have a 9 63 and 6 89 reduction respectively diez et al 2015 briefly gave the basic principle of design space dimensionality reduction and an optimization application of calm water drag for the high speed catamaran by using kle method on the 20 dimensional design space the dimensionalities of the new design spaces after dimensionality reduction are controlled no more than 4 optimization results show that there are significantly positive correlations between the total drag reduction degree and dimensionality of the new design space d agostino et al 2020 used kle method to optimize the calm water drag of dtmb 5415 ship by reducing the dimensionality of the design spaces composed of design variables of ffd radial basis function rbf and global modification function gmf methods under the precondition of keeping 95 geometric changes in the original design space after dimensionality reduction the final design space dimensionalities are reduced by 86 16 and 37 respectively as a matter of fact the application of dimensionality reduction technology in hull form optimization is more than design space dimensionality reduction of hull form deformation serani et al 2016 2018 gave examples of optimizing the calm water drag of dtmb 5415 ship by using the potential flow theory for performance evaluation considering the change of the hull geometry and physics field several reduced order methods such as kle lpca kpca and dae were used for multi physics field learning with the number of geometric and physical field information grid points 5101 under the premise that the overall relative error is no more than 5 the number of bases that contain the multi physics field information are 18 14 15 15 respectively by the four dimensionality reduction methods indicating that there is a strong correlation in the geometrical physical field to sum up in order to reduce the number of samples to evaluate and improve the surrogate based optimization efficiency in the earlier stage of the hull form optimization design space dimensionality reduction can be implemented after evaluations of the new sample hulls determined by design of experiment the geometrical physical field database can be naturally formed and the flow field dimensionality reduction learning can be carried out further therefore the application of reduced order method can run through from the earlier stage to the later stage of the hull form optimization process but there are few relevant studies at present this paper aims to give specific steps and quantitative error analysis of dimensionality reduction method used in the earlier stage of hull form optimization and the multi physics field learning in the later stage of hull form optimization furthermore deep discussions on some important problems such as retainability of fixed control points irrelevance of the relative order of data to dimensionality reduction results and decision of the new design space range after dimensionality reduction in the specific field of hull form optimization are given in detail 2 basic principles of linear dimensionality reduction method in the process of hull form optimization after determining the hull form deformation methods and their corresponding design space a series of new hull forms can be obtained based on the design of experiment results that is a hull form database is obtained consider each new hull form as a sample and arrange the three dimensional grid point coordinates of each hull form in the same order for example x i t x 1 i y 1 i z 1 i x 2 i y 2 i z 2 i x n p i y n p i z n p i where np is the number of grid points on the hull surface a series of column vectors can be got in order to use a linear combination of very few basis vectors to characterize the change of the hull form to the initial hull in the design space the most important thing is to determine the basis vectors and the number of basis obviously for all samples in the database we can obtain the average hull form geometric field x and regard the geometric field of any sample hull form as a linear superposition of the average geometric field and an infinite number of unit orthogonal basis modes as follows 1 x i x j 1 a i j u j where 2 a i j x i x t u j u i u j δ i j if only m finite basis modes u 1 u 2 u m are selected the reconstructed geometric field x i r e c can be expressed as 3 x i r e c x j 1 m a i j u j because of the truncation of the number of series items a cutoff error is produced considering that the deviation between the real geometric field and the reconstructed geometric field of all samples in the database should be as small as possible the total error e m u 1 u 2 u m is measured by the square sum of the modulus length of the error vector in euclidean space namely 4 e m u 1 u 2 u m i 1 n x i x i r e c 2 and we can get 5 e m u 1 u 2 u m i 1 n x i x j 1 m a i j u j 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n j 1 m a i j u j t j 1 m a i j u j 2 i 1 n x i x t j 1 m a i j u j it can be seen from the above equation that the total error is divided into three parts for a certain sample set e 1 is a constant consider the remaining two parts 6 e 2 i 1 n u 1 t a i 1 t u 2 t a i 2 t u m t a i m t a i 1 u 1 a i 2 u 2 a i m u m j 1 m u j t i 1 n a i j t a i j u j j 1 m u j t i 1 n u j t x i x x i x t u j u j j 1 m i 1 n u j t x i x x i x t u j u j t u j j 1 m u j t i 1 n x i x x i x t u j 7 e 3 2 i 1 n x i x t j 1 m x i x t u j u j 2 i 1 n j 1 m u j t x i x x i x t u j 2 j 1 m u j t i 1 n x i x x i x t u j finally we have 8 e m e 1 e 2 e 3 i 1 n x i x 2 j 1 m u j t i 1 n x i x x i x t u j denote the difference between the geometric field of each sample hull form x i and the average geometry x as x i x i x and define the matrix x x 1 x 2 x n then 9 x x t x 1 x 2 x n x 1 t x 2 t x n t i 1 n x i x i t i 1 n x i x x i x t therefore the total error can be denoted as 10 e m i 1 n x i x 2 j 1 m u j t x x t u j assuming that m is certain the constrained optimization problem on the basis u 1 u 2 u m can be defined as follows 11 min e m u 1 u 2 u m i 1 n x i x 2 j 1 m u j t x x t u j s t u j t u j 1 using the lagrange multiplier method the lagrange function corresponding to the above objective function is defined as 12 l u 1 u 2 u m λ 1 λ 2 λ m e m j 1 m λ j 1 u j t u j let the partial derivatives of lagrange function with respect to each basis be 0 i e 13 l u j 0 we have 14 x x t u j λ j u j in other words the basis we re looking for should be the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues of matrix s x x t ℝ 3 n p 3 n p generally there are two ways to determine λ j one is to directly calculate the eigenvalue of square matrix s whose dimension is the number of grid point coordinates on the hull surface the other is to solve the singular value of matrix x or x t according to the relation between the singular value of x or x t and the eigenvalue of s from the perspective of improving the efficiency of numerical calculation since the number of grid point coordinates stored in geometric field is generally greater even far greater than the number of samples in the database in order to calculate the eigenvalue of matrix s we can solve the singular value decomposition of matrix x instead namely 15 x u d v t σ 1 u 1 v 1 t σ 2 u 2 v 2 t σ r u r v r t where σ 1 σ 2 σ r 0 then we have 16 x x t u j u d v t v d t u t u j u d 2 u t u j u d i a g σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ r 2 0 0 u t u j σ j 2 u j where the basis u j happens to be the j th column of the matrix u obtained by singular value decomposition of x next the number of intercepted basis modes m should be determined from the perspective of capturing the total energy information of the geometric field the energy contained in the basis u j can be defined as the sum of squares of the u j direction projection of the geometric field vector corresponding to each sample 17 i 1 n x i u k 2 i 1 n j 1 a i j u j u k 2 i 1 n a i k 2 i 1 n x i t u k t x i t u k u k t x x t u k σ j 2 according to the above formula we can see that the energy contained in the basis u j is exactly the eigenvalue corresponding to the basis u j as the eigenvector of matrix s therefore define the percentage of energy truncation can be defined as 18 e n j 1 m σ j 2 j 1 3 n p σ j 2 100 where m can be regarded as the smallest positive integer that meets the inequality e n 95 at this point we believe that the eigenvectors corresponding to the first m maximum eigenvalues of matrix s contain 95 of the geometric field information in the whole database so far we almost get the reconstructed geometric field after dimensionality reduction in fact the derivation of kle given by diez et al 2015 is based on setting up the energy integral as a functional and uses variational method to obtain the conditions that the basis mode vectors should satisfy in this paper the so called pod or pca method is used directly to minimize the overall reconstruction error of the hull geometry database and an optimization problem with constraints can be established and conditions that the basis mode vectors should meet can be got finally it turns out that they are essentially the same therefore we can say kle pca and pod are just called differently in different fields but essentially the same method 3 further discussion on dimensionality reduction of hull form optimization design space in the following several important problems arising from the dimensionality reduction of hull form optimization design space in the early stage are further discussed 3 1 retainability of fixed control points when the hull is deformed it is often required that the grid points at some positions cannot be moved such as the design waterline middle longitudinal section and some transverse sections such special positions can be limited by using the traditional hull form deformation methods to ensure that the grid points do not move at these positions however after the dimensionality reduction of the design space if the new hull form controlled by the new design variables has some slight deviation in the grid points coordinates of special positions it will make the deformed hull do not meet the design requirements if the coordinate in a certain direction of one grid point needs to remain unchanged the coordinate of this position such as the k th coordinate 1 k 3 n p in each sample hull form vector x i obtained by the original hull form deformation methods remains unchanged then the coordinate of this position in the average new hull form vector x is also the original value and the columns of the matrix x x 1 x 2 x n are defined by x i x i x so we have 19 x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x k 1 x k 2 x k n x 3 n p 1 x 3 n p 2 x 3 n p n x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n 0 0 0 x 3 n p 1 x 3 n p 2 x 3 n p n then 20 x x t 0 0 0 0 0 0 assume α be the eigenvector of the matrix x x t with respect to eigenvalue λ then 21 0 0 0 0 0 0 α 1 α 2 α k α 3 n p λ α 1 α 2 α k α 3 n p considering that the eigenvalues corresponding to each basis mode obtained by dimensionality reduction are all positive real numbers it is only necessary to consider λ 0 then 22 0 λ α 1 α 2 α k α 3 n p therefore we get 23 α k 0 that is the k th coordinate of the corresponding basis vector is 0 for arbitrary reconstructed new hull form x i r e c after dimensionality reduction according to eq 2 it is easy to know that the k th coordinate is still the original value therefore for any reconstructed new hull form the fixed points for the primitive hull form deformation methods keep unchanged after dimensionality reduction 3 2 irrelevance of the relative order of data to dimensionality reduction results when the hull is deformed the coordinates of the grid points on the hull surface will change to some extent but the topological relationship among the grid points will not change however in actual dimensionality reduction operation there is no clear rule for the sequence of each new hull form in the database when the coordinates are written into column vector and there is also no clear rule for the arrangement of different new hull forms that is the column vectors as a result it is necessary to discuss whether the uncertainty of relative position will have an impact on the new reconstructed hull forms obtained by dimensionality reduction of the design space of course the first thing we must ensure is that the orders of each new coordinate point for each new hull form and original hull form are exactly the same under this premise the so called uncertainty of relative position is actually the uncertainty of the relative position of the rows or columns in the matrix x x 1 x 2 x n without loss of generality the following analysis will only take the uncertainty of the relative position of the rows as an example assuming that the deviation matrices obtained are x and x respectively before and after exchanging the locations of the coordinates of each new hull form then it s obviously that x is the row transformation of x which is the result of several elementary row transformations that only exchange certain two rows and it can be expressed in matrix form as 24 x h n h n 1 h 2 h 1 x h x where h k 1 h k t k 1 2 n then we have 25 h 1 h t let s x x t then 26 s x x t h x x t h t h x x t h 1 h s h 1 therefore s s and the eigenvalues of the two matrices are the same assume α be the eigenvector of the matrix s with respect to eigenvalue λ i e 27 s α λ α then 28 s h α h s α λ h α that is to say h α is the eigenvector of the matrix s with respect to eigenvalue λ and h α is just the basis mode after exchanging locations of the coordinates of α therefore we can know that after exchanging the locations of the coordinates of each new hull form the order of reconstructed hull form vector by design space dimensionality reduction has the same change but they essentially both represent the same new hull form consequently the relative order of data is irrelative to the dimensionality reduction results admittedly the dimensionality reduction process cannot be directly guided by the proof given above if not given however we can t ensure theoretically that different researchers use the same database such as the new samples ship hulls and the corresponding geometrical fields to do the dimensionality reduction operation and have the same dimensionality reduction results under different data arrangements this proof demonstrates the irrelevance of data order allowing researchers to set the order of data arbitrarily 3 3 decision of the new design space range after dimensionality reduction after dimensionality reduction of the design space the dimensionality of the design space reduces and the design variables are changed from the original hull form deformation parameters to the coefficients of the basis modes in order to ensure that the deformation in the new design space after dimensionality reduction does not exceed the deformation range controlled by the original design space the ranges of new design variables after dimensionality reduction need to be further determined otherwise it is very likely to produce unreasonable unreal new hull forms according to eqs 2 and 3 it is easy to know that the approximate range of the basis coefficient is 29 a j min x i x x i x t u j max x i x x i x t u j i 1 2 n that is the value range of each basis coefficient can be estimated through n new sample ship hull forms in order to ensure the accuracy of range estimation n new samples in the database should cover the original design space as much as possible therefore the dense sampling strategy is adopted in this paper for example n 5000 and the basis coefficients obtained from 5000 new sample hulls are projected in two dimensions to obtain the spatial distribution of the basis coefficients and value ranges of the new design variables in the dimensionality reduction design space can be determined as a matter of fact there may be additional constraints on the design variables therefore the new design space may no longer be a regular hypercube design space if one ignores this the new design space hypercube may include some new ship forms which may be beyond the possible hull deformations controlled by the original design space and may not satisfy some geometric constraints of hull deformation controlled by the original design space such as the relative change of wet surface area and other constraints or may not be like practical hull forms such as having strange bulbous bow shape therefore a practical method of two dimensional projections between the new design variables will be proposed in this paper to keep the hull deformation in the new design space within the limits of the original design space as much as possible later in the new design variable with constraints in order to ensure no computational costs waste the method of sequential constrained monte carlo golchi et al 2016 is used to do the design of experiment in the constrained design space 4 application in design space dimensionality reduction in earlier stage of hull form optimization in the following we give an example of using the linear dimensionality reduction method to reduce the dimensionality of the hull form optimization design space to illustrate its applicability in earlier stage of hull form optimization 4 1 basic information of the mother ship wigley ship is a kind of parabolic mathematical hull form commonly used in the field of ship research which is regarded as the initial mother ship in this paper the hull is slender which conforms to the small perturbation assumption of linear potential theory and has abundant experimental test results to refer the ship has no specific design speed and can be numerically simulated over a wide range of speed and compared with the experimental results its three dimensional model is shown in fig 1 and the main particulars are shown in table 1 since it conforms to small disturbance assumption of the linear theory when it sails in calm water under high speed its free surface wave elevation is obvious at this time the wave making drag accounted for the proportion of the total drag is relatively big and the potential flow theory such as neumann michell nm potential flow theory noblesse et al 2013 can be used for rapid prediction of wave making drag furthermore the 1957 ittc plate frictional drag coefficient formula can be used to get the approximate frictional drag and the total drag of the ship hull based on the potential flow theory can be got finally which is the sum of the wave making drag and the frictional drag 4 2 definition of optimization problem in this section after generating a basic bulbous bow on the basis of the original wigley ship liu et al 2019 the total drag of a modified wigley ship can be further optimized under the speed froude number 0 3 the radial basis function rbf method is used to carry out the hull form deformation at the bulbous bow and the shifting method is used to adjust the section area curve sac of the whole ship where the cross section of the front and aft halves can be independently translated along the direction of the ship length as shown in fig 2 the sobol 1979 sampling method is adopted to sample in the 7 dimensional design space the ranges of design variables are shown in table 2 all the range values of variables are dimensionless values with respect to the ship model waterline length wherein x corresponds to the coordinate of point p1 in the direction of the ship length z corresponds to the coordinate of point p1 in the direction of ship draught and y corresponds to the coordinate of point p2 in the direction of the ship width in fig 2 it should be noted that the moveable control points along the ship width are moved symmetrically about the central sheer plane of the hull using the rbf deformation method these deformation parameters control the length height and width of the bulbous bow respectively for the shifting method yang et al 2016 modified function g is introduced to modify the sac of ship hull and new hull forms can be obtained by shifting hull lines of each station along the x direction 30 g α 1 0 5 1 cos 2 π x α 2 α 2 x 1 0 5 x 1 x α 2 α 1 0 5 1 cos 2 π x α 2 α 2 x 2 0 5 α 2 x x 2 0 elsewhere where x 1 x 2 represents the start and end points of the shifting range in x direction α 1 represents the amplitude of the modified function and α 2 represents the fixed point section in the shifting range the sac of the initial hull and the deformed hull is shown by the black dot line and green solid line in fig 3 for the optimization problem here there exist two shifting regions namely fore part region 1 and aft part region 2 in shifting region 1 according to eq 30 the modified function g 1 can be written by setting x 1 0 x 2 0 5 likewise in shifting region 2 according to eq 30 the modified function g 2 can be written by setting x 1 0 5 x 2 0 here α 1 and α 3 represent the amplitudes of the modification functions for sac of the fore and aft halves in the shifting method while α 2 and α 4 represent the locations of the fixed cross sections for the fore and aft halves in shifting method the objective function of this optimization problem is the calm water total drag r t at the sailing froude number 0 3 as shown below 31 min f o b j r t 4 3 optimization results and analysis with design space dimensionality reduction according to the deformation methods and the design variables the original design space is determined and dense samplings by sobol method can be got then a large number of new hull forms can be further obtained according to the design variable values of the sample points within the design space which can build a geometry field database in order to use in the design space dimensionality reduction process firstly the influence of different dense sampling numbers on dimensionality reduction of design space should be discussed set n 1250 2500 5000 10000 respectively after dimensionality reduction by these numbers of new sample hulls and combining with eq 18 the variation of en with the number of bases m and different sample numbers n can be obtained as shown in fig 4 as can be seen from fig 4 for a large sample number n selecting m 5 can satisfy the energy truncation percentage greater than 95 that is to say we can think that the eigenvectors corresponding to the first five maximum eigenvalues of matrix s contain 95 of the information of all possible changes of hull forms in the original design space the basis vectors modes obtained by dimensionality reduction using the database constructed by different sample points n are shown in fig 5 for convenience of display the components of three directions in the spatial cartesian coordinate system are given on each grid point of the original modified wigley ship hull since the length euclid norm of each basis vector is limited to 1 when reflected on the hull surface the absolute coordinates of each grid point values are quite small therefore according to the maximum of each basis coefficient each basis vector times the maximum of the corresponding basis coefficient which can also show the distribution law of the grid point coordinates change i e the hull geometric deformation corresponding to different basis modes it is not difficult to find that when n is greater than 2500 the pictures tend to be consistent indicating that the number of dense sampling n is sufficient we select n 5000 as the sample number of the database and the obtained basis modes are used for further study table 3 below gives the approximate value ranges of design variables corresponding to the new design space after dimensionality reduction obtained from eq 29 taking a deformed hull form in the database as an example the influence of different mode number m on the hull form reconstructed error is analyzed as shown in fig 6 the solid black line represents an initially modified wigley ship hull and the dotted red line represents a deformed ship hull in the database which is controlled by a total of 7 design variables of rbf and shifting methods since k 1 2 3 4 5 can be chosen the contribution of each basis mode to the final reconstruction of the hull form is analyzed below set k 1 2 3 4 5 respectively and the reconstructed hull form can be obtained by the following equation 32 x r e c k x j 1 k a j u j as shown in fig 7 the body line comparison and absolute error of the grid point coordinates in three directions reconstructed deformed hull in red minus target deformed hull in black of the two hulls are given due to the fact that before and after deformation of a hull the topological relationship of the grid points between the two hulls remains the same for display convenience the absolute error of the grid point coordinates in three directions of the two hulls is shown on the grid points of the preliminary modified wigley hull with an initially generated bulbous bow it can be seen that with the increase of the number of selected basis modes the absolute error between the real and reconstructed deformed hull decreases gradually with no more than 5 basis modes selected the final dimensionality reduction effect is that the dimensionality of the design space is reduced from 7 to no more than 5 then the total drag optimization in the new design space which is constituted by bases no more than the first five that are obtained by dimensionality reduction can be done according to the value range of each variable in the design space after dimensionality reduction obtained above optimal latin hypercube sampling olhs designs liu et al 2018 can be carried out for the new design space with m 1 3 5 and 20 60 100 sample points can be obtained respectively it should be noted however that the olhs approach picks samples within a regular hypercube design space which based on previous analysis may be larger than the actual feasible range but it is difficult to obtain their complex relationship theoretically from the perspective of practical application based on the dense sampling with n 5000 5000 reconstructed new hull forms with their corresponding five new design variable values can be obtained after doing projections of the five design variables in two dimensional spaces we can almost get new design variables spatial distributions and a new boundary can be regarded as a new constraint among new design variables although this may lead to a more conservative new hull form taking m 5 as an example the two dimensional projections of the corresponding basis coefficients of 5000 new samples after dimensionality reduction are respectively given as shown in the blue dots in fig 8 it can be seen clearly that after the dimensionality reduction the new design space is no longer a hypercube for the basis modes themselves however they do not change depending on whether their coefficient ranges constitute a hypercube therefore if we use olhs method to obtain the new hulls without considering the constraints as shown in the 100 green points in fig 8 there will be some new hull forms out of the real design space predictably they are beyond the scope of deformation in original design space and may be unrealistic hull forms it can be seen from fig 8 b g and i that a relatively conservative irregular design space with constraints among design variables can be determined through the boundary lines of two dimensional projections constraints can be regarded as linear inequality constraints in the form as follows 33 f 1 a 1 a 3 0 f 2 a 1 a 3 0 f 3 a 1 a 3 0 f 4 a 1 a 3 0 f 5 a 2 a 5 0 f 6 a 2 a 5 0 f 7 a 3 a 5 0 in this new irregular design space 5 dimensional new design variables with a number of 100 can be obtained through the scmc method with the use of maximum minimum distance criterion which fully satisfy all the above inequalities making full use of the design space boundaries and avoiding the waste of calculation resources shown above the constraints between the first five basis coefficients a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 have already been obtained by two dimensional projections for the cases of m 1 and m 3 only a 1 and a 1 a 2 a 3 changes specifically for the case of m 1 only the maximum and minimum values of the projection a 1 need to be given through dense sampling that is a 1 min x i x x i x t u 1 max x i x x i x t u 1 i 1 2 n for the case of m 3 after roughly giving maximum and minimum values of a 1 a 2 a 3 like above the constraint relationship between the three coefficients needs to be given through two dimensional projections of a 1 a 2 a 1 a 3 a 2 a 3 which can be seen from fig 8 a b and e in the case of m 5 so the projections of a 1 a 2 a 1 a 3 a 2 a 3 are not given repeatedly therefore after design space dimensionality reduction the new hull form optimization problem whose design space dimensionalities are m 1 3 5 respectively can be defined as follows 34 min r t r f r w s t m 1 m 3 m 5 a 1 0 273 0 177 a 1 0 273 0 177 a 2 0 120 0 111 a 3 0 133 0 086 f 1 a 1 a 3 0 f 2 a 1 a 3 0 f 3 a 1 a 3 0 f 4 a 1 a 3 0 a 1 0 273 0 177 a 2 0 120 0 111 a 3 0 133 0 086 a 4 0 073 0 073 a 5 0 061 0 061 f 1 a 1 a 3 0 f 2 a 1 a 3 0 f 3 a 1 a 3 0 f 4 a 1 a 3 0 f 5 a 2 a 5 0 f 6 a 2 a 5 0 f 7 a 3 a 5 0 the hydrodynamic performance evaluation tool used in this optimization problem is the in house solver nmship sjtu liu et al 2020 based on the nm potential flow theory fig 9 shows the comparison of wigley ship s free surface wave elevation at fr 0 3 which is calculated by using in house nmship sjtu and rans based naoe foam sjtu shen et al 2015 solvers it can be seen that the positions of the bow and stern wave systems calculated by the two solvers are basically the same and the height ranges of the peaks and troughs are also roughly the same indicating that using potential flow theory can efficiently and accurately capture the calm water free surface wave elevation in addition according to the experimental test data of wigley ship model given by ship research institute sri the drag coefficient calculated by nmship sjtu is further verified among them nmship sjtu is used to get the wave making drag coefficient c w and 1957 ittc formula is used to calculate the frictional drag coefficient c f and the total drag coefficient c t is obtained by adding the two the conversion formulas of total wave making and frictional drags r t r w r f and their corresponding coefficients c t c w c f are as follows 35 c t r t 1 2 ρ u 2 s 36 c w r w 1 2 ρ u 2 s 37 c f r f 1 2 ρ u 2 s where ρ u s represent the fluid water density ship speed and static wet surface area respectively as can be seen from fig 10 the total drag coefficient measured by the experiment and numerical simulation show nearly the same trend with the growth of froude number and the difference between the two results is small at medium and high speed such as fr more than 0 3 therefore nmship sjtu can well predict the total drag coefficient of the wigley hull form at medium and high speed which can be used for total drag optimization nmship sjtu is used to evaluate the resistance performance of the new sample hull forms in the original design space before dimensionality reduction and the three new design spaces after dimensionality reduction and the surrogate models of total drag and corresponding design variables are constructed the optimal hulls can be finally obtained respectively by single objective genetic algorithm ga whose optimization parameters are shown in table 4 below the design variable values corresponding to the optimal hulls in the four design spaces are then obtained as shown in table 5 below herein kle 1 kle 3 and kle 5 represent the optimal hull in 1 3 and 5 dimensional design space after dimensionality reduction and optimal represents the optimal hull in original 7 dimensional design space comparison of transverse hull lines of each optimal hull and initial hull is shown in fig 11 in general with the increase of design space dimensionality the change of the optimal hull compared to the initial hull increases and the optimal hull in the 5 dimensional design space is the closest to the optimal hull in the original 7 dimensional design space the total drags for the optimal hulls are further evaluated by nmship sjtu which are compared with the initial hull fig 12 shows the comparison of the free surface wave elevations by nmship sjtu it can be clearly seen that with the increase of design space dimensionality the free surface wave elevation of the corresponding optimal hull decreases more sharply implying that its wave making drag also reduces gradually relatively speaking the optimal hull in the 5 dimensional design space is closest to the optimal hull in the original design space from the view of the free surface wave elevation fig 13 shows the comparison of dynamic pressure distribution on the hull surface by nmship sjtu it can also be seen that with the increase of design space dimensionality the area of high and low pressure regions on the hull surface of the corresponding optimal hull decreases gradually it can be predicted that the optimal hull in the 5 dimensional design space has a fewer total drag than that in the 1 dimensional or 3 dimensional design space the viscous cfd solver naoe foam sjtu is used for further verification of each optimal hull table 6 below gives the calm water total drags of the optimal hulls and the initial hull by naoe foam sjtu it can be seen that the optimal hull form with relatively better resistance performance can be obtained in the 5 dimensional design space for the optimization problems in this paper the maximum relative changes in the wet surface area and the drainage volume of the hull are 3 and 5 respectively it can also be seen from table 6 that due to the fact that the optimal hulls all have a generated bulbous bow the wet surface areas of the optimal hulls are all increased compared with the initial wigley hull without a bulbous bow as for the drainage volume however since the comprehensive effect by the shifting and rbf method the kle 5 and optimal hulls have a bit smaller drainage volumes to sum up for the optimal hulls their relative changes in wet surface area and drainage volume are all less than 2 and 3 respectively fig 14 shows the comparison of free surface wave elevation obtained by using naoe foam sjtu it can be seen from fig 14 that the decrease trend of the optimal hull s free surface wave elevation is consistent with that of the potential flow based calculation results and with the increase of the design space dimensionality the decrease of the corresponding optimal hull s free surface wave elevation is more severe fig 15 shows the comparison of dynamic pressure distribution on the hull surface obtained by using naoe foam sjtu the decrease trend of the area of high and low pressure regions calculated by potential flow and viscous flow solvers are consistent as a result in general the nmship sjtu solver can be used to optimize the total drag of the hull form at medium and high speeds and the optimization results are verified by the viscous cfd solver showing that the optimization effect of the total drag is obvious in addition the design space dimensionality reduction technique can reduce the huge computational cost of hydrodynamic evaluation and obtain the optimal hull with pretty good resistance performance it should be noted that since the hull form in the design space after dimensionality reduction is basically within the possible deformation range in the original high dimensional design space the smoothness of the hull grid mainly depends on the rationality of the deformation method and the selection of design variables in the original design space the mother ship adopted in this paper is wigley ship after generating an initial bulbous bow by rbf method the modified wigley ship hull is further optimized in the process of deformation the nurbs surface was firstly deformed which was mentioned in by liu et al 2019 local refinement of the control points of the nurbs surface at the bow part was carried out to ensure that after the bulbous bow was generated the hull surface mesh converted by the new hull nurbs surface had high quality and good smoothness therefore when we do further optimization of the modified wigley hull by rbf and shifting deformation methods the deformed hull surface mesh will still have good smoothness for actual ship form with complex bow and stern shapes the amount of grid points on the hull surface may be relatively larger so the dimensionality of the constructed matrix will increase which will increase the time required for dimensionality reduction but the essence of the linear reduced order method keeps unchanged it can be obviously seen from the body lines of the optimal hulls that the hull grids and nurbs surfaces have good smoothness which is meaningful to the numerical simulation hull grids and the actual construction hull nurbs surface for iges file format what s more from the view of the corresponding calculated flow fields before and after optimization since the flow fields are smooth the calculated hull grids are smooth enough last but not the least since the 5 dimensional design space can capture 95 deformation information of the 7 dimensional design space 5 information has been lost furthermore considering that the new design variables basis coefficients have some constraints the 2 dimensional projections are done to see the linear constraints adding into the sampling method and optimization algorithm however this operation is relatively conservative therefore the optimal hulls in the 7 dimensional design space and the 5 dimensional design space have some differences in the total drag reduction rate shown in table 6 however in the optimization case with a 7 dimensional design space 140 sample hulls need to be evaluated to guarantee the fidelity of the kriging krige 1951 surrogate model while in optimization cases with 1 3 5 dimensional design spaces only 40 60 100 sample hulls are needed that is to say the computational cost can have a 28 6 reduction in 5 dimensional design space which will be much more beneficial in the viscous flow based hull form optimization problems although its optimal hull kle 5 has a 2 7 total drag difference with the optimal hull after comprehensive consideration of optimization effectiveness and efficiency the new 5 dimensional design space can be regarded as the best design space dimensionality reduction result 5 application of linear dimensionality reduction method in multi physics field learning in the later stage of hull form optimization the optimization example in the previous section presents a simulation based design sbd optimization process which is widely used nowadays there is no doubt that for hull form optimization the resistance performance is a crucial item for various hydrodynamic performances of ships however in sbd optimization process after doing the hydrodynamic evaluations of each new hull form only a certain or some performance index values such as total drag sinkage or trim values are extracted for further optimization to obtain the optimal hull s which does not make full use of calculated multi physics field results of the samples for instance for the resistance performance evaluation the free surface wave elevation and pressure distribution on hull surface can be learned to analyse the main modes of the flow and the influence of hull form deformation to the flow field and then to have further understanding of a given hull form deformation design space furthermore according to the existing database of new hull forms fast hydrodynamic performance prediction especially the flow field prediction can also be made for any new hull in the design space 5 1 multi physics field database construction the basic principle of dimensionality reduction learning for geometric physical fields is almost the same as the dimensionality reduction techniques used previously in design space the main difference between the two is that in the database construction of the geometrical physical field the information contained in each new sample hull is not only the variation of grid point coordinates of the hull but also the wave height of the free surface and the dynamic pressure distribution on the hull surface so the vector can be written as x i t x 1 i y 1 i z 1 i x n p i y n p i z n p i η 1 i η 2 i η n f i p 1 i p 2 i p n p i where n p n f are the grid point numbers of the hull surface and free surface respectively when doing database construction it should be noted that it is best to obtain the dimensionless quantity of the geometric field and each physical field in the scale of the ship model specifically some equations can be used as follows 38 x x l w l 39 y y l w l 40 z z l w l 41 η η u 2 g 42 p p ρ u 2 there are two main reasons for this one is to prevent the phenomenon of large numbers eat the small for a ship model sailing in medium or high speed from a purely numerical point of view if we all use standard international units to measure compared with the dynamic pressure on the hull surface the free surface wave height is quite small therefore if the corresponding vector of each new hull form in the database contains the real values of the multi physics field the dimensionality reduction field learning can be completely subject to the pressure distribution and the information of hull geometrical changes and free surface wave elevation may be ignored and it s unlikely to reach the purpose of the entire geometrical physical field learning by making all the above physical quantities dimensionless they can be limited to a very small numerical range which weakens the possibility of large numbers eat the small phenomenon to a certain extent the other is that it is convenient for physical field data acquisition at different ship model scales through dimensionless operation to the sample new hulls in the database for geometrical physical fields after field learning the multi physics field can be quickly forecast for any new hull form within the design space and the fields are all dimensionless values with respect to the ship model waterline length if real values of the multi physics field for a certain ship model length is required the dimensionless quantities can be converted to real values just according to the above eqs 38 42 that is to say the dimensionless quantity has a wider range of generality which is not constrained by a certain geometric model scale for the 140 new sample hulls of the above modified wigley ship in the original 7 dimensional design space the geometric and physical field results obtained by nmship sjtu are integrated into the multi physics field learning database the example grid points contained in the database are shown in fig 16 which are required for the potential flow based calculation considering the symmetry of the geometrical physical field about the central sheer plane the calm water resistance evaluation is carried out by the half field calculation as shown in fig 16 where the number of free surface grid points is 24460 and the number of hull surface grid points is 8120 therefore for the multi physical field learning of the calm water resistance optimization database including hull geometry hull surface dynamic pressure distribution and free surface wave elevation the database contains 140 new hull forms and the number of data points containing multi physical field information of each new hull is 24460 4 8120 56940 5 2 influence of mode order on multi physics field reconstruction effect firstly according to the existing new sample hulls in the database the influence of the mode order m on the flow field reconstruction effect is discussed and the required mode order can be determined the changes of arithmetic square root arranged from largest to smallest of the eigenvalue and energy proportion corresponding to each mode contained in the database are shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively as can be seen in order to capture 99 of the total multi physics field information the first 10 modes should be selected the mean flow field and first 10 basis modes are shown in fig 19 below it is obvious that with the increase of m the amplitude of free surface wave height and hull surface pressure corresponding to the basis mode decreases gradually on the whole define relative error e r for the reconstruction or prediction error of the dimensionless multi physics field η x y z p after dimensionality reduction and the real field η x y z p of a certain new hull to be specific it is the arithmetic square root of ratio of the sum of squares of information difference total error energy to the real multi physics field information total energy that is 43 e r i 1 n f η i η i 2 i 1 n p x i x i 2 i 1 n p y i y i 2 i 1 n p z i z i 2 i 1 n p p i p i 2 i 1 n f η i 2 i 1 n p x i 2 i 1 n p y i 2 i 1 n p z i 2 i 1 n p p i 2 for each sample in the database the change relationship between its relative error e r and m is measured six samples are randomly selected from the database and the relationship is shown in fig 20 it can be found that with the increase of m the relative error of the reconstructed field corresponding to each new hull decreases monotonously and when m reaches 10 the relative error reaches less than 0 5 indicating that the reconstructed field has high credibility taking model 3 as an example the absolute error of the reconstructed flow field with m changing is shown in fig 21 it can be intuitively seen that the total absolute error of multi physical fields decreases gradually with the increase of m 5 3 influence of sample number on multi physics field reconstruction effect secondly according to the existing new sample hulls in the database the influence of sample number n on the multi physics field reconstruction effect is discussed to determine whether the number of existing samples is sufficient therefore select 2500 or 5000 sample points in the original design space by sobol method which correspond to 2500 or 5000 new hull forms and do the resistance performance evaluations of the new hulls by nmship sjtu to build the two new databases and do the dimensionality reduction multi physics field learning using the two databases the variation of en with m with different sample numbers n is shown in fig 22 it can be seen that the three change curves almost coincide indicating that with the increase of m the change of the proportion of the total energy truncation of multiple physical fields is almost synchronized under different sample numbers in other words the database built with 140 new hulls used in the existing hull form optimization case is enough to capture the change rule of the multi physics fields with the hull form in the original design space 5 4 prediction effect analysis of multi physics field for new hull form thirdly according to the previous analysis it can be known that for each sample hull existing in the database if the basis modes and their coefficients corresponding to the sample hull are known using formula like eq 3 the reconstructed multi physics fields can be quickly obtained when m 10 is selected the reconstruction error is small enough however more often than not we need to quickly predict the multi physical fields of new hulls that are not in the database although the basis modes of the database have already been determined each basis coefficient corresponding to the not in the database new hull cannot be directly solved by formula like eq 3 therefore it is necessary to find a general method to quickly obtain the basis coefficients considering that each new hull in the database is determined by 7 hull form deformation design variables and first 10 basis modes with their corresponding coefficients are determined therefore a total of 10 kriging surrogate models for design variables hull form deformation parameters and each basis coefficient for multi physics field interpolation can be established so that for any new hull the basis coefficient can be obtained and then the multi physics field information can be predicted quickly the following is a brief verification of the prediction error of the multi physics field for a not in the database new hull here variable names x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 are corresponding to the design variables in table 2 that define the hull form deformation in the 7 dimensional design space that is to say x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x z y α 1 α 2 α 3 α 4 for the convenience of expression each design variable of the new hull form is unitized i e 44 x i x i x i min x i max x i min i 1 2 7 obviously we have x i 0 1 i 1 2 7 since the original design space is a standard hypercube and define x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 take a new hull whose normalized design variables are x 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 as an example through kriging models the 10 basis coefficients can be obtained and the prediction multi physics field can be got compared with the real field evaluated by nmship sjtu solver the physical field information is almost identical shown in fig 23 and quantitative analysis of the relative error is given in table 7 therefore the multi physical fields corresponding to any new hull in the design space can be quickly predicted with the number of samples n 140 and the mode order m 10 5 5 sensitivity analysis of hull form optimization design variables sensitivity analysis investigates the influence of an independent variable on the dependent variable when other independent variables remain unchanged for a multi variable problem by using the above results the geometrical and flow field corresponding to any new hull can be quickly obtained with high accuracy and then the influence of all design variables on the flow field details such as free surface wave elevation and hull surface dynamic pressure distribution can be analyzed fig 24 shows the changing trend of the relative change rate of the wave making drag coefficient corresponding to the new hull when each dimensionless design variable changes from 0 to 1 the relative change rate of wave making drag coefficient is positively correlated with the design variables x 3 x 5 x 6 x 7 but negatively correlated with the design variables x 1 x 2 x 4 in addition the design variables x 1 x 3 x 4 have a greater effect on the wave making drag coefficient which is called more sensitive it can be inferred that the change of design variables x 1 x 3 x 4 will lead to the obvious change of the free surface wave elevation and the dynamic pressure distribution on the hull surface the variation trend of free surface wave elevation and the dynamic pressure distribution on the hull surface when changing x 1 and x 3 are respectively given below taking 0 1 as an interval sensitivity analysis is conducted on the design variable x 1 and the dimensionality reduction model could be used to quickly obtain the corresponding multi physics fields of each new hull as shown in fig 25 it can be seen that with the increase of x 1 the bulbous bow of the ship elongates the phase of the wave system moves forward as a whole and the high and low pressure regions of the hull surface move forward with their areas decreasing which is conducive to the reduction of the wave making drag coefficient taking 0 1 as an interval sensitivity analysis is also conducted on the design variable x 3 it can be seen from fig 26 that with the increase of x 3 the bulbous bow becomes wider and the phase of the wave systems move forward as a whole however the peak value of the bow wave becomes larger and the area of high pressure region at the bow increases which is not conducive to the reduction of the wave making drag coefficient the above conclusions obtained from the flow field are consistent with the sensitivity analysis results in fig 24 similarly the influence of the other design variables on the flow fields can be analyzed sequentially although the sensitivity analysis in this paper focuses on the wave making resistance coefficient c w which can be directly predicted through kriging surrogate model it should be noted that for sensitivity analysis each new hull form needed is almost located on the boundary surfaces of the design space so it will hardly be in the database of flow field learning that is to say if there are no flow field learning steps in order to directly observe the change of hull surface pressure distribution and the free surface wave elevation with respect to a certain design variable additional numerical simulations should be done making the computational cost larger through flow field learning the main flow field information corresponding to any new hull form can be obtained within a few seconds and the overall error can be controlled within 1 therefore it can be considered as high fidelity and high efficiency prediction it can also be seen intuitively from the fig 25 in the paper for instance that when x 1 changes alone how the flow field of the new hull will change which is predicted by the flow field learning using reduced order method instead of numerical simulation directly according to the nm potential flow theory the wave making resistance coefficient c w and the flow fields namely the hull surface pressure distribution and the free surface wave elevation are closely related therefore the flow field learning method can be used to match the resistance performance index and the flow field with each other by very small computational costs last but not the least for other optimization problems this process can also be implemented in the same way in the later stage of hull form optimization in order to quickly predict the flow field of any new hull form in the design space of the given optimization problem this is of greater significance for the high fidelity hydrodynamic performance evaluation based on viscous flow such as using rans based solver to obtain the flow fields 6 conclusions and future work in this paper the pod or kle method is used as the linear dimensionality reduction method and the steps of dimensionality reduction of the design space are introduced furthermore some important problems for the design space dimensionality reduction in hull form optimization such as retainability of fixed control points irrelevance of the relative order of data to dimensionality reduction results and decision of the new design space range after dimensionality reduction are deep discussed the application of the dimensionality reduction method for design space dimensionality reduction in the earlier stage of hull form optimization and the multi physics field learning in the later stage of hull form optimization is given through the resistance optimization of the wigley ship and the applicability and reliability of the method are demonstrated by analyzing the influence of mode order and sample number on the reconstruction effect of the hull shape or multi physics field and the prediction effect of multi physics field for new hull form in detail current results are promising showing that the linear dimensionality reduction method can reduce the amount of calculation for surrogate based optimization and be used for quick prediction of multi physics fields of any new form in the design space it should be added that the possible deformations in the new design space obtained by the linear dimensionality reduction method cannot completely reach the possible deformations in the original design space due to the information loss of hull form deformation such as the deformation at the bulbous bow in this example for any new hull form in original design space the reconstructed hull form after the dimensionality reduction has more or less error which is also directly contributing to the slightly inferior drag reduction effect of the optimal hulls in the dimensionality reduced design space compared with that in the original design space future work includes the application extensions of dimensionality reduction method such as from the linear dimensionality reduction method to the nonlinear dimensionality reduction method which may make the reconstruction error of new hull form less and then an optimal hull with better hydrodynamic resistance performance may be obtained furthermore although this paper presents the application of linear dimensionality reduction method in the multi physics field learning in the later stage of hull form optimization the objective function of hull form optimization cannot be calm water drag only and the hydrodynamic performance evaluation method cannot be based on potential flow theory only in parallel a similar approach is being applied to optimize the velocity field at the propeller disk by deforming the ship stern with viscous flow cfd method herein the grid topology relationship at propeller disk of the new hull forms may not be completely consistent not to say that there is no unified grid topology relationship for unstructured grids financial support decheng wan reports

20346,in the earlier stage of hull form optimization design a series of design variables is usually needed to control the hull shape so as to find optimal hull forms with better performance in the surrogate based hydrodynamic performance optimization for ships with the increase of the dimensionality of design space the number of new sample hulls to construct surrogate model needs to be larger which will bring a large amount of calculation through reduced order method the dimensionality of the optimization design space can be reduced while keeping the deformation range of the original design space to a great extent for instance using the linear combination of a smaller number of bases to represent the deformation range in addition in the later stage of hull form optimization design flow field results of the new sample hulls can be fully utilized to do the dimensionality reduction multi physics field learning in this paper the principle of the proper orthogonal decomposition method is used and briefly introduced the steps of dimensionality reduction of the design space are shown then and some important problems for the design space dimensionality reduction in the specific field of hull form optimization such as retainability of fixed control points irrelevance of the relative order of data to dimensionality reduction results and decision of the new design space range after dimensionality reduction are deep analyzed furthermore taking the resistance optimization of the modified wigley ship as an example the specific application and error analysis of the dimensionality reduction method for design space dimensionality reduction in the earlier stage of hull form optimization and the multi physics field learning in the later stage of hull form optimization are given and the applicability and reliability of the method are demonstrated by analyzing the influence of mode order and sample number on reconstruction effect of the hull shape or flow field and the prediction effect of flow field for not in the database new hull form in detail results show that the linear dimensionality reduction method can reduce samples needed for optimization thus reduce the amount of calculation for the surrogate based hull form optimization and be used for quick prediction of multi physics fields of any new form in the design space furthermore it can not only be applied to the sensitivity analysis or a pareto frontier selection in comprehensive performance optimization of hull form based on cfd but also be implemented in the real time forecast of the flow field and influence analysis of the ship performance when adjusting the hull form or hull appendages keywords dimensionality reduction hull form optimization proper orthogonal decomposition design space multi physics field learning sensitivity analysis 1 introduction for the hull form optimization problem if the number of design variables that control the hull form deformation is small the hull shape change may be small in a certain design space that is the geometry variation is not enough therefore the improvement of the performance index of the optimal hull is relatively limited on the contrary if there are more parameters controlling the change of hull shape the possible changes of hull form will be more abundant that is to say in the high dimensional design space more diverse geometry variations will be generated and the optimal hull with much better performance can be found theoretically in order to avoid the difficulty of solving the optimization problems in the high dimensional design space caused by the curse of dimensionality different kinds of dimensionality reduction technologies for the design space have been proposed and widely applied including online dimensionality reduction technology and off line dimensionality reduction technology the so called dimensionality reduction means to reduce the data dimension as far as possible on the premise that it basically includes all the information involved in the set of high dimensional data vectors that is to basically represent all possible changes in the higher dimensional design space using a lower dimensional design space through the dimensionality reduction of the design space of hull form deformation parameters design variables a smaller number of design variables in the lower dimensional design space can represent any possible hull shape change without losing much geometry variation information in original high dimensional design space therefore the design of experiment can be implemented in the new lower dimensional design space where the new design variables can basically represent all possible changes in the higher dimensional design space for the surrogate based optimization the number of new sample hulls needed to evaluate will be reduced due to the reduction of design space dimensionality so the calculation cost will be reduced and then the optimization efficiency will be improved online design space dimensionality reduction technology needs to evaluate the objective function such as hydrodynamic performance index or its gradient lukaczyk et al 2014 proposed a search strategy for active dimensionality reduction subspace however such methods could not evaluate and reduce dimensionality of the design space for various hull form deformation methods in advance that is they cannot consider the strong relationship that may exist in the hull shape changes controlled only by different design variables off line design space dimensionality reduction technology mainly considers the variability of the design space which does not need the evaluation of the objective functions let alone the gradient information of them in terms of the decision of the new feature independent variable in the new dimensionality reduced design space the off line dimensionality reduction methods can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction methods feature selection is just a filtering of the original features that is a subset of independent variables in the original high dimensional space is chosen which usually have the greatest influence on the dependent variables feature extraction is to condense and construct a new set of features on the basis of original features that is it converts the old set of high dimensional variables into a new set of low dimensional variables by data analysis in this paper the dimensionality reduction method of feature extraction is further elaborated and studied proper orthogonal decomposition pod also known as principal component analysis pca or karhunen loève expansion kle pearson 1901 wold et al 1987 jollife 1986 diez et al 2015 is one of the most classic but still most widely used linear reduced order methods the basic idea of this method is to construct a lower dimensional linear space making the projection of a certain number of high dimensional data set on it as large as possible in other words mapping the high dimensional data set into a low dimensional data set by constructing a transformation while making the low dimensional data set keep the change variance information of the original high dimensional data set as much as possible however when there are complex nonlinear relationships between design variables some linear dimensionality reduction methods may not work well in order to reduce the dimensionality of the design space under the premise of capturing the nonlinear information in the original high dimensional design space the nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods were proposed and developed successively after the linear method such as local pca lpca lloyd 1982 kambhatla et al 1997 luxburg 2004 kernel pca kpca scholkopf 1998 and deep auto encoder dae hinton et al 2006 both linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods have their advantages and disadvantages the main advantage of the nonlinear method is that it can capture the nonlinear relationship between the original high dimensional data while reducing the dimensionality however it may need some additional parameter settings and debugging in the calculation to ensure that the relative error before and after dimensionality reduction is small enough so the calculation stability is not as good as the linear method in addition the basis in the linear method usually has a clear physical concept and the new samples can be reconstructed through its linear superposition conveniently such as the changes of hull geometry while the nonlinear mapping relationship in the nonlinear method is only on the mathematical level and its physical significance is not obvious furthermore both linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods have been widely used in image compression signal processing text classification and many other engineering fields however the application of dimensionality reduction technology in the field of hull form optimization is relatively rare chen et al 2014 optimized the delft catamaran calm water drag under a certain speed by using kle method on two design spaces of 20 free form deformation ffd parameters the dimensionalities of the new design spaces after dimensionality reduction become 4 and 6 respectively and the optimal hulls in the two new design spaces have a 9 63 and 6 89 reduction respectively diez et al 2015 briefly gave the basic principle of design space dimensionality reduction and an optimization application of calm water drag for the high speed catamaran by using kle method on the 20 dimensional design space the dimensionalities of the new design spaces after dimensionality reduction are controlled no more than 4 optimization results show that there are significantly positive correlations between the total drag reduction degree and dimensionality of the new design space d agostino et al 2020 used kle method to optimize the calm water drag of dtmb 5415 ship by reducing the dimensionality of the design spaces composed of design variables of ffd radial basis function rbf and global modification function gmf methods under the precondition of keeping 95 geometric changes in the original design space after dimensionality reduction the final design space dimensionalities are reduced by 86 16 and 37 respectively as a matter of fact the application of dimensionality reduction technology in hull form optimization is more than design space dimensionality reduction of hull form deformation serani et al 2016 2018 gave examples of optimizing the calm water drag of dtmb 5415 ship by using the potential flow theory for performance evaluation considering the change of the hull geometry and physics field several reduced order methods such as kle lpca kpca and dae were used for multi physics field learning with the number of geometric and physical field information grid points 5101 under the premise that the overall relative error is no more than 5 the number of bases that contain the multi physics field information are 18 14 15 15 respectively by the four dimensionality reduction methods indicating that there is a strong correlation in the geometrical physical field to sum up in order to reduce the number of samples to evaluate and improve the surrogate based optimization efficiency in the earlier stage of the hull form optimization design space dimensionality reduction can be implemented after evaluations of the new sample hulls determined by design of experiment the geometrical physical field database can be naturally formed and the flow field dimensionality reduction learning can be carried out further therefore the application of reduced order method can run through from the earlier stage to the later stage of the hull form optimization process but there are few relevant studies at present this paper aims to give specific steps and quantitative error analysis of dimensionality reduction method used in the earlier stage of hull form optimization and the multi physics field learning in the later stage of hull form optimization furthermore deep discussions on some important problems such as retainability of fixed control points irrelevance of the relative order of data to dimensionality reduction results and decision of the new design space range after dimensionality reduction in the specific field of hull form optimization are given in detail 2 basic principles of linear dimensionality reduction method in the process of hull form optimization after determining the hull form deformation methods and their corresponding design space a series of new hull forms can be obtained based on the design of experiment results that is a hull form database is obtained consider each new hull form as a sample and arrange the three dimensional grid point coordinates of each hull form in the same order for example x i t x 1 i y 1 i z 1 i x 2 i y 2 i z 2 i x n p i y n p i z n p i where np is the number of grid points on the hull surface a series of column vectors can be got in order to use a linear combination of very few basis vectors to characterize the change of the hull form to the initial hull in the design space the most important thing is to determine the basis vectors and the number of basis obviously for all samples in the database we can obtain the average hull form geometric field x and regard the geometric field of any sample hull form as a linear superposition of the average geometric field and an infinite number of unit orthogonal basis modes as follows 1 x i x j 1 a i j u j where 2 a i j x i x t u j u i u j δ i j if only m finite basis modes u 1 u 2 u m are selected the reconstructed geometric field x i r e c can be expressed as 3 x i r e c x j 1 m a i j u j because of the truncation of the number of series items a cutoff error is produced considering that the deviation between the real geometric field and the reconstructed geometric field of all samples in the database should be as small as possible the total error e m u 1 u 2 u m is measured by the square sum of the modulus length of the error vector in euclidean space namely 4 e m u 1 u 2 u m i 1 n x i x i r e c 2 and we can get 5 e m u 1 u 2 u m i 1 n x i x j 1 m a i j u j 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n j 1 m a i j u j t j 1 m a i j u j 2 i 1 n x i x t j 1 m a i j u j it can be seen from the above equation that the total error is divided into three parts for a certain sample set e 1 is a constant consider the remaining two parts 6 e 2 i 1 n u 1 t a i 1 t u 2 t a i 2 t u m t a i m t a i 1 u 1 a i 2 u 2 a i m u m j 1 m u j t i 1 n a i j t a i j u j j 1 m u j t i 1 n u j t x i x x i x t u j u j j 1 m i 1 n u j t x i x x i x t u j u j t u j j 1 m u j t i 1 n x i x x i x t u j 7 e 3 2 i 1 n x i x t j 1 m x i x t u j u j 2 i 1 n j 1 m u j t x i x x i x t u j 2 j 1 m u j t i 1 n x i x x i x t u j finally we have 8 e m e 1 e 2 e 3 i 1 n x i x 2 j 1 m u j t i 1 n x i x x i x t u j denote the difference between the geometric field of each sample hull form x i and the average geometry x as x i x i x and define the matrix x x 1 x 2 x n then 9 x x t x 1 x 2 x n x 1 t x 2 t x n t i 1 n x i x i t i 1 n x i x x i x t therefore the total error can be denoted as 10 e m i 1 n x i x 2 j 1 m u j t x x t u j assuming that m is certain the constrained optimization problem on the basis u 1 u 2 u m can be defined as follows 11 min e m u 1 u 2 u m i 1 n x i x 2 j 1 m u j t x x t u j s t u j t u j 1 using the lagrange multiplier method the lagrange function corresponding to the above objective function is defined as 12 l u 1 u 2 u m λ 1 λ 2 λ m e m j 1 m λ j 1 u j t u j let the partial derivatives of lagrange function with respect to each basis be 0 i e 13 l u j 0 we have 14 x x t u j λ j u j in other words the basis we re looking for should be the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues of matrix s x x t ℝ 3 n p 3 n p generally there are two ways to determine λ j one is to directly calculate the eigenvalue of square matrix s whose dimension is the number of grid point coordinates on the hull surface the other is to solve the singular value of matrix x or x t according to the relation between the singular value of x or x t and the eigenvalue of s from the perspective of improving the efficiency of numerical calculation since the number of grid point coordinates stored in geometric field is generally greater even far greater than the number of samples in the database in order to calculate the eigenvalue of matrix s we can solve the singular value decomposition of matrix x instead namely 15 x u d v t σ 1 u 1 v 1 t σ 2 u 2 v 2 t σ r u r v r t where σ 1 σ 2 σ r 0 then we have 16 x x t u j u d v t v d t u t u j u d 2 u t u j u d i a g σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ r 2 0 0 u t u j σ j 2 u j where the basis u j happens to be the j th column of the matrix u obtained by singular value decomposition of x next the number of intercepted basis modes m should be determined from the perspective of capturing the total energy information of the geometric field the energy contained in the basis u j can be defined as the sum of squares of the u j direction projection of the geometric field vector corresponding to each sample 17 i 1 n x i u k 2 i 1 n j 1 a i j u j u k 2 i 1 n a i k 2 i 1 n x i t u k t x i t u k u k t x x t u k σ j 2 according to the above formula we can see that the energy contained in the basis u j is exactly the eigenvalue corresponding to the basis u j as the eigenvector of matrix s therefore define the percentage of energy truncation can be defined as 18 e n j 1 m σ j 2 j 1 3 n p σ j 2 100 where m can be regarded as the smallest positive integer that meets the inequality e n 95 at this point we believe that the eigenvectors corresponding to the first m maximum eigenvalues of matrix s contain 95 of the geometric field information in the whole database so far we almost get the reconstructed geometric field after dimensionality reduction in fact the derivation of kle given by diez et al 2015 is based on setting up the energy integral as a functional and uses variational method to obtain the conditions that the basis mode vectors should satisfy in this paper the so called pod or pca method is used directly to minimize the overall reconstruction error of the hull geometry database and an optimization problem with constraints can be established and conditions that the basis mode vectors should meet can be got finally it turns out that they are essentially the same therefore we can say kle pca and pod are just called differently in different fields but essentially the same method 3 further discussion on dimensionality reduction of hull form optimization design space in the following several important problems arising from the dimensionality reduction of hull form optimization design space in the early stage are further discussed 3 1 retainability of fixed control points when the hull is deformed it is often required that the grid points at some positions cannot be moved such as the design waterline middle longitudinal section and some transverse sections such special positions can be limited by using the traditional hull form deformation methods to ensure that the grid points do not move at these positions however after the dimensionality reduction of the design space if the new hull form controlled by the new design variables has some slight deviation in the grid points coordinates of special positions it will make the deformed hull do not meet the design requirements if the coordinate in a certain direction of one grid point needs to remain unchanged the coordinate of this position such as the k th coordinate 1 k 3 n p in each sample hull form vector x i obtained by the original hull form deformation methods remains unchanged then the coordinate of this position in the average new hull form vector x is also the original value and the columns of the matrix x x 1 x 2 x n are defined by x i x i x so we have 19 x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x k 1 x k 2 x k n x 3 n p 1 x 3 n p 2 x 3 n p n x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n 0 0 0 x 3 n p 1 x 3 n p 2 x 3 n p n then 20 x x t 0 0 0 0 0 0 assume α be the eigenvector of the matrix x x t with respect to eigenvalue λ then 21 0 0 0 0 0 0 α 1 α 2 α k α 3 n p λ α 1 α 2 α k α 3 n p considering that the eigenvalues corresponding to each basis mode obtained by dimensionality reduction are all positive real numbers it is only necessary to consider λ 0 then 22 0 λ α 1 α 2 α k α 3 n p therefore we get 23 α k 0 that is the k th coordinate of the corresponding basis vector is 0 for arbitrary reconstructed new hull form x i r e c after dimensionality reduction according to eq 2 it is easy to know that the k th coordinate is still the original value therefore for any reconstructed new hull form the fixed points for the primitive hull form deformation methods keep unchanged after dimensionality reduction 3 2 irrelevance of the relative order of data to dimensionality reduction results when the hull is deformed the coordinates of the grid points on the hull surface will change to some extent but the topological relationship among the grid points will not change however in actual dimensionality reduction operation there is no clear rule for the sequence of each new hull form in the database when the coordinates are written into column vector and there is also no clear rule for the arrangement of different new hull forms that is the column vectors as a result it is necessary to discuss whether the uncertainty of relative position will have an impact on the new reconstructed hull forms obtained by dimensionality reduction of the design space of course the first thing we must ensure is that the orders of each new coordinate point for each new hull form and original hull form are exactly the same under this premise the so called uncertainty of relative position is actually the uncertainty of the relative position of the rows or columns in the matrix x x 1 x 2 x n without loss of generality the following analysis will only take the uncertainty of the relative position of the rows as an example assuming that the deviation matrices obtained are x and x respectively before and after exchanging the locations of the coordinates of each new hull form then it s obviously that x is the row transformation of x which is the result of several elementary row transformations that only exchange certain two rows and it can be expressed in matrix form as 24 x h n h n 1 h 2 h 1 x h x where h k 1 h k t k 1 2 n then we have 25 h 1 h t let s x x t then 26 s x x t h x x t h t h x x t h 1 h s h 1 therefore s s and the eigenvalues of the two matrices are the same assume α be the eigenvector of the matrix s with respect to eigenvalue λ i e 27 s α λ α then 28 s h α h s α λ h α that is to say h α is the eigenvector of the matrix s with respect to eigenvalue λ and h α is just the basis mode after exchanging locations of the coordinates of α therefore we can know that after exchanging the locations of the coordinates of each new hull form the order of reconstructed hull form vector by design space dimensionality reduction has the same change but they essentially both represent the same new hull form consequently the relative order of data is irrelative to the dimensionality reduction results admittedly the dimensionality reduction process cannot be directly guided by the proof given above if not given however we can t ensure theoretically that different researchers use the same database such as the new samples ship hulls and the corresponding geometrical fields to do the dimensionality reduction operation and have the same dimensionality reduction results under different data arrangements this proof demonstrates the irrelevance of data order allowing researchers to set the order of data arbitrarily 3 3 decision of the new design space range after dimensionality reduction after dimensionality reduction of the design space the dimensionality of the design space reduces and the design variables are changed from the original hull form deformation parameters to the coefficients of the basis modes in order to ensure that the deformation in the new design space after dimensionality reduction does not exceed the deformation range controlled by the original design space the ranges of new design variables after dimensionality reduction need to be further determined otherwise it is very likely to produce unreasonable unreal new hull forms according to eqs 2 and 3 it is easy to know that the approximate range of the basis coefficient is 29 a j min x i x x i x t u j max x i x x i x t u j i 1 2 n that is the value range of each basis coefficient can be estimated through n new sample ship hull forms in order to ensure the accuracy of range estimation n new samples in the database should cover the original design space as much as possible therefore the dense sampling strategy is adopted in this paper for example n 5000 and the basis coefficients obtained from 5000 new sample hulls are projected in two dimensions to obtain the spatial distribution of the basis coefficients and value ranges of the new design variables in the dimensionality reduction design space can be determined as a matter of fact there may be additional constraints on the design variables therefore the new design space may no longer be a regular hypercube design space if one ignores this the new design space hypercube may include some new ship forms which may be beyond the possible hull deformations controlled by the original design space and may not satisfy some geometric constraints of hull deformation controlled by the original design space such as the relative change of wet surface area and other constraints or may not be like practical hull forms such as having strange bulbous bow shape therefore a practical method of two dimensional projections between the new design variables will be proposed in this paper to keep the hull deformation in the new design space within the limits of the original design space as much as possible later in the new design variable with constraints in order to ensure no computational costs waste the method of sequential constrained monte carlo golchi et al 2016 is used to do the design of experiment in the constrained design space 4 application in design space dimensionality reduction in earlier stage of hull form optimization in the following we give an example of using the linear dimensionality reduction method to reduce the dimensionality of the hull form optimization design space to illustrate its applicability in earlier stage of hull form optimization 4 1 basic information of the mother ship wigley ship is a kind of parabolic mathematical hull form commonly used in the field of ship research which is regarded as the initial mother ship in this paper the hull is slender which conforms to the small perturbation assumption of linear potential theory and has abundant experimental test results to refer the ship has no specific design speed and can be numerically simulated over a wide range of speed and compared with the experimental results its three dimensional model is shown in fig 1 and the main particulars are shown in table 1 since it conforms to small disturbance assumption of the linear theory when it sails in calm water under high speed its free surface wave elevation is obvious at this time the wave making drag accounted for the proportion of the total drag is relatively big and the potential flow theory such as neumann michell nm potential flow theory noblesse et al 2013 can be used for rapid prediction of wave making drag furthermore the 1957 ittc plate frictional drag coefficient formula can be used to get the approximate frictional drag and the total drag of the ship hull based on the potential flow theory can be got finally which is the sum of the wave making drag and the frictional drag 4 2 definition of optimization problem in this section after generating a basic bulbous bow on the basis of the original wigley ship liu et al 2019 the total drag of a modified wigley ship can be further optimized under the speed froude number 0 3 the radial basis function rbf method is used to carry out the hull form deformation at the bulbous bow and the shifting method is used to adjust the section area curve sac of the whole ship where the cross section of the front and aft halves can be independently translated along the direction of the ship length as shown in fig 2 the sobol 1979 sampling method is adopted to sample in the 7 dimensional design space the ranges of design variables are shown in table 2 all the range values of variables are dimensionless values with respect to the ship model waterline length wherein x corresponds to the coordinate of point p1 in the direction of the ship length z corresponds to the coordinate of point p1 in the direction of ship draught and y corresponds to the coordinate of point p2 in the direction of the ship width in fig 2 it should be noted that the moveable control points along the ship width are moved symmetrically about the central sheer plane of the hull using the rbf deformation method these deformation parameters control the length height and width of the bulbous bow respectively for the shifting method yang et al 2016 modified function g is introduced to modify the sac of ship hull and new hull forms can be obtained by shifting hull lines of each station along the x direction 30 g α 1 0 5 1 cos 2 π x α 2 α 2 x 1 0 5 x 1 x α 2 α 1 0 5 1 cos 2 π x α 2 α 2 x 2 0 5 α 2 x x 2 0 elsewhere where x 1 x 2 represents the start and end points of the shifting range in x direction α 1 represents the amplitude of the modified function and α 2 represents the fixed point section in the shifting range the sac of the initial hull and the deformed hull is shown by the black dot line and green solid line in fig 3 for the optimization problem here there exist two shifting regions namely fore part region 1 and aft part region 2 in shifting region 1 according to eq 30 the modified function g 1 can be written by setting x 1 0 x 2 0 5 likewise in shifting region 2 according to eq 30 the modified function g 2 can be written by setting x 1 0 5 x 2 0 here α 1 and α 3 represent the amplitudes of the modification functions for sac of the fore and aft halves in the shifting method while α 2 and α 4 represent the locations of the fixed cross sections for the fore and aft halves in shifting method the objective function of this optimization problem is the calm water total drag r t at the sailing froude number 0 3 as shown below 31 min f o b j r t 4 3 optimization results and analysis with design space dimensionality reduction according to the deformation methods and the design variables the original design space is determined and dense samplings by sobol method can be got then a large number of new hull forms can be further obtained according to the design variable values of the sample points within the design space which can build a geometry field database in order to use in the design space dimensionality reduction process firstly the influence of different dense sampling numbers on dimensionality reduction of design space should be discussed set n 1250 2500 5000 10000 respectively after dimensionality reduction by these numbers of new sample hulls and combining with eq 18 the variation of en with the number of bases m and different sample numbers n can be obtained as shown in fig 4 as can be seen from fig 4 for a large sample number n selecting m 5 can satisfy the energy truncation percentage greater than 95 that is to say we can think that the eigenvectors corresponding to the first five maximum eigenvalues of matrix s contain 95 of the information of all possible changes of hull forms in the original design space the basis vectors modes obtained by dimensionality reduction using the database constructed by different sample points n are shown in fig 5 for convenience of display the components of three directions in the spatial cartesian coordinate system are given on each grid point of the original modified wigley ship hull since the length euclid norm of each basis vector is limited to 1 when reflected on the hull surface the absolute coordinates of each grid point values are quite small therefore according to the maximum of each basis coefficient each basis vector times the maximum of the corresponding basis coefficient which can also show the distribution law of the grid point coordinates change i e the hull geometric deformation corresponding to different basis modes it is not difficult to find that when n is greater than 2500 the pictures tend to be consistent indicating that the number of dense sampling n is sufficient we select n 5000 as the sample number of the database and the obtained basis modes are used for further study table 3 below gives the approximate value ranges of design variables corresponding to the new design space after dimensionality reduction obtained from eq 29 taking a deformed hull form in the database as an example the influence of different mode number m on the hull form reconstructed error is analyzed as shown in fig 6 the solid black line represents an initially modified wigley ship hull and the dotted red line represents a deformed ship hull in the database which is controlled by a total of 7 design variables of rbf and shifting methods since k 1 2 3 4 5 can be chosen the contribution of each basis mode to the final reconstruction of the hull form is analyzed below set k 1 2 3 4 5 respectively and the reconstructed hull form can be obtained by the following equation 32 x r e c k x j 1 k a j u j as shown in fig 7 the body line comparison and absolute error of the grid point coordinates in three directions reconstructed deformed hull in red minus target deformed hull in black of the two hulls are given due to the fact that before and after deformation of a hull the topological relationship of the grid points between the two hulls remains the same for display convenience the absolute error of the grid point coordinates in three directions of the two hulls is shown on the grid points of the preliminary modified wigley hull with an initially generated bulbous bow it can be seen that with the increase of the number of selected basis modes the absolute error between the real and reconstructed deformed hull decreases gradually with no more than 5 basis modes selected the final dimensionality reduction effect is that the dimensionality of the design space is reduced from 7 to no more than 5 then the total drag optimization in the new design space which is constituted by bases no more than the first five that are obtained by dimensionality reduction can be done according to the value range of each variable in the design space after dimensionality reduction obtained above optimal latin hypercube sampling olhs designs liu et al 2018 can be carried out for the new design space with m 1 3 5 and 20 60 100 sample points can be obtained respectively it should be noted however that the olhs approach picks samples within a regular hypercube design space which based on previous analysis may be larger than the actual feasible range but it is difficult to obtain their complex relationship theoretically from the perspective of practical application based on the dense sampling with n 5000 5000 reconstructed new hull forms with their corresponding five new design variable values can be obtained after doing projections of the five design variables in two dimensional spaces we can almost get new design variables spatial distributions and a new boundary can be regarded as a new constraint among new design variables although this may lead to a more conservative new hull form taking m 5 as an example the two dimensional projections of the corresponding basis coefficients of 5000 new samples after dimensionality reduction are respectively given as shown in the blue dots in fig 8 it can be seen clearly that after the dimensionality reduction the new design space is no longer a hypercube for the basis modes themselves however they do not change depending on whether their coefficient ranges constitute a hypercube therefore if we use olhs method to obtain the new hulls without considering the constraints as shown in the 100 green points in fig 8 there will be some new hull forms out of the real design space predictably they are beyond the scope of deformation in original design space and may be unrealistic hull forms it can be seen from fig 8 b g and i that a relatively conservative irregular design space with constraints among design variables can be determined through the boundary lines of two dimensional projections constraints can be regarded as linear inequality constraints in the form as follows 33 f 1 a 1 a 3 0 f 2 a 1 a 3 0 f 3 a 1 a 3 0 f 4 a 1 a 3 0 f 5 a 2 a 5 0 f 6 a 2 a 5 0 f 7 a 3 a 5 0 in this new irregular design space 5 dimensional new design variables with a number of 100 can be obtained through the scmc method with the use of maximum minimum distance criterion which fully satisfy all the above inequalities making full use of the design space boundaries and avoiding the waste of calculation resources shown above the constraints between the first five basis coefficients a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 have already been obtained by two dimensional projections for the cases of m 1 and m 3 only a 1 and a 1 a 2 a 3 changes specifically for the case of m 1 only the maximum and minimum values of the projection a 1 need to be given through dense sampling that is a 1 min x i x x i x t u 1 max x i x x i x t u 1 i 1 2 n for the case of m 3 after roughly giving maximum and minimum values of a 1 a 2 a 3 like above the constraint relationship between the three coefficients needs to be given through two dimensional projections of a 1 a 2 a 1 a 3 a 2 a 3 which can be seen from fig 8 a b and e in the case of m 5 so the projections of a 1 a 2 a 1 a 3 a 2 a 3 are not given repeatedly therefore after design space dimensionality reduction the new hull form optimization problem whose design space dimensionalities are m 1 3 5 respectively can be defined as follows 34 min r t r f r w s t m 1 m 3 m 5 a 1 0 273 0 177 a 1 0 273 0 177 a 2 0 120 0 111 a 3 0 133 0 086 f 1 a 1 a 3 0 f 2 a 1 a 3 0 f 3 a 1 a 3 0 f 4 a 1 a 3 0 a 1 0 273 0 177 a 2 0 120 0 111 a 3 0 133 0 086 a 4 0 073 0 073 a 5 0 061 0 061 f 1 a 1 a 3 0 f 2 a 1 a 3 0 f 3 a 1 a 3 0 f 4 a 1 a 3 0 f 5 a 2 a 5 0 f 6 a 2 a 5 0 f 7 a 3 a 5 0 the hydrodynamic performance evaluation tool used in this optimization problem is the in house solver nmship sjtu liu et al 2020 based on the nm potential flow theory fig 9 shows the comparison of wigley ship s free surface wave elevation at fr 0 3 which is calculated by using in house nmship sjtu and rans based naoe foam sjtu shen et al 2015 solvers it can be seen that the positions of the bow and stern wave systems calculated by the two solvers are basically the same and the height ranges of the peaks and troughs are also roughly the same indicating that using potential flow theory can efficiently and accurately capture the calm water free surface wave elevation in addition according to the experimental test data of wigley ship model given by ship research institute sri the drag coefficient calculated by nmship sjtu is further verified among them nmship sjtu is used to get the wave making drag coefficient c w and 1957 ittc formula is used to calculate the frictional drag coefficient c f and the total drag coefficient c t is obtained by adding the two the conversion formulas of total wave making and frictional drags r t r w r f and their corresponding coefficients c t c w c f are as follows 35 c t r t 1 2 ρ u 2 s 36 c w r w 1 2 ρ u 2 s 37 c f r f 1 2 ρ u 2 s where ρ u s represent the fluid water density ship speed and static wet surface area respectively as can be seen from fig 10 the total drag coefficient measured by the experiment and numerical simulation show nearly the same trend with the growth of froude number and the difference between the two results is small at medium and high speed such as fr more than 0 3 therefore nmship sjtu can well predict the total drag coefficient of the wigley hull form at medium and high speed which can be used for total drag optimization nmship sjtu is used to evaluate the resistance performance of the new sample hull forms in the original design space before dimensionality reduction and the three new design spaces after dimensionality reduction and the surrogate models of total drag and corresponding design variables are constructed the optimal hulls can be finally obtained respectively by single objective genetic algorithm ga whose optimization parameters are shown in table 4 below the design variable values corresponding to the optimal hulls in the four design spaces are then obtained as shown in table 5 below herein kle 1 kle 3 and kle 5 represent the optimal hull in 1 3 and 5 dimensional design space after dimensionality reduction and optimal represents the optimal hull in original 7 dimensional design space comparison of transverse hull lines of each optimal hull and initial hull is shown in fig 11 in general with the increase of design space dimensionality the change of the optimal hull compared to the initial hull increases and the optimal hull in the 5 dimensional design space is the closest to the optimal hull in the original 7 dimensional design space the total drags for the optimal hulls are further evaluated by nmship sjtu which are compared with the initial hull fig 12 shows the comparison of the free surface wave elevations by nmship sjtu it can be clearly seen that with the increase of design space dimensionality the free surface wave elevation of the corresponding optimal hull decreases more sharply implying that its wave making drag also reduces gradually relatively speaking the optimal hull in the 5 dimensional design space is closest to the optimal hull in the original design space from the view of the free surface wave elevation fig 13 shows the comparison of dynamic pressure distribution on the hull surface by nmship sjtu it can also be seen that with the increase of design space dimensionality the area of high and low pressure regions on the hull surface of the corresponding optimal hull decreases gradually it can be predicted that the optimal hull in the 5 dimensional design space has a fewer total drag than that in the 1 dimensional or 3 dimensional design space the viscous cfd solver naoe foam sjtu is used for further verification of each optimal hull table 6 below gives the calm water total drags of the optimal hulls and the initial hull by naoe foam sjtu it can be seen that the optimal hull form with relatively better resistance performance can be obtained in the 5 dimensional design space for the optimization problems in this paper the maximum relative changes in the wet surface area and the drainage volume of the hull are 3 and 5 respectively it can also be seen from table 6 that due to the fact that the optimal hulls all have a generated bulbous bow the wet surface areas of the optimal hulls are all increased compared with the initial wigley hull without a bulbous bow as for the drainage volume however since the comprehensive effect by the shifting and rbf method the kle 5 and optimal hulls have a bit smaller drainage volumes to sum up for the optimal hulls their relative changes in wet surface area and drainage volume are all less than 2 and 3 respectively fig 14 shows the comparison of free surface wave elevation obtained by using naoe foam sjtu it can be seen from fig 14 that the decrease trend of the optimal hull s free surface wave elevation is consistent with that of the potential flow based calculation results and with the increase of the design space dimensionality the decrease of the corresponding optimal hull s free surface wave elevation is more severe fig 15 shows the comparison of dynamic pressure distribution on the hull surface obtained by using naoe foam sjtu the decrease trend of the area of high and low pressure regions calculated by potential flow and viscous flow solvers are consistent as a result in general the nmship sjtu solver can be used to optimize the total drag of the hull form at medium and high speeds and the optimization results are verified by the viscous cfd solver showing that the optimization effect of the total drag is obvious in addition the design space dimensionality reduction technique can reduce the huge computational cost of hydrodynamic evaluation and obtain the optimal hull with pretty good resistance performance it should be noted that since the hull form in the design space after dimensionality reduction is basically within the possible deformation range in the original high dimensional design space the smoothness of the hull grid mainly depends on the rationality of the deformation method and the selection of design variables in the original design space the mother ship adopted in this paper is wigley ship after generating an initial bulbous bow by rbf method the modified wigley ship hull is further optimized in the process of deformation the nurbs surface was firstly deformed which was mentioned in by liu et al 2019 local refinement of the control points of the nurbs surface at the bow part was carried out to ensure that after the bulbous bow was generated the hull surface mesh converted by the new hull nurbs surface had high quality and good smoothness therefore when we do further optimization of the modified wigley hull by rbf and shifting deformation methods the deformed hull surface mesh will still have good smoothness for actual ship form with complex bow and stern shapes the amount of grid points on the hull surface may be relatively larger so the dimensionality of the constructed matrix will increase which will increase the time required for dimensionality reduction but the essence of the linear reduced order method keeps unchanged it can be obviously seen from the body lines of the optimal hulls that the hull grids and nurbs surfaces have good smoothness which is meaningful to the numerical simulation hull grids and the actual construction hull nurbs surface for iges file format what s more from the view of the corresponding calculated flow fields before and after optimization since the flow fields are smooth the calculated hull grids are smooth enough last but not the least since the 5 dimensional design space can capture 95 deformation information of the 7 dimensional design space 5 information has been lost furthermore considering that the new design variables basis coefficients have some constraints the 2 dimensional projections are done to see the linear constraints adding into the sampling method and optimization algorithm however this operation is relatively conservative therefore the optimal hulls in the 7 dimensional design space and the 5 dimensional design space have some differences in the total drag reduction rate shown in table 6 however in the optimization case with a 7 dimensional design space 140 sample hulls need to be evaluated to guarantee the fidelity of the kriging krige 1951 surrogate model while in optimization cases with 1 3 5 dimensional design spaces only 40 60 100 sample hulls are needed that is to say the computational cost can have a 28 6 reduction in 5 dimensional design space which will be much more beneficial in the viscous flow based hull form optimization problems although its optimal hull kle 5 has a 2 7 total drag difference with the optimal hull after comprehensive consideration of optimization effectiveness and efficiency the new 5 dimensional design space can be regarded as the best design space dimensionality reduction result 5 application of linear dimensionality reduction method in multi physics field learning in the later stage of hull form optimization the optimization example in the previous section presents a simulation based design sbd optimization process which is widely used nowadays there is no doubt that for hull form optimization the resistance performance is a crucial item for various hydrodynamic performances of ships however in sbd optimization process after doing the hydrodynamic evaluations of each new hull form only a certain or some performance index values such as total drag sinkage or trim values are extracted for further optimization to obtain the optimal hull s which does not make full use of calculated multi physics field results of the samples for instance for the resistance performance evaluation the free surface wave elevation and pressure distribution on hull surface can be learned to analyse the main modes of the flow and the influence of hull form deformation to the flow field and then to have further understanding of a given hull form deformation design space furthermore according to the existing database of new hull forms fast hydrodynamic performance prediction especially the flow field prediction can also be made for any new hull in the design space 5 1 multi physics field database construction the basic principle of dimensionality reduction learning for geometric physical fields is almost the same as the dimensionality reduction techniques used previously in design space the main difference between the two is that in the database construction of the geometrical physical field the information contained in each new sample hull is not only the variation of grid point coordinates of the hull but also the wave height of the free surface and the dynamic pressure distribution on the hull surface so the vector can be written as x i t x 1 i y 1 i z 1 i x n p i y n p i z n p i η 1 i η 2 i η n f i p 1 i p 2 i p n p i where n p n f are the grid point numbers of the hull surface and free surface respectively when doing database construction it should be noted that it is best to obtain the dimensionless quantity of the geometric field and each physical field in the scale of the ship model specifically some equations can be used as follows 38 x x l w l 39 y y l w l 40 z z l w l 41 η η u 2 g 42 p p ρ u 2 there are two main reasons for this one is to prevent the phenomenon of large numbers eat the small for a ship model sailing in medium or high speed from a purely numerical point of view if we all use standard international units to measure compared with the dynamic pressure on the hull surface the free surface wave height is quite small therefore if the corresponding vector of each new hull form in the database contains the real values of the multi physics field the dimensionality reduction field learning can be completely subject to the pressure distribution and the information of hull geometrical changes and free surface wave elevation may be ignored and it s unlikely to reach the purpose of the entire geometrical physical field learning by making all the above physical quantities dimensionless they can be limited to a very small numerical range which weakens the possibility of large numbers eat the small phenomenon to a certain extent the other is that it is convenient for physical field data acquisition at different ship model scales through dimensionless operation to the sample new hulls in the database for geometrical physical fields after field learning the multi physics field can be quickly forecast for any new hull form within the design space and the fields are all dimensionless values with respect to the ship model waterline length if real values of the multi physics field for a certain ship model length is required the dimensionless quantities can be converted to real values just according to the above eqs 38 42 that is to say the dimensionless quantity has a wider range of generality which is not constrained by a certain geometric model scale for the 140 new sample hulls of the above modified wigley ship in the original 7 dimensional design space the geometric and physical field results obtained by nmship sjtu are integrated into the multi physics field learning database the example grid points contained in the database are shown in fig 16 which are required for the potential flow based calculation considering the symmetry of the geometrical physical field about the central sheer plane the calm water resistance evaluation is carried out by the half field calculation as shown in fig 16 where the number of free surface grid points is 24460 and the number of hull surface grid points is 8120 therefore for the multi physical field learning of the calm water resistance optimization database including hull geometry hull surface dynamic pressure distribution and free surface wave elevation the database contains 140 new hull forms and the number of data points containing multi physical field information of each new hull is 24460 4 8120 56940 5 2 influence of mode order on multi physics field reconstruction effect firstly according to the existing new sample hulls in the database the influence of the mode order m on the flow field reconstruction effect is discussed and the required mode order can be determined the changes of arithmetic square root arranged from largest to smallest of the eigenvalue and energy proportion corresponding to each mode contained in the database are shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively as can be seen in order to capture 99 of the total multi physics field information the first 10 modes should be selected the mean flow field and first 10 basis modes are shown in fig 19 below it is obvious that with the increase of m the amplitude of free surface wave height and hull surface pressure corresponding to the basis mode decreases gradually on the whole define relative error e r for the reconstruction or prediction error of the dimensionless multi physics field η x y z p after dimensionality reduction and the real field η x y z p of a certain new hull to be specific it is the arithmetic square root of ratio of the sum of squares of information difference total error energy to the real multi physics field information total energy that is 43 e r i 1 n f η i η i 2 i 1 n p x i x i 2 i 1 n p y i y i 2 i 1 n p z i z i 2 i 1 n p p i p i 2 i 1 n f η i 2 i 1 n p x i 2 i 1 n p y i 2 i 1 n p z i 2 i 1 n p p i 2 for each sample in the database the change relationship between its relative error e r and m is measured six samples are randomly selected from the database and the relationship is shown in fig 20 it can be found that with the increase of m the relative error of the reconstructed field corresponding to each new hull decreases monotonously and when m reaches 10 the relative error reaches less than 0 5 indicating that the reconstructed field has high credibility taking model 3 as an example the absolute error of the reconstructed flow field with m changing is shown in fig 21 it can be intuitively seen that the total absolute error of multi physical fields decreases gradually with the increase of m 5 3 influence of sample number on multi physics field reconstruction effect secondly according to the existing new sample hulls in the database the influence of sample number n on the multi physics field reconstruction effect is discussed to determine whether the number of existing samples is sufficient therefore select 2500 or 5000 sample points in the original design space by sobol method which correspond to 2500 or 5000 new hull forms and do the resistance performance evaluations of the new hulls by nmship sjtu to build the two new databases and do the dimensionality reduction multi physics field learning using the two databases the variation of en with m with different sample numbers n is shown in fig 22 it can be seen that the three change curves almost coincide indicating that with the increase of m the change of the proportion of the total energy truncation of multiple physical fields is almost synchronized under different sample numbers in other words the database built with 140 new hulls used in the existing hull form optimization case is enough to capture the change rule of the multi physics fields with the hull form in the original design space 5 4 prediction effect analysis of multi physics field for new hull form thirdly according to the previous analysis it can be known that for each sample hull existing in the database if the basis modes and their coefficients corresponding to the sample hull are known using formula like eq 3 the reconstructed multi physics fields can be quickly obtained when m 10 is selected the reconstruction error is small enough however more often than not we need to quickly predict the multi physical fields of new hulls that are not in the database although the basis modes of the database have already been determined each basis coefficient corresponding to the not in the database new hull cannot be directly solved by formula like eq 3 therefore it is necessary to find a general method to quickly obtain the basis coefficients considering that each new hull in the database is determined by 7 hull form deformation design variables and first 10 basis modes with their corresponding coefficients are determined therefore a total of 10 kriging surrogate models for design variables hull form deformation parameters and each basis coefficient for multi physics field interpolation can be established so that for any new hull the basis coefficient can be obtained and then the multi physics field information can be predicted quickly the following is a brief verification of the prediction error of the multi physics field for a not in the database new hull here variable names x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 are corresponding to the design variables in table 2 that define the hull form deformation in the 7 dimensional design space that is to say x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x z y α 1 α 2 α 3 α 4 for the convenience of expression each design variable of the new hull form is unitized i e 44 x i x i x i min x i max x i min i 1 2 7 obviously we have x i 0 1 i 1 2 7 since the original design space is a standard hypercube and define x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 take a new hull whose normalized design variables are x 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 as an example through kriging models the 10 basis coefficients can be obtained and the prediction multi physics field can be got compared with the real field evaluated by nmship sjtu solver the physical field information is almost identical shown in fig 23 and quantitative analysis of the relative error is given in table 7 therefore the multi physical fields corresponding to any new hull in the design space can be quickly predicted with the number of samples n 140 and the mode order m 10 5 5 sensitivity analysis of hull form optimization design variables sensitivity analysis investigates the influence of an independent variable on the dependent variable when other independent variables remain unchanged for a multi variable problem by using the above results the geometrical and flow field corresponding to any new hull can be quickly obtained with high accuracy and then the influence of all design variables on the flow field details such as free surface wave elevation and hull surface dynamic pressure distribution can be analyzed fig 24 shows the changing trend of the relative change rate of the wave making drag coefficient corresponding to the new hull when each dimensionless design variable changes from 0 to 1 the relative change rate of wave making drag coefficient is positively correlated with the design variables x 3 x 5 x 6 x 7 but negatively correlated with the design variables x 1 x 2 x 4 in addition the design variables x 1 x 3 x 4 have a greater effect on the wave making drag coefficient which is called more sensitive it can be inferred that the change of design variables x 1 x 3 x 4 will lead to the obvious change of the free surface wave elevation and the dynamic pressure distribution on the hull surface the variation trend of free surface wave elevation and the dynamic pressure distribution on the hull surface when changing x 1 and x 3 are respectively given below taking 0 1 as an interval sensitivity analysis is conducted on the design variable x 1 and the dimensionality reduction model could be used to quickly obtain the corresponding multi physics fields of each new hull as shown in fig 25 it can be seen that with the increase of x 1 the bulbous bow of the ship elongates the phase of the wave system moves forward as a whole and the high and low pressure regions of the hull surface move forward with their areas decreasing which is conducive to the reduction of the wave making drag coefficient taking 0 1 as an interval sensitivity analysis is also conducted on the design variable x 3 it can be seen from fig 26 that with the increase of x 3 the bulbous bow becomes wider and the phase of the wave systems move forward as a whole however the peak value of the bow wave becomes larger and the area of high pressure region at the bow increases which is not conducive to the reduction of the wave making drag coefficient the above conclusions obtained from the flow field are consistent with the sensitivity analysis results in fig 24 similarly the influence of the other design variables on the flow fields can be analyzed sequentially although the sensitivity analysis in this paper focuses on the wave making resistance coefficient c w which can be directly predicted through kriging surrogate model it should be noted that for sensitivity analysis each new hull form needed is almost located on the boundary surfaces of the design space so it will hardly be in the database of flow field learning that is to say if there are no flow field learning steps in order to directly observe the change of hull surface pressure distribution and the free surface wave elevation with respect to a certain design variable additional numerical simulations should be done making the computational cost larger through flow field learning the main flow field information corresponding to any new hull form can be obtained within a few seconds and the overall error can be controlled within 1 therefore it can be considered as high fidelity and high efficiency prediction it can also be seen intuitively from the fig 25 in the paper for instance that when x 1 changes alone how the flow field of the new hull will change which is predicted by the flow field learning using reduced order method instead of numerical simulation directly according to the nm potential flow theory the wave making resistance coefficient c w and the flow fields namely the hull surface pressure distribution and the free surface wave elevation are closely related therefore the flow field learning method can be used to match the resistance performance index and the flow field with each other by very small computational costs last but not the least for other optimization problems this process can also be implemented in the same way in the later stage of hull form optimization in order to quickly predict the flow field of any new hull form in the design space of the given optimization problem this is of greater significance for the high fidelity hydrodynamic performance evaluation based on viscous flow such as using rans based solver to obtain the flow fields 6 conclusions and future work in this paper the pod or kle method is used as the linear dimensionality reduction method and the steps of dimensionality reduction of the design space are introduced furthermore some important problems for the design space dimensionality reduction in hull form optimization such as retainability of fixed control points irrelevance of the relative order of data to dimensionality reduction results and decision of the new design space range after dimensionality reduction are deep discussed the application of the dimensionality reduction method for design space dimensionality reduction in the earlier stage of hull form optimization and the multi physics field learning in the later stage of hull form optimization is given through the resistance optimization of the wigley ship and the applicability and reliability of the method are demonstrated by analyzing the influence of mode order and sample number on the reconstruction effect of the hull shape or multi physics field and the prediction effect of multi physics field for new hull form in detail current results are promising showing that the linear dimensionality reduction method can reduce the amount of calculation for surrogate based optimization and be used for quick prediction of multi physics fields of any new form in the design space it should be added that the possible deformations in the new design space obtained by the linear dimensionality reduction method cannot completely reach the possible deformations in the original design space due to the information loss of hull form deformation such as the deformation at the bulbous bow in this example for any new hull form in original design space the reconstructed hull form after the dimensionality reduction has more or less error which is also directly contributing to the slightly inferior drag reduction effect of the optimal hulls in the dimensionality reduced design space compared with that in the original design space future work includes the application extensions of dimensionality reduction method such as from the linear dimensionality reduction method to the nonlinear dimensionality reduction method which may make the reconstruction error of new hull form less and then an optimal hull with better hydrodynamic resistance performance may be obtained furthermore although this paper presents the application of linear dimensionality reduction method in the multi physics field learning in the later stage of hull form optimization the objective function of hull form optimization cannot be calm water drag only and the hydrodynamic performance evaluation method cannot be based on potential flow theory only in parallel a similar approach is being applied to optimize the velocity field at the propeller disk by deforming the ship stern with viscous flow cfd method herein the grid topology relationship at propeller disk of the new hull forms may not be completely consistent not to say that there is no unified grid topology relationship for unstructured grids financial support decheng wan reports

dynamic behaviors keywords floating wind turbine semi submersible platform dynamic responses mooring line damping effect fault conditions 1 introduction due to the increase of energy demand and public awareness of environmental protection wind energy has drawn extensive attention and undergone a series of developments in recent years tang et al 2021 compared with onshore wind power offshore wind sites in deeper waters can provide larger wind capacity with less turbulence for wind turbines with negligible effects of noise and visual pollution on humans kaldellis et al 2016 tang et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 however the high cost in wind turbine fabrication installation and transportation process largely limits the development of offshore wind energy industry willis et al 2018 one of the most promising solutions is to increase the generator capacity to reduce the levelized cost of energy lcoe mckenna et al 2016 a large 10 mw reference wind turbine bak et al 2013a is lately proposed by the technical university of denmark dtu by upscaling the national renewable energy laboratory nrel wind turbine which requires larger and stronger support structures with higher requirements on stability structural integrity and dynamic behavior njiri and söffker 2016 this would reduce the ultimate and fatigue loads and improve the overall performance and operational stability of the floating offshore wind turbine fowt currently semi submersible floating platforms is the most frequently installed form of full scaled fowt prototypes li et al 2017 owing to their greater flexibility in adapting to a wider range of water depths they can be fully assembled at the dock which significantly reduces the construction and installation costs roddier 2011 various forms of semi submersible platform designs have been proposed in recent years in which side columns are widely applied in maintaining sufficient intact stability a 5 mw semi submersible platform named windfloat was designed by roddier et al 2010 which consists of three side columns connected by braces to form an integrated structure with a wind turbine mounted on one side column an active ballast system is used to keep the mast vertical and improve the turbine performance the design of offshore code comparison collaboration oc4 deepcwind robertson et al 2014 incorporates a central column attached to the tower and three side columns connected to the central column through a series of smaller diameter pontoons and cross members for a given joint of windfloat and oc4 deepcwind a column can normally be connected by several braces at the same time which not only increase the design complexity of the welded joint but also affects the fatigue life of the welded joint in the long run due to stress concentration effect and corrosion vittori 2015 zhao et al 2018a 2018b the columns of braceless semi submersible fowt are connected by pontoons rather than braces making it less prone to fatigue at the welded joints several braceless semi submersible fowt concepts have been designed in succession such as nrel 5 mw cesos semi submersible concept csc luan et al 2016 and v shaped semi submersible concept karimirad and michailides 2015 while research by luan et al luan 2018 found that the wave loads can induce large stresses on the pontoons cross section close to the central column of the fowt this is mainly due to the insufficient inertia provided by pontoons cross section in withstanding the dynamics responses and structural loads from the side columns that are like cantilever respect the pontoon another new concept of floating platform with partially tilted side columns is proposed by cao et al 2020 which has high stability and relatively small displacement normally the design of a fowt is examined under different load cases based on international standard e g international electrotechnical commission iec 61400 3 standard c 61400 3 and internationa 2009 so many studies on dynamic analysis of fowts were limited to the normal conditions however fault cases should also be considered owing to the influence of their transient effects on design and lifetime of fowts jiang et al 2012 found fault cases have a significant effect on dynamic responses of a parked spar type fowt with one seized blade in terms of mooring line tension responses yaw and roll motion responses karimirad et al karimirad and michailides 2019 similarly found that among different fault conditions shutdown case has the greatest impact on the functionality and responses of the v shaped semi submersible fowt resulting in large variation of the tower bending moment bachynski et al 2013 compared the effect of fault conditions on the dynamic responses of the oc3 hywind jonkman 2010 oc4 deepcwind and windfloat and tension leg platform tlp bachynski and moan 2012 the results showed that the blade seize and shutdown cases can cause large yaw motions of the spar and tlp and large pitch of the windfloat the shutdown process can impose relatively large edgewise blade loads fowts are hybrid rigid flexible multi body systems which can be beneficial in complex and harsh environmental conditions resulting in strongly coupled system behaviors zhao et al 2020 the 10 mw fowts with larger dimensions in terms of turbine blades swept areas tower heights floating platforms and heavier rotor may be more susceptible to transient load cases ashuri et al 2016 hence it is necessary to study the dynamic responses of an ultra large semi submersible fowt during fault conditions in this paper a novel braceless semi submersible platform named dalian university of technology dut semi designed for moderate water depth 70 150 m is proposed to support the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine numerical analysis has been carried out to analyze the intact stability and hydrodynamic coefficients of the dut semi in the frequency domain based on a first order ansys aqwa ansys 2011 solution then a fully coupled time domain simulation analysis for selected environmental conditions is conducted using code openfast opendocumentation 2020 and a comparative study with the lifes50 oo star wind floater semi 10 mw fowt pegalajar jurado et al 2018 is performed to analyze the dynamic behaviors of the dut semi fowt furthermore the effect of mooring line damping and different fault conditions on the dynamic behaviors of the dut semi fowt is highlighted fault conditions including grid loss blade seize without shutdown and blade seize with the shutdown is compared with the cases under operational conditions 2 theory background 2 1 equations of motion the integrated system of fowt can be simultaneously subjected to aerodynamic loads hydrodynamic loads and mooring loads during operation fully coupled time domain equations of

consisting of lift and drag forces are calculated based on the blade element momentum theory bem moriarty and hansen 2005 for an operating wind turbine the induced velocities and wake effects on the velocity seen by the blade element need to be determined so that the lift and drag coefficients are used to model the aerodynamic forces which can be defined as follows 2 c l α f l 1 2 ρ a v rel 2 c 3

forces f m t on a fowt can be approximated using force displacement or quasi static methods however these methods cannot account for mooring line dynamic effects which significantly affect the overall response of the fowt system matha et al 2011 e g in terms of line inertia the drag of the line through fluid and vortex shedding therefore a lumped mass modeling approach is used to simulate the mooring line dynamic effects discretizing the cable dynamics over the length of the mooring line this approach can account for the internal axial stiffness and damping forces weight and buoyancy forces hydrodynamic forces from morison s equation and vertical spring damper forces from contact with the seabed 3 conceptual design of semi submersible 10 mw wind turbine the dut semi platform is designed to support the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine for a designed water depth of 130 m the schematic layout of the dut semi fowt and coordinate system are presented in fig 1 the x axis points to the downwind direction of the integrated system of the fowt originated from the intersection of the dut semi platform centreline and the sea water level swl the parameters of the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine are outlined in table 1 additional detailed specifications can be found in bak et al 2013b the dut semi is a steel semi submersible platform with three offset side columns connected by a steel tripod supporting the tower of the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine the configuration and main parameters of the dut semi platform is demonstrated in fig 2 and table 2 respectively the platform including ballast has an overall mass of 24783 57 tons at the base of the three offset columns is a larger diameter base column which are connected to each other by three horizontal pontoons and helps to suppress platform motions particularly in the heave direction the base column pontoon can effectively avoid the heave resonant motions excited by first order wave loads and construction of the additional heave plates can be complex and expensive as well the base column can also be used as a ballast tank to reduce the cog of the dut semi platform and improve the stability of the integrated system of the semi submersible fowt the upper side columns are connected by square shaped bars and the tripod design is based on the transition piece of the bard tripile a steel structure for the bottom fixed bard 5 mw wind turbine azcona and vittori 2019 transition piece of the bard tripile support structure is demonstrated in fig 3 for the design of the new semi dut platform the columns are connected by square shaped bars of a steel tripod and horizontal pontoons instead of braces to form an integrated structure which can increase the strength of the pontoon and avoid large stresses on the pontoons as it is no longer like a cantilever beam instead is part of a closed loop that should be more capable of resisting external loads furthermore the design reduces fatigue sensitivity corrosion hot spot and complexity of welding process and the prefabricated steel tripod can be towed and installed as a whole which greatly reduces the construction time and cost of the semi submersible fowt the tower of the dut semi fowt is shortened by 25 m due to the height of tripod and column elevation above swl its main parameters are outlined in table 3 a three line catenary mooring system is designed to keep it in position which features two upwind lines and one downwind line illustrated in fig 4 properties of the mooring system are listed in table 4 additionally to study the dynamic behaviors and performance of the dut semi platform a comparative study with the lifes50 oo star semi submersible platform is conducted schematic layout of the lifes50 oo star semi submersible platform and mooring system are provided in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively details regarding the design of the oo star semi submersible platform can be found in pegalajar jurado et al 2018 4 numerical implantation 4 1 numerical simulation tool fully coupled aero hydro servo elastic time domain simulations are conducted for the 10 mw dut semi and oo star fowt using the code openfast v2 4 0 the openfast code can model a three bladed hawt with 24 dofs the first six dofs originate from the translational surge sway and heave and rotational roll pitch and yaw motions of the support platform relative to the inertia frame the next four dofs account for tower motion two are longitudinal modes and two are lateral modes yawing motion of the nacelle provides another dof the next dof is for the generator azimuth angle and another dof is the compliance in the drivetrain between the generator and hub rotor these dofs account for variable rotor speed and drive shaft flexibility the next three dofs are the blade flapwise tip motion for the first mode three more dofs give the tip displacement for each blade for the second flapwise mode the next three dofs are for the blade edgewise tip displacement for the first edgewise mode the last two dofs are for rotor and tail furl an overview of code openfast integrated with several modules is illustrated in fig 7 the hydrodynamic calculations of the dut semi and oo star are mainly based on a combination of potential flow theory solution and strip theory solution in hydrodyn module jonkman et al 2014 potential flow hydrodynamic loads include linear hydrostatic restoring the added mass and damping contributions from linear wave radiation including free surface memory effects and the incident wave excitation from first and second order diffraction and the viscous drag loads are calculated according to the morison equation the rosco abbas et al 2020 controller developed by delft university of technology in fortran programming language is selected for servodyn module moordyn module is used to model the mooring line dynamic effects more details regarding the numerical modeling methods and iterative process of openfast can be found in jonkman 2019 4 2 environmental conditions the environmental conditions ecs chosen are representative according to iec 61400 3 standard c 61400 3 and internationa 2009 as shown in table 5 a turbulent wind field is generated in turbsim using iec kaimal spectra and the irregular wave time series are generated using the jonswap spectrum for different ecs with varying significant wave height h s and peak spectral period t p the same time series are used in new semi dut and oo star semi submersible fowt analysis for each ec five random seeds are used to generate five wind and wave time series to reduce statistic variations with each simulation lasting for 4200 s which corresponds to a dynamic analysis of 1 h eliminating the first 600 s to avoid the startup transient effect 5 results and discussions 5 1 stability and hydrodynamic analysis the intact stability of the dut semi fowt during operation phase is assessed this is shown in terms of righting moment curve as a function of heel angle demonstrated in fig 8 the dut semi platform can reduce the static heel angle from 8 5 to 5 0 compared with the braceless pontoon type floater proposed by wang 2014 supporting the same dtu10 mw wind turbine the area under the righting moment curve from 0 to the angle of down flooding is 64 0 greater than the area under the wind heeling moment curve to the same limiting angle and the righting moment stays positive from upright to the second intercept therefore the design of the dut semi fowt well satisfies the intact stability requirement from dnv veritas 2013 before the fully coupled analysis the ansys aqwa module is used as a preprocessor for the openfast simulation and the hydrodynamic coefficients the added mass radiation damping and first order wave excitation forces in the frequency domain are the inputs of the openfast model which is then used for time domain simulation panel model of the dut semi for the frequency domain simulation is presented in fig 9 the total number of meshes of the panel model of dut semi is 32736 and the number of diffraction meshes on the wet surface is 29622 the comparison of first order wave excitation force coefficients of the triple spar yu et al 2017 oo star and dut semi is demonstrated in fig 10 it can be observed that the dut semi has better hydrodynamic performance than the other two semi submersible floating platform this is mainly because the dut semi can sustain smaller excitation force coefficients in x direction within a wide range of wave frequencies so that the dynamic responses of the dut semi is smaller under the same wave conditions than the triple spar and oo star which also further promotes the dut semi to have more stable operating advantages in addition the simplest substructure of the triple spar minimizes the fluctuation of first order wave excitation force and the complicated substructure of the pontoon base column heave plate of the oo star and dut semi makes the first order wave excitation force fluctuate more obviously especially for dut semi the distance from the side column to the dut semi centerline is 48 m while that of the oo star is 37 m the column spacing effect caused by the large span from the side column to the dut semi centerline further aggravates the fluctuation of the first order wave force faltinsen 1993 and the abrupt position formed by the connection of the two adjacent pontoons and the base column will also cause the fluctuation of the first order wave excitation force of the dut semi 5 2 free decay test the natural frequencies of the dut semi fowt are calculated using the coupled openfast model in free decay simulations including the mooring system the wind turbine is parked with all blades feathered in the decay tests a prescribed offset for each mode of rigid body motions is applied without the existence of wind waves and currents the surge heave pitch tower top fa displacement and tower top ss displacement decay histories of the dut semi and oo star fowt are shown in fig 11 then the natural frequencies are computed by a fourier transformation of the time histories presented in table 6 it can be observed that the natural frequencies of the dut semi platform motions are generally lower than typical wave frequencies and the rotor frequency 1p and the natural frequencies of the tower are generally higher than the blade passing frequency 3p therefore the dut semi platform is well designed in terms of frequency requirements avoiding resonance due to structural vibrations excited by first order wave loads and 1p and 3p effects 5 3 comparative analysis of dynamic responses of dut semi and oo star fowt 5 3 1 response amplitude operators the response amplitude operators raos are used in the design of floating structures to study their dynamic characteristics which is defined as the response of a system to a unit amplitude periodic wave from a given direction or heading to study the dynamic responses of the dut semi platform the white noise wave test is conducted by using openfast and the significant wave height is determined as 3 m raos can be obtained through the calculation of motion spectra and wave spectra and the raos of surge heave and pitch motions for the dut semi and oo star subjected to zero wind speed are shown in fig 12 it can be observed that the raos for these three motions show obvious peaks at their respective natural frequencies and the coupling effect between surge and pitch motions is evident the maximum surge rao value for the oo star is a little larger around 30 82 m at a frequency of 0 0074 hz and the maximum pitch rao is smaller than that for the dut semi which is around 9 55 deg at a frequency of 0 0299 hz furthermore the most obvious difference appears in heave rao the heave response of the oo star is significantly excited in the low frequency and the maximum heave rao of the oo star is 14 54 m which is 2 21 times that of the dut semi however for the fowt system there are multiple excitation frequencies under a regular wave condition which is mainly due to the nonlinearity of the system affected by the gyroscopic effect of the rotor and the blade pitch controller induced instability yu et al 2015 therefore time domain simulations under different sea states associated with wind speeds are performed next to study the overall performance of the integrated dut semi system 5 3 2 statistics analysis a series of comparative analysis between the dynamic behaviors of dut semi and oo star fowt is performed using code openfast the comparison of motion response statistics of the two platforms in different ecs is demonstrated in fig 13 in which only the most important surge heave and pitch motions are discussed it can be observed that only the mean value of the pitch motion of the dut semi fowt in ec3 is 29 4 higher than that of the oo star fowt while the standard deviation std of the pitch motion of the dut semi fowt in ec3 is much smaller than the oo star fowt furthermore it is well known that the heave response control of semi submersible platform has always been the focus of research while the mean value of the heave motion response of the oo star is much greater than that of dut semi the reason for this difference may be due to the different conceptual design of oo star and dut semi 1 the draft of oo star and dut semi floating platforms are different a larger draft can reduce the heave response amplitude and increase the stability of the integrated system of the fowt 2 the type size and placement depth of the heave suppression mechanism of the oo star and dut semi floating platform are different 3 the performance of the mooring system between oo star and dut semi are different apart from above the operating stability of the dut semi fowt under other ecs is generally better than that of the oo star fowt a statistical comparison of structural dynamics of the dut semi and oo star fowt is presented in fig 14 obvious fluctuation of tower top and tower base fa bending moments and mooring line 1 tension of the oo star fowt can be observed in different ecs for tower top fa bending moments in fig 14 a the mean value of the oo star fowt in rated wind speed condition ec3 is 2 18 times relative to the dut semi fowt and the dut semi and oo star fowt give similar mean values under other ecs however the mean value of tower base fa bending moments of the dut semi fowt in ec3 is 38 5 greater than that of the oo star fowt in fig 14 b this is mainly caused by the slightly increase in pitch motion of the dut semi fowt which leads the rotor weight contributing more to the increase in tower base fa bending moment and the more flexibility in tower of dut semi fowt due to less tower mass is another contributor of this phenomenon the mooring line 1 tension of the dut semi fowt shown in fig 14 c is greater than oo star fowt in different ecs and the largest difference in the mean value occurs in ec4 with a 28 5 deviation however three mooring lines of the oo star fowt are used with one 50 ton clump mass for each which can significantly increase the complexity of the mooring system in design and installation making it more difficult in avoiding over loading and slack of mooring lines 5 3 3 spectral analysis spectral analysis is conducted to compare the dynamic response characteristics of the dut semi and oo star fowt in greater detail power spectrum densities psd of platform surge heave and pitch motions tower top and tower base bending moments and mooring line 1 tension in rated wind speed condition ec8 are obtained by the fast fourier transform fft method as shown in figs 15 and 16 comparing the psd of the platform motion responses in fig 15 the surge motion response of the dut semi fowt is dominated by the low frequency surge resonant response exhibiting a peak at the surge natural frequency of 0 078 rad s which is much larger than the low frequency surge resonant response of the oo star fowt at the surge natural frequency of 0 046 rad s however the wave frequency wave excitation loads govern the surge motion response of the oo star fowt and its excitation effect on the platform surge motion is significantly higher than that of the dut semi fowt although the psd of the heave motion responses of the two platforms all show maximum at the wave frequencies the heave resonant response excited by low frequency wind loads accounts for a larger proportion of the heave motion of the dut semi fowt the wave excitation loads still play a dominant role in the pitch motion responses of the two platforms in which the column spacing effect of the oo star fowt is particularly prominent in addition compared with the dut semi fowt a larger surge and pitch resonant response appears in the low frequency component of the pitch motion of the oo star fowt the psd of the tower top and tower base fa bending moments and mooring line 1 tension of the dut semi and oo star fowt at the rated wind speed under operating conditions shows similar trends in fig 16 it can be observed that the structural dynamics of the two platforms have not only considerable energy in wave frequency but also relatively large energy near the 1p frequency 1 rad s it indicates that the tower top and tower base bending moments and mooring line 1 tension is mainly affected by the wave loads and the rotation of the blades in addition the slowly varying platform motions primarily induced by low frequency wind loads and the high frequency 3p effect should also have an impact on structural dynamics of the platforms however the structural dynamics of the oo star fowt are significantly higher than the dut semi fowt regardless of low frequency resonant responses excited by wind loads the wave frequency responses excited by wave loads or the high frequency responses excited by the 3p effect the tower elastic response of the dut semi fowt will also have an impact on the tower top and tower base fa bending moments due to its flexible tower design and the tower of the oo star fowt does not show any significant effect from the tower elastic response 5 4 effect of mooring line damping on dynamic behaviors of dut semi fowt the effect of mooring line damping on the motion responses and structural dynamics of the dut semi fowt is studied in ec3 the statistical characteristics of the motion and tension responses with and without the mooring line damping are listed in table 7 the effect of mooring line damping is not significant on the motion responses of the dut semi fowt except for the surge motion only increased by 1 5 with consideration of mooring line damping while its effects are significant for the mooring line tension responses as demonstrated in fig 17 in terms of spectrum of tension for line 1 the tension response associated with the surge resonant response at 0 078 rad s 1p and 3p effects 1 and 3 rad s and eigenfrequencies 1 47 rad s of the mooring line is significantly affected by the existence of mooring line damping therefore the damping effect of the mooring lines has to be considered in the design fatigue and ultimate limit states checks of mooring 5 5 effect of fault conditions on dynamic responses of dut semi fowt to study the effect of fault conditions on the dynamic behaviors of the dut semi fowt different possible fault conditions are defined and summarized in table 8 including grid loss blade seize with and without shutdown the time of occurrence for all fault conditions is considered at 400 s during grid loss the grid is disconnected at 400 s with the wind turbine shutting down and pitching all blades to feather 90 at the maximum pitch rate 8 deg s yu et al 2017 after a delay of 0 1 s blade seize indicates the pitch actuator of one blade is blocked at 400 s staying at its instantaneous orientation then the wind turbine may either shutdown after a delay of 0 1 s or the controller tries its best to maintain the rotation speed by pitching the other two blades which corresponds to the two fault conditions of the blade seize with shutdown and without shutdown respectively the wind turbine behaviors for different possible fault conditions are illustrated in fig 18 for the case of blade seize followed by shutdown blade1 is unable to pitch then locked in instantaneous orientation with the other non faulted blades reaching full feathering in about 45 s as shown in fig 18 a the thrust of the dut semi fowt for different fault conditions is compared with normal condition without fault it can be observed that a transient impact load appears in the case of blade seize shutdown and grid loss in fig 18 c negative thrust is shown during grid loss compared with normal operating conditions the thrust in the case of blade seize without shutdown is increased due to the decrease of aerodynamic damping the time of the blade seize with shutdown is slightly delayed compared to shutdown of grid loss as shown in fig 18 b and d a single blade seize without shutdown has little effect on the rotor speed and output power of the dut semi fowt fault conditions may have a significant impact on the dynamic behaviors of the dut semi fowt due to transient effects therefore the dynamic responses of the dut semi fowt in different fault conditions for a sea state with rated wind speed ec3 are examined and compared with normal operational condition time histories and statistical characteristics of the platform motions are illustrated in figs 19 and 20 respectively it is observed that the dut semi fowt for a normal condition without fault initially operates at a mean value of 4 8 m along the surge direction then experiences a large surge motion finally return to near zero after shutdown blade seize with shutdown and grid loss in this process the mean value of the surge motion for blade seize without shutdown is increased by 7 3 compared with normal operating condition due to the increase in thrust as shown in fig 20 a for the pitch motion the effects of the fault conditions on the surge and pitch motions are similar because of the coupling effect between the platform pitch and surge motions in which the pitch motion is more affected by the impact caused by grid loss in fig 19 b the heave motion is more deviated from the swl for the case of blade seize without shutdown this is mainly due to the increase in thrust and the 5 angle between the rotation shaft of the rotor of the dtu 10 mw wind turbine and the horizontal plane which causes the vertical downward force to increase however it is clear that the transient effect of the fault conditions has little influence on the heave motion in fig 20 b because the heave motion of the dut semi fowt is well constrained and the heave motion is small in normal operational conditions for the yaw motion the ratio of the minimum value of the yaw motion between the fault condition blade seize with shutdown and the normal operating condition is 2 24 this can be attributed to the fact that the unbalanced loads caused by blade seize induces a particularly large loads on the blades and tower which in turn leads to an increase in the yaw motion of the dut semi fowt in order to study the effect of fault conditions on structural dynamics of the dut semi fowt the time histories and statistical characteristics of the tower top and tower base fa bending moments and mooring line tension are presented in figs 21 and 22 respectively it can be found that the tower top and tower base fa bending moment is highly affected by the shutdown blade seize with shutdown and grid loss fault conditions the maximum value of the tower top fa bending moment in this case the minimum value for the case of blade seize shutdown condition is 3 57 times relative to the normal operating condition due to the imbalance loads induced by blade seize furthermore although the variation of the tower base fa bending moment is also very large and the std for the case of grid loss increased by 157 0 compared with the normal operating conditions negative bending moment appear due to the removal of the thrust load and the absolute value of the negative tower base fa bending moment is significantly smaller than the corresponding positive tower base fa bending moment in addition the maximum value of the mooring line tension is increased by a factor of 1 2 due to grid loss an impact load due to the transient effect for the case of the shutdown condition also causes a large tension response but the transient response of the tension response of the mooring lines in the two cases of the blade seize with shutdown and grid loss is not much different 6 conclusions in this paper a new concept semi submersible platform dut semi fowt is proposed to support the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine in the intermediate water depth a fully coupled analysis is performed to examine the intact stability of the integrated system and a comparative study is conducted with the oo star fowt to highlight the dynamic responses and performance of the dut semi fowt under typical sea states furthermore the dynamic responses of the dut semi fowt are also studied with emphasis on the effect of mooring line damping additionally the performance of the dut semi fowt under different fault conditions is presented which is compared with the platform motions and structural loads encountered during normal operating conditions the conclusions drawn from the study can be summarized as follows 1 the newly designed semi submersible fowt system is proved to have a reasonably good stability the design of the conceptual floating platform suppresses motion well particularly in the heave direction which is the main reason of the less fluctuations in the motion responses and structural dynamics of the dut semi fowt compared with lifes50 oo star dut semi fowt is also beneficial in structural dynamics in regardless of the low frequency resonant responses excited by wind loads the wave frequency responses excited by wave loads or the responses excited by 1p and 3p effect 2 the mooring line damping does not show any significant effect on the motion responses of the dut semi fowt except for the surge motion however its effects are significant for the mooring line tension responses 3 different fault conditions should also be considered in design among which the shutdown blade seize with shutdown and grid loss fault conditions have the most significant impact on the dynamic behaviors of the dut semi fowt the thrust for the case of grid loss experiences an intense variation due to the feathering of the blades the maximum value of the tower top fa bending moment is increased by a factor of 3 57 due to the imbalance loads induced by the blade seize with shutdown however a single blade pitch failure has little effect on the motion responses and structural dynamics of the dut semi fowt in general this paper highlights the feasibility of a newly designed semi submersible floating platform in aligned wind and wave condition however the overall strength of newly designed semi submersible floating platform and the validation of the fully coupled simulation results of the openfast combined with model test will be performed in future to optimize the performance of the newly designed semi

dynamic behaviors keywords floating wind turbine semi submersible platform dynamic responses mooring line damping effect fault conditions 1 introduction due to the increase of energy demand and public awareness of environmental protection wind energy has drawn extensive attention and undergone a series of developments in recent years tang et al 2021 compared with onshore wind power offshore wind sites in deeper waters can provide larger wind capacity with less turbulence for wind turbines with negligible effects of noise and visual pollution on humans kaldellis et al 2016 tang et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 however the high cost in wind turbine fabrication installation and transportation process largely limits the development of offshore wind energy industry willis et al 2018 one of the most promising solutions is to increase the generator capacity to reduce the levelized cost of energy lcoe mckenna et al 2016 a large 10 mw reference wind turbine bak et al 2013a is lately proposed by the technical university of denmark dtu by upscaling the national renewable energy laboratory nrel wind turbine which requires larger and stronger support structures with higher requirements on stability structural integrity and dynamic behavior njiri and söffker 2016 this would reduce the ultimate and fatigue loads and improve the overall performance and operational stability of the floating offshore wind turbine fowt currently semi submersible floating platforms is the most frequently installed form of full scaled fowt prototypes li et al 2017 owing to their greater flexibility in adapting to a wider range of water depths they can be fully assembled at the dock which significantly reduces the construction and installation costs roddier 2011 various forms of semi submersible platform designs have been proposed in recent years in which side columns are widely applied in maintaining sufficient intact stability a 5 mw semi submersible platform named windfloat was designed by roddier et al 2010 which consists of three side columns connected by braces to form an integrated structure with a wind turbine mounted on one side column an active ballast system is used to keep the mast vertical and improve the turbine performance the design of offshore code comparison collaboration oc4 deepcwind robertson et al 2014 incorporates a central column attached to the tower and three side columns connected to the central column through a series of smaller diameter pontoons and cross members for a given joint of windfloat and oc4 deepcwind a column can normally be connected by several braces at the same time which not only increase the design complexity of the welded joint but also affects the fatigue life of the welded joint in the long run due to stress concentration effect and corrosion vittori 2015 zhao et al 2018a 2018b the columns of braceless semi submersible fowt are connected by pontoons rather than braces making it less prone to fatigue at the welded joints several braceless semi submersible fowt concepts have been designed in succession such as nrel 5 mw cesos semi submersible concept csc luan et al 2016 and v shaped semi submersible concept karimirad and michailides 2015 while research by luan et al luan 2018 found that the wave loads can induce large stresses on the pontoons cross section close to the central column of the fowt this is mainly due to the insufficient inertia provided by pontoons cross section in withstanding the dynamics responses and structural loads from the side columns that are like cantilever respect the pontoon another new concept of floating platform with partially tilted side columns is proposed by cao et al 2020 which has high stability and relatively small displacement normally the design of a fowt is examined under different load cases based on international standard e g international electrotechnical commission iec 61400 3 standard c 61400 3 and internationa 2009 so many studies on dynamic analysis of fowts were limited to the normal conditions however fault cases should also be considered owing to the influence of their transient effects on design and lifetime of fowts jiang et al 2012 found fault cases have a significant effect on dynamic responses of a parked spar type fowt with one seized blade in terms of mooring line tension responses yaw and roll motion responses karimirad et al karimirad and michailides 2019 similarly found that among different fault conditions shutdown case has the greatest impact on the functionality and responses of the v shaped semi submersible fowt resulting in large variation of the tower bending moment bachynski et al 2013 compared the effect of fault conditions on the dynamic responses of the oc3 hywind jonkman 2010 oc4 deepcwind and windfloat and tension leg platform tlp bachynski and moan 2012 the results showed that the blade seize and shutdown cases can cause large yaw motions of the spar and tlp and large pitch of the windfloat the shutdown process can impose relatively large edgewise blade loads fowts are hybrid rigid flexible multi body systems which can be beneficial in complex and harsh environmental conditions resulting in strongly coupled system behaviors zhao et al 2020 the 10 mw fowts with larger dimensions in terms of turbine blades swept areas tower heights floating platforms and heavier rotor may be more susceptible to transient load cases ashuri et al 2016 hence it is necessary to study the dynamic responses of an ultra large semi submersible fowt during fault conditions in this paper a novel braceless semi submersible platform named dalian university of technology dut semi designed for moderate water depth 70 150 m is proposed to support the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine numerical analysis has been carried out to analyze the intact stability and hydrodynamic coefficients of the dut semi in the frequency domain based on a first order ansys aqwa ansys 2011 solution then a fully coupled time domain simulation analysis for selected environmental conditions is conducted using code openfast opendocumentation 2020 and a comparative study with the lifes50 oo star wind floater semi 10 mw fowt pegalajar jurado et al 2018 is performed to analyze the dynamic behaviors of the dut semi fowt furthermore the effect of mooring line damping and different fault conditions on the dynamic behaviors of the dut semi fowt is highlighted fault conditions including grid loss blade seize without shutdown and blade seize with the shutdown is compared with the cases under operational conditions 2 theory background 2 1 equations of motion the integrated system of fowt can be simultaneously subjected to aerodynamic loads hydrodynamic loads and mooring loads during operation fully coupled time domain equations of

consisting of lift and drag forces are calculated based on the blade element momentum theory bem moriarty and hansen 2005 for an operating wind turbine the induced velocities and wake effects on the velocity seen by the blade element need to be determined so that the lift and drag coefficients are used to model the aerodynamic forces which can be defined as follows 2 c l α f l 1 2 ρ a v rel 2 c 3

diffraction in regular or irregular seas the radiation damping forces f c t x and the viscous drag forces f d t x from the incident wave kinematics and platform motions in this study only the first

forces f m t on a fowt can be approximated using force displacement or quasi static methods however these methods cannot account for mooring line dynamic effects which significantly affect the overall response of the fowt system matha et al 2011 e g in terms of line inertia the drag of the line through fluid and vortex shedding therefore a lumped mass modeling approach is used to simulate the mooring line dynamic effects discretizing the cable dynamics over the length of the mooring line this approach can account for the internal axial stiffness and damping forces weight and buoyancy forces hydrodynamic forces from morison s equation and vertical spring damper forces from contact with the seabed 3 conceptual design of semi submersible 10 mw wind turbine the dut semi platform is designed to support the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine for a designed water depth of 130 m the schematic layout of the dut semi fowt and coordinate system are presented in fig 1 the x axis points to the downwind direction of the integrated system of the fowt originated from the intersection of the dut semi platform centreline and the sea water level swl the parameters of the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine are outlined in table 1 additional detailed specifications can be found in bak et al 2013b the dut semi is a steel semi submersible platform with three offset side columns connected by a steel tripod supporting the tower of the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine the configuration and main parameters of the dut semi platform is demonstrated in fig 2 and table 2 respectively the platform including ballast has an overall mass of 24783 57 tons at the base of the three offset columns is a larger diameter base column which are connected to each other by three horizontal pontoons and helps to suppress platform motions particularly in the heave direction the base column pontoon can effectively avoid the heave resonant motions excited by first order wave loads and construction of the additional heave plates can be complex and expensive as well the base column can also be used as a ballast tank to reduce the cog of the dut semi platform and improve the stability of the integrated system of the semi submersible fowt the upper side columns are connected by square shaped bars and the tripod design is based on the transition piece of the bard tripile a steel structure for the bottom fixed bard 5 mw wind turbine azcona and vittori 2019 transition piece of the bard tripile support structure is demonstrated in fig 3 for the design of the new semi dut platform the columns are connected by square shaped bars of a steel tripod and horizontal pontoons instead of braces to form an integrated structure which can increase the strength of the pontoon and avoid large stresses on the pontoons as it is no longer like a cantilever beam instead is part of a closed loop that should be more capable of resisting external loads furthermore the design reduces fatigue sensitivity corrosion hot spot and complexity of welding process and the prefabricated steel tripod can be towed and installed as a whole which greatly reduces the construction time and cost of the semi submersible fowt the tower of the dut semi fowt is shortened by 25 m due to the height of tripod and column elevation above swl its main parameters are outlined in table 3 a three line catenary mooring system is designed to keep it in position which features two upwind lines and one downwind line illustrated in fig 4 properties of the mooring system are listed in table 4 additionally to study the dynamic behaviors and performance of the dut semi platform a comparative study with the lifes50 oo star semi submersible platform is conducted schematic layout of the lifes50 oo star semi submersible platform and mooring system are provided in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively details regarding the design of the oo star semi submersible platform can be found in pegalajar jurado et al 2018 4 numerical implantation 4 1 numerical simulation tool fully coupled aero hydro servo elastic time domain simulations are conducted for the 10 mw dut semi and oo star fowt using the code openfast v2 4 0 the openfast code can model a three bladed hawt with 24 dofs the first six dofs originate from the translational surge sway and heave and rotational roll pitch and yaw motions of the support platform relative to the inertia frame the next four dofs account for tower motion two are longitudinal modes and two are lateral modes yawing motion of the nacelle provides another dof the next dof is for the generator azimuth angle and another dof is the compliance in the drivetrain between the generator and hub rotor these dofs account for variable rotor speed and drive shaft flexibility the next three dofs are the blade flapwise tip motion for the first mode three more dofs give the tip displacement for each blade for the second flapwise mode the next three dofs are for the blade edgewise tip displacement for the first edgewise mode the last two dofs are for rotor and tail furl an overview of code openfast integrated with several modules is illustrated in fig 7 the hydrodynamic calculations of the dut semi and oo star are mainly based on a combination of potential flow theory solution and strip theory solution in hydrodyn module jonkman et al 2014 potential flow hydrodynamic loads include linear hydrostatic restoring the added mass and damping contributions from linear wave radiation including free surface memory effects and the incident wave excitation from first and second order diffraction and the viscous drag loads are calculated according to the morison equation the rosco abbas et al 2020 controller developed by delft university of technology in fortran programming language is selected for servodyn module moordyn module is used to model the mooring line dynamic effects more details regarding the numerical modeling methods and iterative process of openfast can be found in jonkman 2019 4 2 environmental conditions the environmental conditions ecs chosen are representative according to iec 61400 3 standard c 61400 3 and internationa 2009 as shown in table 5 a turbulent wind field is generated in turbsim using iec kaimal spectra and the irregular wave time series are generated using the jonswap spectrum for different ecs with varying significant wave height h s and peak spectral period t p the same time series are used in new semi dut and oo star semi submersible fowt analysis for each ec five random seeds are used to generate five wind and wave time series to reduce statistic variations with each simulation lasting for 4200 s which corresponds to a dynamic analysis of 1 h eliminating the first 600 s to avoid the startup transient effect 5 results and discussions 5 1 stability and hydrodynamic analysis the intact stability of the dut semi fowt during operation phase is assessed this is shown in terms of righting moment curve as a function of heel angle demonstrated in fig 8 the dut semi platform can reduce the static heel angle from 8 5 to 5 0 compared with the braceless pontoon type floater proposed by wang 2014 supporting the same dtu10 mw wind turbine the area under the righting moment curve from 0 to the angle of down flooding is 64 0 greater than the area under the wind heeling moment curve to the same limiting angle and the righting moment stays positive from upright to the second intercept therefore the design of the dut semi fowt well satisfies the intact stability requirement from dnv veritas 2013 before the fully coupled analysis the ansys aqwa module is used as a preprocessor for the openfast simulation and the hydrodynamic coefficients the added mass radiation damping and first order wave excitation forces in the frequency domain are the inputs of the openfast model which is then used for time domain simulation panel model of the dut semi for the frequency domain simulation is presented in fig 9 the total number of meshes of the panel model of dut semi is 32736 and the number of diffraction meshes on the wet surface is 29622 the comparison of first order wave excitation force coefficients of the triple spar yu et al 2017 oo star and dut semi is demonstrated in fig 10 it can be observed that the dut semi has better hydrodynamic performance than the other two semi submersible floating platform this is mainly because the dut semi can sustain smaller excitation force coefficients in x direction within a wide range of wave frequencies so that the dynamic responses of the dut semi is smaller under the same wave conditions than the triple spar and oo star which also further promotes the dut semi to have more stable operating advantages in addition the simplest substructure of the triple spar minimizes the fluctuation of first order wave excitation force and the complicated substructure of the pontoon base column heave plate of the oo star and dut semi makes the first order wave excitation force fluctuate more obviously especially for dut semi the distance from the side column to the dut semi centerline is 48 m while that of the oo star is 37 m the column spacing effect caused by the large span from the side column to the dut semi centerline further aggravates the fluctuation of the first order wave force faltinsen 1993 and the abrupt position formed by the connection of the two adjacent pontoons and the base column will also cause the fluctuation of the first order wave excitation force of the dut semi 5 2 free decay test the natural frequencies of the dut semi fowt are calculated using the coupled openfast model in free decay simulations including the mooring system the wind turbine is parked with all blades feathered in the decay tests a prescribed offset for each mode of rigid body motions is applied without the existence of wind waves and currents the surge heave pitch tower top fa displacement and tower top ss displacement decay histories of the dut semi and oo star fowt are shown in fig 11 then the natural frequencies are computed by a fourier transformation of the time histories presented in table 6 it can be observed that the natural frequencies of the dut semi platform motions are generally lower than typical wave frequencies and the rotor frequency 1p and the natural frequencies of the tower are generally higher than the blade passing frequency 3p therefore the dut semi platform is well designed in terms of frequency requirements avoiding resonance due to structural vibrations excited by first order wave loads and 1p and 3p effects 5 3 comparative analysis of dynamic responses of dut semi and oo star fowt 5 3 1 response amplitude operators the response amplitude operators raos are used in the design of floating structures to study their dynamic characteristics which is defined as the response of a system to a unit amplitude periodic wave from a given direction or heading to study the dynamic responses of the dut semi platform the white noise wave test is conducted by using openfast and the significant wave height is determined as 3 m raos can be obtained through the calculation of motion spectra and wave spectra and the raos of surge heave and pitch motions for the dut semi and oo star subjected to zero wind speed are shown in fig 12 it can be observed that the raos for these three motions show obvious peaks at their respective natural frequencies and the coupling effect between surge and pitch motions is evident the maximum surge rao value for the oo star is a little larger around 30 82 m at a frequency of 0 0074 hz and the maximum pitch rao is smaller than that for the dut semi which is around 9 55 deg at a frequency of 0 0299 hz furthermore the most obvious difference appears in heave rao the heave response of the oo star is significantly excited in the low frequency and the maximum heave rao of the oo star is 14 54 m which is 2 21 times that of the dut semi however for the fowt system there are multiple excitation frequencies under a regular wave condition which is mainly due to the nonlinearity of the system affected by the gyroscopic effect of the rotor and the blade pitch controller induced instability yu et al 2015 therefore time domain simulations under different sea states associated with wind speeds are performed next to study the overall performance of the integrated dut semi system 5 3 2 statistics analysis a series of comparative analysis between the dynamic behaviors of dut semi and oo star fowt is performed using code openfast the comparison of motion response statistics of the two platforms in different ecs is demonstrated in fig 13 in which only the most important surge heave and pitch motions are discussed it can be observed that only the mean value of the pitch motion of the dut semi fowt in ec3 is 29 4 higher than that of the oo star fowt while the standard deviation std of the pitch motion of the dut semi fowt in ec3 is much smaller than the oo star fowt furthermore it is well known that the heave response control of semi submersible platform has always been the focus of research while the mean value of the heave motion response of the oo star is much greater than that of dut semi the reason for this difference may be due to the different conceptual design of oo star and dut semi 1 the draft of oo star and dut semi floating platforms are different a larger draft can reduce the heave response amplitude and increase the stability of the integrated system of the fowt 2 the type size and placement depth of the heave suppression mechanism of the oo star and dut semi floating platform are different 3 the performance of the mooring system between oo star and dut semi are different apart from above the operating stability of the dut semi fowt under other ecs is generally better than that of the oo star fowt a statistical comparison of structural dynamics of the dut semi and oo star fowt is presented in fig 14 obvious fluctuation of tower top and tower base fa bending moments and mooring line 1 tension of the oo star fowt can be observed in different ecs for tower top fa bending moments in fig 14 a the mean value of the oo star fowt in rated wind speed condition ec3 is 2 18 times relative to the dut semi fowt and the dut semi and oo star fowt give similar mean values under other ecs however the mean value of tower base fa bending moments of the dut semi fowt in ec3 is 38 5 greater than that of the oo star fowt in fig 14 b this is mainly caused by the slightly increase in pitch motion of the dut semi fowt which leads the rotor weight contributing more to the increase in tower base fa bending moment and the more flexibility in tower of dut semi fowt due to less tower mass is another contributor of this phenomenon the mooring line 1 tension of the dut semi fowt shown in fig 14 c is greater than oo star fowt in different ecs and the largest difference in the mean value occurs in ec4 with a 28 5 deviation however three mooring lines of the oo star fowt are used with one 50 ton clump mass for each which can significantly increase the complexity of the mooring system in design and installation making it more difficult in avoiding over loading and slack of mooring lines 5 3 3 spectral analysis spectral analysis is conducted to compare the dynamic response characteristics of the dut semi and oo star fowt in greater detail power spectrum densities psd of platform surge heave and pitch motions tower top and tower base bending moments and mooring line 1 tension in rated wind speed condition ec8 are obtained by the fast fourier transform fft method as shown in figs 15 and 16 comparing the psd of the platform motion responses in fig 15 the surge motion response of the dut semi fowt is dominated by the low frequency surge resonant response exhibiting a peak at the surge natural frequency of 0 078 rad s which is much larger than the low frequency surge resonant response of the oo star fowt at the surge natural frequency of 0 046 rad s however the wave frequency wave excitation loads govern the surge motion response of the oo star fowt and its excitation effect on the platform surge motion is significantly higher than that of the dut semi fowt although the psd of the heave motion responses of the two platforms all show maximum at the wave frequencies the heave resonant response excited by low frequency wind loads accounts for a larger proportion of the heave motion of the dut semi fowt the wave excitation loads still play a dominant role in the pitch motion responses of the two platforms in which the column spacing effect of the oo star fowt is particularly prominent in addition compared with the dut semi fowt a larger surge and pitch resonant response appears in the low frequency component of the pitch motion of the oo star fowt the psd of the tower top and tower base fa bending moments and mooring line 1 tension of the dut semi and oo star fowt at the rated wind speed under operating conditions shows similar trends in fig 16 it can be observed that the structural dynamics of the two platforms have not only considerable energy in wave frequency but also relatively large energy near the 1p frequency 1 rad s it indicates that the tower top and tower base bending moments and mooring line 1 tension is mainly affected by the wave loads and the rotation of the blades in addition the slowly varying platform motions primarily induced by low frequency wind loads and the high frequency 3p effect should also have an impact on structural dynamics of the platforms however the structural dynamics of the oo star fowt are significantly higher than the dut semi fowt regardless of low frequency resonant responses excited by wind loads the wave frequency responses excited by wave loads or the high frequency responses excited by the 3p effect the tower elastic response of the dut semi fowt will also have an impact on the tower top and tower base fa bending moments due to its flexible tower design and the tower of the oo star fowt does not show any significant effect from the tower elastic response 5 4 effect of mooring line damping on dynamic behaviors of dut semi fowt the effect of mooring line damping on the motion responses and structural dynamics of the dut semi fowt is studied in ec3 the statistical characteristics of the motion and tension responses with and without the mooring line damping are listed in table 7 the effect of mooring line damping is not significant on the motion responses of the dut semi fowt except for the surge motion only increased by 1 5 with consideration of mooring line damping while its effects are significant for the mooring line tension responses as demonstrated in fig 17 in terms of spectrum of tension for line 1 the tension response associated with the surge resonant response at 0 078 rad s 1p and 3p effects 1 and 3 rad s and eigenfrequencies 1 47 rad s of the mooring line is significantly affected by the existence of mooring line damping therefore the damping effect of the mooring lines has to be considered in the design fatigue and ultimate limit states checks of mooring 5 5 effect of fault conditions on dynamic responses of dut semi fowt to study the effect of fault conditions on the dynamic behaviors of the dut semi fowt different possible fault conditions are defined and summarized in table 8 including grid loss blade seize with and without shutdown the time of occurrence for all fault conditions is considered at 400 s during grid loss the grid is disconnected at 400 s with the wind turbine shutting down and pitching all blades to feather 90 at the maximum pitch rate 8 deg s yu et al 2017 after a delay of 0 1 s blade seize indicates the pitch actuator of one blade is blocked at 400 s staying at its instantaneous orientation then the wind turbine may either shutdown after a delay of 0 1 s or the controller tries its best to maintain the rotation speed by pitching the other two blades which corresponds to the two fault conditions of the blade seize with shutdown and without shutdown respectively the wind turbine behaviors for different possible fault conditions are illustrated in fig 18 for the case of blade seize followed by shutdown blade1 is unable to pitch then locked in instantaneous orientation with the other non faulted blades reaching full feathering in about 45 s as shown in fig 18 a the thrust of the dut semi fowt for different fault conditions is compared with normal condition without fault it can be observed that a transient impact load appears in the case of blade seize shutdown and grid loss in fig 18 c negative thrust is shown during grid loss compared with normal operating conditions the thrust in the case of blade seize without shutdown is increased due to the decrease of aerodynamic damping the time of the blade seize with shutdown is slightly delayed compared to shutdown of grid loss as shown in fig 18 b and d a single blade seize without shutdown has little effect on the rotor speed and output power of the dut semi fowt fault conditions may have a significant impact on the dynamic behaviors of the dut semi fowt due to transient effects therefore the dynamic responses of the dut semi fowt in different fault conditions for a sea state with rated wind speed ec3 are examined and compared with normal operational condition time histories and statistical characteristics of the platform motions are illustrated in figs 19 and 20 respectively it is observed that the dut semi fowt for a normal condition without fault initially operates at a mean value of 4 8 m along the surge direction then experiences a large surge motion finally return to near zero after shutdown blade seize with shutdown and grid loss in this process the mean value of the surge motion for blade seize without shutdown is increased by 7 3 compared with normal operating condition due to the increase in thrust as shown in fig 20 a for the pitch motion the effects of the fault conditions on the surge and pitch motions are similar because of the coupling effect between the platform pitch and surge motions in which the pitch motion is more affected by the impact caused by grid loss in fig 19 b the heave motion is more deviated from the swl for the case of blade seize without shutdown this is mainly due to the increase in thrust and the 5 angle between the rotation shaft of the rotor of the dtu 10 mw wind turbine and the horizontal plane which causes the vertical downward force to increase however it is clear that the transient effect of the fault conditions has little influence on the heave motion in fig 20 b because the heave motion of the dut semi fowt is well constrained and the heave motion is small in normal operational conditions for the yaw motion the ratio of the minimum value of the yaw motion between the fault condition blade seize with shutdown and the normal operating condition is 2 24 this can be attributed to the fact that the unbalanced loads caused by blade seize induces a particularly large loads on the blades and tower which in turn leads to an increase in the yaw motion of the dut semi fowt in order to study the effect of fault conditions on structural dynamics of the dut semi fowt the time histories and statistical characteristics of the tower top and tower base fa bending moments and mooring line tension are presented in figs 21 and 22 respectively it can be found that the tower top and tower base fa bending moment is highly affected by the shutdown blade seize with shutdown and grid loss fault conditions the maximum value of the tower top fa bending moment in this case the minimum value for the case of blade seize shutdown condition is 3 57 times relative to the normal operating condition due to the imbalance loads induced by blade seize furthermore although the variation of the tower base fa bending moment is also very large and the std for the case of grid loss increased by 157 0 compared with the normal operating conditions negative bending moment appear due to the removal of the thrust load and the absolute value of the negative tower base fa bending moment is significantly smaller than the corresponding positive tower base fa bending moment in addition the maximum value of the mooring line tension is increased by a factor of 1 2 due to grid loss an impact load due to the transient effect for the case of the shutdown condition also causes a large tension response but the transient response of the tension response of the mooring lines in the two cases of the blade seize with shutdown and grid loss is not much different 6 conclusions in this paper a new concept semi submersible platform dut semi fowt is proposed to support the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine in the intermediate water depth a fully coupled analysis is performed to examine the intact stability of the integrated system and a comparative study is conducted with the oo star fowt to highlight the dynamic responses and performance of the dut semi fowt under typical sea states furthermore the dynamic responses of the dut semi fowt are also studied with emphasis on the effect of mooring line damping additionally the performance of the dut semi fowt under different fault conditions is presented which is compared with the platform motions and structural loads encountered during normal operating conditions the conclusions drawn from the study can be summarized as follows 1 the newly designed semi submersible fowt system is proved to have a reasonably good stability the design of the conceptual floating platform suppresses motion well particularly in the heave direction which is the main reason of the less fluctuations in the motion responses and structural dynamics of the dut semi fowt compared with lifes50 oo star dut semi fowt is also beneficial in structural dynamics in regardless of the low frequency resonant responses excited by wind loads the wave frequency responses excited by wave loads or the responses excited by 1p and 3p effect 2 the mooring line damping does not show any significant effect on the motion responses of the dut semi fowt except for the surge motion however its effects are significant for the mooring line tension responses 3 different fault conditions should also be considered in design among which the shutdown blade seize with shutdown and grid loss fault conditions have the most significant impact on the dynamic behaviors of the dut semi fowt the thrust for the case of grid loss experiences an intense variation due to the feathering of the blades the maximum value of the tower top fa bending moment is increased by a factor of 3 57 due to the imbalance loads induced by the blade seize with shutdown however a single blade pitch failure has little effect on the motion responses and structural dynamics of the dut semi fowt in general this paper highlights the feasibility of a newly designed semi submersible floating platform in aligned wind and wave condition however the overall strength of newly designed semi submersible floating platform and the validation of the fully coupled simulation results of the openfast combined with model test will be performed in future to optimize the performance of the newly designed semi submersible floating platform credit authorship contribution statement zhixin zhao conceptualization data curation methodology investigation software writing original draft wei shi conceptualization

20348,a numerical study is conducted on vortex induced vibrations vivs of an elastically supported circular cylinder wrapped by a porous layer at a reynolds number of r e 150 the cylinder is allowed to vibrate only in the transverse direction the mass ratio and damping ratio of the system are kept constant at m r 2 and ζ 0 01 respectively the effects of darcy number 10 6 d a 50 the dimensionless thickness of the porous layer e p 0 0 25 0 5 1 and reduced velocity 3 u r 20 on the vortex shedding pattern displacement amplitude displacement frequency as well as lift and drag coefficients are investigated results show that increasing darcy number causes the displacement amplitude of the cylinder to decrease moreover values of da smaller than 10 4 resemble the wake structures of the bare cylinder in these low darcy numbers also for the bare cylinder the 2s mode is observed only at u r 5 however at higher values of darcy number the region of 2s mode is extended to higher values of reduced velocity also except for the limiting cases of very high or very small values of darcy number 10 6 or 50 the sudden decrease in the displacement amplitude at the end of the traditional lock in

shedding phenomenon occurs as a result a periodic force is exerted on the cylinder if the cylinder is supported elastically the transverse component of this force leads to a transverse vibration of the cylinder causing a phenomenon called vortex induced vibration viv bishop and hassan 1964 williamson and govardhan 2004 the viv of elastically mounted cylindrical structures is frequently encountered in many engineering applications such as heat exchanger tubes marine risers offshore platform structures submarine pipelines offshore wind turbine foundations and electric transmission lines when the frequency of vortex shedding approaches the natural frequency of the system a large amplitude vibration occurs in the transverse direction called the lock in or synchronization phenomenon due to high cyclic fluid forces acting on cylindrical structures because of the lock in phenomenon fatigue failure of these flexible structures is unavoidable trim et al 2005 zheng et al 2014 therefore the viv of cylindrical structures has been extensively studied in the past decades zhu et al 2019 janocha et al 2020 2021 tu et al 2020 bourguet 2019 mishra et al 2020 2021 janocha and ong 2021 wanderley and soares 2015 simulated the viv of a circular cylinder with a low mass damping parameter for three ranges of reynolds numbers r e namely 2000 6000 2000 12000 and 2000 24000 and reduced velocity range of 2 u r 12 they reported that the response amplitude lift coefficient and response frequency were significantly affected by reynolds number jiang et al 2016 studied the viv of a square cylinder in a channel by using a single relaxation time incompressible lattice boltzmann method at r e 200 they showed that the lateral movement of the cylinder caused two types of oscillation periodical and non periodical ones depending on different values of the cylinder to fluid density ratio the numerical investigation of the viv of a long flexible pipe conveying pulsating flow was done by dai et al 2014 their results showed that the fluctuating flow through the pipe led to a larger vibration amplitude when compared with the steady state flow conditions in an experimental study khalak and williamson 1996 investigated the forces and responses of a low mass cylinder undergoing viv in the reynolds number ranges of 2000 r e 12000 the experiment was done in the parallel and oblique shedding conditions this experiment showed that throughout the range of tested reynolds numbers drag in the parallel condition was 15 20 larger than the drag of the oblique case however it was shown that the difference of root mean square rms of lift between the two conditions considerably depended on the reynolds number although both conditions had the same value of rms of lift at r e 2000 at r e 1200 the difference between the two was reported to be about 500 in one of the latest researches izadpanh et al izadpanah et al 2019 investigated the effects of number and arrangement of fins on the vortex shedding pattern vibration amplitude and vibration frequency of the cylinderfor r e 150 in another study ashouri et al 2021 numerically studied the viv of a circular cylinder in crossflow with non newtonian power law fluids their study was conducted for the range of reduced velocity 3 u r 12 and mass ratio m r 2 in recent years the problem of flow past a cylinder covered with a porous layer has been extensively studied due to its importance in many industrial applications rashidi et al 2013 sadegh valipour et al 2014 naito and fukagata 2012 vafai and kim 1990 bruneau and mortazavi 2008 bruneau et al 2008 the porous layer can be used as a passive technique for flow control usually flow control is used to reduce the aerodynamic or hydrodynamic forces resonance mechanical vibrations and acoustic noises a numerical investigation on the reduction in drag and vortex shedding frequency of a circular cylinder wrapped by a porous layer was done by bhattacharyya and singh 2011 their investigation was conducted for darcy numbers 10 5 d a 10 2 porosities ε 0 9 and reynolds numbers 40 r e 200 their results showed that the porous coating caused the damping of viv compared with the case of a bare solid cylinder they also concluded that increasing the porous layer thickness decreased the strouhal number rashidi et al 2013 studied the fluid flow around a circular cylinder with an annular porous layer for darcy numbers 10 8 d a 10 1 reynolds numbers 1 r e 40 and a constant prandtl number equal to 7 2 their results indicated that increasing the value of darcy number decreased the drag coefficient experienced by the cylinder they also reported that increasing reynolds and darcy numbers had opposing effects on the wake length where the former decreased and the latter increased this parameter bruneau and mortazavi 2006 investigated the control of vortex shedding around a pipe section by using a porous sheath for r e 15000 and 150000 and 10 3 k 10 3 where k was the permeability of the porous sheath the results showed that the presence of the porous sheath decreased the shear effects in the boundary layer and reduced the wake instabilities they also reported a decrease up to 72 in the root mean square value of the lift coefficient c l r m s for r e 150000 in another study bruneau and mortazavi 2004 implemented a porous layer between the solid square cylinder and fluid to modify boundary layer characteristics their investigation was conducted for a range of permeabilities 10 3 k 100 at three reynolds numbers namely 300 3000 and 30000 the results showed that the porous layer reduced the drag force up to 30 rong et al 2011 investigated the fluid flow around a square cylinder with porous coating in a channel via the lattice boltzmann method for 20 r e 200 10 6 d a 10 2 and three values of porosity namely ε 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 their results indicated that for d a 10 4 the lift and drag coefficients increased as a result of increasing the porous layer thickness however they showed that for d a 10 4 the effect of porous thickness on lift and drag coefficients was negligible liu et al 2014 investigated the effect of a porous layer on hydrodynamic characteristics of a circular cylinder based on the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes method for subcritical reynolds numbers 4 5 10 4 r e 4 5 10 5 and mach numbers 0 1 m a 0 5 they studied the effects of the porous layer on aerodynamic forces streamlines and vorticity field the results showed that the porous layer reduced the velocity gradients in the boundary layer at two sides of the cylinder moreover they reported that the fluctuations of the lift coefficient decreased because of the porous layer in an experimental study ashtiani abdi et al ashtiani abdi et al 2014 investigated the velocity profile and vortex shedding around a cylinder covered with an aluminum foam in a wind tunnel for reynolds numbers between 1000 and 10000 the result showed that the strouhal number increased when the foam thickness increased in another experimental study klausmann and ruck 2017 investigated the effect of a porous layer placed on the leeward side of a circular cylinder on the drag force and pressure by varying the coating angle layer thickness and porosity for 3 10 4 r e 1 4 10 7 the results indicated that the porous layer reduced the drag coefficient compared to the cylinder without any porous coating they also indicated that among three studied parameters namely coating angle porous layer thickness and porosity the drag reduction was strongly affected by the porous layer thickness and coating angle t joen et al t joen et al 2010 studied thermo hydraulic characteristics of a single row heat exchanger consisting of metal foam covered round tubes in a wind tunnel based on the above literature survey elastically mounted circular cylinders covered with a porous layer in a crossflow have widespread applications in industries in most of those applications vortex induced vibrations are inevitable however the effect of vortex induced vibrations of a cylinder covered with a porous layer on fluid flow characteristics has not been investigated yet therefore in this paper the vortex induced vibration of an elastically mounted cylinder covered with a porous layer in crossflow is considered for r e 150 the effect of reduced velocity as well as various parameters of the porous media such as darcy number i e dimensionless permeability and thickness of the porous layer on drag and lift coefficients the amplitude of cylinder displacement and vortex shedding are investigated 2 problem description as shown in fig 1 it is assumed that the cylinder is only allowed to oscillate in the transverse direction undergoing one degree of freedom motion 1dof for fluid flow around and through a stationary cylinder with a porous layer three large medium and small domains respectively with sizes of 85d 50d 70d 40d and 45d 30d are considered in this study where d is the inner diameter of the cylinder in all three domain sizes we have kept the mesh resolution constant near the cylinder we have found that the differences between the results of the medium 70d 40d and the large 85d 50d are as small as 0 1 therefore the computational domain is considered to be a rectangle with dimensions of 70 d and 40 d in streamwise and transverse directions respectively in the stationary condition the distances of the cylinder s center from both inlet and upper boundaries are equal to 20 d the details of the porous layer s geometry are shown in fig 2 3 mathematical modeling and numerical approach 3 1 the governing equation of the fluid flow in this work the viv of an elastically mounted cylinder covered with a porous layer is considered in crossflow the governing equations of the fluid flow within the incompressible fluid and the adjacent saturated porous zones are considered to be the navier stokes equations modified for the porous zone by adding a source term accounting for the resistant forces i e darcy and brinkman terms exerted on the flow by the porous medium in the present study to consider the cylinder movments the arbitrary eulerian lagrangian approach is used it is assumed that the flow is two dimensional 2 d laminar unsteady and incompressible with constant properties moreover the porous material properties such as permeability and porosity are assumed to be homogeneous based on these assumptions the governing equations for both fluid and porous zones are defined as the continuity equation 1 u u ˆ 0 the momentum equation 2 ρ f 1 ε u t 1 ε 2 u u ˆ u p μ e f f 2 u s u where ρ f u ˆ and p are the fluid density the mesh velocity vector and the pressure respectively s u include the darcy forchheimer source terms for the momentum equation and μ e f f is the brinkman modification of the viscosity called the effective dynamic viscosity in the porous zone the ϵ and u represent the porosity of the porous layer and superficial velocity vector respectively and μ e f f and s u are calculated as 3 μ e f f μ f 4 s u μ f k u ρ f f k u u where μ f k and f are the fluid dynamic viscosity the permeability of porous material and the forchheimer coefficient f is calculated as follows vafai 1984 5 f 1 75 150 ε 1 5 in the fluid zone u is the fluid velocity vector and ε 1 s u 0 and μ e f f μ f are considered the darcy number is defined as 6 d a k d 2 reynolds number is defined as follows 7 r e ρ f u d μ f where d and u are the inner diameter of the cylinder and the free stream velocity respectively also the dimensionless thickness of the porous layer e p is defined as follows 8 e p d d where d is the porous layer thickness as shown in fig 2 3 2 boundary conditions the boundary conditions used in this work are presented in this section at the inlet top and bottom boundaries velocity components are defined as 9 u u v 0 at the outlet boundary pressure outlet boundary conditions are used as follows 10 p 0 u x 0 v x 0 at the surface of the solid cylinder 11 u 0 v y where y is the time derivative of the cylinder displacement velocity of the cylinder in the transverse direction 3 3 the governing equations of the cylinder motions the amplitudes of transverse displacement and drag coefficient for 1 dof and 2 dof are compared in gao et al 2019 2020 for reynolds number mass ratio and damping ratio of 150 2 and zero respectively according to the results presented in gao et al 2019 2020 the only difference between the 1 dof and 2 dof transverse amplitudes is that in the 2 dof model the transverse amplitudes increase in the lock in region 4 ur 7 slightly due to the influence of streamwise vibration the differences between the drag results for both models are even smaller than those of the displacement amplitudes therefore in this study the vibration of the elastically mounted cylinder is modeled by considering 1dof using a mass spring damping system the cylinder is restricted to oscillate only in the transverse direction therefore the non dimensional equation for the cylinder motion is given as follows 12 y 4 π ζ u r y 4 π 2 u r 2 y c l 2 m r where y is the nondimensional displacement of the cylinder y d y and y are respectively the velocity and acceleration of the cylinder divided by d u r u f n d is the reduced velocity where f n 1 2 π k e q m e q is the natural frequency and k e q and m e q are the equivalent stiffness and mass of the system respectively m r m e q ρ f d 2 is the mass ratio and ζ c e q 2 m e q k e q is the damping ratio with c e q being the damping constant the instantaneous drag and lift coefficients are defined as follows 13 c d f x 1 2 ρ f u 2 d 14 c l f y 1 2 ρ f u 2 d where f x and f y are respectively the streamwise and transverse components of the force experienced by the cylinder in equations 13 and 14 the force components f x and f y contain the effect of pressure and viscous forces as well as the resistance exerted by the porous media as shown in the following equation 15 f a s p n τ w n da p s u d where τ w is the shear stress a s is the inner surface of the cylinder n is the normal unit vector of the cylinder surface and p is the volume of the porous layer the average drag coefficient c d is calculated as follows 16 c d 1 γ t t γ c d d t for the lift coefficient the root mean square rms value of the lift coefficient c l r m s is calculated as follows 17 c l r m s 1 γ t t γ c l 2 d t where γ is the time duration used to calculate the average drag and lift coefficients the equation of motion of the cylinder eq 12 are solved by using the fourth order runge kutta algorithm as follows 18 y t δ t y t δ t 6 k 1 2 k 2 2 k 3 k 4 y t δ t y t δ t 6 l 1 2 l 2 2 l 3 l 4 where 19 k 1 f l t m e q k e q m e q y t c e q m e q y t l 1 y t 20 k 2 f l t m e q k e q m e q y t l 1 δ t 2 c e q m e q y t k 1 δ t 2 l 2 y t k 1 δ t 2 21 k 3 f l t m e q k e q m e q y t l 2 δ t 2 c e q m

numerical methodology the governing equations are solved by the ansys fluent the simple semi implicit method for the pressure linked equations algorithm is used for coupling between the pressure and the velocity vector the value of 10 6 is adopted for convergence criteria of continuity and momentum equations moreover the second order upwind and the least squares cell based schemes are used for discretization of the convective and gradient terms respectively the first order explicit scheme is adopted for the temporal term and the time step equal to 0 0001 is used in the transient simulation 4 results and discussions in the present study the vortex induced vibrations of a solid cylinder covered with a porous layer are considered at r e 150 m r 2 and ζ 0 01 the effects of different parameters such as reduced velocity darcy number and porous thickness on the displacement lift and drag coefficients of the porous covered cylinder in crossflow are investigated in this study the reynolds number and porosity of the porous layer are taken as 150 and 0 9 respectively also a wide range of reduced velocity 3 u r 20 three different values of darcy number 10 4 10 3 and 10 2 and four different values of the dimensionless thickness e p 0 0 25 0 5 and 1 are considered unless otherwise noted the value of e p 0 5 is used throughout the manuscript 4 1 grid independence study to certify the mesh independence of current results four meshes with 11496 20098 58008 and 98768 cells are used the coarse to fine meshes are denoted by g1 to g4 respectively for a cylinder coated with an annular porous layer in the stationary condition c d and c l r m s are calculated by using all meshes and the results are compared with each other in table 1 as seen the relative error between the results obtained by using g3 and g4 meshes are less than 1 therefore all the presented results in this paper are based on the mesh g3 for the sake of computational efficiency this mesh is shown in fig 3 the independence of the results from the time step is also investigated in table 2 for stationary cylinder with porous layer at d a 10 3 it is observed that for time steps less than 0 001 the results do not change given that the viv simulation is prone to divergence time step of 0 0001 was chosen for these simulations to prevent the divergence of the solutions it should be noted that in all viv simulations with this time step the local cell convective courant number is less than 0 3 which ensures that the results are independent of the time step 4 2 validation of the numerical method to validate the present numerical model the displacement amplitudes of an elastically mounted cylinder covered with a porous layer in very high d a 10 a n d 50 and very low d a 10 6 darcy numbers at r e 150 are compared with the displacement amplitudes given by the literature for a solid cylinder without the porous layer it is worth mentioning that for the geometry considered here both very low darcy numbers or extremely high darcy numbers resemble the behavior of a solid cylinder that is in the low darcy limit flow barely enters the porous layer and the porous wrapped cylinder behaves like a solid cylinder with a diameter equivalent to its outer diameter d o refer to fig 2 in contrast in the high darcy limit the flow easily enters the porous layer and the porous wrapped cylinder behaves like a solid cylinder with a diameter equivalent to its inner diameter d as shown in fig 2 fig 4 compares the results of displacement amplitude of the cylinder obtained from the present study for different darcy numbers to those available in the literature bao et al 2012 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 zhao 2013 at different values of reduced velocity as seen in fig 4 the results of the present study and those reported by bao et al 2012 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 zhao 2013 are in good agreement fig 5 compares the normalized response frequency f f n of a porous covered cylinder obtained from the present study for darcy numbers of 10 6 and 50 to those obtained by zhao 2013 wang et al 2019 for a bare cylinder i e a solid cylinder without any porous coating in fig 5 one can identify the lock in region as a region wherein the normalized response frequency takes the value equal to 1 as seen in fig 5 the present study predicts the lock in region within the reduced velocity range of 5 u r 7 for both values of darcy number as seen in fig 5 it can be concluded that generally the normalized response frequencies of the current study are in good agreement with those available in the literature 4 3 flow pattern fig 6 shows the vorticity contours around the porous annulus at darcy number of 10 4 reduced velocities of 5 and 6 in four different locations including the crest point i e the maximum displacement zero displacement with a downward movement trough point i e the minimum displacement and zero displacement with an upward movement as can be seen in fig 6 in each reduced velocity the pattern of vortex shedding remains unchanged for all different locations of the cylinder studied here the pattern of vortex shedding for u r 5 is of the form 2s where two single vortices with opposite rotation are shed on two distinct rows during each cycle of vibration however for u r 6 a 2s vortex pattern appears where two single vortices with opposite rotations are shed on a single row for each cycle of vibration fig 7 shows the wake patterns behind the porous covered cylinder at the crest point of displacement for different values of darcy number and reduced velocity the vorticity contours placed in each column are for the same darcy number and those placed in each row have the same value of the reduced velocity at d a 10 4 except for u r 5 vortex shedding pattern follows the classical 2s mode because of the small amplitude oscillation of the cylinder at u r 5 the flow pattern is the 2s mode because of the large amplitude vibration of the cylinder in this study similar wake patterns are also observed at d a 10 6 these flow pattern distributions for various reduced velocities are also observed for the solid cylinder without any porous coating by other researchers bao et al 2012 wang et al 2019 the reason behind these similarities between the flow pattern of a porous covered cylinder and a solid cylinder is that for d a 10 4 flow hardly passes through the porous layer and the porous covered cylinder resembles the flow behavior of a solid cylinder although at these extremely low darcy numbers d a 10 4 the 2s mode is observed only for u r 5 at larger values of darcy number the 2s mode is further extended to the region with higher values of reduced velocity at d a 10 3 and d a 10 2 the 2s mode is observed in the reduced velocity ranges of 5 u r 7 and 5 u r 6 respectively 4 4 velocity and pressure coefficient distributions inside the porous layer in this section the effect of darcy number reduced velocity and the cylinder location at zero i e rest point and maximum displacements i e crest point on the pressure coefficient and velocity distributions in the peripheral direction are presented for the porous layer at radial locations r r i r o 2 and r r o refer to fig 2 the pressure coefficient is calculated as follows 23 c p p p 1 2 ρ f u 2 where ρ f is the fluid density p is the fluid pressure and p is the fluid pressure at the inlet boundary fig 8 shows the pressure coefficient distributions for d a 10 2 and different values of the reduced velocity at the radial locations r r i r o 2 the middle surface of the porous layer and r r o the outer surface of the porous layer the plots in the left column of fig 8 are related to the maximum displacement of the cylinder whereas the right column is corresponding to the zero displacement of the cylinder during the vortex induced vibration the first and second rows in fig 8 are related to radial locations r r i r o 2 and r r o respectively as seen in fig 8 for the same displacement of the cylinder the pressure coefficient distributions related to both radial locations are nearly identical this can be attributed to the high flow penetration into the porous layer which occurs due to the high darcy number of 10 2 in other words when darcy number is high 10 2 the flow passing through the porous layer experiences a low resistant force from the solid matrix which causes a lower pressure drop within the porous layer that is why the pressure coefficient does not change much at the two radial locations it can be seen in fig 8 that the effect of reduced velocity on the pressure coefficient distributions is more pronounced for the rear portion of the cylinder especially when it is at the location of zero displacement y 0 as shown in fig 8 at the front side of the cylinder in both zero displacement and maximum displacement positions a stagnation point is created which leads to the generation of a high pressure zone upstream of the cylinder because of this stagnation point the pressure distribution at the front side does not change by the cylinder position however the pressure distribution behind the cylinder changes by changing the position of the cylinder which can be attributed to the vortex shedding developed behind the cylinder fig 9 presents the pressure coefficient distributions along the peripheral direction at two radial locations within the porous layer namely r r i r o 2 and r r o see fig 2 for u r 5 and u r 6 and d a 10 4 10 2 at the crest point of cylinder displacement in fig 9 the plots on the first and second rows are for r r i r o 2 and r r o whereas the left and right columns are corresponding to u r 5 and u r 6 it is seen in fig 9 that at d a 10 2 the pressure distributions in the peripheral direction related to the two radial locations are nearly identical because of the high portion of flow passing through the porous layer at this darcy number as explained before in fig 8 since at the low darcy number d a 10 4 the flow penetration is small and flow experiences more resistance from the porous medium the pressure distributions for the two radial locations r r i r o 2 and r r o are different from each other moreover as seen in fig 9 the pressure distributions through the front part of the porous layer are not affected by the reduced velocity it is because at all values of reduced velocity in the front portion of the porous layer a stagnation point and therefore a high pressure zone is generated however in the back portion of the porous layer the pressure distributions are mainly affected by the pattern of the vortex shedding which varies at different values of the reduced velocity fig 10 presents the velocity magnitude distributions within the porous layer for the same conditions as described in fig 9 in another word the first column second column first row and second row are corresponded to u r 5 u r 6 r r i r o 2 and r r o respectively as observed at d a 10 4 for all reduced velocities the velocity magnitude at r r i r o 2 is equal to zero which is not the case at r r o this means that at this darcy number d a 10 4 flow can only penetrate to a very small depth near the surface of the porous layer because of the high resistant force porous layer offers to the flow in contrast the non zero velocity magnitude at both radial locations r r i r o 2 and r r o for d a 10 2 is an indication of high flow portion passing through the porous layer at this darcy number because of this in fig 10 similar peripheral distributions of the velocity magnitude is seen at both radial locations r r i r o 2 and r r o as seen in fig 10 the effect of reduced velocity on the distribution of the velocity magnitude seems to be more pronounced for d a 10 3 for two of the radial locations 4 5 time history of the displacement and hydrodynamic coefficients fig 11 shows the time history of the cylinder displacement for d a 10 3 at different values of reduced velocity it is seen that for u r 6 the peak to peak amplitude a p p of the cylinder displacement increases with increasing the reduced velocity until it reacheas a maximum value at u r 6 from fig 11 one can observe that further increase in reduced velocity beyond u r 6 causes a p p to decrease the time history of the cylinder displacement y y m a x y m i n 2 d at d a 10 2 is shown in fig 12 for different values of the reduced velocity it is observed that increasing the value of reduced velocity causes the peak to peak amplitude a p p of the cylinder displacement to increase from a minimum value at u r 3 to a maximum value at u r 6 further increase in reduced velocity beyond u r 6 reduces the peak to peak amplitude the instantaneous lift coefficient is shown in fig 13 for d a 10 2 opposed to what is discussed in fig 11 for the time history of the cylinder displacements the maximum peak to peak amplitude for the time history of lift coefficient occurs at the reduced velocity of 5 as seen in fig 13 furthermore in fig 13 one can observe that the peak to peak amplitude for the case with u r 9 is approximately equal to zero fig 14 displays the instantaneous drag coefficient for d a 10 2 at different values of reduced velocity it is seen that the highest values of average maximum and peak to peak amplitude of the drag coefficient occur at u r 7 it is also seen that for u r 4 the peak to peak amplitude of the drag coefficient is approximately equal to zero fig 14 shows that the stationary cylinder experiences a lower drag coefficient compared with the cylinder that undergoes viv for all values of the reduced velocity examined here except for u r 3 where the drag coefficient of the stationary cylinder slightly exceeds that of the vibrating cylinder around the times it reaches its maximum value the fast fourier transform fft analysis of cylinder displacements the left axis with blue color and lift coefficients the right axis with red color at different values of the reduced velocity is plotted in fig 15 for d a 10 2 except u r 5 5 and u r 6 other reduced velocities have only one peak in their fft spectrum it can be seen that for all reduced velocities the frequencies of the cylinder displacement and those of the lift coefficient are exactly matched with each other and there is no difference between them it should be explained that the frequencies with large amplitudes are the foundations of a time series if the frequencies of the spectrum are sorted in a descending order in terms of their amplitudes then the first frequency with the largest amplitude is called the first dominant frequency or only dominant frequency and 2nd and 3rd frequencies are called the second and third dominant frequencies respectively and so on on the other hand the frequencies with small amplitudes have not significant effect on the instantaneous system response and can be ignored furthermore the amplitude ratio of a frequency a r is defined as the amplitude of this frequency divided by the largest amplitude in the spectrum here the dominant frequencies are defined as the frequencies with an amplitude ratio larger than 0 25 based on the accepted threshold a r 25 it can be seen all reduced velocities except u r 5 5 and u r 6 have only one dominant frequency number of dominant frequencies for reduced velocities of 5 5 and 6 respectively the number of dominant frequencies at u r 6 is very high the values of these dominant frequencies are listed in table 3 the fft spectra of cylinder displacements and the lift coefficients for different values of reduced velocity at d a 10 3 are plotted in fig 16 as can be seen in fig 16 except u r 5 all other reduced velocities have only one peak in their frequency domains that is u r 5 has one major peak and four minor peaks in its spectrum frequency domain analysis of cylinder displacement and lift coefficient at different values of reduced velocity in d a 10 4 are presented in fig 17 at u r 4 and u r 4 5 several peaks appear in the frequency spectrum of the response of the system for other reduced velocities only one peak appears in the frequency spectrum in fig 18 the normalized response frequency of the porous cylinder for different values of darcy number 10 4 10 3 10 2 and 50 is plotted against the reduced velocity this figure reveals that the traditional lock in regime well documented for solid cylinders is observed only at the limiting case of the very high darcy number d a 50 although it is not shown in fig 18 also for a very small value of darcy number d a 10 6 the traditional lock in regime is observed during the traditional lock in regime within some range of reduced velocities the value of the normalized response frequency approaches one and the amplitude of vibration increases significantly in the desynchronization regime the reduced velocities larger than those of the lock in regime the vibration amplitude significantly reduces and approaches zero as observed in fig 18 at the intermediate values of darcy number 10 4 10 3 10 2 the traditional lock in regime is not observed therefore as will be discussed later in fig 21 for these intermediate darcy numbers the sharp decrease in the amplitude of vibration does not happen due to the absence of the lock in phenomenon also from fig 18 it can be seen that in each value of the reduced velocity the normalized response frequency has its highest value at d a 50 limiting case of the bare cylinder it is because the normalized response frequency is proportional to the square of the characteristic diameter of porous annulus d c h as follow 24 f f n f μ r e ρ u r d c h 2 in this study the inner diameter d of the porous annulus is chosen as the characteristic diameter except for high values of darcy number d a 50 the actual and effective diameter of the porous cylinder is larger than d and for very low values of darcy number it is equal to 1 2 e p d therefore the calculated normalized response frequencies for d a 50 are lower than those of actual values 4 6 the average values of the hydrodynamic coefficients and the cylinder displacement amplitude fig 19 shows the variation of c d versus reduced velocity for different values of the darcy number as well as the case of the stationary solid cylinder wrapped with a porous layer u r 0 as seen in fig 19 for all values of darcy number studied here a jump in c d occurs at some reduced velocity form fig 19 it can be observed that for darcy numbers of 10 2 10 3 and 10 4 this jump in c d starts at u r 3 4 and 5 respectively it is observed that the jump in the c d is higher for the lower values of the darcy number fig 19 also shows that over the entire range of the reduced velocity the drag coefficient related to the case with d a 10 2 is smaller than those of d a 10 3 and d a 10 4 as seen in fig 19 this is not the case when the drag coefficient of d a 10 3 and d a 10 4 are compared to each other that is c d for d a 10 3 surpasses that of d a 10 4 only within the ranges of reduced velocity 0 u r 4 and 6 u r 15 for d a 10 3 and d a 10 4 the maximums of c d occur at u r 5 5 and u r 7 respectively as seen for d a 10 3 and d a 10 4 the maximums of c d occur at u r 5 5 and u r 7 respectively one can observe that the case with d a 10 2 has two maximums of c d which occur at u r 4 5 and u r 7 fig 20 shows the variation of root mean square values of the lift coefficient c l r m s versus reduced velocity for different values of the darcy number as well as the case of the stationary solid cylinder wrapped with a porous layer as seen from fig 20 for all reduced velocities when darcy number increases c l r m s also increases for all values of darcy numbers c l r m s increases sharply at u r 3 and reaches its maximum value at u r 5 after u r 5 it reduces by further increase in u r fig 21 shows the variation of the dimensionless amplitude of displacement y y m a x y m i n 2 d versus reduced velocity for different values of darcy number as seen in fig 21 increasing darcy number causes a reduction in cylinder displacement amplitude it is seen in fig 21 that for each darcy number when the reduced velocity is increased from u r 3 the displacement amplitude first increases and reaches a maximum value at some critical value of the reduced velocity after that it reduces when the reduced velocity is further increased beyond this critical value the value of reduced velocity related to the maximum displacement of the cylinder increases by increasing the darcy number for darcy numbers of d a 10 4 10 3 and 10 2 the maximum amplitude of displacement occurs at the reduced velocity of u r 4 5 5 and 6 respectively in the case of very high darcy number of 50 which resembles the behavior of a bare solid cylinder with diameter d see fig 2 the displacement amplitude is reduced suddenly at a reduced velocity where the lock in regime is terminated as discussed in figs 4 and 21 and approaches zero at higher values of reduced velocity since for intermediate values of darcy number d a 10 4 10 3 and 10 2 the lock in regime is eliminated the displacement amplitude corresponding to those darcy numbers decreases slowly and reaches a constant value at high values of the reduced velocity 4 7 effects of the thickness of the porous layer on the average drag and lift coefficients and cylinder displacement at da 10 4 in this section the effects of porous layer dimensionless thickness e p on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the cylinder are investigated fig 22 presents the variation of c d versus reduced velocity for four different values of dimensionless thickness e p 0 0 25 0 5 and 1 according to fig 22 as the thickness of the porous layer increases c d experienced by the cylinder also increases fig 23 shows the variation of c l r m s versus reduced velocity for four different values of dimensionless thickness e p 0 0 25 0 5 and 1 as seen in fig 23 c l r m s increases when the thickness of the porous layer is increased fig 24 shows the variation of the amplitude of the displacement versus reduced velocity for three different values of dimensionless thickness e p 0 0 25 0 5 and 1 as seen in fig 24 the displacement amplitude of the cylinder increases when the thickness of the porous layer is increased 5 conclusion in this study the one degree of freedom 1dof vortex induced vibration viv of a circular cylinder covered by an annular porous layer is numerically investigated for r e 150 ζ 0 01 and m r 2 a wide range of darcy numbers 10 6 d a 50 and reduced velocity 3 u r 9 with three different values of dimensionless thickness of the porous layer 0 0 25 0 5 1 were considered the effects of reduced velocity darcy number and the dimensionless porous layer on the vortex shedding pattern displacement amplitude displacement frequency and the lift and drag coefficients are investigated it is concluded that at most reduced velocity values by increasing darcy number drag and lift coefficients and cylinder displacement amplitude decrease it is also seen that by increasing reduced velocity from u r 3 to u r 9 drag and lift coefficients as well as the cylinder displacement amplitudes increase to a maximum value and then decrease by a further increase in the reduced velocity it is also concluded by increasing the porous layer thickness the drag and lift coefficients as well as the cylinder displacement amplitude increase at d a 10 4 and u r 5 the flow pattern is the 2s mode and in other reduced velocities of this darcy number the vortex shedding pattern follows the classical 2s mode therefore d a 10 4 resembles the wake structures of the bare cylinder also at larger values of darcy number the 2s mode is extended to the region of higher values of reduced velocity at d a 10 3 and d a 10 2 the 2s mode is observed in the reduced velocity ranges of 5 u 7 and 5 u 6 respectively furthermore it can be concluded that except for the limiting cases of very high and very small values of darcy number 10 6 or 50 the traditional lock in regime is eliminated from the response frequency of the system therefore for intermediate darcy numbers d a 10 4 10 3 and 10 2 the displacement amplitude decreases slowly and reaches a constant value at high reduced velocities due to the absence of the lock in phenomenon credit authorship contribution statement elham ebrahimi

20348,a numerical study is conducted on vortex induced vibrations vivs of an elastically supported circular cylinder wrapped by a porous layer at a reynolds number of r e 150 the cylinder is allowed to vibrate only in the transverse direction the mass ratio and damping ratio of the system are kept constant at m r 2 and ζ 0 01 respectively the effects of darcy number 10 6 d a 50 the dimensionless thickness of the porous layer e p 0 0 25 0 5 1 and reduced velocity 3 u r 20 on the vortex shedding pattern displacement amplitude displacement frequency as well as lift and drag coefficients are investigated results show that increasing darcy number causes the displacement amplitude of the cylinder to decrease moreover values of da smaller than 10 4 resemble the wake structures of the bare cylinder in these low darcy numbers also for the bare cylinder the 2s mode is observed only at u r 5 however at higher values of darcy number the region of 2s mode is extended to higher values of reduced velocity also except for the limiting cases of very high or very small values of darcy number 10 6 or 50 the sudden decrease in the displacement amplitude at the end of the traditional lock in

shedding phenomenon occurs as a result a periodic force is exerted on the cylinder if the cylinder is supported elastically the transverse component of this force leads to a transverse vibration of the cylinder causing a phenomenon called vortex induced vibration viv bishop and hassan 1964 williamson and govardhan 2004 the viv of elastically mounted cylindrical structures is frequently encountered in many engineering applications such as heat exchanger tubes marine risers offshore platform structures submarine pipelines offshore wind turbine foundations and electric transmission lines when the frequency of vortex shedding approaches the natural frequency of the system a large amplitude vibration occurs in the transverse direction called the lock in or synchronization phenomenon due to high cyclic fluid forces acting on cylindrical structures because of the lock in phenomenon fatigue failure of these flexible structures is unavoidable trim et al 2005 zheng et al 2014 therefore the viv of cylindrical structures has been extensively studied in the past decades zhu et al 2019 janocha et al 2020 2021 tu et al 2020 bourguet 2019 mishra et al 2020 2021 janocha and ong 2021 wanderley and soares 2015 simulated the viv of a circular cylinder with a low mass damping parameter for three ranges of reynolds numbers r e namely 2000 6000 2000 12000 and 2000 24000 and reduced velocity range of 2 u r 12 they reported that the response amplitude lift coefficient and response frequency were significantly affected by reynolds number jiang et al 2016 studied the viv of a square cylinder in a channel by using a single relaxation time incompressible lattice boltzmann method at r e 200 they showed that the lateral movement of the cylinder caused two types of oscillation periodical and non periodical ones depending on different values of the cylinder to fluid density ratio the numerical investigation of the viv of a long flexible pipe conveying pulsating flow was done by dai et al 2014 their results showed that the fluctuating flow through the pipe led to a larger vibration amplitude when compared with the steady state flow conditions in an experimental study khalak and williamson 1996 investigated the forces and responses of a low mass cylinder undergoing viv in the reynolds number ranges of 2000 r e 12000 the experiment was done in the parallel and oblique shedding conditions this experiment showed that throughout the range of tested reynolds numbers drag in the parallel condition was 15 20 larger than the drag of the oblique case however it was shown that the difference of root mean square rms of lift between the two conditions considerably depended on the reynolds number although both conditions had the same value of rms of lift at r e 2000 at r e 1200 the difference between the two was reported to be about 500 in one of the latest researches izadpanh et al izadpanah et al 2019 investigated the effects of number and arrangement of fins on the vortex shedding pattern vibration amplitude and vibration frequency of the cylinderfor r e 150 in another study ashouri et al 2021 numerically studied the viv of a circular cylinder in crossflow with non newtonian power law fluids their study was conducted for the range of reduced velocity 3 u r 12 and mass ratio m r 2 in recent years the problem of flow past a cylinder covered with a porous layer has been extensively studied due to its importance in many industrial applications rashidi et al 2013 sadegh valipour et al 2014 naito and fukagata 2012 vafai and kim 1990 bruneau and mortazavi 2008 bruneau et al 2008 the porous layer can be used as a passive technique for flow control usually flow control is used to reduce the aerodynamic or hydrodynamic forces resonance mechanical vibrations and acoustic noises a numerical investigation on the reduction in drag and vortex shedding frequency of a circular cylinder wrapped by a porous layer was done by bhattacharyya and singh 2011 their investigation was conducted for darcy numbers 10 5 d a 10 2 porosities ε 0 9 and reynolds numbers 40 r e 200 their results showed that the porous coating caused the damping of viv compared with the case of a bare solid cylinder they also concluded that increasing the porous layer thickness decreased the strouhal number rashidi et al 2013 studied the fluid flow around a circular cylinder with an annular porous layer for darcy numbers 10 8 d a 10 1 reynolds numbers 1 r e 40 and a constant prandtl number equal to 7 2 their results indicated that increasing the value of darcy number decreased the drag coefficient experienced by the cylinder they also reported that increasing reynolds and darcy numbers had opposing effects on the wake length where the former decreased and the latter increased this parameter bruneau and mortazavi 2006 investigated the control of vortex shedding around a pipe section by using a porous sheath for r e 15000 and 150000 and 10 3 k 10 3 where k was the permeability of the porous sheath the results showed that the presence of the porous sheath decreased the shear effects in the boundary layer and reduced the wake instabilities they also reported a decrease up to 72 in the root mean square value of the lift coefficient c l r m s for r e 150000 in another study bruneau and mortazavi 2004 implemented a porous layer between the solid square cylinder and fluid to modify boundary layer characteristics their investigation was conducted for a range of permeabilities 10 3 k 100 at three reynolds numbers namely 300 3000 and 30000 the results showed that the porous layer reduced the drag force up to 30 rong et al 2011 investigated the fluid flow around a square cylinder with porous coating in a channel via the lattice boltzmann method for 20 r e 200 10 6 d a 10 2 and three values of porosity namely ε 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 their results indicated that for d a 10 4 the lift and drag coefficients increased as a result of increasing the porous layer thickness however they showed that for d a 10 4 the effect of porous thickness on lift and drag coefficients was negligible liu et al 2014 investigated the effect of a porous layer on hydrodynamic characteristics of a circular cylinder based on the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes method for subcritical reynolds numbers 4 5 10 4 r e 4 5 10 5 and mach numbers 0 1 m a 0 5 they studied the effects of the porous layer on aerodynamic forces streamlines and vorticity field the results showed that the porous layer reduced the velocity gradients in the boundary layer at two sides of the cylinder moreover they reported that the fluctuations of the lift coefficient decreased because of the porous layer in an experimental study ashtiani abdi et al ashtiani abdi et al 2014 investigated the velocity profile and vortex shedding around a cylinder covered with an aluminum foam in a wind tunnel for reynolds numbers between 1000 and 10000 the result showed that the strouhal number increased when the foam thickness increased in another experimental study klausmann and ruck 2017 investigated the effect of a porous layer placed on the leeward side of a circular cylinder on the drag force and pressure by varying the coating angle layer thickness and porosity for 3 10 4 r e 1 4 10 7 the results indicated that the porous layer reduced the drag coefficient compared to the cylinder without any porous coating they also indicated that among three studied parameters namely coating angle porous layer thickness and porosity the drag reduction was strongly affected by the porous layer thickness and coating angle t joen et al t joen et al 2010 studied thermo hydraulic characteristics of a single row heat exchanger consisting of metal foam covered round tubes in a wind tunnel based on the above literature survey elastically mounted circular cylinders covered with a porous layer in a crossflow have widespread applications in industries in most of those applications vortex induced vibrations are inevitable however the effect of vortex induced vibrations of a cylinder covered with a porous layer on fluid flow characteristics has not been investigated yet therefore in this paper the vortex induced vibration of an elastically mounted cylinder covered with a porous layer in crossflow is considered for r e 150 the effect of reduced velocity as well as various parameters of the porous media such as darcy number i e dimensionless permeability and thickness of the porous layer on drag and lift coefficients the amplitude of cylinder displacement and vortex shedding are investigated 2 problem description as shown in fig 1 it is assumed that the cylinder is only allowed to oscillate in the transverse direction undergoing one degree of freedom motion 1dof for fluid flow around and through a stationary cylinder with a porous layer three large medium and small domains respectively with sizes of 85d 50d 70d 40d and 45d 30d are considered in this study where d is the inner diameter of the cylinder in all three domain sizes we have kept the mesh resolution constant near the cylinder we have found that the differences between the results of the medium 70d 40d and the large 85d 50d are as small as 0 1 therefore the computational domain is considered to be a rectangle with dimensions of 70 d and 40 d in streamwise and transverse directions respectively in the stationary condition the distances of the cylinder s center from both inlet and upper boundaries are equal to 20 d the details of the porous layer s geometry are shown in fig 2 3 mathematical modeling and numerical approach 3 1 the governing equation of the fluid flow in this work the viv of an elastically mounted cylinder covered with a porous layer is considered in crossflow the governing equations of the fluid flow within the incompressible fluid and the adjacent saturated porous zones are considered to be the navier stokes equations modified for the porous zone by adding a source term accounting for the resistant forces i e darcy and brinkman terms exerted on the flow by the porous medium in the present study to consider the cylinder movments the arbitrary eulerian lagrangian approach is used it is assumed that the flow is two dimensional 2 d laminar unsteady and incompressible with constant properties moreover the porous material properties such as permeability and porosity are assumed to be homogeneous based on these assumptions the governing equations for both fluid and porous zones are defined as the continuity equation 1 u u ˆ 0 the momentum equation 2 ρ f 1 ε u t 1 ε 2 u u ˆ u p μ e f f 2 u s u where ρ f u ˆ and p are the fluid density the mesh velocity vector and the pressure respectively s u include the darcy forchheimer source terms for the momentum equation and μ e f f is the brinkman modification of the viscosity called the effective dynamic viscosity in the porous zone the ϵ and u represent the porosity of the porous layer and superficial velocity vector respectively and μ e f f and s u are calculated as 3 μ e f f μ f 4 s u μ f k u ρ f f k u u where μ f k and f are the fluid dynamic viscosity the permeability of porous material and the forchheimer coefficient f is calculated as follows vafai 1984 5 f 1 75 150 ε 1 5 in the fluid zone u is the fluid velocity vector and ε 1 s u 0 and μ e f f μ f are considered the darcy number is defined as 6 d a k d 2 reynolds number is defined as follows 7 r e ρ f u d μ f where d and u are the inner diameter of the cylinder and the free stream velocity respectively also the dimensionless thickness of the porous layer e p is defined as follows 8 e p d d where d is the porous layer thickness as shown in fig 2 3 2 boundary conditions the boundary conditions used in this work are presented in this section at the inlet top and bottom boundaries velocity components are defined as 9 u u v 0 at the outlet boundary pressure outlet boundary conditions are used as follows 10 p 0 u x 0 v x 0 at the surface of the solid cylinder 11 u 0 v y where y is the time derivative of the cylinder displacement velocity of the cylinder in the transverse direction 3 3 the governing equations of the cylinder motions the amplitudes of transverse displacement and drag coefficient for 1 dof and 2 dof are compared in gao et al 2019 2020 for reynolds number mass ratio and damping ratio of 150 2 and zero respectively according to the results presented in gao et al 2019 2020 the only difference between the 1 dof and 2 dof transverse amplitudes is that in the 2 dof model the transverse amplitudes increase in the lock in region 4 ur 7 slightly due to the influence of streamwise vibration the differences between the drag results for both models are even smaller than those of the displacement amplitudes therefore in this study the vibration of the elastically mounted cylinder is modeled by considering 1dof using a mass spring damping system the cylinder is restricted to oscillate only in the transverse direction therefore the non dimensional equation for the cylinder motion is given as follows 12 y 4 π ζ u r y 4 π 2 u r 2 y c l 2 m r where y is the nondimensional displacement of the cylinder y d y and y are respectively the velocity and acceleration of the cylinder divided by d u r u f n d is the reduced velocity where f n 1 2 π k e q m e q is the natural frequency and k e q and m e q are the equivalent stiffness and mass of the system respectively m r m e q ρ f d 2 is the mass ratio and ζ c e q 2 m e q k e q is the damping ratio with c e q being the damping constant the instantaneous drag and lift coefficients are defined as follows 13 c d f x 1 2 ρ f u 2 d 14 c l f y 1 2 ρ f u 2 d where f x and f y are respectively the streamwise and transverse components of the force experienced by the cylinder in equations 13 and 14 the force components f x and f y contain the effect of pressure and viscous forces as well as the resistance exerted by the porous media as shown in the following equation 15 f a s p n τ w n da p s u d where τ w is the shear stress a s is the inner surface of the cylinder n is the normal unit vector of the cylinder surface and p is the volume of the porous layer the average drag coefficient c d is calculated as follows 16 c d 1 γ t t γ c d d t for the lift coefficient the root mean square rms value of the lift coefficient c l r m s is calculated as follows 17 c l r m s 1 γ t t γ c l 2 d t where γ is the time duration used to calculate the average drag and lift coefficients the equation of motion of the cylinder eq 12 are solved by using the fourth order runge kutta algorithm as follows 18 y t δ t y t δ t 6 k 1 2 k 2 2 k 3 k 4 y t δ t y t δ t 6 l 1 2 l 2 2 l 3 l 4 where

numerical methodology the governing equations are solved by the ansys fluent the simple semi implicit method for the pressure linked equations algorithm is used for coupling between the pressure and the velocity vector the value of 10 6 is adopted for convergence criteria of continuity and momentum equations moreover the second order upwind and the least squares cell based schemes are used for discretization of the convective and gradient terms respectively the first order explicit scheme is adopted for the temporal term and the time step equal to 0 0001 is used in the transient simulation 4 results and discussions in the present study the vortex induced vibrations of a solid cylinder covered with a porous layer are considered at r e 150 m r 2 and ζ 0 01 the effects of different parameters such as reduced velocity darcy number and porous thickness on the displacement lift and drag coefficients of the porous covered cylinder in crossflow are investigated in this study the reynolds number and porosity of the porous layer are taken as 150 and 0 9 respectively also a wide range of reduced velocity 3 u r 20 three different values of darcy number 10 4 10 3 and 10 2 and four different values of the dimensionless thickness e p 0 0 25 0 5 and 1 are considered unless otherwise noted the value of e p 0 5 is used throughout the manuscript 4 1 grid independence study to certify the mesh independence of current results four meshes with 11496 20098 58008 and 98768 cells are used the coarse to fine meshes are denoted by g1 to g4 respectively for a cylinder coated with an annular porous layer in the stationary condition c d and c l r m s are calculated by using all meshes and the results are compared with each other in table 1 as seen the relative error between the results obtained by using g3 and g4 meshes are less than 1 therefore all the presented results in this paper are based on the mesh g3 for the sake of computational efficiency this mesh is shown in fig 3 the independence of the results from the time step is also investigated in table 2 for stationary cylinder with porous layer at d a 10 3 it is observed that for time steps less than 0 001 the results do not change given that the viv simulation is prone to divergence time step of 0 0001 was chosen for these simulations to prevent the divergence of the solutions it should be noted that in all viv simulations with this time step the local cell convective courant number is less than 0 3 which ensures that the results are independent of the time step 4 2 validation of the numerical method to validate the present numerical model the displacement amplitudes of an elastically mounted cylinder covered with a porous layer in very high d a 10 a n d 50 and very low d a 10 6 darcy numbers at r e 150 are compared with the displacement amplitudes given by the literature for a solid cylinder without the porous layer it is worth mentioning that for the geometry considered here both very low darcy numbers or extremely high darcy numbers resemble the behavior of a solid cylinder that is in the low darcy limit flow barely enters the porous layer and the porous wrapped cylinder behaves like a solid cylinder with a diameter equivalent to its outer diameter d o refer to fig 2 in contrast in the high darcy limit the flow easily enters the porous layer and the porous wrapped cylinder behaves like a solid cylinder with a diameter equivalent to its inner diameter d as shown in fig 2 fig 4 compares the results of displacement amplitude of the cylinder obtained from the present study for different darcy numbers to those available in the literature bao et al 2012 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 zhao 2013 at different values of reduced velocity as seen in fig 4 the results of the present study and those reported by bao et al 2012 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 zhao 2013 are in good agreement fig 5 compares the normalized response frequency f f n of a porous covered cylinder obtained from the present study for darcy numbers of 10 6 and 50 to those obtained by zhao 2013 wang et al 2019 for a bare cylinder i e a solid cylinder without any porous coating in fig 5 one can identify the lock in region as a region wherein the normalized response frequency takes the value equal to 1 as seen in fig 5 the present study predicts the lock in region within the reduced velocity range of 5 u r 7 for both values of darcy number as seen in fig 5 it can be concluded that generally the normalized response frequencies of the current study are in good agreement with those available in the literature 4 3 flow pattern fig 6 shows the vorticity contours around the porous annulus at darcy number of 10 4 reduced velocities of 5 and 6 in four different locations including the crest point i e the maximum displacement zero displacement with a downward movement trough point i e the minimum displacement and zero displacement with an upward movement as can be seen in fig 6 in each reduced velocity the pattern of vortex shedding remains unchanged for all different locations of the cylinder studied here the pattern of vortex shedding for u r 5 is of the form 2s where two single vortices with opposite rotation are shed on two distinct rows during each cycle of vibration however for u r 6 a 2s vortex pattern appears where two single vortices with opposite rotations are shed on a single row for each cycle of vibration fig 7 shows the wake patterns behind the porous covered cylinder at the crest point of displacement for different values of darcy number and reduced velocity the vorticity contours placed in each column are for the same darcy number and those placed in each row have the same value of the reduced velocity at d a 10 4 except for u r 5 vortex shedding pattern follows the classical 2s mode because of the small amplitude oscillation of the cylinder at u r 5 the flow pattern is the 2s mode because of the large amplitude vibration of the cylinder in this study similar wake patterns are also observed at d a 10 6 these flow pattern distributions for various reduced velocities are also observed for the solid cylinder without any porous coating by other researchers bao et al 2012 wang et al 2019 the reason behind these similarities between the flow pattern of a porous covered cylinder and a solid cylinder is that for d a 10 4 flow hardly passes through the porous layer and the porous covered cylinder resembles the flow behavior of a solid cylinder although at these extremely low darcy numbers d a 10 4 the 2s mode is observed only for u r 5 at larger values of darcy number the 2s mode is further extended to the region with higher values of reduced velocity at d a 10 3 and d a 10 2 the 2s mode is observed in the reduced velocity ranges of 5 u r 7 and 5 u r 6 respectively 4 4 velocity and pressure coefficient distributions inside the porous layer in this section the effect of darcy number reduced velocity and the cylinder location at zero i e rest point and maximum displacements i e crest point on the pressure coefficient and velocity distributions in the peripheral direction are presented for the porous layer at radial locations r r i r o 2 and r r o refer to fig 2 the pressure coefficient is calculated as follows 23 c p p p 1 2 ρ f u 2 where ρ f is the fluid density p is the fluid pressure and p is the fluid pressure at the inlet boundary fig 8 shows the pressure coefficient distributions for d a 10 2 and different values of the reduced velocity at the radial locations r r i r o 2 the middle surface of the porous layer and r r o the outer surface of the porous layer the plots in the left column of fig 8 are related to the maximum displacement of the cylinder whereas the right column is corresponding to the zero displacement of the cylinder during the vortex induced vibration the first and second rows in fig 8 are related to radial locations r r i r o 2 and r r o respectively as seen in fig 8 for the same displacement of the cylinder the pressure coefficient distributions related to both radial locations are nearly identical this can be attributed to the high flow penetration into the porous layer which occurs due to the high darcy number of 10 2 in other words when darcy number is high 10 2 the flow passing through the porous layer experiences a low resistant force from the solid matrix which causes a lower pressure drop within the porous layer that is why the pressure coefficient does not change much at the two radial locations it can be seen in fig 8 that the effect of reduced velocity on the pressure coefficient distributions is more pronounced for the rear portion of the cylinder especially when it is at the location of zero displacement y 0 as shown in fig 8 at the front side of the cylinder in both zero displacement and maximum displacement positions a stagnation point is created which leads to the generation of a high pressure zone upstream of the cylinder because of this stagnation point the pressure distribution at the front side does not change by the cylinder position however the pressure distribution behind the cylinder changes by changing the position of the cylinder which can be attributed to the vortex shedding developed behind the cylinder fig 9 presents the pressure coefficient distributions along the peripheral direction at two radial locations within the porous layer namely r r i r o 2 and r r o see fig 2 for u r 5 and u r 6 and d a 10 4 10 2 at the crest point of cylinder displacement in fig 9 the plots on the first and second rows are for r r i r o 2 and r r o whereas the left and right columns are corresponding to u r 5 and u r 6 it is seen in fig 9 that at d a 10 2 the pressure distributions in the peripheral direction related to the two radial locations are nearly identical because of the high portion of flow passing through the porous layer at this darcy number as explained before in fig 8 since at the low darcy number d a 10 4 the flow penetration is small and flow experiences more resistance from the porous medium the pressure distributions for the two radial locations r r i r o 2 and r r o are different from each other moreover as seen in fig 9 the pressure distributions through the front part of the porous layer are not affected by the reduced velocity it is because at all values of reduced velocity in the front portion of the porous layer a stagnation point and therefore a high pressure zone is generated however in the back portion of the porous layer the pressure distributions are mainly affected by the pattern of the vortex shedding which varies at different values of the reduced velocity fig 10 presents the velocity magnitude distributions within the porous layer for the same conditions as described in fig 9 in another word the first column second column first row and second row are corresponded to u r 5 u r 6 r r i r o 2 and r r o respectively as observed at d a 10 4 for all reduced velocities the velocity magnitude at r r i r o 2 is equal to zero which is not the case at r r o this means that at this darcy number d a 10 4 flow can only penetrate to a very small depth near the surface of the porous layer because of the high resistant force porous layer offers to the flow in contrast the non zero velocity magnitude at both radial locations r r i r o 2 and r r o for d a 10 2 is an indication of high flow portion passing through the porous layer at this darcy number because of this in fig 10 similar peripheral distributions of the velocity magnitude is seen at both radial locations r r i r o 2 and r r o as seen in fig 10 the effect of reduced velocity on the distribution of the velocity magnitude seems to be more pronounced for d a 10 3 for two of the radial locations 4 5 time history of the displacement and hydrodynamic coefficients fig 11 shows the time history of the cylinder displacement for d a 10 3 at different values of reduced velocity it is seen that for u r 6 the peak to peak amplitude a p p of the cylinder displacement increases with increasing the reduced velocity until it reacheas a maximum value at u r 6 from fig 11 one can observe that further increase in reduced velocity beyond u r 6 causes a p p to decrease the time history of the cylinder displacement y y m a x y m i n 2 d at d a 10 2 is shown in fig 12 for different values of the reduced velocity it is observed that increasing the value of reduced velocity causes the peak to peak amplitude a p p of the cylinder displacement to increase from a minimum value at u r 3 to a maximum value at u r 6 further increase in reduced velocity beyond u r 6 reduces the peak to peak amplitude the instantaneous lift coefficient is shown in fig 13 for d a 10 2 opposed to what is discussed in fig 11 for the time history of the cylinder displacements the maximum peak to peak amplitude for the time history of lift coefficient occurs at the reduced velocity of 5 as seen in fig 13 furthermore in fig 13 one can observe that the peak to peak amplitude for the case with u r 9 is approximately equal to zero fig 14 displays the instantaneous drag coefficient for d a 10 2 at different values of reduced velocity it is seen that the highest values of average maximum and peak to peak amplitude of the drag coefficient occur at u r 7 it is also seen that for u r 4 the peak to peak amplitude of the drag coefficient is approximately equal to zero fig 14 shows that the stationary cylinder experiences a lower drag coefficient compared with the cylinder that undergoes viv for all values of the reduced velocity examined here except for u r 3 where the drag coefficient of the stationary cylinder slightly exceeds that of the vibrating cylinder around the times it reaches its maximum value the fast fourier transform fft analysis of cylinder displacements the left axis with blue color and lift coefficients the right axis with red color at different values of the reduced velocity is plotted in fig 15 for d a 10 2 except u r 5 5 and u r 6 other reduced velocities have only one peak in their fft spectrum it can be seen that for all reduced velocities the frequencies of the cylinder displacement and those of the lift coefficient are exactly matched with each other and there is no difference between them it should be explained that the frequencies with large amplitudes are the foundations of a time series if the frequencies of the spectrum are sorted in a descending order in terms of their amplitudes then the first frequency with the largest amplitude is called the first dominant frequency or only dominant frequency and 2nd and 3rd frequencies are called the second and third dominant frequencies respectively and so on on the other hand the frequencies with small amplitudes have not significant effect on the instantaneous system response and can be ignored furthermore the amplitude ratio of a frequency a r is defined as the amplitude of this frequency divided by the largest amplitude in the spectrum here the dominant frequencies are defined as the frequencies with an amplitude ratio larger than 0 25 based on the accepted threshold a r 25 it can be seen all reduced velocities except u r 5 5 and u r 6 have only one dominant frequency number of dominant frequencies for reduced velocities of 5 5 and 6 respectively the number of dominant frequencies at u r 6 is very high the values of these dominant frequencies are listed in table 3 the fft spectra of cylinder displacements and the lift coefficients for different values of reduced velocity at d a 10 3 are plotted in fig 16 as can be seen in fig 16 except u r 5 all other reduced velocities have only one peak in their frequency domains that is u r 5 has one major peak and four minor peaks in its spectrum frequency domain analysis of cylinder displacement and lift coefficient at different values of reduced velocity in d a 10 4 are presented in fig 17 at u r 4 and u r 4 5 several peaks appear in the frequency spectrum of the response of the system for other reduced velocities only one peak appears in the frequency spectrum in fig 18 the normalized response frequency of the porous cylinder for different values of darcy number 10 4 10 3 10 2 and 50 is plotted against the reduced velocity this figure reveals that the traditional lock in regime well documented for solid cylinders is observed only at the limiting case of the very high darcy number d a 50 although it is not shown in fig 18 also for a very small value of darcy number d a 10 6 the traditional lock in regime is observed during the traditional lock in regime within some range of reduced velocities the value of the normalized response frequency approaches one and the amplitude of vibration increases significantly in the desynchronization regime the reduced velocities larger than those of the lock in regime the vibration amplitude significantly reduces and approaches zero as observed in fig 18 at the intermediate values of darcy number 10 4 10 3 10 2 the traditional lock in regime is not observed therefore as will be discussed later in fig 21 for these intermediate darcy numbers the sharp decrease in the amplitude of vibration does not happen due to the absence of the lock in phenomenon also from fig 18 it can be seen that in each value of the reduced velocity the normalized response frequency has its highest value at d a 50 limiting case of the bare cylinder it is because the normalized response frequency is proportional to the square of the characteristic diameter of porous annulus d c h as follow 24 f f n f μ r e ρ u r d c h 2 in this study the inner diameter d of the porous annulus is chosen as the characteristic diameter except for high values of darcy number d a 50 the actual and effective diameter of the porous cylinder is larger than d and for very low values of darcy number it is equal to 1 2 e p d therefore the calculated normalized response frequencies for d a 50 are lower than those of actual values 4 6 the average values of the hydrodynamic coefficients and the cylinder displacement amplitude fig 19 shows the variation of c d versus reduced velocity for different values of the darcy number as well as the case of the stationary solid cylinder wrapped with a porous layer u r 0 as seen in fig 19 for all values of darcy number studied here a jump in c d occurs at some reduced velocity form fig 19 it can be observed that for darcy numbers of 10 2 10 3 and 10 4 this jump in c d starts at u r 3 4 and 5 respectively it is observed that the jump in the c d is higher for the lower values of the darcy number fig 19 also shows that over the entire range of the reduced velocity the drag coefficient related to the case with d a 10 2 is smaller than those of d a 10 3 and d a 10 4 as seen in fig 19 this is not the case when the drag coefficient of d a 10 3 and d a 10 4 are compared to each other that is c d for d a 10 3 surpasses that of d a 10 4 only within the ranges of reduced velocity 0 u r 4 and 6 u r 15 for d a 10 3 and d a 10 4 the maximums of c d occur at u r 5 5 and u r 7 respectively as seen for d a 10 3 and d a 10 4 the maximums of c d occur at u r 5 5 and u r 7 respectively one can observe that the case with d a 10 2 has two maximums of c d which occur at u r 4 5 and u r 7 fig 20 shows the variation of root mean square values of the lift coefficient c l r m s versus reduced velocity for different values of the darcy number as well as the case of the stationary solid cylinder wrapped with a porous layer as seen from fig 20 for all reduced velocities when darcy number increases c l r m s also increases for all values of darcy numbers c l r m s increases sharply at u r 3 and reaches its maximum value at u r 5 after u r 5 it reduces by further increase in u r fig 21 shows the variation of the dimensionless amplitude of displacement y y m a x y m i n 2 d versus reduced velocity for different values of darcy number as seen in fig 21 increasing darcy number causes a reduction in cylinder displacement amplitude it is seen in fig 21 that for each darcy number when the reduced velocity is increased from u r 3 the displacement amplitude first increases and reaches a maximum value at some critical value of the reduced velocity after that it reduces when the reduced velocity is further increased beyond this critical value the value of reduced velocity related to the maximum displacement of the cylinder increases by increasing the darcy number for darcy numbers of d a 10 4 10 3 and 10 2 the maximum amplitude of displacement occurs at the reduced velocity of u r 4 5 5 and 6 respectively in the case of very high darcy number of 50 which resembles the behavior of a bare solid cylinder with diameter d see fig 2 the displacement amplitude is reduced suddenly at a reduced velocity where the lock in regime is terminated as discussed in figs 4 and 21 and approaches zero at higher values of reduced velocity since for intermediate values of darcy number d a 10 4 10 3 and 10 2 the lock in regime is eliminated the displacement amplitude corresponding to those darcy numbers decreases slowly and reaches a constant value at high values of the reduced velocity 4 7 effects of the thickness of the porous layer on the average drag and lift coefficients and cylinder displacement at da 10 4 in this section the effects of porous layer dimensionless thickness e p on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the cylinder are investigated fig 22 presents the variation of c d versus reduced velocity for four different values of dimensionless thickness e p 0 0 25 0 5 and 1 according to fig 22 as the thickness of the porous layer increases c d experienced by the cylinder also increases fig 23 shows the variation of c l r m s versus reduced velocity for four different values of dimensionless thickness e p 0 0 25 0 5 and 1 as seen in fig 23 c l r m s increases when the thickness of the porous layer is increased fig 24 shows the variation of the amplitude of the displacement versus reduced velocity for three different values of dimensionless thickness e p 0 0 25 0 5 and 1 as seen in fig 24 the displacement amplitude of the cylinder increases when the thickness of the porous layer is increased 5 conclusion in this study the one degree of freedom 1dof vortex induced vibration viv of a circular cylinder covered by an annular porous layer is numerically investigated for r e 150 ζ 0 01 and m r 2 a wide range of darcy numbers 10 6 d a 50 and reduced velocity 3 u r 9 with three different values of dimensionless thickness of the porous layer 0 0 25 0 5 1 were considered the effects of reduced velocity darcy number and the dimensionless porous layer on the vortex shedding pattern displacement amplitude displacement frequency and the lift and drag coefficients are investigated it is concluded that at most reduced velocity values by increasing darcy number drag and lift coefficients and cylinder displacement amplitude decrease it is also seen that by increasing reduced velocity from u r 3 to u r 9 drag and lift coefficients as well as the cylinder displacement amplitudes increase to a maximum value and then decrease by a further increase in the reduced velocity it is also concluded by increasing the porous layer thickness the drag and lift coefficients as well as the cylinder displacement amplitude increase at d a 10 4 and u r 5 the flow pattern is the 2s mode and in other reduced velocities of this darcy number the vortex shedding pattern follows the classical 2s mode therefore d a 10 4 resembles the wake structures of the bare cylinder also at larger values of darcy number the 2s mode is extended to the region of higher values of reduced velocity at d a 10 3 and d a 10 2 the 2s mode is observed in the reduced velocity ranges of 5 u 7 and 5 u 6 respectively furthermore it can be concluded that except for the limiting cases of very high and very small values of darcy number 10 6 or 50 the traditional lock in regime is eliminated from the response frequency of the system therefore for intermediate darcy numbers d a 10 4 10 3 and 10 2 the displacement amplitude decreases slowly and reaches a constant value at high reduced velocities due to the absence of the lock in phenomenon credit authorship contribution statement elham ebrahimi

20349,the variety of shapes and sizes among daggerboards and rudders of small racing yachts indicates the lack of a comparative design method and that some aspects may be neglected in the designs currently proposed in particular a literature survey showed that i the conventional design approaches are exclusively based on upwind conditions disregarding any downwind contribution to the race ii the detrimental effects related to the typically low reynolds numbers involved are marginally considered and iii there are ambiguous indications about sweep angle effects on foil performance in this paper a design method based on a velocity prediction program compares different appendage planforms for a yacht identifying the ones minimizing the overall racing time sum of upwind and downwind contributions the method is applied to a 4 6 m skiff and the performance of the daggerboards analysed are compared with xflr5 simulations validated against experimental tests the results quantify the time gains of longer foils and the similar performance of elliptic and rectangular geometries with equal drafts but different aspect ratios swept foils are investigated as well showing lower lift

the design of the appendages daggerboard and rudder of small racing yachts providing indications to identify i the foil surfaces in m2 and ii the planform shapes and drafts which achieve good performance during a regatta with upwind and downwind legs in spite of the current interest for flying sailboats i e boats with underwater lifting appendages that sail with the hull above the water it seems reasonable that the vast majority of future recreational racing yachts will remain of the conventional type with this regard small racing sailboats as dinghies and skiffs i e recreational crafts whose length overall is typically around 4 6 m and with a crew of two three persons are addressed in this paper in particular concerning the design of their appendages historically these boats sail and race since several decades see e g chapelle 1951 however the design of their appendages has always been a rather vexed topic and it is a typical subject of discussion among yacht designers or in the nautical clubs as a matter of fact it is common finding dinghies with similar dimensions and sail surfaces but with different daggerboards and rudders the natural question arises which foil shape will be the fastest during a race the technical literature on nautical design does not provide a clear reply nor all the indications as well summarized by trower 1992 p 105 the wide range of planforms used for keels also supports the argument that no one has all the answers the authors of this paper experienced the lack of a unified comparative design method for foils in several ways during more than 10 years of participation to the 1001vela cup competition http www 1001velacup eu a race between skiff prototypes designed manufactured and sailed by university students the first macro indication came from observing the different competitors although constrained by the same design rules the boats are generally presenting different appendages a further confirmation came from a bench marking reported in appendix a performed on 20 commercial dinghies and skiffs with similar dimensions to the ones of the 1001vela some data from this analysis are shown in fig 1 which presents the daggerboard or centreboard keel according to the case and rudder surfaces of each boat against the corresponding sail plane area a first look at the graph of fig 1 indicates an increasing trend of the foil surfaces against the sail areas but with a significant scatter among the different data in spite of the crudeness of this survey further analyses should evaluate whether such differences can be explained in terms of different design choices at the same time several planform shapes can be observed among the foils of these boats fig 14 in appendix a elliptic tapered rectangular geometries as well as different sweep angles have been adopted during the years by different designers seeking for a unified design methods for the appendages a research was performed in the technical literature on yacht design larsson and eliasson 2007 chapelle 1951 trower 1992 crepaz 1986 fossati 2007 vacanti 2005 garrett 1996 marchaj 1987 acerbi et al 2017 in first instance it was concluded that most of these methods base the appendage design solely on the upwind conditions where foils act similarly to the wings of an airplane to compensate the side force on the sails neglecting or giving little consideration to the downwind navigation however the downwind leg still represents around half of the race during which the side force compensation is not needed anymore and the daggerboard shall produce as less drag as possible to avoid slowing down the craft therefore in principle it seems reasonable that the optimum daggerboard design shall represent a trade off between both the upwind and downwind conditions of the race in second instance in spite of the rather unanimous awareness in the literature e g trower 1992 crepaz 1986 fossati 2007 vacanti 2005 acerbi et al 2017 about the detrimental effects related to typically low to moderate reynolds numbers i e r e 3 1 0 6 on foil performance no indications are provided on how systematically accounting for these detriments directly in the preliminary sizing of the foils this latter aspect is especially relevant for skiffs and dinghies because of the relatively small chord lengths of their appendages at last some disagreement was found in the literature about the performance gain loss of swept foils with respect to straight ones from a broader point of view in spite of the different successful foil designs proposed in the technical literature a unified approach which compares the basic design choices in terms of the fundamental principles of the fluid dynamic of sailing to minimize the racing time is not available indeed it is rather common performing a preliminary design i e deciding the foil surface or draft from benchmarkings on similar crafts see the successful design acerbi et al 2017 for instance on the other hand refined numerical tools exist in support of the foil design exercise e g cella et al 2018 cirello and mancuso 2008 but their use is generally limited to the highest levels of sail competition like the america s cup regatta according to the authors experience in fact the small teams normally involved in designing a new yacht a commercial or a prototype one and of her appendages seldom have the resources for including numerical optimization campaigns during the design phase especially in case of small sailboats being the fees proportioned to the boat dimensions it thus follows the need for a quick simple but still effective design method to identify the basic shape and size of the daggerboards and rudders of small racing yachts with this regard the method developed by the authors is presented in this paper for a given craft it is based on the performance evaluation of different daggerboard rudder combinations by a velocity prediction program fossati 2007 molland et al 2017 during the upwind and the downwind legs of the regatta assuming a windward leeward race in the vpp a method developed by jacobs and sherman 1937 is integrated to estimate the polars of the foil sections at different re thus systematically accounting for the detriments on the foil performance the results of the method are summarized into plots which identify the daggerboard and rudder geometries providing the best upwind downwind trade off during the regatta i e the minimum overall racing time for the expected wind and sea conditions since the results are based on the estimation of the foil performances the prediction capability of the computations is compared with simulations performed on the same geometries with the xflr5 code deperrois 2009 in turn the xflr5 analyses have been compared with experimental data on two wings at r e 2 1 0 6 to assess the accuracy of the code at low to moderate reynolds this numerical tool is used here in order to suggest a relatively easy and accessible verification for anyone who is facing the task of appendage design for skiffs and dinghies the article is organized as follows in section 2 the entire architecture of the method is reported in a descriptive way leaving its mathematical development the equations and a numerical example in appendix b for sake of readability in section 3 the procedure is applied to the case study of a 4 6 m skiff and the results in terms of daggerboard performance are compared with the analogous parameters obtained from xflr5 analyses in section 4 indications on peculiar aspects of rudder design as well as for structural and stability verifications are provided finally in section 5 further considerations concerning the selection of the foil section and the sweep angle are reported together with a discussion about the limits of the work the paper is primarily intended for designers of small yachts the knowledge of the fluid dynamics of sailing and of the related design analysis tools are considered prerequisites it shall be remarked that several successful and refined foil designs exist nowadays and the approach presented here does not have the ambition of providing optimized geometries the objective is rather providing a solid procedure to compare the basic design parameters which define the appendage planforms of small racing yachts accounting for aspects generally neglected as the contribution of the downwind part of the race and the effects related to the reynolds number 2 method the method used to identify the optimum planforms and sizes of the daggerboard rudder combination is described here in a step by step procedure the method is a vpp for the boat with the different appendage combinations that is based on computing the balance between forces the side force on the sails against the lift of the daggerboard and the propulsive force against the drag of the system some preliminary tasks requiring familiarity with the fields of sailing fluid dynamics and nautical design are needed to correctly implement the vpp algorithm in particular the availability of the bare hull characteristics and of the sail polars as well as the awareness of the expected wind and sea conditions at the race field are necessary prerequisites the method ultimately provides an estimation of the overall time t t o t sum of the times during the upwind and downwind legs and this parameter is used to rank the different appendage combinations the quickest is the best berman 2018 likely makes use of a similar approach to compare the performance of keels against daggerboards for a sailing catamaran the hypotheses on which the method is based are those typical of appendage design for small racing boats see for instance trower 1992 crepaz 1986 acerbi et al 2017 and are here summarized the boat is assumed to be in a perfectly flat position i e no heeling the daggerboard lift counteracts entirely the side force on the sails i e there is no contribution from the rudder which is instead designed primarily for steering the boat the hull represents a symmetry plane for the daggerboard the mirroring image concept see e g larsson and eliasson 2007 crepaz 1986 marchaj 1987 whose effective aspect ratio a r d b is thus twice the geometric one d 2 s d b with d and s d b being respectively the draft and surface of the daggerboard the rudder is placed on the boat stern transom hung right over the length overall of the craft the wave drag or residual drag of the appendages are neglected the effect of the leeway angle γ on the resistance of the bare hull d b h is assumed to be negligible thus d b h is only function of the boat speed b s when the rudder is not steering the boat it is positioned at an angle of attack around the zero lift position thus its drag is exclusively the viscous one the approaches are thus different for the daggerboard and the rudder daggerboard it is designed to compensate the entire side force from the sails and its performance are evaluated according to the conventional fluid dynamics equations of wings geometries corresponding to different i drafts d i e wing semispans ii aspect ratio a r d b and iii planform shapes e g elliptic against rectangular are compared for a given draft and planform shape the aspect ratio is systematically varied modifying the ratio k c r d between the root chord length and the daggerboard draft as shown in fig 2 for a given planform shape this allows to express the main foil geometrical features surface size aspect ratio as function of the draft d rudder it needs to respond to two conflicting requirements low drag during navigation on one hand and the capability of delaying as much as possible the stall on the other with this latter being somehow the preeminent one trower 1992 fossati 2007 vacanti 2005 the rudder is sized according to an empirical rule as a proportion of the lateral underwater plane see trower 1992 targeting primarily the capability of steering the boat this approach is described in detail in section 4 1 apart from the diverse operations the different approaches are needed because on dinghies the rudder is placed in line behind the daggerboard thus facing the complex flow characterized by the wake and the downwash of the first foil similar distinctions are adopted by other authors as well see for instance trower 1992 acerbi et al 2017 2 1 vpp architecture the architecture of the vpp is presented here in a sequential form and with the support of the flow chart in fig 3 for sake of readability the structure is presented as much as possible in a descriptive way reporting the entire mathematical development the equations and a numerical example in appendix b the performance estimation is based on an iterative computation which assumes a boat speed b s of first guess for the combination of appendages under analysis the unbalance between the propulsive force f p and the total drag d t o t including hull daggerboard and rudder is then used to correct b s when the computation converges it is possible to compute the projection of the boat speed on the wind direction i e the velocity made good vmg and thus the resulting time t u w or t d w for the upwind or downwind cases respectively to cover the distance between the two buoys when the computation has been applied to both the upwind and downwind legs it is finally possible to compute the overall time t t o t t u w t d w referring to fig 3 each block of the computation is presented in the following list see the corresponding numbers taking familiarity with the flow chart of fig 3 and with the nomenclature is recommended before proceeding further 1 several inputs are needed to start the race environmental conditions in terms of expected true wind speed tws leg length l r e g i e the distance between the upwind and downwind buoys expected wave period t 1 and significant wave height h 1 3 the hull characteristics the length overall and length at waterline l o a and l w l the bare hull resistance curve d b h f 1 b s as obtained by software simulation e g maxsurf or by towing tank tests the hydrostatic wet surface s b h and the volume displacement of the hull c the upwind and downwind sail dimensions s s u w and s s d w respectively which are needed to compute the propulsive and side forces the polar characteristics of the sails both upwind and downwind to provide the force coefficients which will be used to compute the propulsive and side forces f p and f s respectively according to the boat heading the polar characteristics of the 2d foil section at several reynolds numbers to account for the performance variations with re with this regard experimental databases for symmetric aerofoils can be obtained from the reports jacobs and sherman 1937 loftin jr and smith 1949 ferris et al 1987 or could be built with the open source xfoil software drela 1989 this input requires the selection of specific foil sections for the daggerboard and the rudder indications in this respect are specifically addressed in section 5 1 2 in step 2 the design parameters for the daggerboard shall be given as input as well and then modified in successive computations to assess different geometries these parameters are the daggerboard draft or semi span in the wing daggerboard analogy d selected the range of k ratios to assess during the computation and the generic planform shape e g 1 4 of ellipse or rectangular all the geometrical parameters of the daggerboard surface s d b aspect ratio a r d b and chord length distribution are so defined exclusively in terms of k and d for a given planform see table 7 in appendix b for the mathematical formulas each computation is performed on a single value of k i and once converged it is then repeated with the k i 1 one when the computations on the entire k range are completed the results are recorded and the procedure applied again for different daggerboard drafts d and planforms for comparison 3 once the boat speed b s is imposed at the beginning of the iteration d b h is computed from the resistance curve of the bare hull which can be approximated by an interpolating polynomial for instance 4 a leeway angle γ of first guess is assumed typically γ 1 0 5 the velocity triangles on the sails fig 15 in appendix b are resolved with the b s and γ resulting from the previous iteration finally providing the apparent wind speed a w s and true wind angle twa 6 the propulsive and side forces f p and f s are computed projecting the actions on the sails on the direction of the motion b s and its perpendicular according to the heading under analysis upwind or downwind sail dimensions and related force coefficients are used 7 the daggerboard geometrical parameters are computed s d b a r d b and the mean chord c m from the inputs provided at step nr 2 as previously reported the effective aspect ratio for the performance computation of the daggerboard is doubled according to the mirroring plane concept induced by the hull larsson and eliasson 2007 crepaz 1986 marchaj 1987 8 the daggerboard reynolds number is computed referring to the mean chord length c m since c m c r k d for a given d the reynolds number r e d b is approximately proportional to the k i of that particular iteration thus r e d b increases linearly with k see fig 2 conversely at equal k r e increases with d 9 for the daggerboard the lift curve slope pertaining to the selected foil section is identified according to the reynolds number a 2 d f 2 r e d b with f 2 being an interpolation function fitting the data as shown in fig 4 a for the 0012 and 64012 naca sections loftin jr and smith 1949 the a 2 d parameter features important variations for r e 3 1 0 6 which is the range of interest for most of the appendages trower 1992 vacanti 2005 this behaviour is due to the thickening of the boundary layer on the suction side of the foil section with decreasing r e a well known phenomenon in several technical disciplines as turbomachinery design see e g p 71 wallis 1961 10 the lift curve slope of the entire three dimensional daggerboard a d b is computed according to the well known equations coming from the aerodynamics of wings see appendix b these equations cf anderson 1936 glauert 1983 anderson 2007 kuchemann 1978 allow to account for the different planforms elliptic tapered rectangular as well as for the sweep angle λ 11 the daggerboard lift coefficient c l d b required to balance the side force f s on the sails is computed as 1 c l d b f s 0 5 ρ w b s 2 s d b where ρ w is the mass density of water by knowing c l d b and the lift curve slope a d b just computed the daggerboard angle of attack α which will ultimately be equal to the leeway angle can be calculated as well 12 with the lift coefficient obtained at the previous step the unviscid drag coefficient c d i related to the induced velocity and thus to the lift is computed 13 unless the foil section polars at different r e are directly integrated within the computation as for instance in the xfoil based method presented in carolus and starzmann 2011 for fan blade design the viscous drag coefficient c d can be computed at the corresponding incidence angle according to the generalized section polar proposed by jacobs and sherman 1937 which allows estimating the polar of the generic 2d section at different reynolds numbers this approach described in appendix b requires the trends with reynolds of i the minimum drag coefficient c d m i n and ii the maximum lift coefficient c l m a x of the selected foil section see figs 4 b and 4 c for the naca 0012 and 64012 14 the overall daggerboard drag is computed as sum of the viscous and non viscous contributions 2 c d d b c d c d i 3 d d b 1 2 ρ w c d d b b s 2 s d b 15 as anticipated the rudder is sized according to a rule of thumb suggested by trower for dinghies trower 1992 p 113 its surface s r is assumed to be equal to the 15 of the underwater lateral plane i e the lateral projection of the underwater surface s b h l a t s d b s r giving 4 s r 0 176 s b h l a t s d b the reasons for using the empirical relation 4 are mainly two first we experienced that the rudder surfaces obtained from eq 4 allow an acceptable compromise between the navigation conditions and the need for effective manoeuvring capabilities at low boat speeds e g approaching an harbour or at the start line of the regatta on the contrary more complex approaches resulted into undersized rudders with poor effectiveness at low b s in second instance the fact that during navigation the rudder is immersed into the wake and downwash of the daggerboard see keuning et al 2006 for conventional yachts calls into question the accuracy of an analytic approach as the one used for the daggerboard also for the rudder with this respect reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations performed in torriani 2012 on six daggerboard rudder combinations for a skiff sailing at a given leeway angle showed a decrease of lift for the rudder around δ l r 31 34 with respect to the same geometry in isolated conditions and a lower decrease of drag δ d r 3 11 this aspect is recalled in section 4 1 the positioning of the daggerboard with respect to the rudder and the centre of force on the sails trower 1992 fossati 2007 does not affect the performance estimation nonetheless the boat centering has to be verified see section 4 to achieve the sailing balance before finalizing the foil design 16 since the rudder is sized for manoeuvring and not to contribute in resisting leeway at this step the sailing balance i e the equilibrium between turning moments along the yaw axis of the boat is assumed to be achieved this involves that the drag of the rudder during navigation unless if used to correct the trajectory is only the viscous one around the zero lift operation 5 d r 1 2 ρ w c d m i n b s 2 s r where c d m i n is function of the reynolds number and of the foil section selected for the rudder according to the data reported in torriani 2012 the decrease of rudder drag caused by the daggerboard wake and downwash is δ d r 11 this makes the computation of d r with eq 5 an acceptable approximation even for rudders positioned in line behind the daggerboard 17 only during the upwind navigation an additional drag is caused by the boat interaction with the waves naturally existing on the race field this is called added resistance in waves d a w and it is modelled in appendix b in terms of the boat characteristics and of the waving system see larsson and eliasson 2007 keuning and sonnenberg 1998 18 at the given b s the entire drag of the hull with the appendages d t o t f b s is then computed as 6 d t o t d b h d d b d r d a w where d a w is included only for the upwind leg 19 finally the initially guessed boat speed value b s is verified comparing the propulsive force on the sails f p with the total drag d t o t in particular b s is increased if d t o t f p or decreased if d t o t f p until converging to a value such that d t o t f p at each new iteration the leeway angle previously computed returns to step 4 updating so the computation of the velocity triangles 20 when the iterations are converged the daggerboard angle of attack α actually is the leeway angle of the boat γ 21 the velocity made good vmg is computed as 7 v m g b s c o s t w a 22 the times t u w and t d w are finally calculated for the upwind and downwind legs respectively dividing the distance between bouys l r e g for the vmg 8 t l r e g v m g and the overall time is given as sum of the two 9 t t o t t u w t d w this latter parameter is then used to identify the best appendage combination the lower the time t t o t the quicker will be the boat during the race it shall be remarked that the t values so computed are ranking parameters and do not represent real racing times since they cannot account for i the time needed for tacking and gybing and ii the slowing action induced by the rudder activation for instance to correct the route during upwind navigation or to bring back the boat to a flat attitude in downwind conditions for a given daggerboard planform shape and draft d the computation is performed on several k ratios until when the plot t k shows a minimum see step 22 of fig 3 that minimum identifies the optimum k i e the best aspect ratio a r d b for that particular draft and planform after that the procedure is repeated for different d and for different planforms the data are then recorded and plotted together in the same t k plot for comparison the daggerboard geometry which shows the minimum t t o t is the best if feasible in structural stability and control terms see section 3 and in turn identifies the size of the rudder as well 3 results and verifications the procedure is applied here to the case study of a 4 6 m skiff whose characteristics are reported in table 1 with the environmental conditions considered and the polynomial functions used for the vpp whereas the five daggerboard geometries analysed are summarized in table 2 among the usual planform shapes elliptic rectangular and tapered the analysis has been applied solely to the first two and only to straight geometries i e with zero sweep angle in fact tapered wings with optimum taper ratio λ 0 5 perform similarly to the elliptic ones this was indeed observed with xflr5 analyses and it was also shown by the towing tank tests conducted at delft larsson and eliasson 2007 fossati 2007 on the other hand foils with larger taper ratios will perform intermediately between elliptic and rectangular ones whereas geometries featuring low λ values i e triangular or quasi triangular wings provide poor performances anderson 1936 marchaj 1987 and were not taken into consideration a dedicated paragraph is addressed to the sweep angle and related foil performance in section 5 the results in terms of upwind downwind and total times t u w t d w and t t o t are presented in fig 5 and analysed in section 3 1 the comparison between the daggerboard performances resulting from the method and those obtained from xflr5 are then presented in section 3 2 with the validation against experimental data 3 1 results the outputs of the computations are presented in fig 5 for the upwind downwind and total times respectively the following observations can be reported upwind independently of the planform and draft d a minimum on the upwind leg timing is identified as corresponding to a particular c r d ratio fig 5 a this minimum is slightly appreciable for the curves pertaining to the lowest semispan d 0 9 m though becoming more evident for the geometries at higher d in upwind conditions when the daggerboard works similarly to an airplane wing the geometry corresponding to this minimum represents the best compromise between profile and friction losses for a given d the geometries with higher c r d ratio right side of the curves produce an excessive resistance because of the higher surface s d b on the opposite side left part of the curves foils with lower c r d and thus less surface produce less friction drag but they must operate at higher angles of attack i e higher leeway to achieve the required lift increasing both the viscous and inviscid resistances related to the higher lift coefficients involved upwind at equal daggerboard draft d the elliptic geometries feature lower minimums than the rectangular ones although the differences are narrow in terms of t u w 1 5 s at d 0 9 m and just 0 3 s at d 1 3 m on the other hand the right hand sides of the curves for the rectangular foils are steeper than the elliptic ones this is easily explained in terms of the higher surface and thus higher friction of a rectangular daggerboard compared to an elliptic one of equal draft and k ratio this aspect makes the identification of the optimum c r d ratio more critical for rectangular foils than for elliptic ones overall referring at fig 5 a increasing the draft d reduces the minimum t u w and the optimum c r d ratio shifts towards lower values looking at the elliptic geometries t u w o p t is reduced of 23 s 2 5 passing from d 0 9 m k 0 5 to 1 3 m k 0 25 on the other hand the corresponding timing increase during the downwind leg fig 5 b due to the longer daggerboard at k 0 25 with respect to the shorter one at k 0 5 is just 1 5 s for a final total gain of 21 5 s although such gain might appear small benefits of this entity see also vacanti 2005 and p 91 larsson and eliasson 2007 would make a race chanceless for a boat using the shorter daggerboard yacht designers are aware that longer keels provide better boat performance e g vacanti 2005 however these computations also allow an indirect explanation of the general rule of handicap estimation for races involving yachts of different classes which statistically quantifies the advantage of boats with longer appendages wolstenholme 2009 downwind as expected no minimum is observed in the curves pertaining to the downwind leg fig 5 b this is reasonable since there is no need for compensating leeway when sailing leeward in fact a higher γ angle increases the v m g see fig 15 in appendix b as a matter of fact the daggerboard is generally lifted up when sailing downwind on single helmed crafts as the laser radial for instance this same action is not performed on skiffs because i it would create an obstacle for the crew ii to damp excessive roll movements during the navigation accordingly on dinghies and skiffs with helmsman and crew the daggerboard remains in position also during the downwind leg overall when the upwind and downwind times are summed together the minimum is identified at lower values with respect to the windward curves compare figs 5 a and b for instance for the elliptic geometries the minimum shifts from k 0 5 to 0 4 with d 0 9 m and from 0 25 to 0 2 with d 1 3 m and in analogous manner for the rectangular ones this is due to the downwind contribution which favours smaller daggerboards to reduce the drag during the leeward navigation in spite of this effect the lower impact of the downwind leg on the overall time with respect to the upwind one compare fig 5 a and b provides an explanation of the common custom of referring the design of the appendages exclusively to the windward conditions overall regarding the planform shape by comparing the upwind and most importantly the overall performance fig 5 a and c of rectangular and elliptic geometries it can be observed that the minimum timing values are approximately equals for foils with the same draft however for rectangular daggerboards the k o p t occurs at lower values with respect to the elliptic ones and the curves are steeper at higher c r d both are direct consequences of simple geometry indeed the surface of a rectangular foil is 27 higher with respect to an elliptic geometry with the same semi span d crepaz 1986 p 205 thus providing the same lifting capability at a lower c l with the lower losses related but also with higher friction drag the effect of this increase in the friction drag is well visible in the plot referring to the downwind leg fig 5 b where the rectangular geometries evidently require higher racing times with respect to the elliptic ones with equal d it can also be observed that the longer the daggerboard draft the narrower becomes the range around the optimum k ratio in particular for the rectangular foil whereas the elliptic one shows less steep gradients as anticipated this translates into an important advantage when selecting an elliptical planform since it makes the identification of the k o p t less critical with respect to rectangular ones although trower 1992 reports that elliptic planforms are numerous among dinghies some designers seems to be favouring different fashions see fig 14 in appendix overall the relative advantage of longer geometries with respect to shorter ones reduces with the increase of d compare the differences between the elliptic curves at d 0 9 1 1 and 1 3 in figs 5 a and c this suggests that an excessive elongation of the daggerboard would end into producing negligible gains although it is likely that other aspects structural stability or maximum depth allowed will play a major role in limiting the maximum draft it seems fair mentioning that d was chosen as independent variable because the maximum draft is a typical constraint in daggerboard design both to limit the maximum depth to avoid hitting the ground when approaching the beach harbour and for structural reasons indeed the daggerboard behaves like a cantilevered beam and too long geometries might experience excessive stresses in case of capsizing when the crew jumps on it to bring up back the boat in vertical position this argument is further developed in section 4 in support of the reader who is willing to re construct the vpp algorithm using the equations reported in appendix b the numerical results pertaining to the rectangular daggerboard d 1 3 m and k 0 4 derived from the first second and final computations are reported in table 9 the method can certainly be used considering different environmental conditions with this regard it was applied to the same 4 6 skiff but with tws 4 and 6 m s respectively and different wave systems the results are reported in fig 17 in appendix b for d 1 3 m rectangular and elliptic foils showing analogous trends with respect to those of fig 5 however it is here remarked that being aware of the relation between wind and sea conditions i e the wave system created by a certain wind speed is fundamental to obtain representative indications for the targeted race field at last although applied here to a windward leeward race the method could be also applied to different routes if a different regatta scheme is involved in that case the computation will include additional legs abeam for instance and the identification of the optimum geometry will take into account the related times as well 3 2 comparison with xflr5 for the upwind data as first verification it was deemed important verifying the vpp polar prediction capability for the foils at different reynolds accordingly the daggerboard upwind results pertaining to different k ratios have been compared with data obtained from xflr5 analyses on analogous geometries the comparison has been performed on upwind cases only being the downwind ones more trivial due to the higher boat speeds i e higher re and the lower angles of attack involved at first the polar prediction capability of xflr5 has been preventively verified against experimental data this was retained necessary because of the relatively low reynolds numbers typical of small yachts appendages 3 2 1 xflr5 validation xflr5 is an open source program for the design and analysis of sailplane models based on the well known xfoil software drela 1989 this is a panel code that integrates a solver of the euler equations for the inviscid flow with a two equations integral boundary layer formulation and a transition model drela and giles 1987 a detailed description of both xfoil and xflr5 can be found in the related literature deperrois 2009 drela 1989 drela and giles 1987 it was deemed important assessing the polar prediction capability of xflr5 at low re and the possible tuning of some simulation parameters however experimental data of wings within the range 5 1 0 5 r e 3 1 0 6 are not numerous in the available literature with this regard we referred to the tests presented in the naca report tinling and kolk 1951 on two backswept geometries the characteristics of which are reported in table 3 together with the setting up parameters of the xflr5 analyses in fig 6 the results of the xflr5 analyses solid lines are compared with the experimental data dotted lines with markers in terms of c l α c d c l and c l c d α in general a better agreement between simulations and experimental data is observable for the wing with ar 5 with respect to the ar 10 one moreover a satisfactory match is visible for both geometries at low angles of attack 2 but with an increasing divergence at higher angles in particular it can be observed see fig 6 a that the slope of the experimental lift coefficient curves decreases with increasing values of the angle of attack diverging from the linear behaviour shown by the numerical analyses this behaviour is more evident for the wing with ar 10 with respect to the ar 5 one and is ascribable primarily to the stall of the outer portions of the wings typical of geometries with relevant sweep back angles and to a minor extent to small distortions of the wing models because of torsion and bending during the tests both phenomena are typical of highly sweptback wings tinling and kolk 1951 and they cannot be predicted by the xflr5 code nonetheless this is of little importance within the scope of this work as racing daggerboards normally neither feature such large sweep back angles nor they are usually designed to work at angles of attack leeway 6 focusing on the comparison at lift coefficients c l 0 4 a good matching is observable between numerical and experimental data in terms of c l c d curves thus indicating a good prediction also of the viscous drag on the other hand a certain disagreement is observable at the edge of the laminar bucket c l 0 23 where xflr5 overestimates the c d of the wing with ar 10 35 while it slightly underestimates 13 the same parameter for the wing with ar 5 this is the reason of the marked difference between the peak values of the c l c d curves fig 6 c for the wing with ar 10 while those with ar 5 show an acceptable agreement in general this is still considered a fair agreement between experiments and xflr5 simulations however to avoid the uncertainty related to laminar foils operating at the edges of the low drag buckets it was decided to use a conventional naca 0012 section within this work analyses on the two wings were repeated also at r e 4 1 0 6 providing similar comparisons whereas simulations with lower n c r i t 9 showed worse matching between the experimental and numerical data accordingly the prediction capability of the xflr5 code is considered validated within the objectives of this work 3 2 2 comparison between the computation results and xflr5 data on the same geometries elliptic and rectangular foils with drafts equal to 0 9 m and 1 3 m featuring analogous k ratios of those in the computations have been reconstructed into xflr5 the analyses were performed imposing the same boat speed and lift resulting from the computations thus at equal lift coefficients and reynolds numbers see table 4 by doing so the data are compared in terms of angles of attack leeway angles and drag coefficients the results are plotted in fig 7 for different k ratios around the optimum one with the numerical data pertaining to this latter reported in table 4 the computed trends are well in agreement with the results of the simulations though showing some differences in terms of values in particular the vpp results overestimate the leeway angles with respect to xflr5 and this translates also into higher drag coefficients c d focusing on figs 7 a and b it can be observed that both the elliptic and rectangular geometries show the largest difference δ γ at the lowest k ratio but with a constant reduction with increasing k values furthermore the differences are higher for the foils with d 0 9 m than the 1 3 m ones being the aspect ratios equals for the longer and shorter daggerboards in fact a r is approximately the reciprocal of k see appendix b this behaviour of δ γ cannot be explained but in terms of r e as previously mentioned indeed the reynolds number is proportional both to k and d ranging from 3 5 1 0 5 at the lower k up to 1 4 1 0 6 for k 0 5 for the d 0 9 m foils therefore the differences δ γ between computation and simulations can be explained by the approximation introduced by the polynomial table 1 used to fit the experimental data describing the trend a 2 d f 2 r e for the 0012 section visible in fig 4 a it shall also be remarked that the foil section data on which the polynomial of table 1 was built are limited to a minimum r e 7 0 1 0 5 see fig 4 thus the performances below this value are extrapolated and cannot be considered reliable on the other hand neither xflr5 has been validated at such low reynolds numbers therefore a certain degree of uncertainty relies at those regimes in spite of this at higher reynolds the agreement between the results of the computations and simulations considerably improves with differences δ γ 14 and δ c d 11 see table 4 around the optimum k ratios as the differences between the computations and the results from xflr5 are higher at lower k ratios the vpp is expected to excessively penalize the geometries with low c r d thus with higher aspect ratios especially if the reynolds number falls below 7 1 0 5 as a consequence in that case the actual k o p t might result slightly displaced towards the right side of the curves nonetheless the comparison reported in fig 8 in terms of t u w computed using xflr5 and the performance parameters from the vpp for the rectangular foil with d 1 3 m and k ratios around the optimum one shows that the trends are fairly in agreement with a maximum difference of 9 2 s 1 at k 0 15 differences of this magnitude are acceptable within an engineering approach as the one proposed in this work aimed at the first sizing of the appendage if necessary further analyses can be later performed with more complex tools e g by rans simulations to identify with higher accuracy the optimum geometry 4 rudder design and final verifications when the iterations are completed and an optimum daggerboard geometry has been identified the rudder surface remains defined as well and its design can be finalized according to the indications reported in this paragraph at last some structural and stability verifications reported in the second part of the paragraph shall be done before concluding the design exercise 4 1 indications on rudder design as anticipated the rudder design shall respond to two conflicting requirements low drag during navigation as well as delaying as much as possible the stall to ensure a high range of manoeuvrability also at low speeds with this latter being the preeminent one trower 1992 fossati 2007 vacanti 2005 furthermore unlike the daggerboard which is expected to work at rather constant conditions the rudder is continuously activated to keep the route this dynamic operation further complicates a possible design based on a performance estimation similar to the daggerboard one although still in principle possible it would require a law for the expected activation of the tiller during the race actually several laws depending on the weather conditions to allow the identification of the best trade off one such a law database is not available and its assumption would risk to be erroneous in light of this we provide here information which allows the definition of the rudder design on one side and might help developing a performance estimation method also for the rear foil on the other there is a general agreement among the authors that the rudder shall be designed primarily to delay the stall to account also for an efficient navigation we suggest selecting the rudder foil section comparing the parameter c l m a x c d m i n for the different candidates the higher the better furthermore the following aspects shall be taken into account being the rudder hung on the transom it crosses the water surface therefore unlike the daggerboard there is not a solid surface acting like a symmetry plane i e no mirroring concept accordingly the aspect ratio a r r of the rudder during navigation shall not be doubled as the daggerboard one this aspect complicates also the numerical simulations on the appendage combinations since only one of the two foils can be mirrored introducing the necessity of particular precautions on the domain definition and on the boundary conditions furthermore this simultaneous operation of the rudder between two fluids causes a problem known as ventilation with the water level lowering on the suction side of the foil during steering because of the lower local pressure with a consequent reduction of the effective rudder surface some designers propose the use of fences to partly compensate this effect trower 1992 although such devices cannot cope with the following issue being placed at the very end of the craft the first underwater sections of the rudder are immersed into the hull boundary layer this low velocity region in the fluid around the foil makes part of the rudder less effective in the generation of lift the flatness of the hull surface of most dinghies and skiffs allows in first approximation to estimate the vertical extension of this region δ b l from the equation for the turbulent incompressible flow over a flat plate see anderson 2007 10 δ b l 0 37 x r e x 1 5 where r e x for the rudder is the reynolds number computed on x l w l depending on the boat speed b s the vertical extension of this low velocity region can affect a not negligible part of the rudder draft up to 8 10 cm to address both this issue and the ventilation one we suggest a reduction of the chord lengths in the upper part of the rudder see fig 9 as much as permitted by structural integrity also the daggerboard root is immersed into the hull boundary layer though for a reduced vertical extension δ b l being the distance x lower in the case of the front foil however some daggerboard and keel designs feature as well a chord reduction close to the root trower 1992 whereas in this respect vacanti 2005 suggests a sort of transition fairing although this feature seems rather difficult to apply on dinghies qualitatively the low velocity region of the hull boundary layer can be observed when some air bubbles slowly slip along the hull surface during navigation see fig 10 as already reported the rudder is placed in line behind the daggerboard thus facing dirty flow conditions characterized by the wake and the downwash of the first foil researchers from delft keuning et al 2006 proposed an equation to estimate the downwash angle due to the daggerboard as 11 φ d b 0 192 c l d b 2 a r d b therefore the angle of attack seen by the rudder could be estimated by 12 α r γ φ d b the angle of attack reduction identified by eq 12 is one of the causes of the lift decrease δ l r observed in torriani 2012 by comparing the rudder in isolated operation and in line with the daggerboard unlike the daggerboard the maximum draft is not a major constrain for the rudder which in any case is normally shorter and is not used to flip back the boat after a capsize high aspect ratios are more efficient but are more prone to stall also because of the lower reynolds numbers related to the shorter chord lengths at equal rudder surface s r without limitations on the maximum draft the elliptic planform is expected to be the most efficient one for the rudder and indeed is largely employed crepaz 1986 however it is reported trower 1992 p 111 that squaring off the rudder planform gives some warnings of an incipient stall to the helmsman this is in agreement with the different stall mechanisms of rectangular wings with respect to elliptic ones marchaj 1987 p 315 where the stall is rather uniform along the entire span instead once the rudder surface s r is obtained from the computation of section 2 and accounting for the indications above the design finalization ultimately requires the identification of the aspect ratio a r r representing the best compromise between stall delaying and navigation efficiency in lack of a mathematical method to identify this compromise we suggest referring to the benchmarking in appendix a for the selection of a range of first guess with the related advantage drawbacks to be compared one by one for instance by numerical analyses with xflr5 on the isolated rudder geometry 4 2 final verifications the identified daggerboard geometry shall comply with three final requirements i structurally it shall withstand the maximum expected stresses ii the maximum heeling moment h m must be lower than the highest achievable righting moment r m and iii the daggerboard position shall allow the balance along the yaw angle boat centering i normally the most critical loading condition for the daggerboard is in case of capsize when the crew jumps on the daggerboard to flip the boat back to the vertical position since the crew stands on the foil tip to increase as much as possible r m the maximum bending moment is b m w g d n mm thus the admissible stress σ a d m of the daggerboard structure shall be 13 σ a d m b m i y m a x mpa where i mm4 is the moment of inertia of the foil section and y m a x mm is the distance between the daggerboard axis along the centroids of the sections and the point of maximum thickness on the root cross section assuming a crew weight w 80 90 kg standing on the daggerboard tip normally makes unnecessary repeating the verification also for the distributed lifting load during navigation ii since dinghies and skiffs do not have a bulb that provides ballast the crew and the helmsman shall ensure the necessary righting moment moving their own weight on the deck and in case using the trapezes in theory an excessively long daggerboard might shift the centre of hydrodynamic efforts so deeply to induce an excessive heeling moment h m with respect to the maximum achievable righting moment r m m a x see fig 11 a accordingly it shall be verified that at the maximum boat speed expected 14 r m m a x l d b z d b f s z s where l d b is the daggerboard lift while z d b and z s are the vertical positions of the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic sail centres see trower 1992 for practical ways to identify these positions with respect to an arbitrary plane of reference the waterline for instance since l d b f s eq 14 becomes 15 r m m a x l d b z d b z s the maximum righting moment r m m a x depends on the characteristics of each boat the maximum width the inclusion of lateral wings the use of trapezes etc thus it is here left in a generic form with its derivation being trivial given the boat specifications iii the boat balance along the yaw has to be targeted during the upwind conditions corresponding to the expected t w s since the beam wind and leeward courses are less demanding to control the craft we follow here the approach proposed by trower 1992 p 120 who suggests that a good balance for a dinghy is achieved placing the sail overall centroid a small distance ahead 5 of the l w l also named lead of the underwater centroid this latter being identified omitting the rudder fig 11 b this is a customary approach and other designers prefer including the rudder as well although this would change the amount of lead recommended to achieve the proper balance it shall be remarked that the optimum design deriving from the vpp computation might not comply with the previous verifications for instance depending on the materials and manufacturing methods employed the maximum stresses might exceed σ a d m if a foil section with insufficient thickness e g 6 of the chord length is used at the daggerboard root accordingly these final checks are always needed before finalizing the design task 5 discussions in spite of the satisfactory indications provided by the comparison with xflr5 this cannot be considered a validation of the entire method indeed a definitive verification would not consider the daggerboard performance alone rather it would assess the behaviour of the entire system sailboat appendages in terms of boat speed and leeway angle to compute the vmg systematically varying the daggerboard draft c r d ratio and planform shape for given wind and marine conditions although in principle possible such validation requires demanding means as a towing tank which are beyond authors possibilities consequently this design method cannot be deemed entirely verified we are aware that this might be considered a weak point of the paper however the structure the physical concepts and models implemented in the procedure have a general validity independently of the experimental validation which could be done on different small sailboats than the one considered here the authors would appreciate and technically support whoever with such possibilities might be interested into addressing such work of validation some further comments on specific design aspects such as the foil section identification and the sweep angle are lastly reported the reader will have likely noted that the performance evaluation procedure relies on assuming the foil section for both the daggerboard and the rudder different sections can be compared by changing the polynomials which describes the aerofoil performance with r e and repeating the computations nonetheless it is deemed important ranking the best candidates in a paragraph dedicated to the topic 5 1 foil section the identification of the appropriate foil sections is a difficult design decision among the numerous options available trower 1992 several families that can be used for the daggerboard and the rudder are suggested in the literature see for instance larsson and eliasson 2007 trower 1992 fossati 2007 vacanti 2005 a deep analysis of the characteristics related to the different sections is rather complex and beyond the scope of this work however seeking for quantitative criteria to identify the best candidates the formulas of table 5 are suggested some iterations are needed for the daggerboard criterion as a first run of the computation with an arbitrary selected section shall be performed to obtain a first estimation of t u w t d w and t t o t it shall be remarked that c l c d in table 5 shall be taken at the angle of attack α 0 seen by the foil section i e the angle of attack of the wing reduced by the effect of the induced velocity see p 132 glauert 1983 resulting from the computation the application of the criteria of table 5 to a range of candidates allows the identification of the section which maximizes the parameters as shown in fig 12 for the naca 4 digit family with different thicknesses in particular fig 12 a shows that thinner sections should be preferred for the daggerboard if feasible from a structural point of view and if the design angle of attack presents a reasonable margin from stall on the other hand fig 12 b shows that the 12 thick foil section provides the best trade off between maximum lift capability and minimum drag for the rudder as previously reported some authors trower 1992 fossati 2007 vacanti 2005 suggest that the stall delaying capability should be the major design driver for the rudder accordingly sections with relatively thin leading edges as the naca 6 series for instance should be discarded in favour of families with a thicker front as the naca 4 digit family with this regard the higher c l m a x capability of the 0012 section is evident when compared to the 64012 one at any reynolds number see fig 4 c of course all the parameters included in table 5 change according to re however preliminary indications suggest that the identification of the foil sections according to these criteria is affected to a minor extent by r e within the typical ranges of sailing foils i e the section maximizing the formulas in table 5 is the same at different reynolds numbers further investigations are needed however and the application of the criteria at the extremes of the expected range of r e is recommended for verification the surface finishing shall be as smooth as possible although polishing or waxing is useless in terms of performance differences with respect to well sanded surfaces according to stivers et al 1945 in table 6 measurements of surface roughness along the chord direction for two daggerboards manufactured for the 1001vela competition and treated with different coatings are reported the data clearly show the superiority in terms of surface finishing of the painting with respect to the sole gel coat a drawback of the method is that the aerofoil polars at several reynolds are required and these are available from experimental data for a limited number of sections see e g jacobs and sherman 1937 loftin jr and smith 1949 ferris et al 1987 in lack of these the section polars can be obtained from xflr5 with the possibility of integrating an automatic polar prediction in the iterative loop of fig 3 as done in carolus and starzmann 2011 for instance particular care shall be taken however especially with respect to c l m a x estimated values and a preliminary validation against experimental data on similar sections is always recommended at last it shall be notified that the generalized polar concept developed by jacobs and sherman 1937 is precedent to the development of laminar foils thus it cannot account for the sudden performance variation occurring outside the edge of the low drag bucket this should not represent an issue for laminar foils with a sufficient bucket extension 3 if the optimum planforms identified by the computations of section 2 work at leeway angles γ 3 otherwise the drag coefficient c d of laminar sections would be underestimated for operations outside the low drag bucket but the use of laminar geometries loses of sense in this latter case 5 2 sweep angle although the procedure allows to include the effect of the sweep angle λ into the daggerboard performance see eqs 24 in appendix b the analysis has been limited so far only to foils with straight planforms it is nonetheless important addressing a specific paragraph to the vexed argument of the effects of the sweep on foil performance in light of the fact that several daggerboards and rudders feature backswept geometries both for rectangular elliptic and tapered planforms see fig 14 among the authors the indications are rather in contrast larsson and eliasson 2007 p 109 and marchaj 1987 p 348 indicate that the sweep angle is used to obtain nearly elliptic force distributions and thus induced drag with tapered foils these authors indicate a relation λ f λ to identify the optimum sweep angle for a given taper ratio in particular for taper ratios λ 0 45 0 5 which is the tapered geometry with closer performance to the elliptic one see p 110 larsson and eliasson 2007 the sweep angle is zero this appears in agreement with the indications from brewer 1981 who suggests sweepback angles reducing down to nearly zero with the increase of the aspect ratio a r of the opposite vision appears vacanti 2005 who claims that λ is the most important parameter to increase the upwind characteristics of a keel and provides the following equation reported also in scholz et al 2007 to compute the lift curve slope of a swept foil 16 c l α 2 π a r 2 a r k v 2 1 t a n λ 50 2 4 where λ 50 is the sweep angle of the positions at mid chord k v is a scale factor 1 1 vacanti 2005 does not provide an explanation of the scale factor k v which divides the aspect ratio a r at the denominator of eq 16 though reporting a value rather close to one 1 003 in scholz et al 2007 the same factor is defined as k v c l α 2 π 1 m a 2 where m a is the mach number although claiming that some authors use k v 1 and t a n λ 50 t a n λ 4 a r 1 λ 2 1 λ eq 16 resembles the form of eq 24 by kuchemann 1978 reported in appendix b for rectangular foils where a 2 d 2 π in the thin aerofoil theory anderson 2007 2 2 both eqs 16 and 24 assume a linear lift curve slope thus not taking into account the non linear behaviour at larger angles of attack shown by highly swept wings as those tested in tinling and kolk 1951 unlike eq 24 however eq 16 identifies the highest lift curve slope c l α at sweep angles λ higher than zero for tapered wings see fig 13 and generally around 15 according to vacanti also marchaj although admitting that the inclusion of swept keels daggerboards might be due to aesthetic reasons rather than to increase the foil efficiency marchaj 1987 p 340 in a caption at p 349 claims that for moderately tapered geometries the highest c l α occurs with sweptback foils rather than straight ones on the other hand the same author also presents experimental plots of c l versus α for three rectangular geometries with a r 6 and λ to 0 20 and 20 the geometry featuring the highest c l α is still the straight one in agreement with the indications provided by eq 24 in this somehow confusing scenario we compared the trends resulting from eqs 16 and 24 with the lift curve slopes of tapered and rectangular foils with different sweep angles as obtained from xflr5 in particular we analysed the cases of rectangular foils with ar 6 67 and again the two tapered geometries with ar 5 14 λ 0 713 and ar 10 07 λ 0 500 from the naca report tinling and kolk 1951 the results are reported in fig 13 the trend resulting from eq 24 is well in agreement with the numerical data showing a symmetric behaviour with respect to the zero sweep angle where the rectangular foil achieves the highest c l α value on the contrary the trends resulting from eq 16 do not match with the xflr5 data pertaining to the tapered wings in particular i the peak of the curves is shifted towards higher sweep angles at 21 and 11 respectively for the wing with ar 5 and the one with ar 10 whereas the results from the simulations on both tapered wings again show that the peaks occur at λ 0 and ii the maximum value provided by eq 16 is overestimated of 8 and 5 due to the use of 2 π at the numerator instead of the actual lift curve slope a 2 d corresponding to that particular reynolds in light of these indications eq 16 appears incorrect to estimate the c l α at least when used for the incompressible conditions m a 0 pertaining to sailing although a slight asymmetry is just perceivable for the data with ar 5 14 the xflr5 results of fig 13 indicate the superiority of straight foils compared to swept ones in terms of the lift curve slopes for the relatively high aspect ratios typical of the appendages of dinghies and skiffs the c l c d versus α data not reported confirmed this superiority accordingly so far the authors have not found any solid indication about possible gains of swept foils of any planform shape with respect to straight ones for the typical aspect ratios pertaining to the daggerboards of racing dinghies and skiffs as an indirect confirmation all the foils of the 1001vela race cup prototypes are straight ones according to the authors best knowledge on the other hand the sweep angle might represent a potential design solution to provide an acceptable rudder behaviour beyond the stall see p 347 marchaj 1987 as well as to shift longitudinally the hydrodynamic centre of the underwater actions in case of constraints on the positions of the daggerboard and rudder 6 conclusions an engineering method based on the fundamental equations of the fluid dynamics of sailing has been developed to provide in a rather simple way a unified comparison of the basic design choices i e basic planform shapes drafts and aspect ratios for the appendages of small racing yachts the method is based on a velocity prediction program which estimates the sum of both the upwind and downwind times during the race accounting also for the effect of the reynolds number variation of the foil performance and it can be easily implemented without requiring complex numerical tools for a given daggerboard shape and draft the procedure provides the optimum aspect ratio by identifying the c r d which minimizes the sum of the upwind and downwind times the method has been applied to the case of a 4 6 m skiff sailing with a true wind speed of 5 m s showing that an optimum trade off exists between upwind and downwind conditions identified in terms of the optimum c r d ratio which minimizes the overall racing time in general the longer the daggerboard the faster the boat in the elliptic case analysed the overall racing time is reduced of 21 5 s by increasing the draft d from 0 9 to 1 3 m decreasing the optimum c r d ratio from 0 5 to 0 25 the downwind contribution slightly shifts towards lower values the optimum c r d identified considering only the upwind leg from 0 25 to 0 2 for the elliptic foil with d 1 3 m and from 0 5 to 0 4 for d 0 9 m on the other hand the lower downwind contribution to the overall time explains why appendages are usually designed solely considering windward conditions daggerboards of equal draft but with elliptic and rectangular planforms present similar overall timing performances although at different optimum c r d values the accurate identification of this latter parameter is more critical for the rectangular geometries with respect to the elliptic ones tapered geometries with moderate taper ratios are expected to perform intermediately between the rectangular and elliptic ones the rudder design needs to respond to two conflicting requirements low drag and delaying as much as possible the stall it is sized as 15 of the lateral underwater surface hull appendages and its upper part should present a chord reduction to cope with the effects of the free water surface and of the hull boundary layer investigations have also been performed on the topic of the sweep angle λ comparing xflr5 simulations with the results obtained by equations from the literature to provide the lift curve slope of swept rectangular and tapered foils in particular eq 24 provided by kuchemann for swept rectangular foils fairly agrees with the numerical results on geometries with moderate sweep angles on the contrary eq 16 erroneously predicts the lift curve slope of tapered swept foils both in terms of the maximum c l α value and of the corresponding λ for the relatively high aspect ratios typically used on the foils of small racing yachts the data indicates that the highest c l α is achieved with straight geometries i e λ 0 both for rectangular and tapered ones credit

2d foil section at several reynolds numbers to account for the performance variations with re experimental databases for symmetric aerofoils can be obtained from the reports jacobs and sherman 1937 loftin jr and smith 1949 ferris et al 1987 otherwise for a given foil section a database of polar characteristics at different re could be built with the open source xfoil software drela 1989 this input requires the selection of specific foil sections both for the daggerboard and the rudder see section 5 1 2 the design parameters for the daggerboard shall be given as input as well in step 2 and then modified in successive computations to assess different geometries these parameters are the daggerboard draft or semi span d in m selected the range of k ratios c r d to assess during the computation and the generic planform shape e g 1 4 of ellipse all the geometrical parameters of the daggerboard surface s d b aspect ratio a r d b and chord length distribution are so defined in terms of k and d for a given planform see table 7 each computation is performed on a single value of k i and once converged it is then repeated with the k i 1 one when the computations on the entire k range are completed the results are recorded and the procedure applied again for different daggerboard drafts d and planforms for comparison the k range shall be selected so that the minimum a r d b remains higher than 4 since the equations for finite wings with relatively high aspect ratios are not representative for lower values anderson 2007 p 442 3 once the boat speed b s is imposed at the beginning of the iteration d b h is computed from the resistance curve of the bare hull which can be approximated by an interpolating polynomial for instance 4 a leeway angle γ of first guess is assumed

c m 21 r e d b ρ w b s c m μ ρ w b s k d μ where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the water it can be seen from eq 21 that for a given draft d the reynolds number r e d b is approximately proportional to the k i of that particular iteration on the other hand at equal k r e increases with d 9 for the daggerboard the lift curve slope pertaining to the selected foil section is identified according to the reynolds number 22 a 2 d f 2 r e d b with f 2 being an interpolation function fitting the data as shown in fig 4 a for the 0012 and 64012 naca sections loftin jr and smith 1949 the a 2 d parameter features important variations in the range r e 3 1 0 6 which is the range of interest for most of the appendages trower 1992 vacanti 2005 this behaviour is due to thickening of the boundary layer on the suction side of the foil section with decreasing r e a well known phenomenon in several technical disciplines as turbomachinery design see e g wallis 1961 p 71 10 the lift curve slope of the entire daggerboard a d b is computed according to the well known equations coming from the aerodynamics of wings see glauert 1983 anderson 2007 kuchemann 1978 elliptic planform 23 a e l π a r 1 π a 2

introduce an elliptic load distribution on a wing foil which is not geometrically elliptic larsson and eliasson 2007 marchaj 1987 this parameter is not needed in eq 23 tapered wings with taper ratios c r c t 0 45 0 5 show lift curve slopes almost equal to the elliptic one larsson and eliasson 2007 thus eq 23 can still be used with confidence for different taper ratios anderson anderson 1936 computes a t a p multiplying the right hand member of eq 23 by a factor f which is function of c r c t and the foil aspect ratio the plot of f c r c t a r has not been reported in this work but the

as 25 c l d b f s 0 5 ρ w b s 2 s d b 12 the unviscid drag coefficient related to the induced velocity c d i is computed according to 26 c d i c l 2 π a r eq 26 is exact for elliptic planforms only although it can be applied to other planforms with a negligible error glauert 1983 p 147 the daggerboard angle of attack which is the leeway angle γ of the boat when the iterations converge is computed as 27 α 180 π c l d b a d b in addition the local angle of attack α 2 d might be needed to compute the viscous drag from the foil section polar at the specific r e α 2 d is computed by the following equations see glauert 1983 elliptic planform 28 α 2 d α 180 π c l d b π a r d b rectangular planforms see p 147 glauert 1983 29 a 1 r e c l d b π a r d b 30 μ r e 2 π k i 8 31 τ 1 μ r e μ r

geometries because of the local increase of downwash see glauert 1983 marchaj 1987 accordingly for rectangular foils the angles computed with eqs 27 32 should be integrated and averaged along the entire foil semispan although a direct use of eqs 27 32 results in an acceptable approximation glauert 1983 13 if the foil section polars at different r e are not directly available the viscous drag coefficient c d can be computed according to the generalized section polar proposed by jacobs and sherman jacobs and sherman 1937 which allows an estimation of the polar of the generic section at different reynolds numbers the application to the case of symmetric sections foresees what follows the computation of the minimum drag coefficient at zero lift as 33 c d m i n c d m i n r e f r e r e f r e 0 11 where the subscript ref stands for the parameter at r e r e f 8 1 0 6 such values can be found in the report jacobs and sherman 1937 alternatively the decreasing trends of c d m i n with r e presented in fig 4 b for the naca 0012 and 64012 sections can be described by an interpolating function c d m i n f 3 r e the c d at different lift coefficients i e at different angles of attack is then computed as see fig 16 34 c d c d m i n δ c d c d m i n f 4 c l c l m a x with the function f 4 represented in fig 16 c l c l d b and both c d m i n and c l m a x taken at the corresponding r e see fig 4 and table 1 the maximum lift coefficient of different aerofoils at several reynolds can be found in jacobs and sherman 1937 or in loftin jr and smith 1949 for the 0012 and 64012 sections fig 4 c 14 the overall daggerboard drag is computed as sum of the viscous and non viscous contributions 35 c d d b c d c d i 36 d d b 1 2 ρ w c d d b b s 2 s d b 15 as anticipated the rudder is sized according to a rule of thumb suggested by trower for dinghies trower 1992 p 113 rather than according to fluid dynamics equations in particular the rudder surface s r is assumed to be equal to the 15 of the underwater lateral plane i e the lateral projection of the underwater surface s b h l a t s d b s r giving 37 s r 0 176 s b h l a t s d b the positioning of the daggerboard with respect to the rudder and the centre of force on the sails trower 1992 fossati 2007 does not affect the performance estimation nonetheless the boat centering has to be verified see section 3 to achieve the sailing balance before finalizing the foil design 16 since the rudder is sized for manoeuvring and not to contribute in resisting to leeway at this step the sailing balance i e the equilibrium between turning moments along the yaw axis of the boat is assumed to be achieved this involves that the drag of the rudder during navigation unless if used to correct the trajectory is only the viscous one around the zero lift operation 38 d r 1 2 ρ w b s 2 c d m i n s r where c d m i n is function of the reynolds number and of the foil section selected for the rudder according to the data reported in torriani 2012 the decrease of rudder drag caused by the daggerboard wake and downwash is δ d r 11 this makes the computation of d r with eq 38 an acceptable approximation even for rudders positioned in line behind the daggerboard 17 during the upwind navigation an additional drag is caused by the boat interaction with the waves naturally existing on the race field sailing windward the boat heads against the approaching waves with the bow heading up and down in a pitching motion with a slowing effect this is called added resistance in waves and its modelling is rather complex in this work the equation proposed by the researchers of delft keuning and sonnenberg 1998 and tabulated in larsson and eliasson 2007 is used 39 d a w a ρ w g l w l h 1 3 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 c 1 3 l w l k y y l w l b where a and b are two coefficients tabulated in function of wave mean period t 1 and the froude number f r for the different heading angles see p 93 larsson and eliasson 2007 g is the gravitational acceleration and k y y is the gyradius a parameter related to the moment of inertia of the boat along the transversal axis y according to larsson and eliasson larsson and eliasson 2007 p 93 taking k y y 0 25 l o a is a reasonable assumption and this appears appropriate within the scope of this work 18 at the given b s the entire drag of the hull with the appendages d t o t f b s is then computed as 40 d t o t d b h d d b d r d a w with the addition of d a w only for the upwind leg 19 finally the initially guessed boat speed value b s is verified comparing the propulsive force on the sails f p with the total drag d t o t in particular b s is increased if d t o t f p or decreased if d t o t f p until converging to a b s value such that d t o t f p at each new iteration the leeway angle previously computed returns to step 4 and it updates the computation of the velocity triangles 20 when the iterations are converged the daggerboard angle of attack α computed with eq 27 actually is the leeway angle of the boat γ 21 the velocity made good vmg is computed as 41 v m g b s c o s t w a 22 the times t u w and t d w are finally calculated for the upwind and downwind legs respectively dividing the distance between bouys l r e g for the vmg 42 t l r e g v m g and the overall time is given as sum of the two 43 t t o t t u w t d w this latter parameter is then used to identify the best appendage combination the lower the time t t o t the quicker will be the boat during the race it shall be remarked that the t values so computed do not represent actual racing times since they cannot account for i the time needed for tacking and gybing and ii the slowing action induced by the rudder activation for instance to correct the route during upwind navigation or to bring back the boat to a flat attitude in downwind conditions 
20349,the variety of shapes and sizes among daggerboards and rudders of small racing yachts indicates the lack of a comparative design method and that some aspects may be neglected in the designs currently proposed in particular a literature survey showed that i the conventional design approaches are exclusively based on upwind conditions disregarding any downwind contribution to the race ii the detrimental effects related to the typically low reynolds numbers involved are marginally considered and iii there are ambiguous indications about sweep angle effects on foil performance in this paper a design method based on a velocity prediction program compares different appendage planforms for a yacht identifying the ones minimizing the overall racing time sum of upwind and downwind contributions the method is applied to a 4 6 m skiff and the performance of the daggerboards analysed are compared with xflr5 simulations validated against experimental tests the results quantify the time gains of longer foils and the similar performance of elliptic and rectangular geometries with equal drafts but different aspect ratios swept foils are investigated as well showing lower lift

the design of the appendages daggerboard and rudder of small racing yachts providing indications to identify i the foil surfaces in m2 and ii the planform shapes and drafts which achieve good performance during a regatta with upwind and downwind legs in spite of the current interest for flying sailboats i e boats with underwater lifting appendages that sail with the hull above the water it seems reasonable that the vast majority of future recreational racing yachts will remain of the conventional type with this regard small racing sailboats as dinghies and skiffs i e recreational crafts whose length overall is typically around 4 6 m and with a crew of two three persons are addressed in this paper in particular concerning the design of their appendages historically these boats sail and race since several decades see e g chapelle 1951 however the design of their appendages has always been a rather vexed topic and it is a typical subject of discussion among yacht designers or in the nautical clubs as a matter of fact it is common finding dinghies with similar dimensions and sail surfaces but with different daggerboards and rudders the natural question arises which foil shape will be the fastest during a race the technical literature on nautical design does not provide a clear reply nor all the indications as well summarized by trower 1992 p 105 the wide range of planforms used for keels also supports the argument that no one has all the answers the authors of this paper experienced the lack of a unified comparative design method for foils in several ways during more than 10 years of participation to the 1001vela cup competition http www 1001velacup eu a race between skiff prototypes designed manufactured and sailed by university students the first macro indication came from observing the different competitors although constrained by the same design rules the boats are generally presenting different appendages a further confirmation came from a bench marking reported in appendix a performed on 20 commercial dinghies and skiffs with similar dimensions to the ones of the 1001vela some data from this analysis are shown in fig 1 which presents the daggerboard or centreboard keel according to the case and rudder surfaces of each boat against the corresponding sail plane area a first look at the graph of fig 1 indicates an increasing trend of the foil surfaces against the sail areas but with a significant scatter among the different data in spite of the crudeness of this survey further analyses should evaluate whether such differences can be explained in terms of different design choices at the same time several planform shapes can be observed among the foils of these boats fig 14 in appendix a elliptic tapered rectangular geometries as well as different sweep angles have been adopted during the years by different designers seeking for a unified design methods for the appendages a research was performed in the technical literature on yacht design larsson and eliasson 2007 chapelle 1951 trower 1992 crepaz 1986 fossati 2007 vacanti 2005 garrett 1996 marchaj 1987 acerbi et al 2017 in first instance it was concluded that most of these methods base the appendage design solely on the upwind conditions where foils act similarly to the wings of an airplane to compensate the side force on the sails neglecting or giving little consideration to the downwind navigation however the downwind leg still represents around half of the race during which the side force compensation is not needed anymore and the daggerboard shall produce as less drag as possible to avoid slowing down the craft therefore in principle it seems reasonable that the optimum daggerboard design shall represent a trade off between both the upwind and downwind conditions of the race in second instance in spite of the rather unanimous awareness in the literature e g trower 1992 crepaz 1986 fossati 2007 vacanti 2005 acerbi et al 2017 about the detrimental effects related to typically low to moderate reynolds numbers i e r e 3 1 0 6 on foil performance no indications are provided on how systematically accounting for these detriments directly in the preliminary sizing of the foils this latter aspect is especially relevant for skiffs and dinghies because of the relatively small chord lengths of their appendages at last some disagreement was found in the literature about the performance gain loss of swept foils with respect to straight ones from a broader point of view in spite of the different successful foil designs proposed in the technical literature a unified approach which compares the basic design choices in terms of the fundamental principles of the fluid dynamic of sailing to minimize the racing time is not available indeed it is rather common performing a preliminary design i e deciding the foil surface or draft from benchmarkings on similar crafts see the successful design acerbi et al 2017 for instance on the other hand refined numerical tools exist in support of the foil design exercise e g cella et al 2018 cirello and mancuso 2008 but their use is generally limited to the highest levels of sail competition like the america s cup regatta according to the authors experience in fact the small teams normally involved in designing a new yacht a commercial or a prototype one and of her appendages seldom have the resources for including numerical optimization campaigns during the design phase especially in case of small sailboats being the fees proportioned to the boat dimensions it thus follows the need for a quick simple but still effective design method to identify the basic shape and size of the daggerboards and rudders of small racing yachts with this regard the method developed by the authors is presented in this paper for a given craft it is based on the performance evaluation of different daggerboard rudder combinations by a velocity prediction program fossati 2007 molland et al 2017 during the upwind and the downwind legs of the regatta assuming a windward leeward race in the vpp a method developed by jacobs and sherman 1937 is integrated to estimate the polars of the foil sections at different re thus systematically accounting for the detriments on the foil performance the results of the method are summarized into plots which identify the daggerboard and rudder geometries providing the best upwind downwind trade off during the regatta i e the minimum overall racing time for the expected wind and sea conditions since the results are based on the estimation of the foil performances the prediction capability of the computations is compared with simulations performed on the same geometries with the xflr5 code deperrois 2009 in turn the xflr5 analyses have been compared with experimental data on two wings at r e 2 1 0 6 to assess the accuracy of the code at low to moderate reynolds this numerical tool is used here in order to suggest a relatively easy and accessible verification for anyone who is facing the task of appendage design for skiffs and dinghies the article is organized as follows in section 2 the entire architecture of the method is reported in a descriptive way leaving its mathematical development the equations and a numerical example in appendix b for sake of readability in section 3 the procedure is applied to the case study of a 4 6 m skiff and the results in terms of daggerboard performance are compared with the analogous parameters obtained from xflr5 analyses in section 4 indications on peculiar aspects of rudder design as well as for structural and stability verifications are provided finally in section 5 further considerations concerning the selection of the foil section and the sweep angle are reported together with a discussion about the limits of the work the paper is primarily intended for designers of small yachts the knowledge of the fluid dynamics of sailing and of the related design analysis tools are considered prerequisites it shall be remarked that several successful and refined foil designs exist nowadays and the approach presented here does not have the ambition of providing optimized geometries the objective is rather providing a solid procedure to compare the basic design parameters which define the appendage planforms of small racing yachts accounting for aspects generally neglected as the contribution of the downwind part of the race and the effects related to the reynolds number 2 method the method used to identify the optimum planforms and sizes of the daggerboard rudder combination is described here in a step by step procedure the method is a vpp for the boat with the different appendage combinations that is based on computing the balance between forces the side force on the sails against the lift of the daggerboard and the propulsive force against the drag of the system some preliminary tasks requiring familiarity with the fields of sailing fluid dynamics and nautical design are needed to correctly implement the vpp algorithm in particular the availability of the bare hull characteristics and of the sail polars as well as the awareness of the expected wind and sea conditions at the race field are necessary prerequisites the method ultimately provides an estimation of the overall time t t o t sum of the times during the upwind and downwind legs and this parameter is used to rank the different appendage combinations the quickest is the best berman 2018 likely makes use of a similar approach to compare the performance of keels against daggerboards for a sailing catamaran the hypotheses on which the method is based are those typical of appendage design for small racing boats see for instance trower 1992 crepaz 1986 acerbi et al 2017 and are here summarized the boat is assumed to be in a perfectly flat position i e no heeling the daggerboard lift counteracts entirely the side force on the sails i e there is no contribution from the rudder which is instead designed primarily for steering the boat the hull represents a symmetry plane for the daggerboard the mirroring image concept see e g larsson and eliasson 2007 crepaz 1986 marchaj 1987 whose effective aspect ratio a r d b is thus twice the geometric one d 2 s d b with d and s d b being respectively the draft and surface of the daggerboard the rudder is placed on the boat stern transom hung right over the length overall of the craft the wave drag or residual drag of the appendages are neglected the effect of the leeway angle γ on the resistance of the bare hull d b h is assumed to be negligible thus d b h is only function of the boat speed b s when the rudder is not steering the boat it is positioned at an angle of attack around the zero lift position thus its drag is exclusively the viscous one the approaches are thus different for the daggerboard and the rudder daggerboard it is designed to compensate the entire side force from the sails and its performance are evaluated according to the conventional fluid dynamics equations of wings geometries corresponding to different i drafts d i e wing semispans ii aspect ratio a r d b and iii planform shapes e g elliptic against rectangular are compared for a given draft and planform shape the aspect ratio is systematically varied modifying the ratio k c r d between the root chord length and the daggerboard draft as shown in fig 2 for a given planform shape this allows to express the main foil geometrical features surface size aspect ratio as function of the draft d rudder it needs to respond to two conflicting requirements low drag during navigation on one hand and the capability of delaying as much as possible the stall on the other with this latter being somehow the preeminent one trower 1992 fossati 2007 vacanti 2005 the rudder is sized according to an empirical rule as a proportion of the lateral underwater plane see trower 1992 targeting primarily the capability of steering the boat this approach is described in detail in section 4 1 apart from the diverse operations the different approaches are needed because on dinghies the rudder is placed in line behind the daggerboard thus facing the complex flow characterized by the wake and the downwash of the first foil similar distinctions are adopted by other authors as well see for instance trower 1992 acerbi et al 2017 2 1 vpp architecture the architecture of the vpp is presented here in a sequential form and with the support of the flow chart in fig 3 for sake of readability the structure is presented as much as possible in a descriptive way reporting the entire mathematical development the equations and a numerical example in appendix b the performance estimation is based on an iterative computation which assumes a boat speed b s of first guess for the combination of appendages under analysis the unbalance between the propulsive force f p and the total drag d t o t including hull daggerboard and rudder is then used to correct b s when the computation converges it is possible to compute the projection of the boat speed on the wind direction i e the velocity made good vmg and thus the resulting time t u w or t d w for the upwind or downwind cases respectively to cover the distance between the two buoys when the computation has been applied to both the upwind and downwind legs it is finally possible to compute the overall time t t o t t u w t d w referring to fig 3 each block of the computation is presented in the following list see the corresponding numbers taking familiarity with the flow chart of fig 3 and with the nomenclature is recommended before proceeding further 1 several inputs are needed to start the race environmental conditions in terms of expected true wind speed tws

hull c the upwind and downwind sail dimensions s s u w and s s d w respectively which are needed to compute the propulsive and side forces the polar characteristics of the sails both upwind and downwind to provide the force coefficients which will be used to compute the propulsive and side forces f p and f s respectively according to the boat heading the polar characteristics of the 2d foil section at several reynolds numbers to account for the performance variations with re with this regard experimental databases for symmetric aerofoils can be obtained from the reports jacobs and sherman 1937 loftin jr and smith 1949 ferris et al 1987 or could be built with the open source xfoil software drela 1989 this input requires the selection of specific foil sections for the daggerboard and the rudder indications in this respect are specifically addressed in section 5 1 2 in step 2 the design parameters for the daggerboard shall be given as input as well and then modified in successive computations to assess different geometries these parameters are the daggerboard draft or semi span in the wing daggerboard analogy d selected the range of k ratios to assess during the computation and the generic planform shape e g 1 4 of ellipse or rectangular all the geometrical parameters of the daggerboard surface s d b aspect ratio a r d b and chord length distribution are so defined exclusively in terms of k and d for a given planform see table 7 in appendix b for the mathematical formulas each computation is performed on a single value of k i and once converged it is then repeated with the k i 1 one when the computations on the entire k range are completed the results are recorded and the procedure applied again for different daggerboard drafts d and planforms for comparison 3 once the boat speed b s is imposed at the beginning of the iteration d b h is computed from the resistance curve of the bare hull which can be approximated by an interpolating polynomial for instance 4 a leeway angle γ of first guess is assumed typically γ 1 0 5 the velocity triangles on the sails fig 15 in appendix b are resolved with the b s and γ resulting from the previous iteration finally providing the apparent wind speed a w s and true wind angle twa 6 the propulsive and side forces f p and f s are computed projecting the actions on the sails on the direction of the motion b s and its perpendicular according to the heading under analysis upwind or downwind sail dimensions and related force coefficients are used 7 the daggerboard geometrical parameters are computed s d b a r d b and the mean chord c m from the inputs provided at step nr 2 as previously reported the effective aspect ratio for the performance computation of the daggerboard is doubled according to the mirroring plane concept induced by the hull larsson and eliasson 2007 crepaz 1986 marchaj 1987 8 the daggerboard reynolds number is computed referring to the mean chord length c m since c m c r k d for a given d the reynolds number r e d b is approximately proportional to the k i of that particular iteration thus r e d b increases linearly with k see fig 2 conversely at equal k r e increases with d 9 for the daggerboard the lift curve slope pertaining to the selected foil section is identified according to the reynolds number a 2 d f 2 r e d b with f 2 being an interpolation function fitting the data as shown in fig 4 a for the 0012 and 64012 naca sections loftin jr and smith 1949 the a 2 d parameter features important variations for r e 3 1 0 6 which is the range of interest for most of the appendages trower 1992 vacanti 2005 this behaviour is due to the thickening of the boundary layer on the suction side of the foil section with decreasing r e a well known phenomenon in several technical disciplines as turbomachinery design see e g p 71 wallis 1961 10 the lift curve slope of the entire three dimensional daggerboard a d b is computed according to the well known equations coming from the aerodynamics of wings see appendix b these equations cf anderson 1936 glauert 1983 anderson 2007 kuchemann 1978 allow to account for the different planforms elliptic tapered rectangular as well as for the sweep angle λ 11 the daggerboard lift coefficient c l d b required to balance the side force f s on the sails is computed as 1 c l d b f s 0 5 ρ w b s 2 s d b where ρ w is the mass density of water by knowing c l d b and the lift curve slope a d b just computed the daggerboard angle of attack α which will ultimately be equal to the leeway angle can be calculated as well 12 with the lift coefficient obtained at the previous step the unviscid drag coefficient c d i related to the induced velocity and thus to the lift is computed 13 unless the foil section polars at different r e are directly integrated within the computation as for instance in the xfoil based method presented in carolus and starzmann 2011 for fan blade design the viscous drag coefficient c d can be computed at the corresponding incidence angle according to the generalized section polar proposed by jacobs and sherman 1937 which allows estimating the polar of the generic 2d section at different reynolds numbers this approach described in appendix b requires the trends with reynolds of i the minimum drag coefficient c d m i n and ii the maximum lift coefficient c l m a x of the selected foil section see figs 4 b and 4 c for the naca 0012 and 64012 14 the overall daggerboard drag is computed as sum of the viscous and non viscous contributions 2 c d d b c d c d i 3 d d b 1 2 ρ w c d d b b s 2 s d b 15 as anticipated the rudder is sized according to a rule of thumb suggested by trower for dinghies trower 1992 p 113 its surface s r is assumed to be equal to the 15 of the underwater lateral plane i e the lateral projection of the underwater surface s b h l a t s d b s r giving 4 s r 0 176 s b h l a t s d b the reasons for using the empirical relation 4 are mainly two first we experienced that the rudder surfaces obtained from eq 4 allow an acceptable compromise between the navigation conditions and the need for effective manoeuvring capabilities at low boat speeds e g approaching an harbour or at the start line of the regatta on the contrary more complex approaches resulted into undersized rudders with poor effectiveness at low b s in second instance the fact that during navigation the rudder is immersed into the wake and downwash of the daggerboard see keuning et al 2006 for conventional yachts calls into question the accuracy of an analytic approach as the one used for the daggerboard also for the rudder with this respect reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations performed in torriani 2012 on six daggerboard rudder combinations for a skiff sailing at a given leeway angle showed a decrease of lift for the rudder around δ l r 31 34 with respect to the same geometry in isolated conditions and a lower decrease of drag δ d r 3 11 this aspect is recalled in section 4 1 the positioning of the daggerboard with respect to the rudder and the centre of force on the sails trower 1992 fossati 2007 does not affect the performance estimation nonetheless the boat centering has to be verified see section 4 to achieve the sailing balance before finalizing the foil design 16 since the rudder is sized for manoeuvring and not to contribute in resisting leeway at this step the sailing balance i e the equilibrium between turning moments along the yaw axis of the boat is assumed to be achieved this involves that the drag of the rudder during navigation unless if used to correct the trajectory is only the viscous one around the zero lift operation 5 d r 1 2 ρ w c d m i n b s 2 s r where c d m i n is function of the reynolds number and of the foil section selected for the rudder according to the data reported in torriani 2012 the decrease of rudder drag caused by the daggerboard wake and downwash is δ d r 11 this makes the computation of d r with eq 5 an acceptable approximation even for rudders positioned in line behind the daggerboard 17 only during the upwind navigation an additional drag is caused by the boat interaction with the waves naturally existing on the race field this is called added resistance in waves d a w and it is modelled in appendix b in terms of the boat characteristics and of the waving system see larsson and eliasson 2007 keuning and sonnenberg 1998 18 at the given b s the entire drag of the hull with the appendages d t o t f b s is then computed as 6 d t o t d b h d d b d r d a w where d a w is included only for the upwind leg 19 finally the initially guessed boat speed value b s is verified comparing the propulsive force on the sails f p with the total drag d t o t in particular b s is increased if d t o t f p or decreased if d t o t f p until converging to a value such that d t o t f p at each new iteration the leeway angle previously computed returns to step 4 updating so the computation of the velocity triangles 20 when the iterations are converged the daggerboard angle of attack α actually is the leeway angle of the boat γ 21 the velocity made good vmg is computed as 7 v m g b s c o s t w a 22 the times t u w and t d w are finally calculated for the upwind and downwind legs respectively dividing the distance between bouys l r e g for the vmg 8 t l r e g v m g and the overall time is given as sum of the two 9 t t o t t u w t d w this latter parameter is then used to identify the best appendage combination the lower the time t t o t the quicker will be the boat during the race it shall be remarked that the t values so computed are ranking parameters and do not represent real racing times since they cannot account for i the time needed for tacking and gybing and ii the slowing action induced by the rudder activation for instance to correct the route during upwind navigation or to bring back the boat to a flat attitude in downwind conditions for a given daggerboard planform shape and draft d the computation is performed on several k ratios until when the plot t k shows a minimum see step 22 of fig 3 that minimum identifies the optimum k i e the best aspect ratio a r d b for that particular draft and planform after that the procedure is repeated for different d and for different planforms the data are then recorded and plotted together in the same t k plot for comparison the daggerboard geometry which shows the minimum t t o t is the best if feasible in structural stability and control terms see section 3 and in turn identifies the size of the rudder as well 3 results and verifications the procedure is applied here to the case study of a 4 6 m skiff whose characteristics are reported in table 1 with the environmental conditions considered and the polynomial functions used for the vpp whereas the five daggerboard geometries analysed are summarized in table 2 among the usual planform shapes elliptic rectangular and tapered the analysis has been applied solely to the first two and only to straight geometries i e with zero sweep angle in fact tapered wings with optimum taper ratio λ 0 5 perform similarly to the elliptic ones this was indeed observed with xflr5 analyses and it was also shown by the towing tank tests conducted at delft larsson and eliasson 2007 fossati 2007 on the other hand foils with larger taper ratios will perform intermediately between elliptic and rectangular ones whereas geometries featuring low λ values i e triangular or quasi triangular wings provide poor performances anderson 1936 marchaj 1987 and were not taken into consideration a dedicated paragraph is addressed to the sweep angle and related foil performance in section 5 the results in terms of upwind downwind and total times t u w t d w and t t o t are presented in fig 5 and analysed in section 3 1 the comparison between the daggerboard performances resulting from the method and those obtained from xflr5 are then presented in section 3 2 with the validation against experimental data 3 1 results the outputs of the computations are presented in fig 5 for the upwind downwind and total times respectively the following observations can be reported upwind independently of the planform and draft d a minimum on the upwind leg timing is identified as corresponding to a particular c r d ratio fig 5 a this minimum is slightly appreciable for the curves pertaining to the lowest semispan d 0 9 m though becoming more evident for the geometries at higher d in upwind conditions when the daggerboard works similarly to an airplane wing the geometry corresponding to this minimum represents the best compromise between profile and friction losses for a given d the geometries with higher c r d ratio right side of the curves produce an excessive resistance because of the higher surface s d b on the opposite side left part of the curves foils with lower c r d and thus less surface produce less friction drag but they must operate at higher angles of attack i e higher leeway to achieve the required lift increasing both the viscous and inviscid resistances related to the higher lift coefficients involved upwind at equal daggerboard draft d the elliptic geometries feature lower minimums than the rectangular ones although the differences are narrow in terms of t u w 1 5 s at d 0 9 m and just 0 3 s at d 1 3 m on the other hand the right hand sides of the curves for the rectangular foils are steeper than the elliptic ones this is easily explained in terms of the higher surface and thus higher friction of a rectangular daggerboard compared to an elliptic one of equal draft and k ratio this aspect makes the identification of the optimum c r d ratio more critical for rectangular foils than for elliptic ones overall referring at fig 5 a increasing the draft d reduces the minimum t u w and the optimum c r d ratio shifts towards lower values looking at the elliptic geometries t u w o p t is reduced of 23 s 2 5 passing from d 0 9 m k 0 5 to 1 3 m k 0 25 on the other hand the corresponding timing increase during the downwind leg fig 5 b due to the longer daggerboard at k 0 25 with respect to the shorter one at k 0 5 is just 1 5 s for a final total gain of 21 5 s although such gain might appear small benefits of this entity see also vacanti 2005 and p 91 larsson and eliasson 2007 would make a race chanceless for a boat using the shorter daggerboard yacht designers are aware that longer keels provide better boat performance e g vacanti 2005 however these computations also allow an indirect explanation of the general rule of handicap estimation for races involving yachts of different classes which statistically quantifies the advantage of boats with longer appendages wolstenholme 2009 downwind as expected no minimum is observed in the curves pertaining to the downwind leg fig 5 b this is reasonable since there is no need for compensating leeway when sailing leeward in fact a higher γ angle increases the v m g see fig 15 in appendix b as a matter of fact the daggerboard is generally lifted up when sailing downwind on single helmed crafts as the laser radial for instance this same action is not performed on skiffs because i it would create an obstacle for the crew ii to damp excessive roll movements during the navigation accordingly on dinghies and skiffs with helmsman and crew the daggerboard remains in position also during the downwind leg overall when the upwind and downwind times are summed together the minimum is identified at lower values with respect to the windward curves compare figs 5 a and b for instance for the elliptic geometries the minimum shifts from k 0 5 to 0 4 with d 0 9 m and from 0 25 to 0 2 with d 1 3 m and in analogous manner for the rectangular ones this is due to the downwind contribution which favours smaller daggerboards to reduce the drag during the leeward navigation in spite of this effect the lower impact of the downwind leg on the overall time with respect to the upwind one compare fig 5 a and b provides an explanation of the common custom of referring the design of the appendages exclusively to the windward conditions overall regarding the planform shape by comparing the upwind and most importantly the overall performance fig 5 a and c of rectangular and elliptic geometries it can be observed that the minimum timing values are approximately equals for foils with the same draft however for rectangular daggerboards the k o p t occurs at lower values with respect to the elliptic ones and the curves are steeper at higher c r d both are direct consequences of simple geometry indeed the surface of a rectangular foil is 27 higher with respect to an elliptic geometry with the same semi span d crepaz 1986 p 205 thus providing the same lifting capability at a lower c l with the lower losses related but also with higher friction drag the effect of this increase in the friction drag is well visible in the plot referring to the downwind leg fig 5 b where the rectangular geometries evidently require higher racing times with respect to the elliptic ones with equal d it can also be observed that the longer the daggerboard draft the narrower becomes the range around the optimum k ratio in particular for the rectangular foil whereas the elliptic one shows less steep gradients as anticipated this translates into an important advantage when selecting an elliptical planform since it makes the identification of the k o p t less critical with respect to rectangular ones although trower 1992 reports that elliptic planforms are numerous among dinghies some designers seems to be favouring different fashions see fig 14 in appendix overall the relative advantage of longer geometries with respect to shorter ones reduces with the increase of d compare the differences between the elliptic curves at d 0 9 1 1 and 1 3 in figs 5 a and c this suggests that an excessive elongation of the daggerboard would end into producing negligible gains although it is likely that other aspects structural stability or maximum depth allowed will play a major role in limiting the maximum draft it seems fair mentioning that d was chosen as independent variable because the maximum draft is a typical constraint in daggerboard design both to limit the maximum depth to avoid hitting the ground when approaching the beach harbour and for structural reasons indeed the daggerboard behaves like a cantilevered beam and too long geometries might experience excessive stresses in case of capsizing when the crew jumps on it to bring up back the boat in vertical position this argument is further developed in section 4 in support of the reader who is willing to re construct the vpp algorithm using the equations reported in appendix b the numerical results pertaining to the rectangular daggerboard d 1 3 m and k 0 4 derived from the first second and final computations are reported in table 9 the method can certainly be used considering different environmental conditions with this regard it was applied to the same 4 6 skiff but with tws 4 and 6 m s respectively and different wave systems the results are reported in fig 17 in appendix b for d 1 3 m rectangular and elliptic foils showing analogous trends with respect to those of fig 5 however it is here remarked that being aware of the relation between wind and sea conditions i e the wave system created by a certain wind speed is fundamental to obtain representative indications for the targeted race field at last although applied here to a windward leeward race the method could be also applied to different routes if a different regatta scheme is involved in that case the computation will include additional legs abeam for instance and the identification of the optimum geometry will take into account the related times as well 3 2 comparison with xflr5 for the upwind data as first verification it was deemed important verifying the vpp polar prediction capability for the foils at different reynolds accordingly the daggerboard upwind results pertaining to different k ratios have been compared with data obtained from xflr5 analyses on analogous geometries the comparison has been performed on upwind cases only being the downwind ones more trivial due to the higher boat speeds i e higher re and the lower angles of attack involved at first the polar prediction capability of xflr5 has been preventively verified against experimental data this was retained necessary because of the relatively low reynolds numbers typical of small yachts appendages 3 2 1 xflr5 validation xflr5 is an open source program for the design and analysis of sailplane models based on the well known xfoil software drela 1989 this is a panel code that integrates a solver of the euler equations for the inviscid flow with a two equations integral boundary layer formulation and a transition model drela and giles 1987 a detailed description of both xfoil and xflr5 can be found in the related literature deperrois 2009 drela 1989 drela and giles 1987 it was deemed important assessing the polar prediction capability of xflr5 at low re and the possible tuning of some simulation parameters however experimental data of wings within the range 5 1 0 5 r e 3 1 0 6 are not numerous in the available literature with this regard we referred to the tests presented in the naca report tinling and kolk 1951 on two backswept geometries the characteristics of which are reported in table 3 together with the setting up parameters of the xflr5 analyses in fig 6 the results of the xflr5 analyses solid lines are compared with the experimental data dotted lines with markers in terms of c l α c d c l and c l c d α in general a better agreement between simulations and experimental data is observable for the wing with ar 5 with respect to the ar 10 one moreover a satisfactory match is visible for both geometries at low angles of attack 2 but with an increasing divergence at higher angles in particular it can be observed see fig 6 a that the slope of the experimental lift coefficient curves decreases with increasing values of the angle of attack diverging from the linear behaviour shown by the numerical analyses this behaviour is more evident for the wing with ar 10 with respect to the ar 5 one and is ascribable primarily to the stall of the outer portions of the wings typical of geometries with relevant sweep back angles and to a minor extent to small distortions of the wing models because of torsion and bending during the tests both phenomena are typical of highly sweptback wings tinling and kolk 1951 and they cannot be predicted by the xflr5 code nonetheless this is of little importance within the scope of this work as racing daggerboards normally neither feature such large sweep back angles nor they are usually designed to work at angles of attack leeway 6 focusing on the comparison at lift coefficients c l 0 4 a good matching is observable between numerical and experimental data in terms of c l c d curves thus indicating a good prediction also of the viscous drag on the other hand a certain disagreement is observable at the edge of the laminar bucket c l 0 23 where xflr5 overestimates the c d of the wing with ar 10 35 while it slightly underestimates 13 the same parameter for the wing with ar 5 this is the reason of the marked difference between the peak values of the c l c d curves fig 6 c for the wing with ar 10 while those with ar 5 show an acceptable agreement in general this is still considered a fair agreement between experiments and xflr5 simulations however to avoid the uncertainty related to laminar foils operating at the edges of the low drag buckets it was decided to use a conventional naca 0012 section within this work analyses on the two wings were repeated also at r e 4 1 0 6 providing similar comparisons whereas simulations with lower n c r i t 9 showed worse matching between the experimental and numerical data accordingly the prediction capability of the xflr5 code is considered validated within the objectives of this work 3 2 2 comparison between the computation results and xflr5 data on the same geometries elliptic and rectangular foils with drafts equal to 0 9 m and 1 3 m featuring analogous k ratios of those in the computations have been reconstructed into xflr5 the analyses were performed imposing the same boat speed and lift resulting from the computations thus at equal lift coefficients and reynolds numbers see table 4 by doing so the data are compared in terms of angles of attack leeway angles and drag coefficients the results are plotted in fig 7 for different k ratios around the optimum one with the numerical data pertaining to this latter reported in table 4 the computed trends are well in agreement with the results of the simulations though showing some differences in terms of values in particular the vpp results overestimate the leeway angles with respect to xflr5 and this translates also into higher drag coefficients c d focusing on figs 7 a and b it can be observed that both the elliptic and rectangular geometries show the largest difference δ γ at the lowest k ratio but with a constant reduction with increasing k values furthermore the differences are higher for the foils with d 0 9 m than the 1 3 m ones being the aspect ratios equals for the longer and shorter daggerboards in fact a r is approximately the reciprocal of k see appendix b this behaviour of δ γ cannot be explained but in terms of r e as previously mentioned indeed the reynolds number is proportional both to k and d ranging from 3 5 1 0 5 at the lower k up to 1 4 1 0 6 for k 0 5 for the d 0 9 m foils therefore the differences δ γ between computation and simulations can be explained by the approximation introduced by the polynomial table 1 used to fit the experimental data describing the trend a 2 d f 2 r e for the 0012 section visible in fig 4 a it shall also be remarked that the foil section data on which the polynomial of table 1 was built are limited to a minimum r e 7 0 1 0 5 see fig 4 thus the performances below this value are extrapolated and cannot be considered reliable on the other hand neither xflr5 has been validated at such low reynolds numbers therefore a certain degree of uncertainty relies at those regimes in spite of this at higher reynolds the agreement between the results of the computations and simulations considerably improves with differences δ γ 14 and δ c d 11 see table 4 around the optimum k ratios as the differences between the computations and the results from xflr5 are higher at lower k ratios the vpp is expected to excessively penalize the geometries with low c r d thus with higher aspect ratios especially if the reynolds number falls below 7 1 0 5 as a consequence in that case the actual k o p t might result slightly displaced towards the right side of the curves nonetheless the comparison reported in fig 8 in terms of t u w computed using xflr5 and the performance parameters from the vpp for the rectangular foil with d 1 3 m and k ratios around the optimum one shows that the trends are fairly in agreement with a maximum difference of 9 2 s 1 at k 0 15 differences of this magnitude are acceptable within an engineering approach as the one proposed in this work aimed at the first sizing of the appendage if necessary further analyses can be later performed with more complex tools e g by rans simulations to identify with higher accuracy the optimum geometry 4 rudder design and final verifications when the iterations are completed and an optimum daggerboard geometry has been identified the rudder surface remains defined as well and its design can be finalized according to the indications reported in this paragraph at last some structural and stability verifications reported in the second part of the paragraph shall be done before concluding the design exercise 4 1 indications on rudder design as anticipated the rudder design shall respond to two conflicting requirements low drag during navigation as well as delaying as much as possible the stall to ensure a high range of manoeuvrability also at low speeds with this latter being the preeminent one trower 1992 fossati 2007 vacanti 2005 furthermore unlike the daggerboard which is expected to work at rather constant conditions the rudder is continuously activated to keep the route this dynamic operation further complicates a possible design based on a performance estimation similar to the daggerboard one although still in principle possible it would require a law for the expected activation of the tiller during the race actually several laws depending on the weather conditions to allow the identification of the best trade off one such a law database is not available and its assumption would risk to be erroneous in light of this we provide here information which allows the definition of the rudder design on one side and might help developing a performance estimation method also for the rear foil on the other there is a general agreement among the authors that the rudder shall be designed primarily to delay the stall to account also for an efficient navigation we suggest selecting the rudder foil section comparing the parameter c l m a x c d m i n for the different candidates the higher the better furthermore the following aspects shall be taken into account being the rudder hung on the transom it crosses the water surface therefore unlike the daggerboard there is not a solid surface acting like a symmetry plane i e no mirroring concept accordingly the aspect ratio a r r of the rudder during navigation shall not be doubled as the daggerboard one this aspect complicates also the numerical simulations on the appendage combinations since only one of the two foils can be mirrored introducing the necessity of particular precautions on the domain definition and on the boundary conditions furthermore this simultaneous operation of the rudder between two fluids causes a problem known as ventilation with the water level lowering on the suction side of the foil during steering because of the lower local pressure with a consequent reduction of the effective rudder surface some designers propose the use of fences to partly compensate this effect trower 1992 although such devices cannot cope with the following issue being placed at the very end of the craft the first underwater sections of the rudder are immersed into the hull boundary layer this low velocity region in the fluid around the foil makes part of the rudder less effective in the generation of lift the flatness of the hull surface of most dinghies and skiffs allows in first approximation to estimate the vertical extension of this region δ b l from the equation for the turbulent incompressible flow over a flat plate see anderson 2007 10 δ b l 0 37 x r e x 1 5 where r e x for the rudder is the reynolds number computed on x l w l depending on the boat speed b s the vertical extension of this low velocity region can affect a not negligible part of the rudder draft up to 8 10 cm to address both this issue and the ventilation one we suggest a reduction of the chord lengths in the upper part of the rudder see fig 9 as much as permitted by structural integrity also the daggerboard root is immersed into the hull boundary layer though for a reduced vertical extension δ b l being the distance x lower in the case of the front foil however some daggerboard and keel designs feature as well a chord reduction close to the root trower 1992 whereas in this respect vacanti 2005 suggests a sort of transition fairing although this feature seems rather difficult to apply on dinghies qualitatively the low velocity region of the hull boundary layer can be observed when some air bubbles slowly slip along the hull surface during navigation see fig 10 as already reported the rudder is placed in line behind the daggerboard thus facing dirty flow conditions characterized by the wake and the downwash of the first foil researchers from delft keuning et al 2006 proposed an equation to estimate the downwash angle due to the daggerboard as 11 φ d b 0 192 c l d b 2 a r d b therefore the angle of attack seen by the rudder could be estimated by 12 α r γ φ d b the angle of attack reduction identified by eq 12 is one of the causes of the lift decrease δ l r observed in torriani 2012 by comparing the rudder in isolated operation and in line with the daggerboard unlike the daggerboard the maximum draft is not a major constrain for the rudder which in any case is normally shorter and is not used to flip back the boat after a capsize high aspect ratios are more efficient but are more prone to stall also because of the lower reynolds numbers related to the shorter chord lengths at equal rudder surface s r without limitations on the maximum draft the elliptic planform is expected to be the most efficient one for the rudder and indeed is largely employed crepaz 1986 however it is reported trower 1992 p 111 that squaring off the rudder planform gives some warnings of an incipient stall to the helmsman this is in agreement with the different stall mechanisms of rectangular wings with respect to elliptic ones marchaj 1987 p 315 where the stall is rather uniform along the entire span instead once the rudder surface s r is obtained from the computation of section 2 and accounting for the indications above the design finalization ultimately requires the identification of the aspect ratio a r r representing the best compromise between stall delaying and navigation efficiency in lack of a mathematical method to identify this compromise we suggest referring to the benchmarking in appendix a for the selection of a range of first guess with the related advantage drawbacks to be compared one by one for instance by numerical analyses with xflr5 on the isolated rudder geometry 4 2 final verifications the identified daggerboard geometry shall comply with three final requirements i structurally it shall withstand the maximum expected stresses ii the maximum heeling moment h m must be lower than the highest achievable righting moment r m and iii the daggerboard position shall allow the balance along the yaw angle boat centering i normally the most critical loading condition for the daggerboard is in case of capsize when the crew jumps on the daggerboard to flip the boat back to the vertical position since the crew stands on the foil tip to increase as much as possible r m the maximum bending moment is b m w g d n mm thus the admissible stress σ a d m of the daggerboard structure shall be 13 σ a d m b m i y m a x mpa where i mm4 is the moment of inertia of the foil section and y m a x mm is the distance between the daggerboard axis along the centroids of the sections and the point of maximum thickness on the root cross section assuming a crew weight w 80 90 kg standing on the daggerboard tip normally makes unnecessary repeating the verification also for the distributed lifting load during navigation ii since dinghies and skiffs do not have a bulb that provides ballast the crew and the helmsman shall ensure the necessary righting moment moving their own weight on the deck and in case using the trapezes in theory an excessively long daggerboard might shift the centre of hydrodynamic efforts so deeply to induce an excessive heeling moment h m with respect to the maximum achievable righting moment r m m a x see fig 11 a accordingly it shall be verified that at the maximum boat speed expected 14 r m m a x l d b z d b f s z s where l d b is the daggerboard lift while z d b and z s are the vertical positions of the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic sail centres see trower 1992 for practical ways to identify these positions with respect to an arbitrary plane of reference the waterline for instance since l d b f s eq 14 becomes 15 r m m a x l d b z d b z s the maximum righting moment r m m a x depends on the characteristics of each boat the maximum width the inclusion of lateral wings the use of trapezes etc thus it is here left in a generic form with its derivation being trivial given the boat specifications iii the boat balance along the yaw has to be targeted during the upwind conditions corresponding to the expected t w s since the beam wind and leeward courses are less demanding to control the craft we follow here the approach proposed by trower 1992 p 120 who suggests that a good balance for a dinghy is achieved placing the sail overall centroid a small distance ahead 5 of the l w l also named lead of the underwater centroid this latter being identified omitting the rudder fig 11 b this is a customary approach and other designers prefer including the rudder as well although this would change the amount of lead recommended to achieve the proper balance it shall be remarked that the optimum design deriving from the vpp computation might not comply with the previous verifications for instance depending on the materials and manufacturing methods employed the maximum stresses might exceed σ a d m if a foil section with insufficient thickness e g 6 of the chord length is used at the daggerboard root accordingly these final checks are always needed before finalizing the design task 5 discussions in spite of the satisfactory indications provided by the comparison with xflr5 this cannot be considered a validation of the entire method indeed a definitive verification would not consider the daggerboard performance alone rather it would assess the behaviour of the entire system sailboat appendages in terms of boat speed and leeway angle to compute the vmg systematically varying the daggerboard draft c r d ratio and planform shape for given wind and marine conditions although in principle possible such validation requires demanding means as a towing tank which are beyond authors possibilities consequently this design method cannot be deemed entirely verified we are aware that this might be considered a weak point of the paper however the structure the physical concepts and models implemented in the procedure have a general validity independently of the experimental validation which could be done on different small sailboats than the one considered here the authors would appreciate and technically support whoever with such possibilities might be interested into addressing such work of validation some further comments on specific design aspects such as the foil section identification and the sweep angle are lastly reported the reader will have likely noted that the performance evaluation procedure relies on assuming the foil section for both the daggerboard and the rudder different sections can be compared by changing the polynomials which describes the aerofoil performance with r e and repeating the computations nonetheless it is deemed important ranking the best candidates in a paragraph dedicated to the topic 5 1 foil section the identification of the appropriate foil sections is a difficult design decision among the numerous options available trower 1992 several families that can be used for the daggerboard and the rudder are suggested in the literature see for instance larsson and eliasson 2007 trower 1992 fossati 2007 vacanti 2005 a deep analysis of the characteristics related to the different sections is rather complex and beyond the scope of this work however seeking for quantitative criteria to identify the best candidates the formulas of table 5 are suggested some iterations are needed for the daggerboard criterion as a first run of the computation with an arbitrary selected section shall be performed to obtain a first estimation of t u w t d w and t t o t it shall be remarked that c l c d in table 5 shall be taken at the angle of attack α 0 seen by the foil section i e the angle of attack of the wing reduced by the effect of the induced velocity see p 132 glauert 1983 resulting from the computation the application of the criteria of table 5 to a range of candidates allows the identification of the section which maximizes the parameters as shown in fig 12 for the naca 4 digit family with different thicknesses in particular fig 12 a shows that thinner sections should be preferred for the daggerboard if feasible from a structural point of view and if the design angle of attack presents a reasonable margin from stall on the other hand fig 12 b shows that the 12 thick foil section provides the best trade off between maximum lift capability and minimum drag for the rudder as previously reported some authors trower 1992 fossati 2007 vacanti 2005 suggest that the stall delaying capability should be the major design driver for the rudder accordingly sections with relatively thin leading edges as the naca 6 series for instance should be discarded in favour of families with a thicker front as the naca 4 digit family with this regard the higher c l m a x capability of the 0012 section is evident when compared to the 64012 one at any reynolds number see fig 4 c of course all the parameters included in table 5 change according to re however preliminary indications suggest that the identification of the foil sections according to these criteria is affected to a minor extent by r e within the typical ranges of sailing foils i e the section maximizing the formulas in table 5 is the same at different reynolds numbers further investigations are needed however and the application of the criteria at the extremes of the expected range of r e is recommended for verification the surface finishing shall be as smooth as possible although polishing or waxing is useless in terms of performance differences with respect to well sanded surfaces according to stivers et al 1945 in table 6 measurements of surface roughness along the chord direction for two daggerboards manufactured for the 1001vela competition and treated with different coatings are reported the data clearly show the superiority in terms of surface finishing of the painting with respect to the sole gel coat a drawback of the method is that the aerofoil polars at several reynolds are required and these are available from experimental data for a limited number of sections see e g jacobs and sherman 1937 loftin jr and smith 1949 ferris et al 1987 in lack of these the section polars can be obtained from xflr5 with the possibility of integrating an automatic polar prediction in the iterative loop of fig 3 as done in carolus and starzmann 2011 for instance particular care shall be taken however especially with respect to c l m a x estimated values and a preliminary validation against experimental data on similar sections is always recommended at last it shall be notified that the generalized polar concept developed by jacobs and sherman 1937 is precedent to the development of laminar foils thus it cannot account for the sudden performance variation occurring outside the edge of the low drag bucket this should not represent an issue for laminar foils with a sufficient bucket extension 3 if the optimum planforms identified by the computations of section 2 work at leeway angles γ 3 otherwise the drag coefficient c d of laminar sections would be underestimated for operations outside the low drag bucket but the use of laminar geometries loses of sense in this latter case 5 2 sweep angle although the procedure allows to include the effect of the sweep angle λ into the daggerboard performance see eqs 24 in appendix b the analysis has been limited so far only to foils with straight planforms it is nonetheless important addressing a specific paragraph to the vexed argument of the effects of the sweep on foil performance in light of the fact that several daggerboards and rudders feature backswept geometries both for rectangular elliptic and tapered planforms see fig 14 among the authors the indications are rather in contrast larsson and eliasson 2007 p 109 and marchaj 1987 p 348 indicate that the sweep angle is used to obtain nearly elliptic force distributions and thus induced drag with tapered foils these authors indicate a relation λ f λ to identify the optimum sweep angle for a given taper ratio in particular for taper ratios λ 0 45 0 5 which is the tapered geometry with closer performance to the elliptic one see p 110 larsson and eliasson 2007 the sweep angle is zero this appears in agreement with the indications from brewer 1981 who suggests sweepback angles reducing down to nearly zero with the increase of the aspect ratio a r of the opposite vision appears vacanti 2005 who claims that λ is the most important parameter to increase the upwind characteristics of a keel and provides the following equation reported also in scholz et al 2007 to compute the lift curve slope of a swept foil 16 c l α 2 π a r 2 a r k v 2 1 t a n λ 50 2 4 where λ 50 is the sweep angle of the positions at mid chord k v is a scale factor 1 1 vacanti 2005 does not provide an explanation of the scale factor k v which divides the aspect ratio a r at the denominator of eq 16 though reporting a value rather close to one 1 003 in scholz et al 2007 the same factor is defined as k v c l α 2 π 1 m a 2 where m a is the mach number although claiming that some authors use k v 1 and t a n λ 50 t a n λ 4 a r 1 λ 2 1 λ eq 16 resembles the form of eq 24 by kuchemann 1978 reported in appendix b for rectangular foils where a 2 d 2 π in the thin aerofoil theory anderson 2007 2 2 both eqs 16 and 24 assume a linear lift curve slope thus not taking into account the non linear behaviour at larger angles of attack shown by highly swept wings as those tested in tinling and kolk 1951 unlike eq 24 however eq 16 identifies the highest lift curve slope c l α at sweep angles λ higher than zero for tapered wings see fig 13 and generally around 15 according to vacanti also marchaj although admitting that the inclusion of swept keels daggerboards might be due to aesthetic reasons rather than to increase the foil efficiency marchaj 1987 p 340 in a caption at p 349 claims that for moderately tapered geometries the highest c l α occurs with sweptback foils rather than straight ones on the other hand the same author also presents experimental plots of c l versus α for three rectangular geometries with a r 6 and λ to 0 20 and 20 the geometry featuring the highest c l α is still the straight one in agreement with the indications provided by eq 24 in this somehow confusing scenario we compared the trends resulting from eqs 16 and 24 with the lift curve slopes of tapered and rectangular foils with different sweep angles as obtained from xflr5 in particular we analysed the cases of rectangular foils with ar 6 67 and again the two tapered geometries with ar 5 14 λ 0 713 and ar 10 07 λ 0 500 from the naca report tinling and kolk 1951 the results are reported in fig 13 the trend resulting from eq 24 is well in agreement with the numerical data showing a symmetric behaviour with respect to the zero sweep angle where the rectangular foil achieves the highest c l α value on the contrary the trends resulting from eq 16 do not match with the xflr5 data pertaining to the tapered wings in particular i the peak of the curves is shifted towards higher sweep angles at 21 and 11 respectively for the wing with ar 5 and the one with ar 10 whereas the results from the simulations on both tapered wings again show that the peaks occur at λ 0 and ii the maximum value provided by eq 16 is overestimated of 8 and 5 due to the use of 2 π at the numerator instead of the actual lift curve slope a 2 d corresponding to that particular reynolds in light of these indications eq 16 appears incorrect to estimate the c l α at least when used for the incompressible conditions m a 0 pertaining to sailing although a slight asymmetry is just perceivable for the data with ar 5 14 the xflr5 results of fig 13 indicate the superiority of straight foils compared to swept ones in terms of the lift curve slopes for the relatively high aspect ratios typical of the appendages of dinghies and skiffs the c l c d versus α data not reported confirmed this superiority accordingly so far the authors have not found any solid indication about possible gains of swept foils of any planform shape with respect to straight ones for the typical aspect ratios pertaining to the daggerboards of racing dinghies and skiffs as an indirect confirmation all the foils of the 1001vela race cup prototypes are straight ones according to the authors best knowledge on the other hand the sweep angle might represent a potential design solution to provide an acceptable rudder behaviour beyond the stall see p 347 marchaj 1987 as well as to shift longitudinally the hydrodynamic centre of the underwater actions in case of constraints on the positions of the daggerboard and rudder 6 conclusions an engineering method based on the fundamental equations of the fluid dynamics of sailing has been developed to provide in a rather simple way a unified comparison of the basic design choices i e basic planform shapes drafts and aspect ratios for the appendages of small racing yachts the method is based on a velocity prediction program which estimates the sum of both the upwind and downwind times during the race accounting also for the effect of the reynolds number variation of the foil performance and it can be easily implemented without requiring complex numerical tools for a given daggerboard shape and draft the procedure provides the optimum aspect ratio by identifying the c r d which minimizes the sum of the upwind and downwind times the method has been applied to the case of a 4 6 m skiff sailing with a true wind speed of 5 m s showing that an optimum trade off exists between upwind and downwind conditions identified in terms of the optimum c r d ratio which minimizes the overall racing time in general the longer the daggerboard the faster the boat in the elliptic case analysed the overall racing time is reduced of 21 5 s by increasing the draft d from 0 9 to 1 3 m decreasing the optimum c r d ratio from 0 5 to 0 25 the downwind contribution slightly shifts towards lower values the optimum c r d identified considering only the upwind leg from 0 25 to 0 2 for the elliptic foil with d 1 3 m and from 0 5 to 0 4 for d 0 9 m on the other hand the lower downwind contribution to the overall time explains why appendages are usually designed solely considering windward conditions daggerboards of equal draft but with elliptic and rectangular planforms present similar overall timing performances although at different optimum c r d values the accurate identification of this latter parameter is more critical for the rectangular geometries with respect to the elliptic ones tapered geometries with moderate taper ratios are expected to perform intermediately between the rectangular and elliptic ones the rudder design needs to respond to two conflicting requirements low drag and delaying as much as possible the stall it is sized as 15 of the lateral underwater surface hull appendages and its upper part should present a chord reduction to cope with the effects of the free water surface and of the hull boundary layer investigations have also been performed on the topic of the sweep angle λ comparing xflr5 simulations with the results obtained by equations from the literature to provide the lift curve slope of swept rectangular and tapered foils in particular eq 24 provided by kuchemann for swept rectangular foils fairly agrees with the numerical results on geometries with moderate sweep angles on the contrary eq 16 erroneously predicts the lift curve slope of tapered swept foils both in terms of the maximum c l α value and of the corresponding λ for the relatively high aspect ratios typically used on the foils of small racing yachts the data indicates that the highest c l α is achieved with straight geometries i e λ 0 both for rectangular and tapered ones credit

2d foil section at several reynolds numbers to account for the performance variations with re experimental databases for symmetric aerofoils can be obtained from the reports jacobs and sherman 1937 loftin jr and smith 1949 ferris et al 1987 otherwise for a given foil section a database of polar characteristics at different re could be built with the open source xfoil software drela 1989 this input requires the selection of specific foil sections both for the daggerboard and the rudder see section 5 1 2 the design parameters for the daggerboard shall be given as input as well in step 2 and then modified in successive computations to assess different geometries these parameters are the daggerboard draft or semi span d in m selected the range of k ratios c r d to assess during the computation and the generic planform shape e g 1 4 of ellipse all the geometrical parameters of the daggerboard surface s d b aspect ratio a r d b and chord length distribution are so defined in terms of k and d for a given planform see table 7 each computation is performed on a single value of k i and once converged it is then repeated with the k i 1 one when the computations on the entire k range are completed the results are recorded and the procedure applied again for different daggerboard drafts d and planforms for comparison the k range shall be selected so that the minimum a r d b remains higher than 4 since the equations for finite wings with relatively high aspect ratios are not representative for lower values anderson 2007 p 442 3 once the boat speed b s is imposed at the beginning of the iteration d b h is computed from the resistance curve of the bare hull which can be approximated by an interpolating polynomial for instance 4 a leeway angle γ of first guess is assumed

according to the mirroring plane concept induced by the hull larsson and eliasson 2007 crepaz 1986 marchaj 1987 8 the reynolds number is computed referring to the mean chord length of the daggerboard c m 21 r e d b ρ w b s c m μ ρ w b s k d μ where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the water it can be seen from eq 21 that for a given draft d the reynolds number r e d b is approximately proportional to the k i of that particular iteration on the other hand at equal k r e increases with d 9 for the daggerboard the lift curve slope pertaining to the selected foil section is identified according to the reynolds number 22 a 2 d f 2 r e d b with f 2 being an interpolation function fitting the data as shown in fig 4 a for the 0012 and 64012 naca sections loftin jr and smith 1949 the a 2 d parameter features important variations in the range r e 3 1 0 6 which is the range of interest for most of the appendages trower 1992 vacanti 2005 this behaviour is due to thickening of the boundary layer on the suction side of the foil section with decreasing r e a well known phenomenon in several technical disciplines as turbomachinery design see e g wallis 1961 p 71 10 the lift curve slope of the entire daggerboard a d b is computed according to the well known equations coming from the aerodynamics of wings see glauert 1983 anderson 2007 kuchemann 1978 elliptic planform 23 a e l π a r 1 π a 2

introduce an elliptic load distribution on a wing foil which is not geometrically elliptic larsson and eliasson 2007 marchaj 1987 this parameter is not needed in eq 23 tapered wings with taper ratios c r c t 0 45 0 5 show lift curve slopes almost equal to the elliptic one larsson and eliasson 2007 thus eq 23 can still be used with confidence for different taper ratios anderson anderson 1936 computes a t a p multiplying the right hand member of eq 23 by a factor f which is function of c r c t and the foil aspect ratio the plot of f c r c t a r has not been reported in this work but the reader can refer to the original freely available naca report anderson 1936 in case of need 11 the daggerboard lift coefficient c l d b required to balance the side force f s on the sails is computed as 25 c l d b f s 0 5 ρ w b s 2 s d b 12 the unviscid drag coefficient related to the induced velocity c d i is computed according to 26 c d i c l 2 π a r eq 26 is exact for elliptic planforms only although it can be applied to other planforms with a negligible error glauert 1983 p 147 the daggerboard angle of attack which is the leeway angle γ of the boat when the iterations converge is computed as 27 α 180 π c l d b a d b in addition the local angle of attack α 2 d might be needed to compute the viscous drag from the foil section polar at the specific r e α 2 d is computed by the

geometries because of the local increase of downwash see glauert 1983 marchaj 1987 accordingly for rectangular foils the angles computed with eqs 27 32 should be integrated and averaged along the entire foil semispan although a direct use of eqs 27 32 results in an acceptable approximation glauert 1983 13 if the foil section polars at different r e are not directly available the viscous drag coefficient c d can be computed according to the generalized section polar proposed by jacobs and sherman jacobs and sherman 1937 which allows an estimation of the polar of the generic section at different reynolds numbers the application to the case of symmetric sections foresees what follows the computation of the minimum drag coefficient at zero lift as 33 c d m i n c d m i n r e f r e r e f r e 0 11 where the subscript ref stands for the parameter at r e r e f 8 1 0 6 such values can be found in the report jacobs and sherman 1937 alternatively the decreasing trends of c d m i n with r e presented in fig 4 b for the naca 0012 and 64012 sections can be described by an interpolating function c d m i n f 3 r e the c d at different lift coefficients i e at different angles of attack is then computed as see fig 16 34 c d c d m i n δ c d c d m i n f 4 c l c l m a x with the function f 4 represented in fig 16 c l c l d b and both c d m i n and c l m a x taken at the corresponding r e see fig 4 and table 1 the maximum lift coefficient of different aerofoils at several reynolds can be found in jacobs and sherman 1937 or in loftin jr and smith 1949 for the 0012 and 64012 sections fig 4 c 14 the overall daggerboard drag is computed as sum of the viscous and non viscous contributions 35 c d d b c d c d i 36 d d b 1 2 ρ w c d d b b s 2 s d b 15 as anticipated the rudder is sized according to a rule of thumb suggested by trower for dinghies trower 1992 p 113 rather than according to fluid dynamics equations in particular the rudder surface s r is assumed to be equal to the 15 of the underwater lateral plane i e the lateral projection of the underwater surface s b h l a t s d b s r giving 37 s r 0 176 s b h l a t s d b the positioning of the daggerboard with respect to the rudder and the centre of force on the sails trower 1992 fossati 2007 does not affect the performance estimation nonetheless the boat centering has to be verified see section 3 to achieve the sailing balance before finalizing the foil design 16 since the rudder is sized for manoeuvring and not to contribute in resisting to leeway at this step the sailing balance i e the equilibrium between turning moments along the yaw axis of the boat is assumed to be achieved this involves that the drag of the rudder during navigation unless if used to correct the trajectory is only the viscous one around the zero lift operation 38 d r 1 2 ρ w b s 2 c d m i n s r where c d m i n is function of the reynolds number and of the foil section selected for the rudder according to the data reported in torriani 2012 the decrease of rudder drag caused by the daggerboard wake and downwash is δ d r 11 this makes the computation of d r with eq 38 an acceptable approximation even for rudders positioned in line behind the daggerboard 17 during the upwind navigation an additional drag is caused by the boat interaction with the waves naturally existing on the race field sailing windward the boat heads against the approaching waves with the bow heading up and down in a pitching motion with a slowing effect this is called added resistance in waves and its modelling is rather complex in this work the equation proposed by the researchers of delft keuning and sonnenberg 1998 and tabulated in larsson and eliasson 2007 is used 39 d a w a ρ w g l w l h 1 3 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 c 1 3 l w l k y y l w l b where a and b are two coefficients tabulated in function of wave mean period t 1 and the froude number f r for the different heading angles see p 93 larsson and eliasson 2007 g is the gravitational acceleration and k y y is the gyradius a parameter related to the moment of inertia of the boat along the transversal axis y according to larsson and eliasson larsson and eliasson 2007 p 93 taking k y y 0 25 l o a is a reasonable assumption and this appears appropriate within the scope of this work 18 at the given b s the entire drag of the hull with the appendages d t o t f b s is then computed as 40 d t o t d b h d d b d r d a w with the addition of d a w only for the upwind leg 19 finally the initially guessed boat speed value b s is verified comparing the propulsive force on the sails f p with the total drag d t o t in particular b s is increased if d t o t f p or decreased if d t o t f p until converging to a b s value such that d t o t f p at each new iteration the leeway angle previously computed returns to step 4 and it updates the computation of the velocity triangles 20 when the iterations are converged the daggerboard angle of attack α computed with eq 27 actually is the leeway angle of the boat γ 21 the velocity made good vmg is computed as 41 v m g b s c o s t w a 22 the times t u w and t d w are finally calculated for the upwind and downwind legs respectively dividing the distance between bouys l r e g for the vmg 42 t l r e g v m g and the overall time is given as sum of the two 43 t t o t t u w t d w this latter parameter is then used to identify the best appendage combination the lower the time t t o t the quicker will be the boat during the race it shall be remarked that the t values so computed do not represent actual racing times since they cannot account for i the time needed for tacking and gybing and ii the slowing action induced by the rudder activation for instance to correct the route during upwind navigation or to bring back the boat to a flat attitude in downwind conditions
