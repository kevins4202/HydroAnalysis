12720,in this study a mnceox modified tea waste biochar was successfully prepared mnceox tbc via impregnation precipitation method to activate peroxodisulfate pds to remove tetracycline tc from an aqueous solution sem xrd bet and ftir were used to characterize the modified biochar mnceox tbc pds system was highly efficient in the elimination of tc under the optimal conditions of mnceox tbc 0 8 g l 1 and pds 6 mm up to 98 41 of tc was degraded at a ph of 3 0 especially after five cycles of mnceox tbc the removal of tc was still 94 52 indicating excellent catalytic stability and reusability the quenching experiments established the major role of singlet oxygen 1o2 during the tc degradation as well as the supporting role of so4 oh and o2 further electron paramagnetic resonance epr revealed that active oxygen species including so4 oh and o2 and 1o2 participated in the reaction process the analysis of intermediate products combined with toxicity prediction indicated that the toxicities of most degradation products were weaker than those of tc these results suggested that the modification of tbc with mnceox is an effective method for pds activation to remove tc graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tea waste biochar peroxodisulfate tetracycline degradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction tetracycline tc is a commonly used antibiotic with widespread applications in aquaculture livestock and humans 1 antibiotics have been detected in environmental media due to their large scale production and consumption 2 3 tc cannot be effectively removed via traditional wastewater treatments resulting in adverse health effects and environmental contamination both directly and indirectly 4 in particular the presence of tc residues can lead to the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes args in the microbiome 5 more importantly args can be transmitted through the environment thus weakening the therapeutic effect of antibiotics on humans and animals 6 hence it is of great significance to eliminate tc from aqueous environments in ensure environmental and human health tc can be removed via adsorption advanced oxidation processes aops 7 and biodegradation 8 aops based on peroxodisulfate pds have attracted substantial attention due to their simplicity and effectiveness 9 however due to the stability of pds external energy is required to activate it to produce sulfate so4 and hydroxyl oh radicals and non radical 1o2 for the oxidation of pollutants 10 11 in general pds can be activated by light heat transition metals and carbon based materials to produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species for decontamination among the methods of activation carbon based materials are considered to be catalytically efficient for pds activation because of minimal energy consumption 12 13 biochar is a kind of carbon rich material prepared under oxygen restricted conditions and is an excellent pds activator with favourable electron transfer ability and abundant oxygenic groups 14 consequently the application of biochar for pds activation has attracted substantial attention due to its simplicity low price and environmental friendliness for example a pds system activated by sludge biochar has been used to eliminate antibiotics 15 further pine needle biochar activated pds strongly degraded of 1 4 dioxane 16 china is the largest tea producer in the world however during the tea manufacture a large amount of waste is generated which can take a long time to degrade tea contains abundant polyphenols and carbon which facilitate the excitation of pds for the degradation of antibiotics for example tea waste enables the formation of porous structures during pyrolysis with aromatic properties thus increasing the number of adsorption and catalytic active sites 17 moreover the surface of biochar contributes to the enrichment of antibiotics and pds 18 however biochar is difficult to recycle and contains a limited amount of surface active sites further limiting its promotion currently the activation of pds via transition metals is widely investigated the existence of a single electron in the electronic configuration of transition metals facilitates the gain and loss of electrons which can be used to activate pds for the production of so4 metal loading on porous materials can improve the catalytic activity and reduce the metal loss 14 19 mnceox induces numerous catalytic reactions such as oxidation of methylbenzene and methane 20 21 and the conversion decomposition of nox 22 the excellent performance of mnceox is attributed to oxygen storage release both mn and ce exhibit multi stable valence states and the redox reaction can continuously generate active sites therefore doping mn into the lattice of ceo2 increases the number of oxygen vacancies in the catalyst thereby promoting its activity 23 previous studies reported the benefits of oxygen vacancies in the low state and metal active sites e g mn2 mn3 for the generation of free radicals on catalyst surfaces 24 some studies have reported that fece oxide catalyst used in fenton like system resulted in efficient removal of organic pollutants 25 especially ce combined with uv ps system resulted in effective and rapid removal of direct red 26 in addition mnox can enter ceo2 lattice 27 28 resulting in enhanced catalytic stability mnceox is a potential catalyst for the activation of pds however a major disadvantage of metallic catalysts is their tendency to aggregate loading the metal component onto a carrier can overcome the challenge due to aggregation active hydroxyl groups oh on the surfaces are inclined to react with pollutants as well as functional groups furthermore oh can act as the bridge between s2o8 2 o2 and metal sites facilitating the activation of s2o8 2 o2 to generate so4 and o2 free radicals thus improving catalytic efficiency 29 in this study ce mn modified biochar mnceox tbc was prepared to activate pds the mnceox tbc pds system was then used for tc degradation in water solution three types of biochar namely 1 mnceox tbc 2 mnceox tbc and 3 mnceox tbc were prepared under different loading ratios of mnceox to investigate the properties of activated pds and the tc degradation rate the effects of mnceox tbc dosage pds concentration inorganic anions and initial ph of the solution were also elucidated moreover the contributing active groups were identified by quenching experiments and epr technology the mechanism of pds activated by mnceox tbc for the degradation of tc was proposed finally the intermediate products were analyzed and the toxicity was predicted 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and characterization all the agents used in this experiment are listed in table 1 the methods of characterization are described in text s1 2 2 preparation of tea waste biochar the biochar was produced from trimmed waste tea leaves the tea waste was washed with water and dried at 80 c for 12 h and then grinded and sifted through 100 mesh sieves to obtain powdered tea waste cemn modified biochar was subsequently prepared via redox precipitation by dissolving 0 025 mol cecl3 7h2o 0 01 mol kmno4 and 0 015 mol mncl2 4h2o in 100 ml ultrapure water tea powder 3 1 1 86 1 32 and 0 g was added to the three mixed metal salt solutions and stirred for 12 h respectively followed by the addition of 1 mol naoh solution and stirred until ph 11 the solution was left to stand for 2 h and subsequently centrifuged the product was cleaned with ethanol and ultrapure water 3 times consecutively and then dried at 100 c for 6 h the mnceox tbc precursor product was transferred into a tubular furnace and heated to 600 c at a rate of 5 c min under vacuum for 2 h the entire pyrolysis was carried out under vacuum conditions the obtained modified biochars were labeled as 1 mnceox tbc 2 mnceox tbc 3 mnceox tbc and mnceox 2 3 degradation tests of tc the mnceox tbc catalyst was added to 50 ml tc 10 mg l 1 solution in a brown bottle for adsorption over a 30 min period resulting in a final concentration of 0 8 g l 1 mnceox tbc then 4 mm pds was transferred into the above solution to induce the reaction in darkness a total of 3 ml of the samples were acquired every 30 min and filtered to obtain the concentrated tc after reaction 2 4 analytical methods the analysis of tc and intermediate product was performed via lc ms tsq vantage thermo fisher us using the methods described previously 30 the tc degradation exhibited first order kinetics as displayed in eq 1 1 ln l l 0 kt where l 0 and l represent the initial level and the level at time t min mg l 1 respectively and k denotes the kinetic constant min 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization tbc mnceox and mnceox tbc were characterized by xrd in order to analyze the crystal composition of mnceox tbc fig 1 a the broad peaks at 35 9 200 and 21 7 101 of tbc correspond to the graphite carbon in the biochar and amorphous carbon respectively 31 32 for mnceox the diffraction peaks of ceo2 were located at 2θ 29 0 33 6 48 1 and 56 9 33 34 while those of mnox were detected at 2θ 28 8 33 40 7 58 6 56 4 and 70 3 35 36 with the introduction of mnceox the characteristic peaks of ceox and mnox were detected for 1 mnceox tbc 2 mnceox tbc and 3 mnceox tbc moreover as the mnceox load increased the characteristic diffraction peak was enhanced indicating that mnceox was successfully loaded on the tbc the characteristic functional groups of the biochar were analyzed using ft ir spectra before and after modification fig 1 b the strong peak at 3420 cm 1 was identified in all the catalytic materials which could be attributed to isolated oh stretching vibrations 37 for mnceox the peaks at 478 cm 1 and 1614 cm 1 correspond to the mno lattice and h o h vibrations of mnox respectively 36 further the new peaks at 522 528 and 547 cm 1 in the spectra of 3 mnceox tbc 1 mnceox tbc 2 mnceox tbc respectively were attributed to the mno lattice vibration of mnox demonstrating successful doping of mnceox on the surface of biochar sem tests were performed to explore the surface morphology variations of prepared biochar pre and post modification fig 2 the tea biochar clearly displayed a typical porous structure which may contribute to the high specific surface area the surface of mnceox tbc was evenly dispersed with irregular mnceox particles fig 2 a c the surface elemental analysis of mnceox tbc indicated that the c o ce and mn elements were uniformly dispersed on the catalyst surface fig 2 d g this indicated that mnceox was successfully loaded onto the biochar bet tests were performed to detect the specific surface area ssa and pore size of mnceox tbc fig 3 the tbc and mnceox tbc were characterized by type iv isotherm with h3 and h4 hysteresis loops respectively implying that the composite catalysts exhibited irregular pore structures before and after modification in particular the pore size distribution further demonstrated the presence of an abundance of micropores and mesopores in the tbc and mnceox tbc 38 which improved the adsorption performance of the catalyst the ssa 50 079 m2 g 1 and pore volume 0 0709 cm3 g 1 of mnceox tbc were slightly lower than those of the tbc table s1 which could be attributed to blocked tbc pores by the metal oxide particles 3 2 degradation of tc by mnceox tbc induced pds activation in order to investigate the activation effect of pds by mnceox tbc we evaluated the performance of different systems following the removal of tc under an initial tc level of 10 mg l 1 pds concentration of 4 mmol l 1 mnceox tbc catalyst level of 0 8 mg l 1 and ph 6 3 after 30 min of adsorption equilibrium the degradation of tc was induced by pds in the presence of tbc mnceox 1 mnceox tbc 2 mnceox tbc and 3 mnceox tbc alone the removal rate of tc was 18 31 20 89 36 58 44 67 and 40 14 respectively therefore the introduction of mnceox enhanced the adsorption capacity of the activated materials fig 4 a similarly when pds alone was added the elimination rate of tc was 11 34 after 3 h indicating that pds alone cannot effectively remove tc the effect of mnceox content on catalytic activity was investigated under different load ratios fig 4 b the tc elimination rate by the tbc activated pds system was 81 65 whereas the removal efficiency of tc by 1 mnceox tbc pds 2 mnceox tbc pds and 3 mnceox tbc pds reached 96 46 97 75 and 97 43 respectively thus the catalytic performance of the modified tbc was reinforced by the loading of mnceox however the increase in the catalytic activity was limited by excessive loading suggesting that treatment with a specific amount of ceox improved the electron transfer however excessive levels of mnox and ceox accumulating on the tbc surface reduced the active site fig 4 c and table s2 depicted the first order kinetic parameters of tc degradation by mnceox tbc activated pds with different compound ratios the results indicate the ability of pds activated with mnceox tbc to achieve a maximum tc elimination of 97 75 with a 2 4 fold higher reaction rate compared with that of tbc pds system thus the composite catalyst mnceox tbc had an obvious effect on tc degradation which may be attributed to the enhanced electron transfer on the catalyst surface by the redox reaction between ce4 ce3 and mn4 mn2 32 ce4 loaded on fluorite e g ceo2 exhibited significant catalytic oxidation because of its excellent oxygen storage capacity the reversible transition between ce4 and ce3 states led to the conversion of gaseous oxygen into reactive chemisorbed oxygen thus improving the catalytic activity of bimetal mnce this proves that mnceox tbc was an effective activator of pds and enhanced the ability of pds to remove tc 3 3 effects of the operating parameters on tc degradation effects of mnceox tbc dosage on tc removal fig 5 a the degradation rates of tc increased gradually along with the increase of the mnceox tbc concentration the maximum removal rate of tc 97 75 occurred at the mnceox tbc level of 0 8 g l 1 mnceox tbc levels of 0 6 and 0 8 g l 1 resulted in no significant difference in tc degradation which may be explained by the high levels of mnceox tbc which provided additional active sites for pds while excess biochar depleted the pds thus resulting in the failure to improve the degradation efficiency 15 fig 5 b presents the effects of the pds dose on tc removal when the level of pds was 1 2 4 6 and 8 mm the degradation rate of tc was 85 45 96 14 97 65 97 75 and 97 74 respectively this indicates the advantages of higher concentration of pds for the production of oxidizing active substances and the degradation of tc however the reaction rate was not continuously enhanced at high pds concentrations which may be due to the exhaustion of active sites in the biochar while excessive pds can lead to self quenching 39 thus the optimum pds level in this study was selected as 6 mmol l in many advanced oxidation technologies involving pds oxidation ph is an important factor affecting the reaction 40 fig 5 c shows the effect of the initial ph value on tc elimination the elimination efficiencies of tc by the 2 mnceox tbc pds system were 98 41 97 75 96 79 94 51 and 62 79 at ph 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 and 11 0 respectively meanwhile the cod removal of the effluent was 23 5 after treatment under the optimum conditions as shown in fig s1 it is obvious that tc undergoes strong degradation in the initial ph range 3 9 and the elimination of tc is decreased significantly at the initial ph 11 as shown in fig s2 this phenomenon may be attributed to the negatively charged surface of mnceox tbc which repels the pds and tc anions electrostatically at ph 6 97 resulting in ineffective activation of pds and interaction with tc by the biochar therefore the degradation efficiency of tc under alkaline conditions is drastically reduced at ph 6 97 the surface of mnceox tbc is positively charged which can effectively activate pds to generate highly active species and bind with tc especially the adsorption of persulfate ions or the excessive consumption of so4 under strong alkaline conditions 41 thus the efficiency of tc degradation was enhanced under acidic conditions the effects of common anions cl no3 hco3 and h2po4 on tc removal under the 2 mnceox tbc pds system were investigated fig 5 d when 10 mm no3 cl h2po4 hco3 coexisted with tc at the dosage of 10 mg l 1 the elimination of tc was 96 14 95 17 94 19 and 96 46 respectively with no obvious differences compared with the control this indicates that cl h2po4 no3 and hco3 had negligible effects on the final tc removal rate 3 4 stability and reusability of catalytic material in order to prove the reusability and practicability of mnceox tbc composite materials cycling experiments were conducted to test the stability of the material after each experiment the remaining biochar was collected and rinsed with methanol and ultrapure water before vacuum drying for the next experiment as shown in fig 6 the catalytic capacity of mnceox tbc decreased from 98 41 to 94 52 after 5 cycles of testing indicating the strong stability of mnceox tbc catalyst during pds activation and was attributed to the tea polyphenols present in the tea biochar 42 moreover icp oes was used to detect ce and mn ions leached from biochar after the first cycle in the experiment the results showed that the concentrations of ce and mn ions in the solution were 0 005 and 0 628 mg l 1 respectively the ce ion concentration was substantially lower than the ec50 35 8 μm and lc50 2 03 mg l 1 proposed by the previous study 43 44 while the mn ion concentration was below the concentration limit of the pollutant discharge standard specified for municipal waste water treatment plants 2 mg l 1 3 5 possible degradation mechanisms the main active species during the degradation were determined using the quenching experiment tba meoh ffa and p bq were added as quenching agents in response to so4 oh 1o2 and o2 respectively the molar ratios of tba meoh p bq and ffa to pds were 500 1 500 1 1 4 and 1 1 respectively meoh tba and p bq had no obvious impact on the tc removal rate after the addition of the quenching agent fig 7 a however following the addition of ffa the tc removal decreased to 49 52 within 180 min compared with the control 97 75 therefore the non free radical 1o2 played a major role in the elimination of tc while so4 o2 and oh facilitated the reaction the epr method was used to detect the active species generated during the tc degradation as described in text s2 dmpo and temo were used in this experiment to capture so4 oh o2 and 1o2 a typical dmpo o2 spectrum was observed in the mnceox tbc pds system as shown in fig 7 b a strong dmpo oh signal and a weak dmpo so4 signal were also detected fig 7 c which confirms the production of o2 so4 and oh in the system in addition the addition of temp to the system yielded a typical strong triplet signal of temp 1o2 fig 7 d it was shown that 1o2 also participated in the catalytic reaction which was consistent with the quenching results xps analysis was conducted to study the composition and chemical valence states of mnceox tbc before and after reaction fig s3 and fig 8 the characteristic peak of ce was obvious at 886 ev while that of mn was detected at 640 ev 21 45 fig s3 a demonstrating the successful combination of mnceox tbc no changes were observed following the reaction fig s3 b fig 8 a b depicts the high resolution spectrogram of o1s the peaks at 529 62 531 32 and 532 25 ev corresponded to lattice oxygen olatt o2 surface chemical oxygen osur o and oh and adsorbed molecular oxygen oads h2o respectively 46 olatt accounted for 64 28 while that of olatt was 59 03 following the reaction implying that lattice oxygen may be involved in the reaction the reduced lattice oxygen may be explained by the separation of oxygen atoms in lattice oxygen to form oxygen vacancies 46 moreover the area occupied by adsorbed oads increased by 6 01 which could be related to the adsorption of oxygen atoms by oxygen vacancies the carbonyl carbon c o content decreased while the proportion of carbonyl c o area in the c1s spectrum also decreased by 11 58 fig s4 the carbonyl group c o interacts with pds to produce 1o2 47 49 therefore the reduced number of carbonyl groups may be involved in the reaction meanwhile the vibration of the c o c c peak at 1614 cm 1 was significantly attenuated after 2 mnceox tbc reaction as shown in fig s5 indicating that c o c c was involved in the degradation reaction and pds was catalyzed by the ketone functional groups to generate 1o2 however the mno lattice vibration of mnox at 478 cm 1 was also significantly weakened indicating that mn loaded on biological carbon also participated in the degradation reaction fig 8 c d presents the high resolution spectra of mn2p before and after the reaction the two main peaks at 642 ev and 654 ev corresponded to the binding energies of the spin orbits of mn2p 3 2 and mn2p 1 2 respectively spectral deconvolution of the mn2p 3 2 signal yielded mn2 mn3 and mn4 peak components with binding energies 641 77 643 12 and 646 72 ev respectively 50 51 the wide 639 651 ev range of mn2p 3 2 transition demonstrated the abundance of mn2 mn3 and mn4 constituting 70 82 of the total spectrum after the reaction the change in the corresponding mn2 mn3 and mn4 areas in the mn2p 3 2 spectrum indicated that the introduction of mn facilitated the activation of pds fig 8 e f presents the high resolution spectrum of ce3d v0 v u0 and u belonging to ce3 species and v v v u u and u belonging to ce4 species 52 following the reaction the binding energy of ce3 increased in particular the binding energy of v increased from 884 12 ev to 884 34 ev which implied the electron loss of ce3 in addition the binding energy of ce4 decreased indicating that ce4 gained electrons the percentage of ce3 was reduced from 26 81 to 22 31 these results demonstrate the electron losses by ce3 during the reaction and subsequent oxidation to ce4 the generation of the oxygen vacancy was induced by the presence of ce3 in ceo2 which enabled the diffusion of oxygen further the unique redox characteristics of ce4 ce3 enhanced the electron transfer capacity of the catalyst 53 therefore the low valence states of ce3 contributed to the activation and degradation of tc by pds the above analysis provided insight into the catalytic degradation mechanism of tc using mnceox tbc composite material combined with pds first pds and tbc were adsorbed onto the tbc surface the sp2 hybrid carbon structure and surface functional groups provided electrons to activate the pds eqs 2 3 the pds was subsequently activated by mn2 mn3 and ce3 to form so4 2 while mn2 mn3 and ce3 were oxidized to mn3 mn4 and ce4 respectively 29 eqs 4 7 mn3 and mn2 can be regenerated by gaining e in the solution eqs 8 9 e0 ce4 ce3 1 44 v and e0 mn4 mn3 0 95 v ce4 can be reduced to ce3 by mn3 in the redox reaction between ce4 ce3 and mn2 mn3 54 eq 10 the existence of ce3 demonstrated the presence of the oxygen vacancy which acted as the adsorption site for o2 to induce active chemisorption of oxygen on the catalyst surface the active metal converted the surface reactive oxygen to o2 eq 11 1o2 was generated via the recombination of o2 in addition pds was catalyzed to 1o2 by the defective sites and ketone functional groups 55 56 eqs 12 13 finally tc was degraded via a non radical 1o2 mediated degradation and oxidized into h2o co2 and intermediates eq 14 based on the mechanism presented in fig 9

intermediate product analysis the possible degradation mechanism was further explored via lc ms analysis of tc intermediates the m z of the original tc was 444 according to the results of lc ms fig s6 the experiment revealed three degradation pathways of tc fig 10 the electron rich functional groups in tc molecules such as phenolic groups aromatic rings and especially conjugated double bonds are extremely vulnerable to attack by oh 57 in route i tc was first converted to p1 m z 474 via aldolization and hydroxylation 58 followed by hydroxylation dehydroxylation and further degradation to generate p4 m z 316 p4 underwent demethylation and dehydroxylation to produce p5 m z 300 followed by addition and dehydroxylation to produce p6 m z 262 and finally ring opening and hydroxylation to yield p7 m z 218 and p8 m z 200 in route ii demethylation and amination were first performed to generate p2 m z 452 followed by dehydroxylation addition and substitution of p2 to yield p9 m z 357 59 p9 underwent ring opening hydroxylation and addition reactions to produce p10 m z 337 followed by addition oxidation and dehydroxylation to yield p7 m z 218 and p11 m z 158 60 in route iii tc underwent dehydroxylation and substitution to generate p3 m z 405 61 p3 underwent dehydroxylation deamidation and addition to yield p5 followed by further oxidation hydroxylation and ring opening to afford p12 m z 270 62 p13 m z 248 and p14 m z 180 the products obtained in the three degradation pathways were then converted to small molecules p15 m z 130 p16 m z 90 and p17 m z 62 during the course of the catalytic reaction tc was gradually oxidized to small molecules of organic matter including co2 and h2o the toxicities of tc and the intermediate products were predicted using the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t as shown in table s3 the lc50 of tc was 0 9 and 12 70 mg l 1 for fathead minnow and daphnia magna respectively which were supposed to be very toxic and harmful however the lc50 values of a great majority of tc degradation products in fathead minnow and d magna was higher than those of tc suggesting a reduction in the acute toxicity of most degradation products after reaction 4 conclusions in this work the mnceox tbc catalyst was fabricated using the impregnation precipitation method to activate pds and remove tc from an aqueous solution bet analysis showed that the ssa 50 079 m2 g 1 and pore volume 0 0709 cm3 g 1 of mnceox tbc were slightly lower than those of the tbc the maximum removal of tc was achieved up to 98 41 under the optimal conditions of mnceox tbc 0 8 g l 1 and pds 6 mm at ph 3 0 biochar not only improved the agglomeration of bimetallic oxides but also provided surface functional groups to synergistically adsorb pollutants in water and facilitate the surface oxidation of tc after 5 cycles of testing nearly 94 52 of the tc elimination rate was retained indicating the strong stability and reliability of 2 mnceox tbc the active oxygen species including so4 oh o2 and 1o2 were effective in the quenching experiments and 1o2 played a decisive role in the tc removal the toxicity of major intermediate products was lower than that of tc indicating that the modification of tbc with mnceox was an effective method of pollutant removal via pds activation credit authorship contribution statement qiuya zhang writing original draft

12720,in this study a mnceox modified tea waste biochar was successfully prepared mnceox tbc via impregnation precipitation method to activate peroxodisulfate pds to remove tetracycline tc from an aqueous solution sem xrd bet and ftir were used to characterize the modified biochar mnceox tbc pds system was highly efficient in the elimination of tc under the optimal conditions of mnceox tbc 0 8 g l 1 and pds 6 mm up to 98 41 of tc was degraded at a ph of 3 0 especially after five cycles of mnceox tbc the removal of tc was still 94 52 indicating excellent catalytic stability and reusability the quenching experiments established the major role of singlet oxygen 1o2 during the tc degradation as well as the supporting role of so4 oh and o2 further electron paramagnetic resonance epr revealed that active oxygen species including so4 oh and o2 and 1o2 participated in the reaction process the analysis of intermediate products combined with toxicity prediction indicated that the toxicities of most degradation products were weaker than those of tc these results suggested that the modification of tbc with mnceox is an effective method for pds activation to remove tc graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tea waste biochar peroxodisulfate tetracycline degradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction tetracycline tc is a commonly used antibiotic with widespread applications in aquaculture livestock and humans 1 antibiotics have been detected in environmental media due to their large scale production and consumption 2 3 tc cannot be effectively removed via traditional wastewater treatments resulting in adverse health effects and environmental contamination both directly and indirectly 4 in particular the presence of tc residues can lead to the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes args in the microbiome 5 more importantly args can be transmitted through the environment thus weakening the therapeutic effect of antibiotics on humans and animals 6 hence it is of great significance to eliminate tc from aqueous environments in ensure environmental and human health tc can be removed via adsorption advanced oxidation processes aops 7 and biodegradation 8 aops based on peroxodisulfate pds have attracted substantial attention due to their simplicity and effectiveness 9 however due to the stability of pds external energy is required to activate it to produce sulfate so4 and hydroxyl oh radicals and non radical 1o2 for the oxidation of pollutants 10 11 in general pds can be activated by light heat transition metals and carbon based materials to produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species for decontamination among the methods of activation carbon based materials are considered to be catalytically efficient for pds activation because of minimal energy consumption 12 13 biochar is a kind of carbon rich material prepared under oxygen restricted conditions and is an excellent pds activator with favourable electron transfer ability and abundant oxygenic groups 14 consequently the application of biochar for pds activation has attracted substantial attention due to its simplicity low price and environmental friendliness for example a pds system activated by sludge biochar has been used to eliminate antibiotics 15 further pine needle biochar activated pds strongly degraded of 1 4 dioxane 16 china is the largest tea producer in the world however during the tea manufacture a large amount of waste is generated which can take a long time to degrade tea contains abundant polyphenols and carbon which facilitate the excitation of pds for the degradation of antibiotics for example tea waste enables the formation of porous structures during pyrolysis with aromatic properties thus increasing the number of adsorption and catalytic active sites 17 moreover the surface of biochar contributes to the enrichment of antibiotics and pds 18 however biochar is difficult to recycle and contains a limited amount of surface active sites further limiting its promotion currently the activation of pds via transition metals is widely investigated the existence of a single electron in the electronic configuration of transition metals facilitates the gain and loss of electrons which can be used to activate pds for the production of so4 metal loading on porous materials can improve the catalytic activity and reduce the metal loss 14 19 mnceox induces numerous catalytic reactions such as oxidation of methylbenzene and methane 20 21 and the conversion decomposition of nox 22 the excellent performance of mnceox is attributed to oxygen storage release both mn and ce exhibit multi stable valence states and the redox reaction can continuously generate active sites therefore doping mn into the lattice of ceo2 increases the number of oxygen vacancies in the catalyst thereby promoting its activity 23 previous studies reported the benefits of oxygen vacancies in the low state and metal active sites e g mn2 mn3 for the generation of free radicals on catalyst surfaces 24 some studies have reported that fece oxide catalyst used in fenton like system resulted in efficient removal of organic pollutants 25 especially ce combined with uv ps system resulted in effective and rapid removal of direct red 26 in addition mnox can enter ceo2 lattice 27 28 resulting in enhanced catalytic stability mnceox is a potential catalyst for the activation of pds however a major disadvantage of metallic catalysts is their tendency to aggregate loading the metal component onto a carrier can overcome the challenge due to aggregation active hydroxyl groups oh on the surfaces are inclined to react with pollutants as well as functional groups furthermore oh can act as the bridge between s2o8 2 o2 and metal sites facilitating the activation of s2o8 2 o2 to generate so4 and o2 free radicals thus improving catalytic efficiency 29 in this study ce mn modified biochar mnceox tbc was prepared to activate pds the mnceox tbc pds system was then used for tc degradation in water solution three types of biochar namely 1 mnceox tbc 2 mnceox tbc and 3 mnceox tbc were prepared under different loading ratios of mnceox to investigate the properties of activated pds and the tc degradation rate the effects of mnceox tbc dosage pds concentration inorganic anions and initial ph of the solution were also elucidated moreover the contributing active groups were identified by quenching experiments and epr technology the mechanism of pds activated by mnceox tbc for the degradation of tc was proposed finally the intermediate products were analyzed and the toxicity was predicted 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and characterization all the agents used in this experiment are listed in table 1 the methods of characterization are described in text s1 2 2 preparation of tea waste biochar the biochar was produced from trimmed waste tea leaves the tea waste was washed with water and dried at 80 c for 12 h and then grinded and sifted through 100 mesh sieves to obtain powdered tea waste cemn modified biochar was subsequently prepared via redox precipitation by dissolving 0 025 mol cecl3 7h2o 0 01 mol kmno4 and 0 015 mol mncl2 4h2o in 100 ml ultrapure water tea powder 3 1 1 86 1 32 and 0 g was added to the three mixed metal salt solutions and stirred for 12 h respectively followed by the addition of 1 mol naoh solution and stirred until ph 11 the solution was left to stand for 2 h and subsequently centrifuged the product was cleaned with ethanol and ultrapure water 3 times consecutively and then dried at 100 c for 6 h the mnceox tbc precursor product was transferred into a tubular furnace and heated to 600 c at a rate of 5 c min under vacuum for 2 h the entire pyrolysis was carried out under vacuum conditions the obtained modified biochars were labeled as 1 mnceox tbc 2 mnceox tbc 3 mnceox tbc and mnceox 2 3 degradation tests of tc the mnceox tbc catalyst was added to 50 ml tc 10 mg l 1 solution in a brown bottle for adsorption over a 30 min period resulting in a final concentration of 0 8 g l 1 mnceox tbc then 4 mm pds was transferred into the above solution to induce the reaction in darkness a total of 3 ml of the samples were acquired every 30 min and filtered to obtain the concentrated tc after reaction 2 4 analytical methods the analysis of tc and intermediate product was performed via lc ms tsq vantage thermo fisher us using the methods described previously 30 the tc degradation exhibited first order kinetics as displayed in eq 1 1 ln l l 0 kt where l 0 and l represent the initial level and the level at time t min mg l 1 respectively and k denotes the kinetic constant min 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization tbc mnceox and mnceox tbc were characterized by xrd in order to analyze the crystal composition of mnceox tbc fig 1 a the broad peaks at 35 9 200 and 21 7 101 of tbc correspond to the graphite carbon in the biochar and amorphous carbon respectively 31 32 for mnceox the diffraction peaks of ceo2 were located at 2θ 29 0 33 6 48 1 and 56 9 33 34 while those of mnox were detected at 2θ 28 8 33 40 7 58 6 56 4 and 70 3 35 36 with the introduction of mnceox the characteristic peaks of ceox and mnox were detected for 1 mnceox tbc 2 mnceox tbc and 3 mnceox tbc moreover as the mnceox load increased the characteristic diffraction peak was enhanced indicating that mnceox was successfully loaded on the tbc the characteristic functional groups of the biochar were analyzed using ft ir spectra before and after modification fig 1 b the strong peak at 3420 cm 1 was identified in all the catalytic materials which could be attributed to isolated oh stretching vibrations 37 for mnceox the peaks at 478 cm 1 and 1614 cm 1 correspond to the mno lattice and h o h vibrations of mnox respectively 36 further the new peaks at 522 528 and 547 cm 1 in the spectra of 3 mnceox tbc 1 mnceox tbc 2 mnceox tbc respectively were attributed to the mno lattice vibration of mnox demonstrating successful doping of mnceox on the surface of biochar sem tests were performed to explore the surface morphology variations of prepared biochar pre and post modification fig 2 the tea biochar clearly displayed a typical porous structure which may contribute to the high specific surface area the surface of mnceox tbc was evenly dispersed with irregular mnceox particles fig 2 a c the surface elemental analysis of mnceox tbc indicated that the c o ce and mn elements were uniformly dispersed on the catalyst surface fig 2 d g this indicated that mnceox was successfully loaded onto the biochar bet tests were performed to detect the specific surface area ssa and pore size of mnceox tbc fig 3 the tbc and mnceox tbc were characterized by type iv isotherm with h3 and h4 hysteresis loops respectively implying that the composite catalysts exhibited irregular pore structures before and after modification in particular the pore size distribution further demonstrated the presence of an abundance of micropores and mesopores in the tbc and mnceox tbc 38 which improved the adsorption performance of the catalyst the ssa 50 079 m2 g 1 and pore volume 0 0709 cm3 g 1 of mnceox tbc were slightly lower than those of the tbc table s1 which could be attributed to blocked tbc pores by the metal oxide particles 3 2 degradation of tc by mnceox tbc induced pds activation in order to investigate the activation effect of pds by mnceox tbc we evaluated the performance of different systems following the removal of tc under an initial tc level of 10 mg l 1 pds concentration of 4 mmol l 1 mnceox tbc catalyst level of 0 8 mg l 1 and ph 6 3 after 30 min of adsorption equilibrium the degradation of tc was induced by pds in the presence of tbc mnceox 1 mnceox tbc 2 mnceox tbc and 3 mnceox tbc alone the removal rate of tc was 18 31 20 89 36 58 44 67 and 40 14 respectively therefore the introduction of mnceox enhanced the adsorption capacity of the activated materials fig 4 a similarly when pds alone was added the elimination rate of tc was 11 34 after 3 h indicating that pds alone cannot effectively remove tc the effect of mnceox content on catalytic activity was investigated under different load ratios fig 4 b the tc elimination rate by the tbc activated pds system was 81 65 whereas the removal efficiency of tc by 1 mnceox tbc pds 2 mnceox tbc pds and 3 mnceox tbc pds reached 96 46 97 75 and 97 43 respectively thus the catalytic performance of the modified tbc was reinforced by the loading of mnceox however the increase in the catalytic activity was limited by excessive loading suggesting that treatment with a specific amount of ceox improved the electron transfer however excessive levels of mnox and ceox accumulating on the tbc surface reduced the active site fig 4 c and table s2 depicted the first order kinetic parameters of tc degradation by mnceox tbc activated pds with different compound ratios the results indicate the ability of pds activated with mnceox tbc to achieve a maximum tc elimination of 97 75 with a 2 4 fold higher reaction rate compared with that of tbc pds system thus the composite catalyst mnceox tbc had an obvious effect on tc degradation which may be attributed to the enhanced electron transfer on the catalyst surface by the redox reaction between ce4 ce3 and mn4 mn2 32 ce4 loaded on fluorite e g ceo2 exhibited significant catalytic oxidation because of its excellent oxygen storage capacity the reversible transition between ce4 and ce3 states led to the conversion of gaseous oxygen into reactive chemisorbed oxygen thus improving the catalytic activity of bimetal mnce this proves that mnceox tbc was an effective activator of pds and enhanced the ability of pds to remove tc 3 3 effects of the operating parameters on tc degradation effects of mnceox tbc dosage on tc removal fig 5 a the degradation rates of tc increased gradually along with the increase of the mnceox tbc concentration the maximum removal rate of tc 97 75 occurred at the mnceox tbc level of 0 8 g l 1 mnceox tbc levels of 0 6 and 0 8 g l 1 resulted in no significant difference in tc degradation which may be explained by the high levels of mnceox tbc which provided additional active sites for pds while excess biochar depleted the pds thus resulting in the failure to improve the degradation efficiency 15 fig 5 b presents the effects of the pds dose on tc removal when the level of pds was 1 2 4 6 and 8 mm the degradation rate of tc was 85 45 96 14 97 65 97 75 and 97 74 respectively this indicates the advantages of higher concentration of pds for the production of oxidizing active substances and the degradation of tc however the reaction rate was not continuously enhanced at high pds concentrations which may be due to the exhaustion of active sites in the biochar while excessive pds can lead to self quenching 39 thus the optimum pds level in this study was selected as 6 mmol l in many advanced oxidation technologies involving pds oxidation ph is an important factor affecting the reaction 40 fig 5 c shows the effect of the initial ph value on tc elimination the elimination efficiencies of tc by the 2 mnceox tbc pds system were 98 41 97 75 96 79 94 51 and 62 79 at ph 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 and 11 0 respectively meanwhile the cod removal of the effluent was 23 5 after treatment under the optimum conditions as shown in fig s1 it is obvious that tc undergoes strong degradation in the initial ph range 3 9 and the elimination of tc is decreased significantly at the initial ph 11 as shown in fig s2 this phenomenon may be attributed to the negatively charged surface of mnceox tbc which repels the pds and tc anions electrostatically at ph 6 97 resulting in ineffective activation of pds and interaction with tc by the biochar therefore the degradation efficiency of tc under alkaline conditions is drastically reduced at ph 6 97 the surface of mnceox tbc is positively charged which can effectively activate pds to generate highly active species and bind with tc especially the adsorption of persulfate ions or the excessive consumption of so4 under strong alkaline conditions 41 thus the efficiency of tc degradation was enhanced under acidic conditions the effects of common anions cl no3 hco3 and h2po4 on tc removal under the 2 mnceox tbc pds system were investigated fig 5 d when 10 mm no3 cl h2po4 hco3 coexisted with tc at the dosage of 10 mg l 1 the elimination of tc was 96 14 95 17 94 19 and 96 46 respectively with no obvious differences compared with the control this indicates that cl h2po4 no3 and hco3 had negligible effects on the final tc removal rate 3 4 stability and reusability of catalytic material in order to prove the reusability and practicability of mnceox tbc composite materials cycling experiments were conducted to test the stability of the material after each experiment the remaining biochar was collected and rinsed with methanol and ultrapure water before vacuum drying for the next experiment as shown in fig 6 the catalytic capacity of mnceox tbc decreased from 98 41 to 94 52 after 5 cycles of testing indicating the strong stability of mnceox tbc catalyst during pds activation and was attributed to the tea polyphenols present in the tea biochar 42 moreover icp oes was used to detect ce and mn ions leached from biochar after the first cycle in the experiment the results showed that the concentrations of ce and mn ions in the solution were 0 005 and 0 628 mg l 1 respectively the ce ion concentration was substantially lower than the ec50 35 8 μm and lc50 2 03 mg l 1 proposed by the previous study 43 44 while the mn ion concentration was below the concentration limit of the pollutant discharge standard specified for municipal waste water treatment plants 2 mg l 1 3 5 possible degradation mechanisms the main active species during the degradation were determined using the quenching experiment tba meoh ffa and p bq were added as quenching agents in response to so4 oh 1o2 and o2 respectively the molar ratios of tba meoh p bq and ffa to pds were 500 1 500 1 1 4 and 1 1 respectively meoh tba and p bq had no obvious impact on the tc removal rate after the addition of the quenching agent fig 7 a however following the addition of ffa the tc removal decreased to 49 52 within 180 min compared with the control 97 75 therefore the non free radical 1o2 played a major role in the elimination of tc while so4 o2 and oh facilitated the reaction the epr method was used to detect the active species generated during the tc degradation as described in text s2 dmpo and temo were used in this experiment to capture so4 oh o2 and 1o2 a typical dmpo o2 spectrum was observed in the mnceox tbc pds system as shown in fig 7 b a strong dmpo oh signal and a weak dmpo so4 signal were also detected fig 7 c which confirms the production of o2 so4 and oh in the system in addition the addition of temp to the system yielded a typical strong triplet signal of temp 1o2 fig 7 d it was shown that 1o2 also participated in the catalytic reaction which was consistent with the quenching results xps analysis was conducted to study the composition and chemical valence states of mnceox tbc before and after reaction fig s3 and fig 8 the characteristic peak of ce was obvious at 886 ev while that of mn was detected at 640 ev 21 45 fig s3 a demonstrating the successful combination of mnceox tbc no changes were observed following the reaction fig s3 b fig 8 a b depicts the high resolution spectrogram of o1s the peaks at 529 62 531 32 and 532 25 ev corresponded to lattice oxygen olatt o2 surface chemical oxygen osur o and oh and adsorbed molecular oxygen oads h2o respectively 46 olatt accounted for 64 28 while that of olatt was 59 03 following the reaction implying that lattice oxygen may be involved in the reaction the reduced lattice oxygen may be explained by the separation of oxygen atoms in lattice oxygen to form oxygen vacancies 46 moreover the area occupied by adsorbed oads increased by 6 01 which could be related to the adsorption of oxygen atoms by oxygen vacancies the carbonyl carbon c o content decreased while the proportion of carbonyl c o area in the c1s spectrum also decreased by 11 58 fig s4 the carbonyl group c o interacts with pds to produce 1o2 47 49 therefore the reduced number of carbonyl groups may be involved in the reaction meanwhile the vibration of the c o c c peak at 1614 cm 1 was significantly attenuated after 2 mnceox tbc reaction as shown in fig s5 indicating that c o c c was involved in the degradation reaction and pds was catalyzed by the ketone functional groups to generate 1o2 however the mno lattice vibration of mnox at 478 cm 1 was also significantly weakened indicating that mn loaded on biological carbon also participated in the degradation reaction fig 8 c d presents the high resolution spectra of mn2p before and after the reaction the two main peaks at 642 ev and 654 ev corresponded to the binding energies of the spin orbits of mn2p 3 2 and mn2p 1 2 respectively spectral deconvolution of the mn2p 3 2 signal yielded mn2 mn3 and mn4 peak components with binding energies 641 77 643 12 and 646 72 ev respectively 50 51 the wide 639 651 ev range of mn2p 3 2 transition demonstrated the abundance of mn2 mn3 and mn4 constituting 70 82 of the total spectrum after the reaction the change in the corresponding mn2 mn3 and mn4 areas in the mn2p 3 2 spectrum indicated that the introduction of mn facilitated the activation of pds fig 8 e f presents the high resolution spectrum of ce3d v0 v u0 and u belonging to ce3 species and v v v u u and u belonging to ce4 species 52 following the reaction the binding energy of ce3 increased in particular the binding energy of v increased from 884 12 ev to 884 34 ev which implied the electron loss of ce3 in addition the binding energy of ce4 decreased indicating that ce4 gained electrons the percentage of ce3 was reduced from 26 81 to 22 31 these results demonstrate the electron losses by ce3 during the reaction and subsequent oxidation to ce4 the generation of the oxygen vacancy was induced by the presence of ce3 in ceo2 which enabled the diffusion of oxygen further the unique redox characteristics of ce4 ce3 enhanced the electron transfer capacity of the catalyst 53 therefore the low valence states of ce3 contributed to the activation and degradation of tc by pds the above analysis provided insight into the catalytic degradation mechanism of tc using mnceox tbc composite material combined with pds first pds and tbc were adsorbed onto the tbc surface the sp2 hybrid carbon structure and surface functional groups provided electrons to activate the pds eqs 2 3 the pds was subsequently activated by mn2 mn3 and ce3 to form so4 2 while mn2 mn3 and ce3 were oxidized to mn3 mn4 and ce4 respectively 29 eqs 4 7 mn3 and mn2 can be regenerated by gaining e in the solution eqs 8 9 e0 ce4 ce3 1 44 v and e0 mn4 mn3 0 95 v ce4 can be reduced to ce3 by mn3 in the redox reaction between ce4 ce3 and mn2 mn3 54 eq 10 the existence of ce3 demonstrated the presence of the oxygen vacancy which acted as the adsorption site for o2 to induce active chemisorption of oxygen on the catalyst surface the active metal converted the surface reactive oxygen to o2 eq 11 1o2 was generated via the recombination of o2 in addition pds was catalyzed to 1o2 by the defective sites and ketone functional groups 55 56 eqs 12 13 finally tc was degraded via a non radical 1o2 mediated degradation and oxidized into h2o co2 and intermediates eq 14 based on the mechanism presented in fig 9

intermediate product analysis the possible degradation mechanism was further explored via lc ms analysis of tc intermediates the m z of the original tc was 444 according to the results of lc ms fig s6 the experiment revealed three degradation pathways of tc fig 10 the electron rich functional groups in tc molecules such as phenolic groups aromatic rings and especially conjugated double bonds are extremely vulnerable to attack by oh 57 in route i tc was first converted to p1 m z 474 via aldolization and hydroxylation 58 followed by hydroxylation dehydroxylation and further degradation to generate p4 m z 316 p4 underwent demethylation and dehydroxylation to produce p5 m z 300 followed by addition and dehydroxylation to produce p6 m z 262 and finally ring opening and hydroxylation to yield p7 m z 218 and p8 m z 200 in route ii demethylation and amination were first performed to generate p2 m z 452 followed by dehydroxylation addition and substitution of p2 to yield p9 m z 357 59 p9 underwent ring opening hydroxylation and addition reactions to produce p10 m z 337 followed by addition oxidation and dehydroxylation to yield p7 m z 218 and p11 m z 158 60 in route iii tc underwent dehydroxylation and substitution to generate p3 m z 405 61 p3 underwent dehydroxylation deamidation and addition to yield p5 followed by further oxidation hydroxylation and ring opening to afford p12 m z 270 62 p13 m z 248 and p14 m z 180 the products obtained in the three degradation pathways were then converted to small molecules p15 m z 130 p16 m z 90 and p17 m z 62 during the course of the catalytic reaction tc was gradually oxidized to small molecules of organic matter including co2 and h2o the toxicities of tc and the intermediate products were predicted using the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t as shown in table s3 the lc50 of tc was 0 9 and 12 70 mg l 1 for fathead minnow and daphnia magna respectively which were supposed to be very toxic and harmful however the lc50 values of a great majority of tc degradation products in fathead minnow and d magna was higher than those of tc suggesting a reduction in the acute toxicity of most degradation products after reaction 4 conclusions in this work the mnceox tbc catalyst was fabricated using the impregnation precipitation method to activate pds and remove tc from an aqueous solution bet analysis showed that the ssa 50 079 m2 g 1 and pore volume 0 0709 cm3 g 1 of mnceox tbc were slightly lower than those of the tbc the maximum removal of tc was achieved up to 98 41 under the optimal conditions of mnceox tbc 0 8 g l 1 and pds 6 mm at ph 3 0 biochar not only improved the agglomeration of bimetallic oxides but also provided surface functional groups to synergistically adsorb pollutants in water and facilitate the surface oxidation of tc after 5 cycles of testing nearly 94 52 of the tc elimination rate was retained indicating the strong stability and reliability of 2 mnceox tbc the active oxygen species including so4 oh o2 and 1o2 were effective in the quenching experiments and 1o2 played a decisive role in the tc removal the toxicity of major intermediate products was lower than that of tc indicating that the modification of tbc with mnceox was an effective method of pollutant removal via pds activation credit authorship contribution statement qiuya zhang writing original draft

the optimized membrane were achieved as 196 3 lmh graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hollow fiber membrane membrane bioreactor carbon nanomaterials ultrafiltration membrane data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction today with rapid population growth and development of industries the need for new clean water resources has become a serious concern pharmaceutical chemical and textile industries are the primary sources of water pollution 1 3 hence finding and developing new methods for wastewater treatment is one of the main concerns of researchers today 4 7 membrane bioreactor mbr systems combine membrane filtration processes and conventional activated sludge cas systems and offer advantages such as higher separation efficiency less sludge production and reduced plant volume 8 9 mbr can be considered as an acceptable option for water reuse applications 10 11 membrane fouling limits widespread applications of mbr systems by reducing membrane permeability and thus increasing cost 12 13 in mbr systems three important parameters affecting the membrane fouling are operating conditions feed biomass characteristics and membrane characteristics 8 14 membranes are classified into polymeric and ceramic membranes based on the membrane materials used most commercial membranes used in mbr systems are polymeric membranes most polymeric membranes with good chemical and physical resistance are hydrophobic polysulfone psf with good resistance to harsh chemicals and high ph is one of the most commonly used membrane materials for water treatment applications the hydrophobic nature of psf makes it more prone to fouling on the other hand the excellent chemical and mechanical properties of psf make it a good choice for use in long term operation of mbr 15 18 in the membrane filtration processes membrane modification to improve membrane hydrophilicity has attracted considerable attention to reduce fouling and biofouling 19 21 various membrane modification approaches including membrane surface modification blending of polymers and embedding inorganic nanomaterials into polymer matrices have been widely used incorporating of nanomaterials into the polymeric matrices seems easier among different membrane modification techniques 22 25 antibacterial nanomaterials are divided into metal based nanomaterials au ag zno and cuo carbon nanomaterials graphene oxide go carbon nanotubes cnts nanodiamond and reduced graphene oxide r go and organic nanomaterials chitosan quaternary polyethyleneimines and lipids 26 29 go nanosheets with many attractive properties including unique 2d structure excellent mechanical and thermal properties and hydrophilic nature due to having large amount of oxygen containing functional groups including carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxy have received tremendous worldwide attention in membrane preparation for water wastewater treatment applications 30 32 membrane fouling could be overcome by preparing polymeric membranes containing go nanosheets with improved hydrophilicity 15 improved membrane hydrophilicity facilitates formation of a hydration layer on the surface of membrane and prevents the adhesion of fouling agents on the surface of membrane junaidi et al 33 reported fabrication of go polyethersulfone go pes hollow fiber hf and flat sheet membranes via phase inversion method it was found that hydrophilicity flux and antifouling behavior of the fabricated membranes enhance due to the go nanosheets presence in the membrane structure lemos et al 34 used go nanosheets to fabricate psf ultrafiltration uf membranes their results showed that incorporating go creates a hydrophilic surface layer and increases rejection of humic acid ha and bovine serum albumin bsa and also improves antifouling properties of the membrane ibrahim et al 35 reported fabrication of zwitterionic go nanohybrid psf hf membranes the obtained results demonstrated that the fabricated membranes pure water flux pwf and hydrophilicity increase due to the go nanohybrid presence in the membrane structure li et al modified go nanosheets with silver nanoparticles and embedded the ag go nanohybrid into polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes to fabricate membranes with antibacterial properties the obtained results demonstrated that antifouling behavior of the prepared ag go pvdf membranes improve significantly and the silver release rate in the ag go pvdf membranes is slower than that in the ag pvdf membranes among carbon nanomaterials go and cnts have more frequently been used in polymeric membranes fabrication however go and cnts are still considered as expensive nanomaterials due to their unscalable and complicated synthesis processes also for large scale membrane fabrication to disperse go and cnts in organic solvents and water sonication is required which is the main drawback 36 hence to improve membranes properties production and incorporation of new carbon nanomaterials with better dispersion properties and lower costs than cnts and go is significant as reported previously 37 charcoal based carbon nanomaterial charcoal cnm with excellent dispersion property go like structure and high hydrophilicity due to having large amounts of nitrogen and oxygen containing functional groups can be produced from charcoal with low cost the charcoal cnm with excellent dispersion stability could be dispersed in polar solvents without sonication in this work psf charcoal cnm nanocomposite hf membranes were prepared via phase inversion technique the effects of charcoal cnm on morphology porosity mechanical strength surface properties pwf and mbr performance of the fabricated membranes were systematically investigated 2 experimental 2 1 materials polysulfone psf kynar 761 arkema polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp sigma aldrich k30 and 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp sigma aldrich anhydrous 99 8 were used as polymer pore former and solvent respectively charcoal cnm was synthesized and characterized as reported previously 37 2 2 methods 2 2 1 hf membranes preparation to prepare the dope solution first charcoal cnm was dispersed in solvent nmp without sonication then pvp was added to the mixture and stirred for 30 min then psf was gradually added to the mixture and stirred for 8 h after that allowed to remove bubbles from the dope solution for 24 h to prepare hf membranes the wet spinning technique was used under conditions presented in table 1 water was used as bore fluid and non solvent bath the prepared hf membranes were stored for 24 h in the water bath to complete solvent non solvent exchange and finally dried the dope solutions compositions are listed in table 2 as shown in fig 1 the membrane modules consisting of 20 hfs with an effective length of 10 cm were prepared to evaluate the hf membranes performance 2 2 2 membrane characterization field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem tescan mira3 was employed to study structure of the charcoal cnm and hf membranes for cross sectional photography the membrane samples were broken in liquid n2 and finally coated with gold energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx tescan mira3 was used to investigate o and n atoms distribution on the membrane cross section water contact angle wca measurement of the prepared membranes was done by digital optical microscope dino lite am 7915mzt attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir 8400s was employed to study the functional groups of the fabricated membranes to determine surface roughness ra of the membranes atomic force microscopy afm bio afm model was used a h5k s mechanical tester at a stretching rate of 50 mm min was used to study mechanical properties of the membrane samples the membrane samples were cut into 5 cm 1 cm specimens prior to investigate their mechanical properties to minimize experimental error all characterization tests were repeated 5 times and the mean values were reported the dry wet technique was used to determine membrane porosity at first the membrane samples were soaked in isopropanol ip for 3 days and then in distilled water for 3 days the soaked membrane samples were weighed after removing the excess water from the surface of the membrane samples using filter paper the membrane samples were dried for 12 h at 60 c and the dried membrane samples were weighted the membrane porosity was calculated as follows 38 1 ε w 1 w 2 ρ w w 1 w 2 ρ w w 2 ρ ρ 100 where w1 g w2 g ε ρw g cm3 and ρp g cm3 are wet and dry weights of the membrane samples the membrane porosity and water and polymer densities respectively the porosity measurement was repeated 3 times for each membrane sample and the mean values were reported the mean

submerged mbr system with 10 l volume was used to evaluate the hf membranes performance air was fed to the mbr system using a diffuser underneath the membrane module to maintain dissolved oxygen for microorganisms at the desired level and provide continuous sludge aeration also shear stress was provided by aeration to hinder the microorganisms deposition on the hf membranes surface the module was connected to a vacuum pump to provide pressure gradient table 3 presents the mbr operational conditions compositions of the synthetic wastewater were provided in table 4 permeate flux was measured based on weight of the collected water during mbr filtration at sub critical conditions for 6 h chemical oxygen demand cod removal was calculated as follows 3 cod removal 1 cod e cod i 100 where codi and code are cod values of influent feed and effluent permeate respectively as measured by the absorbance method wastewater of dana pharmaceutical co with 1100 mg l cod was used as the mbr feed protein concentration in mbr was measured via lowry method as 6 326 mg ml to evaluate the hf membrane pure water flux lmh the hf module was mounted inside a cylindrical device equipped with a

discussion 3 1 characterization of the charcoal cnm fesem and tem images of the charcoal cnm are shown in fig 2 as can be observed the charcoal cnm has sheet like structure it should be mentioned that the charcoal cnm was characterized by different analyzes in our previous work 37 3 2 characterization of the psf charcoal cnm hf membranes to study the effect of charcoal cnm on the membrane structure fesem images of the hf membranes fabricated with different charcoal cnm contents 0 0 5 and 1 wt are illustrated in fig 3 as can be seen wall thickness and inner diameter of the prepared hf membranes with the sandwich structure are about 0 15 and 0 97 mm respectively the sandwich structure consists of a relatively sponge like middle layer surrounded by integrated finger like cavities on the both sides the sandwich structure is formed due to the contact of the polymer solution on the inner surface with the pore forming fluid which acts as strong non solvent and on the outer surface with the coagulation bath 33 41 compared to the sponge like structure the finger like structure is relatively shorter as shown in fig 3 e it is clear that in the presence of 0 5 wt of cnm the finger like cavities are extended dramatically across the cross sectional area of the membrane also in the middle layer of membrane structure the number and size of macropores increase presence of the charcoal cnm with hydrophilic nature in the polymer solution accelerate solvent and non solvent exchange and as a result finger like cavities from the both walls into the membrane grow the shorter exchange time between non solvent and solvent in the coagulation bath the faster development of finger like pores in the structure of membrane however adding 1 wt charcoal cnm to the dope solution increases the dope solution viscosity resulting in delayed solvent non solvent exchange in other words high viscosity of the dope solution acts as barrier and slows down the solvent non solvent exchange rate thereby somewhat reducing pore size and porosity of the membrane as seen in fig 3 g surface of the membrane fabricated with 1 wt cnm is denser than the others and its pores and cavities are not visible due to the sheet like shape of the charcoal cnm that is flat and well distributed on the membrane surface in other words the charcoal cnm with its sheet like shape covers pores of the membrane surface 42 44 fig 4 shows cross sectional edx mapping of the membrane fabricated with 0 5 wt charcoal cnm as can be observed the o and n atoms distribution on the membrane cross section is uniform indicating the charcoal cnm good dispersion in the structure of membrane atr ftir of the nanocomposite membrane containing 0 5 wt charcoal cnm and the neat membrane was performed to ensure presence of the cnm in the hf membrane matrix as can be observed in fig 5 a the peaks appear at wavenumbers of 690 1150 1234 1320 and 2972 cm 1 in the neat membrane spectrum are related to the psf polymer bonds as can be observed in fig 5 b some new peaks in the nanocomposite membrane spectrum apeare that can be related to the presence of charcoal cnm in the membrane structure and also spontaneous cnm migration to the surface of membrane the peaks at wavenubers of 1104 1582 1706 and 3614 cm 1 in the nanocomposite membrane spectrum are attributed to the tensile vibrations of epoxy co carbonyl cc carboxyl co and hydroxyl oh functional groups respectively that confirm the presence of charcoal cnm in the polymer matrix 37 45 49 porosity and average pore size of the prepared hf membranes with different charcoal cnm contents 0 0 5 and 1 wt are illustrated in fig 6 as seen by incorporating the charcoal cnm into the membrane structure up to 0 5 wt average pore size and porosity of the prepared hf membranes increase and beyond 0 5 wt both decrease it is worth noticing that hydrophilicity of the cnm enhances the exchange rate of solvent non solvent during the phase inversion resulting in formation of the more extensive pores which results in the more porous structure 9 49 at high cnm loading 1 wt the dope solution viscosity increases and as a result during the phase inversion the solvent and non solvent exchange rate reduces which causes the reduced pore radius and porosity of the prepared membrane besides the increased casting solution viscosity the membrane pores blockage due to the charcoal cnm agglomeration into the membrane matrix is the dominant phenomenon at the charcoal cnm content beyond 0 5 wt 10 44 49 hydrophilicity of the membrane affects its pwf and antifouling property significantly 12 hydrophilicity of the membrane surface was studied by measuring wca wca of the prepared hf membranes containing different charcoal cnm amounts 0 0 5 and 1 wt are illustrated in fig 7 as seen the prepared nanocomposite membranes have higher water uptake and smaller wca than the neat psf membrane higher hydrophilicity and water uptake of the prepared nanocomposite membranes than the neat psf membrane is related to the acidic functional groups of the cnm incorporated in the matrix of membrane by incorporation of the cnm in the matrix of membrane up to 0 5 wt wca of the prepared membranes decreases from 90 7 to 69 6 and water uptake increases from 51 8 to 84 5 which this hydrophilicity enhancement can be related to the presence of charcoal cnm with hydrophilic nature in the membrane structure and also spontaneous cnm migration to the membrane surface as demonstrated in fig 4 although wca of the nanocomposite membrane containing 1 wt cnm was achieved lower than the nanocomposite membrane containing 0 5 wt cnm its water uptake is lower that can be attributed to its lower porosity and smaller average pore size 13 15 fig 8 shows afm illustrations of the neat and nanocomposite hf membranes at scan size of 10 μm 10 μm as seen in table 5 compared to the neat psf membrane surface roughness of the nanocomposite membranes decreases due to the cnm presence in the membrane matrix spontaneous cnm migration with sheet like structure toward the surface of membrane during the phase inversion reduces surface roughness of the prepared nanocomposite membranes furthermore due to the presence of hydrophilic functional groups in the cnm structure the solvent non solvent exchange rate increases and this facilitates the cnm migration toward the surface of membrane with increasing the cnm content to 1 wt due to accumulation of the cnm on the surface of membrane the roughness of membrane surface increases to some extent however surface roughness of the prepared nanocomposite membranes is still less than that of the neat membrane 50 lower surface roughness reduces the membrane surface area exposed to proteins and therefore reduces the protein uptake and the membrane fouling soluble microbial products smps due to the shape of their chains easily sediment on roughness of the membrane surface and therefore reduce the membrane surface roughness and as a result prevent clogging and fouling phenomenon even if a cake layer of smps is formed on the surface of membrane this cake layer has a fragile bond with the nanocomposite membrane surface 50 51 pwf of the prepared neat and nanocomposite hf membranes was measures as illustrated in fig 9 generally pwf relates to surface porosity average pore size and hydrophilicity of membrane hence membranes with higher porosity and hydrophilicity are more suitable for water waste water treatment applications 15 the results showed that using the prepared nanocomposite membrane fabricated with 0 5 wt charcoal cnm the highest pwf as 196 3 lmh bar was achieved that is 2 2 times more than the measured value of 89 lmh bar for the neat psf membrane this pwf enhancement is attributed to its enhanced porosity higher hydrophilicity and larger average pore size mechanical strength of ultrafiltration membranes is crucial in their performance evaluation in the mbr systems the membrane s mechanical strength and lifespan are significant according to the feed type and different operating conditions fig 10 shows mechanical properties of the prepared neat and nanocomposite membranes each sample was stretched at speed of 50 mm min at any given moment the amount of force that the sample could withstand and the elongation length were recorded for three membrane samples as shown in fig 10 the diagram of each membrane sample at a given size is suddenly broken downward indicating the point of membrane rupture and the maximum elongation of each membrane sample the later downward fracture the higher ts and the lower brittleness of the membrane sample on the other hand the higher peak of the resulting graph for each membrane sample the greater force upon which the membrane can withstand 52 53 as shown in fig 10 the nanocomposite membrane fabricated with 0 5 wt charcoal cnm has the highest elongation at break while the nanocomposite membrane containing 1 wt charcoal cnm exhibits the lowest elongation at break by adding 0 5 wt charcoal cnm to the membrane matrix the maximum elongation occurs and percentage of elongation at the breaking point increases from 19 9 for the neat membrane to 24 4 by increasing the cnm content in the membrane structure due to accumulation and clumping of the nanomaterials in the membrane matrix the membrane elongation decreases and elongation at the breaking point reaches 19 3 at the same time the amount of force that the membrane sample can withstand increases due to uniform cnm dispersion in the polymer matrix on the other hand due to the reduced porosity of the nanocomposite membrane containing 1 wt cnm the membrane can withstand more force to some extent 44 3 3 mbr operation performance of the prepared hf membranes in the mbr system was investigated fig 11 shows the prepared membranes protein rejection and cod removal results as can be observed adding the charcoal cnm to the membrane structure improves the protein rejection and cod removal performance this performance improvement can be related to the reduced size of the membrane surface pores and the hydrophilic properties of the charcoal cnm that form hydrophilic hydration layer on the surface of membrane as seen in the fesem images fig 3 despite the increased porosity in the internal structure of the prepared nanocomposite membranes their surface is dense the reduced roughness and improved hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite membrane surface due to the presence of cnm in the membrane structure prevents the sludge from sticking to the surface of membrane and the sludge species from passing through the membrane cod removal for the neat membrane is about 81 8 which increases to 95 8 after the 0 5 wt cnm addition the highest protein rejection is also about 94 3 related to the nanocomposite membrane fabricated with 0 5 wt cnm cod removal and pwf are usually considered as measures of the mbr systems membrane performance therefore the nanocomposite membrane containing 0 5 wt cnm can be considered as the optimized membrane the treated water by the optimized membrane m1 is transparent and colorless and the results of removing contaminants show that the produced water has high quality and can be reused as shown in fig 11 fig 12 shows the time dependent flux behavior of the prepared neat and nanocomposite hf membranes as can be seen the flux decline is evident over time at the beginning of the filtration process the flux of the neat membrane decreases rapidly and this flux decline indicates the onset of severe fouling the neat membrane exhibits lower flux compared to the other nanocomposite membranes adding the cnm with hydrophilic nature to the membrane matrix improves the time dependent flux behavior of the prepared nanocomposite membranes at the beginning of the filtration process due to the high hydrophilicity the suspended components in the mbr system with their hydrophobic nature are not interested in being contacted to the membrane surface and this facilitates water passing through the membrane on the other hand adding the charcoal cnm to the membrane matrix by reducing the membrane roughness prevents sticking the suspended components in the mbr system on the surface of membrane and therefore facilitates water passing through the membrane as observed the time dependent flux behavior of the optimum membrane fabricated with 0 5 wt charcoal cnm is better than the two other membranes the essential point is that the final flux of the optimum membrane is higher than the initial flux of the other membranes 3 4 comparison with literature the performance of the optimized nanocomposite hf membrane prepared in this work and other sulfone based hf membranes containing various carbon nanomaterials in mbr systems was compared and the obtained results are presented in table 6 as can be seen the optimal membrane containing 0 5 wt charcoal cnm compared to other membranes presents desirable performance and can be used successfully in wastewater treatment by mbr 4 conclusions in summary the charcoal cnm with hydrophilic nature was used to improve the performance and surface properties of the psf uf hf membrane in mbr system the results show that with increasing the charcoal cnm content up to the optimum content of 0 5 wt in the membrane structure pwf of the prepared membrane improve in contrast beyond this pwf of the membrane is adversely affected due to agglomeration of the nanoparticles also the obtained results revealed that wca of the optimum membrane containing 0 5 wt charcoal cnm reduces to 69 6 compared to the neat psf membrane with wca of 90 7 based on fesem results with the cnm addition into the psf matrix the membrane porosity enhances and the larger finger like pores are extended to the bottom part of the membrane compared the neat psf membrane based on the afm results increasing the cnm content up to 0 5 wt reduces the membrane surface roughness the membrane samples porosity and pwf were achieved in the range of 82 91 and 89 196 3 lmh respectively that the maximum values were achieved at the charcoal cnm content of 0 5 wt the highest protein rejection and cod removal were achieved for the optimized membrane containing 0 5 wt cnm about 94 3 and 95 8 respectively the obtained results of this study

data will be made available on request 1 introduction today with rapid population growth and development of industries the need for new clean water resources has become a serious concern pharmaceutical chemical and textile industries are the primary sources of water pollution 1 3 hence finding and developing new methods for wastewater treatment is one of the main concerns of researchers today 4 7 membrane bioreactor mbr systems combine membrane filtration processes and conventional activated sludge cas systems and offer advantages such as higher separation efficiency less sludge production and reduced plant volume 8 9 mbr can be considered as an acceptable option for water reuse applications 10 11 membrane fouling limits widespread applications of mbr systems by reducing membrane permeability and thus increasing cost 12 13 in mbr systems three important parameters affecting the membrane fouling are operating conditions feed biomass characteristics and membrane characteristics 8 14 membranes are classified into polymeric and ceramic membranes based on the membrane materials used most commercial membranes used in mbr systems are polymeric membranes most polymeric membranes with good chemical and physical resistance are hydrophobic polysulfone psf with good resistance to harsh chemicals and high ph is one of the most commonly used membrane materials for water treatment applications the hydrophobic nature of psf makes it more prone to fouling on the other hand the excellent chemical and mechanical properties of psf make it a good choice for use in long term operation of mbr 15 18 in the membrane filtration processes membrane modification to improve membrane hydrophilicity has attracted considerable attention to reduce fouling and biofouling 19 21 various membrane modification approaches including membrane surface modification blending of polymers and embedding inorganic nanomaterials into polymer matrices have been widely used incorporating of nanomaterials into the polymeric matrices seems easier among different membrane modification techniques 22 25 antibacterial nanomaterials are divided into metal based nanomaterials au ag zno and cuo carbon nanomaterials graphene oxide go carbon nanotubes cnts nanodiamond and reduced graphene oxide r go and organic nanomaterials chitosan quaternary polyethyleneimines and lipids 26 29 go nanosheets with many attractive properties including unique 2d structure excellent mechanical and thermal properties and hydrophilic nature due to having large amount of oxygen containing functional groups including carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxy have received tremendous worldwide attention in membrane preparation for water wastewater treatment applications 30 32 membrane fouling could be overcome by preparing polymeric membranes containing go nanosheets with improved hydrophilicity 15 improved membrane hydrophilicity facilitates formation of a hydration layer on the surface of membrane and prevents the adhesion of fouling agents on the surface of membrane junaidi et al 33 reported fabrication of go polyethersulfone go pes hollow fiber hf and flat sheet membranes via phase inversion method it was found that hydrophilicity flux and antifouling behavior of the fabricated membranes enhance due to the go nanosheets presence in the membrane structure lemos et al 34 used go nanosheets to fabricate psf ultrafiltration uf membranes their results showed that incorporating go creates a hydrophilic surface layer and increases rejection of humic acid ha and bovine serum albumin bsa and also improves antifouling properties of the membrane ibrahim et al 35 reported fabrication of zwitterionic go nanohybrid psf hf membranes the obtained results demonstrated that the fabricated membranes pure water flux pwf and hydrophilicity increase due to the go nanohybrid presence in the membrane structure li et al modified go nanosheets with silver nanoparticles and embedded the ag go nanohybrid into polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes to fabricate membranes with antibacterial properties the obtained results demonstrated that antifouling behavior of the prepared ag go pvdf membranes improve significantly and the silver release rate in the ag go pvdf membranes is slower than that in the ag pvdf membranes among carbon nanomaterials go and cnts have more frequently been used in polymeric membranes fabrication however go and cnts are still considered as expensive nanomaterials due to their unscalable and complicated synthesis processes also for large scale membrane fabrication to disperse go and cnts in organic solvents and water sonication is required which is the main drawback 36 hence to improve membranes properties production and incorporation of new carbon nanomaterials with better dispersion properties and lower costs than cnts and go is significant as reported previously 37 charcoal based carbon nanomaterial charcoal cnm with excellent dispersion property go like structure and high hydrophilicity due to having large amounts of nitrogen and oxygen containing functional groups can be produced from charcoal with low cost the charcoal cnm with excellent dispersion stability could be dispersed in polar solvents without sonication in this work psf charcoal cnm nanocomposite hf membranes were prepared via phase inversion technique the

charcoal cnm was synthesized and characterized as reported previously 37 2 2 methods 2 2 1 hf membranes preparation to prepare the dope solution first charcoal cnm was dispersed in solvent nmp without sonication then pvp was added to the mixture and stirred for 30 min then psf was gradually added to the mixture and stirred for 8 h after that allowed to remove bubbles from the dope solution for 24 h

mean values were reported the dry wet technique was used to determine membrane porosity at first the membrane samples were soaked in isopropanol ip for 3 days and then in distilled water for 3 days the soaked membrane samples were weighed after removing the excess water from the surface of the membrane samples using filter paper the membrane samples were dried for 12 h at 60 c and the dried

hf membranes as can be seen the flux decline is evident over time at the beginning of the filtration process the flux of the neat membrane decreases rapidly and this flux decline indicates the onset of severe fouling the neat membrane exhibits lower flux compared to the other nanocomposite membranes adding the cnm with hydrophilic nature to the membrane matrix improves the time dependent flux behavior of the prepared nanocomposite membranes at the beginning of the filtration process due to the high hydrophilicity the suspended components in the mbr system with their hydrophobic nature are not interested in being contacted to the membrane surface and this facilitates water passing through the membrane on the other hand adding the charcoal cnm to the membrane matrix by reducing the membrane roughness prevents sticking the suspended components in the mbr system on the surface of membrane and therefore facilitates water passing through the membrane as observed the time dependent flux behavior of the optimum membrane fabricated with 0 5 wt charcoal cnm is better than the two other membranes the essential point is that the final flux of the optimum membrane is higher than the initial flux of the other membranes 3 4 comparison with literature the performance of the optimized nanocomposite hf membrane prepared in this work and other sulfone based hf membranes containing various carbon nanomaterials in mbr systems was compared and the obtained results are presented in table 6 as can be seen the optimal membrane containing 0 5 wt charcoal cnm compared to other membranes presents desirable performance and can be used successfully in wastewater treatment by mbr 4 conclusions in summary the charcoal cnm with hydrophilic nature was used to improve the performance and surface properties of the psf uf hf membrane in mbr system the results show that with increasing the charcoal cnm content up to the optimum content of 0 5 wt in the membrane structure pwf of the prepared membrane improve in contrast beyond this pwf of the membrane is adversely affected due to agglomeration of the nanoparticles also the obtained results revealed that wca of the optimum membrane containing 0 5 wt charcoal cnm reduces to 69 6 compared to the neat psf membrane with wca of 90 7 based on fesem results with the cnm addition into the psf matrix the membrane porosity enhances and the larger finger like pores are extended to the bottom part of the membrane compared the neat psf membrane based on the afm results increasing the cnm content up to 0 5 wt reduces the membrane surface roughness the membrane samples porosity and pwf were achieved in the range of 82 91 and 89 196 3 lmh respectively that the maximum values were achieved at the charcoal cnm content of 0 5 wt the highest protein rejection and cod removal were achieved for the optimized membrane containing 0 5 wt cnm about 94 3 and 95 8 respectively the obtained results of this study revealed that the charcoal psf nanocomposite membrane fabricated in this work can be used in mbr system for wastewater treatment applications successfully declaration of competing interest the authors

12722,the growing adoption of biogas production from source separated organics ssos has resulted in a need for advanced treatment processes for the resulting liquid waste by products while previous studies have demonstrated the potential of using nanofiltration nf membranes to polish the outlet stream of a membrane bioreactor mbr in municipal wastewater applications there is little known about the performance of such membranes to treat the more complex multi component streams that result from the processing of ssos in this study crossflow filtration experiments with three commercial flat sheet nf membranes nfs nfx nf90 were run on two batches of mbr permeate identified as batch a and batch b which were sourced four months apart from a biogas production facility for each batch there was a remarkable difference in performance of the three nf membranes where a clear trade off between permeate quality and recovery was observed for example the nf90 membrane gave the best permeate quality but the lowest recovery interestingly the nfs permeate cod for batch b was approximately 60 lower than that for batch a it is believed that this was due to differences in the amount of ammonia between the two batches this work bridges a technical gap in the water energy nexus by demonstrating the viability of using nf technology to polish liquid waste streams from biogas production processes while also highlighting their susceptibility to variable feed conditions caused by upstream process deviations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanofiltration polishing treatment process biogas production source separated organics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the production of methane rich biogas from source separated organics ssos in an anaerobic digestion ad facility is an emerging clean tech solution that diverts organic waste away from landfills 1 2 currently there are nearly 300 ad facilities throughout canada which collectively produce approximately 6 million gigajoules of energy each year notably only nine of these facilities are equipped to process ssos despite a 50 increase in biogas facilities between 2011 and 2020 3 the on site treatment of waste in particular the spent feedstock known as digestate is a challenge for many facilities typically facilities will dewater the digestate into the respective solid and liquid fractions using process equipment such as screw presses and centrifuges 4 6 the solid fraction is used in land based applications e g as fertilizer or disposed in landfills or sometimes incinerated 7 the liquid fraction comprising up to 90 of the total mass of digestate is either hauled to a separate treatment facility or is treated on site 5 over the past 30 years membrane bioreactors mbrs have become a well established water treatment technology that requires a minimal footprint while achieving water quality effluent that is free of pathogenic microorganisms the vast majority of mbr facilities in operation treat municipal wastewater however mbr technology is seeing rapid adoption in industrial treatment applications such as for wastewaters sourced from tanneries pulp and paper production textile dyeing pharmaceutical production and landfill leachate 8 9 the application of mbrs has also been extended to treating liquid fractions of anaerobic digestate namely sourced from farm manure 10 11 in these particular mbr feed streams the high concentrations of salts natural organic matter nom and nutrients demanded the use of advanced polishing treatment processes to achieve the increasingly stringent constraints on water quality discharge 12 for example the wastewater systems effluent regulations in canada establishes national standards for deleterious substances that are known to have environmental impacts e g un ionized ammonia has a discharge limit of 1 25 mg l 13 nanofiltration nf membranes were developed as low pressure alternatives to reverse osmosis membranes inwater softening applications however they have since been adopted for a wide array of challenging applications such as the treatment of high strength industrial wastewater that contains high contaminant concentrations 14 17 previous studies have shown that a combined mbr nf process results in a better quality effluent than just an mbr for treating feeds from landfill leachate 18 20 dairy production 21 pharmaceutical production 22 and municipal wastewater facilities 23 24 these studies have shown that the addition of nf polishing greatly improves the quality of the process effluent especially for reducing cod and nom concentrations however there are two shortcomings that remain unaddressed for applying a similar treatment process for treating mbr effluents from digestate sourced from municipal ssos first the performance of nf membranes is source dependent as contaminant transport and removal is highly dependent on specific solute membrane interactions 25 26 second studies using feeds with high nom concentrations reported significant nf permeate flux declines due to membrane fouling this outcome is undesirable as it leads to higher operational costs due to the need for frequent cleaning cycles as such a fouling mitigation technique may be required to make an mbr nf process more viable the present work aims to bridge these concepts by investigating a hybrid coagulation nf process for polishing mbr permeate sourced from the liquid fraction of dewatered ad the addition of an inorganic coagulant is an effective low cost method of removing nom foulants prior to membrane filtration that has shown to improve membrane productivity flux 27 31 in order to determine the most accurate prediction of treatment performance in this application 32 samples of mbr permeate were obtained from a biogas production facility these samples had quite complex compositions see table 1 our study included the following areas of investigation 1 characterization of the mbr permeate using both bulk measurement techniques i e cod and complex analytical techniques i e lc ocd 2 high throughput screening of the effectiveness of using a commercial coagulant to remove nom 3 filtration experiments to assess membrane performance based on cod removal permeate quality and permeate recovery membrane productivity and 4 evaluation of the effect of nf feed properties by comparing the filtration performance of two batches on treatment efficacy 2 material and methods 2 1 mbr permeate sampling and characterization two batches of mbr permeate were sampled from a sso processing facility in north america briefly the process is as follows shipments of municipal sso waste are pre processed to remove any non organic material mainly plastic bags and then fed into an anerobic digestor to produce biogas the spent digestate is dewatered using a centrifuge and then the resulting liquid fraction is send to a mbr the two batches of mbr permeate were sampled four months apart with each one characterized according to the following cod was measured using a hach 8000 hr cod kit digestion method following the method provided by the supplier zeta potential was measured using a zetasizer nano za instrument malvern analytical ph and conductivity were measured using an hi5522 ph conductivity meter total organic carbon ion sodium potassium magnesium calcium and nutrient chloride sulfates ammonia nitrites and nitrates concentrations were measured by agat laboratories oakville ontario canada liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd analysis was conducted at the university of waterloo s water institute a comparison of the quality parameters of batch a 165 l that was sampled in march 2021 and batch b 60 l that was sampled in july 2021 is given in table 1 the average measurements and standard deviation errors are presented for those parameters that were measured by our team all parameters were measured in duplicate for each bucket in which the samples were received 11 buckets for batch a and 4 buckets for batch b most of the parameters were quite similar between the two batches however there were a few exceptions most notably the concentration of ammonia in batch a was nearly 300 times higher than that in batch b 2 2 high throughput and jar testing protocol an inorganic alum based coagulant pax 18 9 05 al was obtained from kemira water solutions and used to pre treat batch a in advance of the membrane filtration tests an aluminum based coagulant was selected because the optimal coagulation ph 7 5 8 0 is similar to the ph of the mbr permeate 33 34 the effect of coagulant dosage was studied using a multi point magnetic stirrer and eight lab beakers of sufficient size to accommodate 80 ml of mbr permeate coagulant concentrations ranging from 40 to 120 mg al3 l each beaker was mixed for 3 min at 300 rpm then the beaker contents were allowed to settle for 30 min previous work has shown that this small scale high throughput ht screening of coagulants provides good scalability 35 the effect of ph adjustment to 7 6 using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1m naoh was also studied a pb 700 jar tester phipps bird was used repeatedly to produce 60 l of coagulated mbr permeate as follows each jar was filled with 2 l of mbr permeate dosed with the desired amount of pax 18 and then mixed for 3 min at 300 rpm the mixture was then allowed to settle for 30 min after which the supernate was filtered using a 1 micron bag filter to remove any unsettled flocs the composition of the coagulated mbr permeate was determined using the same battery of tests described above for the as received batches of mbr permeate including compositional analysis and lc ocd analysis 2 3 membranes and filtration system rectangular coupons 140 cm2 of three commercial flat sheet polyamide nf membranes nfs synder nfx synder and nf90 dow were cut from a large sheet in order to fit in the sepa crossflow filtration cell used in this study the coupons were wetted in deionized di water prior to filtration and refrigerated when not in use the surface charge properties of the three membranes were determined using the streaming potential method of a surpass 3 electrokinetic analyzer anton paar as follows a pair of rectangular membrane samples 2 cm 1 cm was cut from the same large sheet used for the crossflow filtration studies and then attached onto the adjustable gap cell of the surpass 3 the distance between the two rectangular samples was set to 100 10 micrometers the nfs and nfx membranes were soaked in di water for 12 h prior to testing while the nf90 membrane was soaked in a 25 isopropyl alcohol solution for 1 h before testing the zeta potential measurements were performed using an electrolyte solution of 1 mm kcl which was adjusted from ph 2 to 10 using 0 05 m hcl and 0 05 m naoh solutions after each zeta potential measurement the system was rinsed twice with the electrolyte solution a schematic of the bench scale crossflow filtration system used in this study is shown in fig 1 additional details are provided in fig s1 in the supplementary material the fluid from the feed tank t01 is pressurized using a positive displacement pump p01 and fed directly into the sepa cell membrane housing m01 at a constant flow rate of 6 6 l min the transmembrane pressure tmp is calculated using eq 1 where pf bar pc bar and pp bar are the feed concentrate and permeate pressures respectively 1 p tmp bar p f p c 2 p p the tmp is controlled through a precision needle valve v04 and is manipulated to control the back pressure of m01 the concentrate stream is recycled back to the feed tank and the permeate stream is continuously withdrawn from the system through valve v05 a temperature controller in the feed tank ensured that the fluid temperature stayed in the range of 20 c a type k thermocouple gave a precise measurement of the actual fluid temperature each membrane coupon was first compacted under a tmp of 6 9 bar and flowrate of 6 6 l min for 30 min with regular tap water following the compaction step the water permeability l p l m 2 h bar was determined from an anova regression analysis of average permeate flux j l m 2 h versus tmp ranging from 4 1 to 9 6 bar via eq 2 where v l is the dispensed permeate volume t h is the time required to dispense the volume a m2 is the surface area of the membrane ptmp bar is the transmembrane pressure μ t pa s is the dynamic viscosity of water at the fluid temperature and μ 20 c pa s is the dynamic viscosity of water at 20 c 2 l p l m 2 h bar j p tmp v t a μ t μ 20 c p tmp permeate flux was calculated from timed measurements to collect 1 ml of permeate with five measurements taken at each tmp a sodium chloride nacl rejection test was also conducted on each membrane coupon as follows a 5 l nacl solution at a concentration of 2000 ppm was prepared in deionized water and the system was run with complete permeate recirculation for 30 min at 6 9 bar after which three 10 ml samples of the feed and permeate were collected the electrical conductivity was measured using a hi 5522 ph conductivity meter hanna instruments and rejection was calculated via eq 3 3 r nacl ec f ec p ec f 100 where ec f ms cm and ec p ms cm are the average electrical conductivities of the feed and permeate samples respectively the average permeabilities and the 95 confidence interval around the regression line and average salt rejection and standard deviation error for the three nanofiltration membranes used in this study are presented in table 2 the corresponding values for each individual membrane coupon used in this study is listed in table s1 in the supplementary material filtration tests with the as received and coagulated mbr permeate were conducted at a constant tmp of 6 9 bar and constant feed flow rate of 6 6 l min each experimental condition e g membrane type feed solution was tested in duplicate referred to as replicate 1 and replicate 2 in order to confirm the reproducibility of the results within an experiment the permeate was collected in a container located on top of a load cell that recorded the cumulative mass at one minute time intervals the cumulative mass data was converted to temperature corrected flux by conducting a numerical differentiation on the mass and time data sets obtained from each experiment permeate recovery for each filtration experiment was calculated via eq 4 where vfinal p l is the total permeate volume at the end of the filtration period 4 permeate recovery v final p 5 l 100 the constant pressure filtration experiments were conducted until 8 h had elapsed or 80 permeate recovery had been reached two feed and permeate samples were collected at every 20 increment of permeate recovery as well as at the end of the 8 hour filtration period the cod of the feed and permeate samples were measured using the method described in section 2 1 and percentage removal of cod was calculated via eq 5 where c f mg l and c p mg l are the feed and permeate concentrations respectively nfs and nf90 permeate samples collected from the filtration of both batches were sent to agat laboratories for compositional analysis additionally nfs and nf90 samples collected from the filtration of the as received and coagulated batch a were sent for lc ocd analysis 5 r cod c f c p c f 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of coagulation operating point via high throughput screening tests a comparison of the coagulation treatment results obtained with batch a is shown in fig 2 the measured cod and zeta potential of the supernate are shown at different coagulant dosages without ph adjustment left panel and with ph adjustment right panel as expected the zeta potential steadily increased as the coagulant dosage increased it has been previously shown that neutralization or reversal of the colloidal nom charge can result in increased cake formation on membrane surfaces due the loss of charge repulsion between the negatively charged membrane surface see table 2 and cake forming foulants 36 38 our objective was to determine the coagulant dosage that maximized nom removal while maintaining a negative solution zeta potential it was found that charge neutralization occurred between dosages of 80 mg al3 l and 85 mg al3 l in the absence of ph adjustment in a similar manner the cod of the supernate steadily decreased until charge neutralization was attained at which point it plateaued around 370 mg l as reported in a previous study with a polyaluminum chloride coagulant this suggests that charge neutralization is the dominant mechanism of coagulation 39 a visual comparison of the effect of increasing coagulant dosage is shown in fig s3 in the supplementary material as shown in fig s4 in the supplementary material it was found that the ph of the supernate decreased from 7 6 to around 4 with the addition of coagulant it is believed that this is due to the consumption of alkalinity brought about by aluminum hydroxide formation 40 interestingly a negative zeta potential was observed for each coagulant dosage after the supernate ph had been adjusted to 7 6 this is likely due to deprotonation of colloidal matter as the solution ph is increased thereby leading to a lower zeta potential 41 once again the measured cod steadily decreased up to a coagulant dosage of 90 mg al3 l after which point it remained relatively stable at around 370 mg l coagulation tests performed with the six cell jar tester were required to produce the large volumes of coagulated mbr permeate that was required for crossflow filtration experiments at the dosage of 90 mg al3 l the supernate produced in the jar test had a slightly higher zeta potential 10 3 0 1 mv than the corresponding samples from the beaker tests 4 7 2 0 mv the average cod of the 60 l of coagulated mbr permeate was 354 16 mg l which is approximately half of the corresponding value for the as received sample see table 1 in order to gain further insight into the coagulation induced changes in composition of the mbr permeate the as received and coagulated samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd this semi quantitative analytical method resolves compounds based on their molecular weight and hydrophobicity into five groups biopolymers humic substances building blocks decomposed humic substances low molecular weight lmw acids and lmw neutrals 42 an overlay of the lc ocd chromatograms for the mbr permeate and coagulated mbr permeate is shown in fig 3 peak integration was used to estimate the concentrations of biopolymers and humic substances in both the coagulated and as received mbr permeate and showed approximate removals of 80 and 90 respectively the peaks of the smaller building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals fractions were too low in concentration to accurately integrate however fig 3 shows that these fractions were only partially removed by coagulation the total organic concentration as measured via toc remaining in the coagulated mbr permeate was 84 mg l and the poor removal of the smaller nom fractions can be assumed to the primary contributors to the measured toc thus any nom fouling observed while filtering the coagulated mbr permeate can be attributed to these unremoved fractions 3 2 effect of pretreatment conditions on filtration performance as shown in fig 4 the filtration performance was first compared in terms of the permeate flux profiles obtained for di water included in our study as a control the as received mbr permeate and the coagulated mbr permeate obtained from six cell jar tests the continuous flux profile for each test condition was obtained via a numerical differentiation of the mass versus time data which was obtained through load cell measurements duplicate filtration experiments using separate membrane coupons were conducted for each membrane and feed condition thus a total of 18 independent filtration experiments are presented in fig 4 as expcted a stable flux was observed when filtering di water through all three membranes interestingly the nfs membrane gave a di water flux 41 lmh nearly double that of the nfx membrane 20 lmh despite both membranes having similar rated mwcos see table 1 yet it was found that the nf90 membrane demonstrated the highest di water flux 50 lmh which has been reported in the literature as being due to the presence of carboxylic acid and amine functional groups that facilitate water transfer via hydrogen bonding interactions 43 44 thereby making the membrane hydrophilic the nfs and nfx membranes both showed similar initial wastewater and di water fluxes however flux decline due to membrane fouling was observed with the nfs membrane whereas a relatively flat profile was observed with the nfx membrane in contrast to this despite having the highest di water flux the nf90 membrane had the lowest wastewater flux additionally the flux of the nf90 membrane decreased from 12 lmh to 8 lmh during wastewater filtration this discrepancy between the initial clean and wastewater fluxes was also observed by dolar et al 45 who reported a 53 decline in flux when changing from the filtration of di water to landfill leachate while it has been reported that the nf90 membrane has a tight pore structure 46 it is not known exactly what caused the dramatic difference in flux values it was found that pre treating the mbr permeate with coagulant did not improve the flux performance of any of the three nanofiltration membranes previous studies have shown examples of coagulation nf hybrid processes where coagulation had minimal to no impact on fouling mitigation 46 48 liang et al suggests that a higher residual al3 concentration leads to an increase in osmotic pressure on the permeate side which in turn reduces the concentration differential that drives permeation the aluminum concentration in the coagulated mbr increased from 0 2 mg l to 1 5 mg l which suggests that this phenomena is a likely cause for the lack of improvement seen in the flux performance 49 targeted nom removal via coagulation failed to improve on the permeate flux and recovery which can be explained via two possible mechanisms first there was insufficient coagulant dosing to remove smaller nom fractions building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals that still enabled nom fouling second residual amounts of al3 build up on the permeate side reduced the osmotic pressure that drives permeation the corresponding permeate recovery values for the twelve filtration experiments shown in the bottom three panels of fig 4 are given in table 3 for all three nanofiltration membranes there was no appreciable improvement to permeate recovery following coagulation of the mbr permeate due to the crossflow configuration of the system used in our study and given that the filtration experiments were conducted with the permeate stream continuously withdrawn from the system i e permeate was collected in container located on top of a load cell the properties of the feed solution changed during each filtration test as an example the results obtained for the filtration of the as received mbr permeate batch a using the nfs membrane are shown in fig 5 the data points for each filtration test correspond to samples of the feed and permeate taken at 20 increments of recovery and another set of samples taken at the end of the 8 hour filtration experiment while the feed cod increased steadily to a concentration nearly four times the initial cod of 666 mg l see table 1 the permeate cod remained constant as a result of this the cod rejection calculated using eq 5 increased with permeate recovery this trend was also observed with the nfx and nf90 membranes under both feed conditions see fig s5 in the supplementary material this result highlights the robust nature of nf membranes since vastly different permeate recoveries were obtained with each membrane removal performance was compared based on the cod measured at the end of the filtration experiment i e the highest obtained recovery after 8 h or at 80 recovery fig 6 shows the feed and permeate cod measurements obtained for the filtrations of coagulated and as received mbr permeate using each membrane similar to the flux results no improvements in removal were observed following the coagulation of the mbr permeate despite the initial feed cod being significantly lower the nf90 membrane produced the highest quality permeate while the cod measurements obtained for the nfs and nfx membranes were comparable and nearly double that of the nf90 membrane once again targeted nom removal did not improve permeate quality or the permeate recovery rates of the three membranes referring back to fig 2 it can be seen that the lc ocd chromatogram for the nf90 permeate shows the near perfect removal of all organic fractions this trend was observed for the permeates obtained from all membranes under both feed conditions which suggests that some inorganic species are not being removed by the membrane and are contributing to the measuredpermeate cod these results are in good agreement with those reported by chang et al 46 where the removal of cod obtained with a nanofiltration process was unaffected by the addition of an aluminum based coagulant the superior cod removal observed with the nf90 membrane may be attributed to its tight pore structure which is widely reported in the literature 17 the enhanced removal ascertained by the tight pore structure is however accompanied by a lower flux and greater fouling potential additionally charge effects may also explain the high rejection observed with the nf90 membrane 50 however as presented in table 2 there is no significant difference in membrane surface charge between the nfx and nf90 membranes yet the nf90 membrane produced a permeate with a much lower cod 3 3 effect of feed properties on filtration performance the filtration performance of the nf90 and nfs membranes was also determined for the second batch of mbr permeate i e batch b the nfx membrane was excluded from these tests as filtration results using batch a indicated that it offered neither the high recovery rates of the nfs membrane nor the high permeate quality produced by the nf90 membrane additionally batch b was filtered as received since we determined that pre treating with the coagulant had no effect on filtration performance fig 7 compares batches a and b with respect to flux top and cod removal bottom observed during filtration with the nfs and nf90 membranes the nf90 membrane produced very similar flux profiles during the filtration of both batches specifically very low fluxes compared to the clean water flux were observed including similar flux declines over the 8 hour filtration window this resulted in very similar permeate recoveries obtained for both batches interestingly a marginally lower flux was observed for the nfs membrane when it was used to filter batch b with recovery rates of 70 being recorded across both replicates regardless the nfs membrane displayed superior overall wastewater flux performance compared to the nf90 membrane for both batches the most striking observation pertains to cod removal where the nf90 membrane produced high quality 100 mg l permeate for both batches however the nfs membrane produced a much higher quality of permeate during the filtration of batch b 95 14 mg l than it did for the filtration of batch a 234 14 mg l the results in fig 7 are presented in alternative format in fig 8 to explicitly show the tradeoff in filtration performance here the percentage of permeate recovered by each membrane with each batch to the permeate cod concentration this graphical approach was originally developed by robeson to visualize the trade of between selectivity and permeability of polymeric membranes used for gas separation 51 it has since been used to visualize the trade off in performance metrics in other areas of membrane research such as the advancement of desalination membranes the development of electrically conductive membranes and the development of metal organic frameworks 52 54 to our knowledge this is the first time this analysis has been extended to wastewater byproducts from biogas production the plot area is divided into four quadrants with the lower right quadrant i e recovery 50 permeate cod 180 mg l representing the high quality high recovery operating region a permeate cod of 180 mg l was chosen as an analogue for typical sewer discharge limits notably for filtrations with batch a a trade off was observed between permeate recovery and the permeate cod concentration as a result none of the membranes operated in the high quality high recovery region conversely filtering batch b with the nfs membrane operated in the high quality high recovery operating region despite batch b having very similar bulk properties to batch a nf enabled the removal of 90 of toc from the permeate as observed in lc ocd results presented in fig 3 which implies that the variation in the permeate cod observed between both batches was derived from a non organic fraction in order to further investigate this batch to batch variation feed samples from both batches and permeate samples obtained from both membranes were sent to agat laboratories for a compositional analysis which provided measurements of select nutrients metals and ions as shown in fig 9 the rejection of the various species values given in table s2 in the supplementary material was compared to the stokes radius to account for both solute size and hydration shell effects the stokes radius for each solute was calculated assuming an infinite dilution using the stokes einstein equation eq 6 6 r nm k b t 6 πμd where k b kg m 2 s 2 k is the boltzmann constant t k is the solution temperature μ pa s is the solution dynamic viscosity and d m 2 s is the diffusion coefficient obtained from the crc handbook of chemistry physics 55 as shown in fig 9 the rejection of solutes by both the nf90 and nfs membranes was well correlated with their respective stokes radius values we found that solute molecular weight was a poor predictor of rejection see fig s6 in the supplementary material which has been previously reported in the literature 25 the solutes with the largest stokes radius e g magnesium had the highest rejection values additionally for those solutes with similar stokes radii e g potassium and chloride the highest rejection values were found for negatively charge solutes this observation agrees with the membrane zeta potential measurements presented in table 2 and fig s2 for each solute greater rejections were observed with the nf90 membrane as compared to the nfs membrane and thus indicates why the nf90 membrane was consistently able to produce a permeate with a lower cod concentration as shown in fig s6 in the supplementary material the same trends were observed in the filtration experiments conducted with batch b the relationship between stokes radius and rejection has been previously reported in the literature however those comparisons were based on experiments done with single component solutions or simple multi component mixtures 56 57 the results from this study show that the relationship between stokes radius and solute rejection can be extended to complex industrial wastewater mixtures the significant source of difference between the two batches was the concentration of ammonia which was significantly higher in batch a 134 mg l than batch b 0 48 mg l due to incomplete nitrification in the mbr fig 9 shows that ammonia was virtual unremoved by the nfs membrane and exhibited very low removal with the nf90 membrane although it is well known that standard cod measuring kits that use dichromate oxidizers do not oxidize ammonia it can form an interference when present in conjunction with high concentration of chloride 58 the oxidation of chloride ions into chlorine significantly affects the accurate measurement of cod but the addition of mercuric sulfate can mask chloride interference by forming mercuric chloride complexes that cannot be oxidized however in the presence of high concentrations of nitrogenous compounds the oxidation of chloride to chlorine occurs through the formation of chloroamine intermediates even in the presence of mercuric sulfate 59 thus the high permeate cod in the samples from batch a were likely due to the high concentrations of ammonia and chlorides in these samples furthermore nitrites also have a profound impact on cod which has a theoretical oxygen demand of 1 1 mg o2 l per 1 mg l of no2 60 the higher cod concentrations in the permeate produced by the nf90 membrane filtrations of batch a were likely due to the relatively better performance with respect to chloride removal offered by the nf90 membrane as observed in fig 9 4 conclusions this research assessed the ability of three commercially available flat sheet nf membranes to polish the permeate stream from a mbr that treats the liquid fraction of dewatered anaerobic digestate a by product from the conversion of municipal source separated organics into biogas batch a was subject to coagulation pre treatment whereas batch b was filtered without pre treatment intrinsic differences between the three nf membranes were evaluated and the composition of batch a resulted in a trade off observed between the volume of permeate recovered and the permeate cod concentration more permeable membranes nfs nfx demonstrated a higher permeate recovery however often at the sacrifice of permeate quality to improve membrane performance 90 mg al3 l determined through high throughput screening of an aluminum based coagulant was dosed to reduce the nom concentration despite reducing the cod concentration by nearly 50 pre coagulation failed to improve permeate quality or recovery this was hypothesized to be due to 1 the failure of the coagulant to remove smaller nom fractions building blocks lmw acids lmw neutrals and 2 a build up of residual alum that decreases the osmotic pressure needed to drive filtration filtration of batch b sampled 4 months after batch a showed a significant improvement in cod removal when filtered with the nfs membrane batch a 95 14 mg l vs batch b 234 8 mg l without sacrificing the high permeate recovery analysis of the permeate indicated high concentrations of both chlorides and nitrogenous compounds namely ammonia and nitrite the interference caused by the oxidation of chloride into chlorine is usually masked by the addition of mercuric sulfate in standard cod kits however this approach is ineffective in the presence of high levels of ammonia as the oxidation of chloride occurs through the formation of chloroamine intermediates comparing individual solute rejection to the solvated size of the solute estimated via stokes radius revealed that the nf90 was able to produce a better overall permeate quality due to its superior removal of chloride ions the high ammonia concentration in one batch of mbr permeate demonstrated the susceptibility of nf based treatment processes to up stream process e g denitrification changes and also justifies further studies to determine the full operating window for nf membranes in biogas production processes declaration of competing interest the authors

12722,the growing adoption of biogas production from source separated organics ssos has resulted in a need for advanced treatment processes for the resulting liquid waste by products while previous studies have demonstrated the potential of using nanofiltration nf membranes to polish the outlet stream of a membrane bioreactor mbr in municipal wastewater applications there is little known about the performance of such membranes to treat the more complex multi component streams that result from the processing of ssos in this study crossflow filtration experiments with three commercial flat sheet nf membranes nfs nfx nf90 were run on two batches of mbr permeate identified as batch a and batch b which were sourced four months apart from a biogas production facility for each batch there was a remarkable difference in performance of the three nf membranes where a clear trade off between permeate quality and recovery was observed for example the nf90 membrane gave the best permeate quality but the lowest recovery interestingly the nfs permeate cod for batch b was approximately 60 lower than that for batch a it is believed that this was due to differences in the amount of ammonia between the two batches this work bridges a technical gap in the water energy nexus by demonstrating the viability of using nf technology to polish liquid waste streams from biogas production processes while also highlighting their susceptibility to variable feed conditions caused by upstream process deviations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanofiltration polishing treatment process biogas production source separated organics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the production of methane rich biogas from source separated organics ssos in an anaerobic digestion ad facility is an emerging clean tech solution that diverts organic waste away from landfills 1 2 currently there are nearly 300 ad facilities throughout canada which collectively produce approximately 6 million gigajoules of energy each year notably only nine of these facilities are equipped to process ssos despite a 50 increase in biogas facilities between 2011 and 2020 3 the on site treatment of waste in particular the spent feedstock known as digestate is a challenge for many facilities typically facilities will dewater the digestate into the respective solid and liquid fractions using process equipment such as screw presses and centrifuges 4 6 the solid fraction is used in land based applications e g as fertilizer or disposed in landfills or sometimes incinerated 7 the liquid fraction comprising up to 90 of the total mass of digestate is either hauled to a separate treatment facility or is treated on site 5 over the past 30 years membrane bioreactors mbrs have become a well established water treatment technology that requires a minimal footprint while achieving water quality effluent that is free of pathogenic microorganisms the vast majority of mbr facilities in operation treat municipal wastewater however mbr technology is seeing rapid adoption in industrial treatment applications such as for wastewaters sourced from tanneries pulp and paper production textile dyeing pharmaceutical production and landfill leachate 8 9 the application of mbrs has also been extended to treating liquid fractions of anaerobic digestate namely sourced from farm manure 10 11 in these particular mbr feed streams the high concentrations of salts natural organic matter nom and nutrients demanded the use of advanced polishing treatment processes to achieve the increasingly stringent constraints on water quality discharge 12 for example the wastewater systems effluent regulations in canada establishes national standards for deleterious substances that are known to have environmental impacts e g un ionized ammonia has a discharge limit of 1 25 mg l 13 nanofiltration nf membranes were developed as low pressure alternatives to reverse osmosis membranes inwater softening applications however they have since been adopted for a wide array of challenging applications such as the treatment of high strength industrial wastewater that contains high contaminant concentrations 14 17 previous studies have shown that a combined mbr nf process results in a better quality effluent than just an mbr for treating feeds from landfill leachate 18 20 dairy production 21 pharmaceutical production 22 and municipal wastewater facilities 23 24 these studies have shown that the addition of nf polishing greatly improves the quality of the process effluent especially for reducing cod and nom concentrations however there are two shortcomings that remain unaddressed for applying a similar treatment process for treating mbr effluents from digestate sourced from municipal ssos first the performance of nf membranes is source dependent as contaminant transport and removal is highly dependent on specific solute membrane interactions 25 26 second studies using feeds with high nom concentrations reported significant nf permeate flux declines due to membrane fouling this outcome is undesirable as it leads to higher operational costs due to the need for frequent cleaning cycles as such a fouling mitigation technique may be required to make an mbr nf process more viable the present work aims to bridge these concepts by investigating a hybrid coagulation nf process for polishing mbr permeate sourced from the liquid fraction of dewatered ad the addition of an inorganic coagulant is an effective low cost method of removing nom foulants prior to membrane filtration that has shown to improve membrane productivity flux 27 31 in order to determine the most accurate prediction of treatment performance in this application 32 samples of mbr permeate were obtained from a biogas production facility these samples had quite complex compositions see table 1 our study included the following areas of investigation 1 characterization of the mbr permeate using both bulk measurement techniques i e cod and complex analytical techniques i e lc ocd 2 high throughput screening of the effectiveness of using a commercial coagulant to remove nom 3 filtration experiments to assess membrane performance based on cod removal permeate quality and permeate recovery membrane productivity and 4 evaluation of the effect of nf feed properties by comparing the filtration performance of two batches on treatment efficacy 2 material and methods 2 1 mbr permeate sampling and characterization two batches of mbr permeate were sampled from a sso processing facility in north america briefly the process is as follows shipments of municipal sso waste are pre processed to remove any non organic material mainly plastic bags and then fed into an anerobic digestor to produce biogas the spent digestate is dewatered using a centrifuge and then the resulting liquid fraction is send to a mbr the two batches of mbr permeate were sampled four months apart with each one characterized according to the following cod was measured using a hach 8000 hr cod kit digestion method following the method provided by the supplier zeta potential was measured using a zetasizer nano za instrument malvern analytical ph and conductivity were measured using an hi5522 ph conductivity meter total organic carbon ion sodium potassium magnesium calcium and nutrient chloride sulfates ammonia nitrites and nitrates concentrations were measured by agat laboratories oakville ontario canada liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd analysis was conducted at the university of waterloo s water institute a comparison of the quality parameters of batch a 165 l that was sampled in march 2021 and batch b 60 l that was sampled in july 2021 is given in table 1 the average measurements and standard deviation errors are presented for those parameters that were measured by our team all parameters were measured in duplicate for each bucket in which the samples were received 11 buckets for batch a and 4 buckets for batch b most of the parameters were quite similar between the two batches however there were a few exceptions most notably the concentration of ammonia in batch a was nearly 300 times higher than that in batch b 2 2 high throughput and jar testing protocol an inorganic alum based coagulant pax 18 9 05 al was obtained from kemira water solutions and used to pre treat batch a in advance of the membrane filtration tests an aluminum based coagulant was selected because the optimal coagulation ph 7 5 8 0 is similar to the ph of the mbr permeate 33 34 the effect of coagulant dosage was studied using a multi point magnetic stirrer and eight lab beakers of sufficient size to accommodate 80 ml of mbr permeate coagulant concentrations ranging from 40 to 120 mg al3 l each beaker was mixed for 3 min at 300 rpm then the beaker contents were allowed to settle for 30 min previous work has shown that this small scale high throughput ht screening of coagulants provides good scalability 35 the effect of ph adjustment to 7 6 using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1m naoh was also studied a pb 700 jar tester phipps bird was used repeatedly to produce 60 l of coagulated mbr permeate as follows each jar was filled with 2 l of mbr permeate dosed with the desired amount of pax 18 and then mixed for 3 min at 300 rpm the mixture was then allowed to settle for 30 min after which the supernate was filtered using a 1 micron bag filter to remove any unsettled flocs the composition of the coagulated mbr permeate was determined using the same battery of tests described above for the as received batches of mbr permeate including compositional analysis and lc ocd analysis 2 3 membranes and filtration system rectangular coupons 140 cm2 of three commercial flat sheet polyamide nf membranes nfs synder nfx synder and nf90 dow were cut from a large sheet in order to fit in the sepa crossflow filtration cell used in this study the coupons were wetted in deionized di water prior to filtration and refrigerated when not in use the surface charge properties of the three membranes were determined using the streaming potential method of a surpass 3 electrokinetic analyzer anton paar as follows a pair of rectangular membrane samples 2 cm 1 cm was cut from the same large sheet used for the crossflow filtration studies and then attached onto the adjustable gap cell of the surpass 3 the distance between the two rectangular samples was set to 100 10 micrometers the nfs and nfx membranes were soaked in di water for 12 h prior to testing while the nf90 membrane was soaked in a 25 isopropyl alcohol solution for 1 h before testing the zeta potential measurements were performed using an electrolyte solution of 1 mm kcl which was adjusted from ph 2 to 10 using 0 05 m hcl and 0 05 m naoh solutions after each zeta potential measurement the system was rinsed twice with the electrolyte solution a schematic of the bench scale crossflow filtration system used in this study is shown in fig 1 additional details are provided in fig s1 in the supplementary material the fluid from the feed tank t01 is pressurized using a positive displacement pump p01 and fed directly into the sepa cell membrane housing m01 at a constant flow rate of 6 6 l min the transmembrane pressure tmp is calculated using eq 1 where pf bar pc bar and pp bar are the feed concentrate and permeate pressures respectively 1 p tmp bar p f p c 2 p p the tmp is controlled through a precision needle valve v04 and is manipulated to control the back pressure of m01 the concentrate stream is recycled back to the feed tank and the permeate stream is continuously withdrawn from the system through valve v05 a temperature controller in the feed tank ensured that the fluid temperature stayed in the range of 20 c a type k thermocouple gave a precise measurement of the actual fluid temperature each membrane coupon was first compacted under a tmp of 6 9 bar and flowrate of 6 6 l min for 30 min with regular tap water following the compaction step the water permeability l p l m 2 h bar was determined from an anova regression analysis of average permeate flux j l m 2 h versus tmp ranging from 4 1 to 9 6 bar via eq 2 where v l is the dispensed permeate volume t h is the time required to dispense the volume a m2

2 l p l m 2 h bar j p tmp v t a μ t μ 20 c p tmp permeate flux was calculated from timed measurements to collect 1 ml of permeate with five measurements taken at each tmp a sodium chloride nacl rejection test was also conducted on each membrane coupon as follows a 5 l nacl solution at a concentration of 2000 ppm was prepared in deionized water and the system was run with complete permeate recirculation for 30 min at 6 9 bar after which three 10 ml samples of the feed and permeate were collected the electrical conductivity was measured using a hi 5522 ph conductivity meter hanna instruments and rejection was calculated via eq 3 3 r nacl ec f ec p ec f 100 where ec f ms cm and ec p ms cm are the average electrical conductivities of the feed and permeate samples respectively the average permeabilities and the 95 confidence interval around the regression line and average salt rejection and standard deviation error for the three nanofiltration membranes used in this study are presented in table 2 the corresponding values for each individual membrane coupon used in this study is listed in table s1 in the supplementary material filtration tests with the as received and coagulated mbr permeate were conducted at a constant tmp of 6 9 bar and constant feed flow rate of 6 6 l min each experimental condition e g membrane type feed solution was tested in duplicate referred to as replicate 1 and replicate 2 in order to confirm the reproducibility of the results within an experiment the permeate was collected in a container located on top of a load cell that recorded the cumulative mass at one minute time intervals the cumulative mass data was converted to temperature corrected flux by conducting a numerical differentiation on the mass and time data sets obtained from each experiment permeate recovery for each filtration experiment was calculated via eq 4 where vfinal p l is the total permeate volume at the end of the filtration period 4 permeate recovery v final p 5 l 100 the constant pressure filtration experiments were conducted until 8 h had elapsed or 80 permeate recovery had been reached two feed and permeate samples were collected at every 20 increment of permeate recovery as well as at the end of the 8 hour filtration period the cod of the feed and permeate samples were measured using the method described in section 2 1 and percentage removal of cod was calculated via eq 5 where c f mg l and c p mg l are the feed and permeate concentrations respectively nfs and nf90 permeate samples collected from the filtration of both batches were sent to agat laboratories for compositional analysis additionally nfs and nf90 samples collected from the filtration of the as received and coagulated batch a were sent for lc ocd analysis 5 r cod c f c p c f 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of coagulation operating point via high throughput screening tests a comparison of the coagulation treatment results obtained with batch a is shown in fig 2 the measured cod and zeta potential of the supernate are shown at different coagulant dosages without ph adjustment left panel and with ph adjustment right panel as expected the zeta potential steadily increased as the coagulant dosage increased it has been previously shown that neutralization or reversal of the colloidal nom charge can result in increased cake formation on membrane surfaces due the loss of charge repulsion between the negatively charged membrane surface see table 2 and cake forming foulants 36 38 our objective was to determine the coagulant dosage that maximized nom removal while maintaining a negative solution zeta potential it was found that charge neutralization occurred between dosages of 80 mg al3 l and 85 mg al3 l in the absence of ph adjustment in a similar manner the cod of the supernate steadily decreased until charge neutralization was attained at which point it plateaued around 370 mg l as reported in a previous study with a polyaluminum chloride coagulant this suggests that charge neutralization is the dominant mechanism of coagulation 39 a visual comparison of the effect of increasing coagulant dosage is shown in fig s3 in the supplementary material as shown in fig s4 in the supplementary material it was found that the ph of the supernate decreased from 7 6 to around 4 with the addition of coagulant it is believed that this is due to the consumption of alkalinity brought about by aluminum hydroxide formation 40 interestingly a negative zeta potential was observed for each coagulant dosage after the supernate ph had been adjusted to 7 6 this is likely due to deprotonation of colloidal matter as the solution ph is increased thereby leading to a lower zeta potential 41 once again the measured cod steadily decreased up to a coagulant dosage of 90 mg al3 l after which point it remained relatively stable at around 370 mg l coagulation tests performed with the six cell jar tester were required to produce the large volumes of coagulated mbr permeate that was required for crossflow filtration experiments at the dosage of 90 mg al3 l the supernate produced in the jar test had a slightly higher zeta potential 10 3 0 1 mv than the corresponding samples from the beaker tests 4 7 2 0 mv the average cod of the 60 l of coagulated mbr permeate was 354 16 mg l which is approximately half of the corresponding value for the as received sample see table 1 in order to gain further insight into the coagulation induced changes in composition of the mbr permeate the as received and coagulated samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd this semi quantitative analytical method resolves compounds based on their molecular weight and hydrophobicity into five groups biopolymers humic substances building blocks decomposed humic substances low molecular weight lmw acids and lmw neutrals 42 an overlay of the lc ocd chromatograms for the mbr permeate and coagulated mbr permeate is shown in fig 3 peak integration was used to estimate the concentrations of biopolymers and humic substances in both the coagulated and as received mbr permeate and showed approximate removals of 80 and 90 respectively the peaks of the smaller building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals fractions were too low in concentration to accurately integrate however fig 3 shows that these fractions were only partially removed by coagulation the total organic concentration as measured via toc remaining in the coagulated mbr permeate was 84 mg l and the poor removal of the smaller nom fractions can be assumed to the primary contributors to the measured toc thus any nom fouling observed while filtering the coagulated mbr permeate can be attributed to these unremoved fractions 3 2 effect of pretreatment conditions on filtration performance as shown in fig 4 the filtration performance was first compared in terms of the permeate flux profiles obtained for di water included in our study as a control the as received mbr permeate and the coagulated mbr permeate obtained from six cell jar tests the continuous flux profile for each test condition was obtained via a numerical differentiation of the mass versus time data which was obtained through load cell measurements duplicate filtration experiments using separate membrane coupons were conducted for each membrane and feed condition thus a total of 18 independent filtration experiments are presented in fig 4 as expcted a stable flux was observed when filtering di water through all three membranes interestingly the nfs membrane gave a di water flux 41 lmh nearly double that of the nfx membrane 20 lmh despite both membranes having similar rated mwcos see table 1 yet it was found that the nf90 membrane demonstrated the highest di water flux 50 lmh which has been reported in the literature as being due to the presence of carboxylic acid and amine functional groups that facilitate water transfer via hydrogen bonding interactions 43 44 thereby making the membrane hydrophilic the nfs and nfx membranes both showed similar initial wastewater and di water fluxes however flux decline due to membrane fouling was observed with the nfs membrane whereas a relatively flat profile was observed with the nfx membrane in contrast to this despite having the highest di water flux the nf90 membrane had the lowest wastewater flux additionally the flux of the nf90 membrane decreased from 12 lmh to 8 lmh during wastewater filtration this discrepancy between the initial clean and wastewater fluxes was also observed by dolar et al 45 who reported a 53 decline in flux when changing from the filtration of di water to landfill leachate while it has been reported that the nf90 membrane has a tight pore structure 46 it is not known exactly what caused the dramatic difference in flux values it was found that pre treating the mbr permeate with coagulant did not improve the flux performance of any of the three nanofiltration membranes previous studies have shown examples of coagulation nf hybrid processes where coagulation had minimal to no impact on fouling mitigation 46 48 liang et al suggests that a higher residual al3 concentration leads to an increase in osmotic pressure on the permeate side which in turn reduces the concentration differential that drives permeation the aluminum concentration in the coagulated mbr increased from 0 2 mg l to 1 5 mg l which suggests that this phenomena is a likely cause for the lack of improvement seen in the flux performance 49 targeted nom removal via coagulation failed to improve on the permeate flux and recovery which can be explained via two possible mechanisms first there was insufficient coagulant dosing to remove smaller nom fractions building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals that still enabled nom fouling second residual amounts of al3 build up on the permeate side reduced the osmotic pressure that drives permeation the corresponding permeate recovery values for the twelve filtration experiments shown in the bottom three panels of fig 4 are given in table 3 for all three nanofiltration membranes there was no appreciable improvement to permeate recovery following coagulation of the mbr permeate due to the crossflow configuration of the system used in our study and given that the filtration experiments were conducted with the permeate stream continuously withdrawn from the system i e permeate was collected in container located on top of a load cell the properties of the feed solution changed during each filtration test as an example the results obtained for the filtration of the as received mbr permeate batch a using the nfs membrane are shown in fig 5 the data points for each filtration test correspond to samples of the feed and permeate taken at 20 increments of recovery and another set of samples taken at the end of the 8 hour filtration experiment while the feed cod increased steadily to a concentration nearly four times the initial cod of 666 mg l see table 1 the permeate cod remained constant as a result of this the cod rejection calculated using eq 5 increased with permeate recovery this trend was also observed with the nfx and nf90 membranes under both feed conditions see fig s5 in the supplementary material this result highlights the robust nature of nf membranes since vastly different permeate recoveries were obtained with each membrane removal performance was compared based on the cod measured at the end of the filtration experiment i e the highest obtained recovery after 8 h or at 80 recovery fig 6 shows the feed and permeate cod measurements obtained for the filtrations of coagulated and as received mbr permeate using each membrane similar to the flux results no improvements in removal were observed following the coagulation of the mbr permeate despite the initial feed cod being significantly lower the nf90 membrane produced the highest quality permeate while the cod measurements obtained for the nfs and nfx membranes were comparable and nearly double that of the nf90 membrane once again targeted nom removal did not improve permeate quality or the permeate recovery rates of the three membranes referring back to fig 2 it can be seen that the lc ocd chromatogram for the nf90 permeate shows the near perfect removal of all organic fractions this trend was observed for the permeates obtained from all membranes under both feed conditions which suggests that some inorganic species are not being removed by the membrane and are contributing to the measuredpermeate cod these results are in good agreement with those reported by chang et al 46 where the removal of cod obtained with a nanofiltration process was unaffected by the addition of an aluminum based coagulant the superior cod removal observed with the nf90 membrane may be attributed to its tight pore structure which is widely reported in the literature 17 the enhanced removal ascertained by the tight pore structure is however accompanied by a lower flux and greater fouling potential additionally charge effects may also explain the high rejection observed with the nf90 membrane 50 however as presented in table 2 there is no significant difference in membrane surface charge between the nfx and nf90 membranes yet the nf90 membrane produced a permeate with a much lower cod 3 3 effect of feed properties on filtration performance the filtration performance of the nf90 and nfs membranes was also determined for the second batch of mbr permeate i e batch b the nfx membrane was excluded from these tests as filtration results using batch a indicated that it offered neither the high recovery rates of the nfs membrane nor the high permeate quality produced by the nf90 membrane additionally batch b was filtered as received since we determined that pre treating with the coagulant had no effect on filtration performance fig 7 compares batches a and b with respect to flux top and cod removal bottom observed during filtration with the nfs and nf90 membranes the nf90 membrane produced very similar flux profiles during the filtration of both batches specifically very low fluxes compared to the clean water flux were observed including similar flux declines over the 8 hour filtration window this resulted in very similar permeate recoveries obtained for both batches interestingly a marginally lower flux was observed for the nfs membrane when it was used to filter batch b with recovery rates of 70 being recorded across both replicates regardless the nfs membrane displayed superior overall wastewater flux performance compared to the nf90 membrane for both batches the most striking observation pertains to cod removal where the nf90 membrane produced high quality 100 mg l permeate for both batches however the nfs membrane produced a much higher quality of permeate during the filtration of batch b 95 14 mg l than it did for the filtration of batch a 234 14 mg l the results in fig 7 are presented in alternative format in fig 8 to explicitly show the tradeoff in filtration performance here the percentage of permeate recovered by each membrane with each batch to the permeate cod concentration this graphical approach was originally developed by robeson to visualize the trade of between selectivity and permeability of polymeric membranes used for gas separation 51 it has since been used to visualize the trade off in performance metrics in other areas of membrane research such as the advancement of desalination membranes the development of electrically conductive membranes and the development of metal organic frameworks 52 54 to our knowledge this is the first time this analysis has been extended to wastewater byproducts from biogas production the plot area is divided into four quadrants with the lower right quadrant i e recovery 50 permeate cod 180 mg l representing the high quality high recovery operating region a permeate cod of 180 mg l was chosen as an analogue for typical sewer discharge limits notably for filtrations with batch a a trade off was observed between permeate recovery and the permeate cod concentration as a result none of the membranes operated in the high quality high recovery region conversely filtering batch b with the nfs membrane operated in the high quality high recovery operating region despite batch b having very similar bulk properties to batch a nf enabled the removal of 90 of toc from the permeate as observed in lc ocd results presented in fig 3 which implies that the variation in the permeate cod observed between both batches was derived from a non organic fraction in order to further investigate this batch to batch variation feed samples from both batches and permeate samples obtained from both membranes were sent to agat laboratories for a compositional analysis which provided measurements of select nutrients metals and ions as shown in fig 9 the rejection of the various species values given in table s2 in the supplementary material was compared to the stokes radius to account for both solute size and hydration shell effects the stokes radius for each solute was calculated assuming an infinite dilution using the stokes einstein equation eq 6 6 r nm k b t 6 πμd where k b kg m 2 s 2 k is the boltzmann constant t k is the solution temperature μ pa s is the solution dynamic viscosity and d m 2 s is the diffusion coefficient obtained from the crc handbook of chemistry physics 55 as shown in fig 9 the rejection of solutes by both the nf90 and nfs membranes was well correlated with their respective stokes radius values we found that solute molecular weight was a poor predictor of rejection see fig s6 in the supplementary material which has been previously reported in the literature 25 the solutes with the largest stokes radius e g magnesium had the highest rejection values additionally for those solutes with similar stokes radii e g potassium and chloride the highest rejection values were found for negatively charge solutes this observation agrees with the membrane zeta potential measurements presented in table 2 and fig s2 for each solute greater rejections were observed with the nf90 membrane as compared to the nfs membrane and thus indicates why the nf90 membrane was consistently able to produce a permeate with a lower cod concentration as shown in fig s6 in the supplementary material the same trends were observed in the filtration experiments conducted with batch b the relationship between stokes radius and rejection has been previously reported in the literature however those comparisons were based on experiments done with single component solutions or simple multi component mixtures 56 57 the results from this study show that the relationship between stokes radius and solute rejection can be extended to complex industrial wastewater mixtures the significant source of difference between the two batches was the concentration of ammonia which was significantly higher in batch a 134 mg l than batch b 0 48 mg l due to incomplete nitrification in the mbr fig 9 shows that ammonia was virtual unremoved by the nfs membrane and exhibited very low removal with the nf90 membrane although it is well known that standard cod measuring kits that use dichromate oxidizers do not oxidize ammonia it can form an interference when present in conjunction with high concentration of chloride 58 the oxidation of chloride ions into chlorine significantly affects the accurate measurement of cod but the addition of mercuric sulfate can mask chloride interference by forming mercuric chloride complexes that cannot be oxidized however in the presence of high concentrations of nitrogenous compounds the oxidation of chloride to chlorine occurs through the formation of chloroamine intermediates even in the presence of mercuric sulfate 59 thus the high permeate cod in the samples from batch a were likely due to the high concentrations of ammonia and chlorides in these samples furthermore nitrites also have a profound impact on cod which has a theoretical oxygen demand of 1 1 mg o2 l per 1 mg l of no2 60 the higher cod concentrations in the permeate produced by the nf90 membrane filtrations of batch a were likely due to the relatively better performance with respect to chloride removal offered by the nf90 membrane as observed in fig 9 4 conclusions this research assessed the ability of three commercially available flat sheet nf membranes to polish the permeate stream from a mbr that treats the liquid fraction of dewatered anaerobic digestate a by product from the conversion of municipal source separated organics into biogas batch a was subject to coagulation pre treatment whereas batch b was filtered without pre treatment intrinsic differences between the three nf membranes were evaluated and the composition of batch a resulted in a trade off observed between the volume of permeate recovered and the permeate cod concentration more permeable membranes nfs nfx demonstrated a higher permeate recovery however often at the sacrifice of permeate quality to improve membrane performance 90 mg al3 l determined through high throughput screening of an aluminum based coagulant was dosed to reduce the nom concentration despite reducing the cod concentration by nearly 50 pre coagulation failed to improve permeate quality or recovery this was hypothesized to be due to 1 the failure of the coagulant to remove smaller nom fractions building blocks lmw acids lmw neutrals and 2 a build up of residual alum that decreases the osmotic pressure needed to drive filtration filtration of batch b sampled 4 months after batch a showed a significant improvement in cod removal when filtered with the nfs membrane batch a 95 14 mg l vs batch b 234 8 mg l without sacrificing the high permeate recovery analysis of the permeate indicated high concentrations of both chlorides and nitrogenous compounds namely ammonia and nitrite the interference caused by the oxidation of chloride into chlorine is usually masked by the addition of mercuric sulfate in standard cod kits however this approach is ineffective in the presence of high levels of ammonia as the oxidation of chloride occurs through the formation of chloroamine intermediates comparing individual solute rejection to the solvated size of the solute estimated via stokes radius revealed that the nf90 was able to produce a better overall permeate quality due to its superior removal of chloride ions the high ammonia concentration in one batch of mbr permeate demonstrated the susceptibility of nf based treatment processes to up stream process e g denitrification changes and also justifies further studies to determine the full operating window for nf membranes in biogas production processes declaration of competing interest the authors

12723,chlorination is the most common form of water disinfection for recreational swimming pools and represents a major cost for many large scale operations reducing the chlorine demand in a system may alleviate these costs by decreasing the amount of chlorine required to maintain a target disinfection residual while magnetic water treatment is common for removal of pipe scale impacts on chlorine demand have not been evaluated the application of a commercial magnetic treatment device significantly p 0 05 reduced the chlorine demand by 13 8 within 24 h due to a reduction of monochloramine nh2cl when applied to a simulated pool system subsequent breakpoint chlorination through the addition of calcium hypochlorite caocl2 resulted in a 30 8 increase in free chlorine concentration additionally a 1 h exposure to the magnetic field resulted in a 6 1 reduction in monochloramine compared to the control demonstrating that transient flow through treatment can yield a reduced yet still significant effect mechanistically this effect could be due to the magnetic field effects mfe influencing the electron configuration of compounds in the system thus altering reaction equilibria to favor more volatile chloramine species this treatment is potentially a cost effective method to improve the efficiency of chlorination via the demonstrated reduction of chlorine demand graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords chlorine chloramine monochloramine water treatment static magnetic field data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chlorination is one of the most common forms of water treatment especially in swimming pools due to its effectiveness and low costs however in large scale systems the cost of chlorination can quickly increase as a greater chlorine demand is introduced into the system therefore technologies are desirable that can reduce the chlorine demand and or improve the efficiency of chlorine usage while still maintaining the target disinfection residual there have been anecdotal claims of improvements to water quality in both cooling tower and pool systems as well as reduced chlorination costs of 40 000 usd annually in resort style swimming pools through the use of magnetic technologies p basha personal communication this prompted an investigation into the potential effects of such devices while not commonly used in pool systems magnetic treatment of water may hold promise due to the influence of magnetic fields on chemical reactions with charged or polar intermediates 1 4 including the chloramine forming reactions involving hocl or ocl with nh3 or with organic molecules many water treatment applications such as the disinfection of pool waters utilize free chlorine in the form of hypochlorite ions ocl or hypochlorous acid hocl because of their reactivity with both inorganic and organic contaminants 5 7 the amount of chlorine that is consumed by these reactions is termed the chlorine demand which also dictates the amount of chlorine that must be added to the water to maintain the target disinfection residual when the molar ratio of the cl n is 1 1 chloramines are formed as the free chlorine reacts with nh3 or organic molecules these chloramines have a much weaker oxidative potential than free chlorine and are therefore less desirable as a disinfectant in these systems the sum of all the chlorine species in the system free chlorine chloramines organic chloramines etc can be described as the total chlorine the relationship between the total chlorine as the free chlorine dose is increased in a system with nitrogenous compounds is described in fig 1 as free chlorine is added and the ratio of cl n increases to 1 1 chloramines are oxidized to various nitrogen species n2 no3 ncl3 8 the point at which this occurs is termed the breakpoint fig 1 when the breakpoint occurs all organic and inorganic contaminants are degraded for swimming pools a cl n ratio 1 along with a sufficient free chlorine residual are maintained such that should any contaminant be introduced into the pool it will be degraded while retaining a safe chlorine residual any further addition of free chlorine will remain as free chlorine as there is no chlorine demand remaining in the system the magnitude of available free chlorine that is lost due to the breakpoint is related to the amount of chloramines in the system that are imparting a chlorine demand thus by reducing the amount of chloramines present in the water the free chlorine consumed during the breakpoint

statistical significance p 0 05 was evaluated using paired student s t tests to compare the effects of the magnetically treated systems and their corresponding controls at each time point for each measured variable 3 results 3 1 experiment 1 evaluation of 24 h constant exposure to magnetic field on chlorine demand exposure to a static magnetic field test during the introduction of a nh4no3 contaminant in a 151 l batch study resulted in a significant reduction in total chlorine by 11 4 and monochloramine by 13 8 over the control after 24 h of treatment tables 1 2 3 the initial ph decreased from 7 8 0 17 to 7 7 0 12 and 8 0 0 11 to 7 9 0 04 in the test and control respectively following ammonia addition subsequent breakpoint chlorination resulted in a significant increase of 30 8 in final free chlorine concentration and 20 0 in total chlorine concentration when exposed to the magnetic field compared to the control after the second addition of chlorine final ph of the test and control waters were 7 4 0 03 and 7 5 0 06 respectively with a small but significant difference between the two results are the average of four repeated experiments 3 2 experiment 2 effectiveness of brief exposure to magnetic field on chlorine demand compared to constant exposure brief exposure to the static magnetic field followed by removal from the field resulted in a lower reduction in chlorine demand when compared to the longer constant exposure however average total chlorine in mfe from brief exposure samples were still reduced by 7 5 and 7 3 in samples exposed for 0 5 and 1 h respectively when measured 24 h after collection and compared to their corresponding controls fig 4 table 4 in contrast reductions of 12 8 and 10 5 in total chlorine were seen in mfe from constant exposure samples when compared to their corresponding controls average monochloramine concentrations were reduced by 5 9 and 6 1 in mfe from brief exposure samples collected after 0 5 and 1 h respectively and subsequently measured 24 h after collection in contrast reductions of 12 7 and 14 0 monochloramine were seen in mfe from constant exposure samples at their respective timepoints 24 5 and 25 h when compared to their corresponding controls the ph of briefly exposed samples did not vary significantly after each timepoint in contrast the ph in waters under constant magnetic field exposure resulted in a significant difference of 7 6 0 10 and 7 6 0 07 in the test compared to 7 9 0 10 and 7 9 0 11 for the controls at both 24 5 and 25 h respectively after the addition of nh4no3 results are the averages of three replicates 3 3 experiment 3 evaluation of experimental variables on chlorine demand to assess each variable s contribution to any effect on the chlorine demand of the system each variable was substituted or removed to determine which constituents altered any potential effects similar trends were seen when using naocl as the source of chlorine as when ca ocl 2 was used in previous studies fig 5b as well as when nh4cl was substituted for nh4no3 fig 5c however no discernible effect was seen when the ph was buffered to 7 1 fig 5d or when cyanuric acid was removed from the system fig 5e the effects of different variables on the increase in total chlorine and monochloramine are found in table 5 effects on parameters other than total chlorine are found in the supplementary materials tables s2 s5 4 discussion this proof of concept study demonstrates mfe on chlorine demand in simulated pool systems through the reduction in monochloramine and also documents the key constraints required for the manifestation of this phenomenon few studies have evaluated magnetic field effects in chlorinated waters however with chlorination being one of the most common water treatment methods for pool systems improvements to either the disinfection capabilities or minimizing chlorine loss may prove to be a valuable advancement in water treatment while these results cannot perfectly mimic the complexity of a full scale pool system it was possible to demonstrate that the chloramine forming reactions were influenced by this technology in a manner that reduced chlorine demand it is surmised that the effects of magnetic treatment may stem from influencing the chloramine forming reactions that could occur if the magnetic field altered the electron configuration of compounds in the system this study also successfully demonstrated conditions where this effect was and was not observed highlighting the importance of certain water parameters such as cyanuric acid and ph fig 5d and e table 5 in the system these results demonstrate that under certain conditions the chlorine demand in a simulated pool system can be reduced by the presence of a static magnetic field in experiment 1 chlorinated water which had undergone magnetic treatment was exposed to a chlorine demand nh3 and subsequently breakpoint chlorinated to remove that demand tables 1 2 3 this strategy was chosen because it was expected to mimic the conditions that would be experienced in real world swimming pool systems when a bather enters a pool a chlorine demand will be imparted due to the addition of organic and inorganic compounds typically the chlorine residual in a pool is then sufficient to satisfy the chlorine demand while maintaining a free chlorine residual for continued disinfection initial experiments data not shown showed no measurable difference between magnetic treatment and the control when a free chlorine residual was maintained for the entirety of the experiment it is possible that the magnetic treatment does affect this system but the sensitivity of the assay relative to the amount of reactant used was not sufficient to yield a measurable difference however when the chlorine demand exceeded the free chlorine residual for extended periods of time the monochloramine concentration decreased more rapidly in the magnetically treated system tables 1 2 3 the reduction in monochloramine concentration resulted in a lower chlorine demand after 24 h and ultimately resulted in a 30 8 increase on average of free chlorine residual after subsequent breakpoint chlorination it is unrealistic to assume that in most recreational water systems that the water will remain under constant exposure to a magnetic treatment to mimic a short exposure period nh3 was added to chlorinated water in the presence of the magnetic field and a sample subsequently collected in chlorine demand free bottles and removed from the magnetic field after 30 min and 1 h at the time of sampling no significant difference in monochloramine was observed between waters under treatment and the control fig 4 table 4 interestingly 24 h after collection and removal of the sample from the magnetic field it was found that the monochloramine concentration was lower in samples that experienced even a brief exposure to the magnetic field the monochloramine concentration was once again reduced after 24 h post sample collection in the waters under constant exposure 12 7 and 14 0 and to a lesser extent in the samples removed from the field at 0 5 and 1 h 5 9 and 6 1 respectively compared to their controls at the equivalent times section 3 2 the importance of various water parameters was systematically evaluated to understand what conditions are required for the reduction of chlorine demand under magnetic treatment this evaluation included changing the chlorine source naocl ammonia source nh4cl ph buffered at 7 1 and the presence of cyanuric acid fig 5 table 5 tables s2 s5 these data demonstrate that the initial source of chlorine or ammonia did not appear to influence the reduction of the chlorine demand in a magnetic field however both the ph and the presence of cyanuric acid did influence this reduction this indicates that both the ph and cyanuric acid potentially play a role in the reduction of chlorine demand in the previous experiments table 1 it was seen that the ph significantly changed between the treated and non treated water when the ph was buffered the chlorine demand was not reduced these results coupled with the previously described smaller magnitude of ph shift in samples under brief exposure resulting in a lower reduction in monochloramine indicate that the change in ph may not be a result of the change in chlorine demand but rather a driver for that change these experiments highlight four key findings that may point to how chlorine demand could be reduced in the system the mass balance difference section 3 1 the time required after the chloramine formation that result in a reduced chlorine demand section 3 2 the necessity on cyanuric acid section 3 3 and the effects of ph a difference in mass balance can be observed when the magnetic treatment yielded a reduction on monochloramine and was subsequently breakpoint chlorinated table 1 this would imply that chlorine demand was removed from the system a possible explanation for this reduction of monochloramine is that the yield of the reaction may be shifted to favor di or trichloramine which are more volatile resulting in the removal of chloramines through degassing 18 stoichiometric analysis of the results in section 3 1 indicate that the amount cl mmol is lower in the treated system than the control table 2 however the amount of n mmol is the same this is likely due to losses primarily as dichloramine which is more volatile than monochloramine this would in part explain the relatively slow reduction in chlorine demand as degassing would likely occur on the scale of hours to days as noted by schmalz et al 19 the hypothesis that the removal of chlorine demand is due to a secondary process is further supported in experiment 2 fig 4 table 4 evaluating the effects of brief exposure to the magnetic field which at 1 h show no difference in the measured water parameters but do show a difference at 24 5 h in both briefly exposed and constantly exposed samples determining the mechanism of how a magnetic field could produce such effects are beyond the scope of this study however the most obvious drivers of this effect are likely to be ph and the reactant concentration due to chloramine forming reactions being dependent on both yamashita et al 20 noted that a magnetic field may subtly affect the local ph of the system which could subsequently favor di or trichloramine formation a multitude of mechanisms have also been described in which a magnetic field may influence the spin of electrons changing the yield of the reaction 3 the change in electron configuration could be facilitated by the mixing of the system as compounds cross the static magnetic field which in turn could increase the yield of di or trichloramine at a higher ph than what would normally be expected another consideration is the necessity of cyanuric acid which helps prevent the loss of free chlorine by uv light through the complexion between the two molecules 21 it is possible that the presence of cyanuric acid slows down the chloramine forming reactions by reducing the amount of available chlorine that may initially react with the addition of ammonia cyanuric acid may also impact the effective concentration of chlorine in solution this equilibria between bound chlorine and chlorine in solution could be impacted by aromatic ring shielding due to isocyanuric acid the predominant cyanuric acid species in water having weakly aromatic characteristics 22 it could be possible for an external magnetic field to deshield electrons the outer electrons and slightly shift the equilibria of bound and unbound chlorine should the molecule cross the magnetic field due to mixing 23 determining on a mechanistic level how magnetic technologies produce various outcomes in water systems remains contested to this day even in the most well documented magnetic field effect of scale removal 24 25 differences in results between studies can in part be attributed to subtle differences in experimental design ranging from different magnetic fields 26 pipe material 27 flow rates 28 and water characteristics it is likely that a multitude of factors contribute to the reduction of chlorine demand as seen throughout this study and many more may potentially contribute or hinder these effects these experiments address two key issues regarding the applicability of this method to reduce chlorine inputs necessary for recreational pool waters first it demonstrates that the chlorine demand is reduced over time showing how less chlorine could be used to maintain the desired free chlorine residual additionally the experiment 2 fig 4 table 4 demonstrates how a localized effect has the capacity to affect a much larger recirculating system in that a brief exposure to the magnetic field is sufficient to produce an effect on the chlorine demand this experiment showed that so long as the reaction occurred in the presence of the magnetic field the reduction of chlorine demand could still manifest albeit at a reduced level given the complexity of real world systems future work should be conducted to evaluate the translatability of this research to full scale systems real world pool systems contain a variety of organic and inorganic compounds that may react synergistically or antagonistically with this treatment additionally it is possible that the presence of organic nitrogen from bathers 14 urea and creatinine may yield different results than inorganic chloramines and should be the focus of further investigations although these factors will likely influence the efficacy of magnetic water treatment this study has demonstrated that it is possible to alter reactions found in swimming pools in a manner that could reduce chlorine consumption in these systems 5 conclusion magnetic treatment of water has the potential to reduce chlorine demand in simulated pool water systems resulting in net savings for chlorine costs under real world applications this magnetic treatment device provides an energy and cost effective method of reducing chlorination costs in swimming pools a significant reduction in chlorine demand in the form of reduced monochloramine was observed under certain experimental conditions this phenomenon was apparent in non buffered pool waters containing cyanuric acid regardless of the source of chlorine or ammonia that was supplied into the system interestingly the reduction in chlorine demand appears to be based on the presence of the magnetic field during the formation of the chloramines which provides the potential for unique applications even when waters are treated only briefly the reduction in chlorine demand may be due to magnetic field effects on the ph of the system or the electron configuration of the reactants resulting in an increased yield of the more volatile di or trichloramine which may ultimately gas out of the system funding source funding provided by the vodaa

12723,chlorination is the most common form of water disinfection for recreational swimming pools and represents a major cost for many large scale operations reducing the chlorine demand in a system may alleviate these costs by decreasing the amount of chlorine required to maintain a target disinfection residual while magnetic water treatment is common for removal of pipe scale impacts on chlorine demand have not been evaluated the application of a commercial magnetic treatment device significantly p 0 05 reduced the chlorine demand by 13 8 within 24 h due to a reduction of monochloramine nh2cl when applied to a simulated pool system subsequent breakpoint chlorination through the addition of calcium hypochlorite caocl2 resulted in a 30 8 increase in free chlorine concentration additionally a 1 h exposure to the magnetic field resulted in a 6 1 reduction in monochloramine compared to the control demonstrating that transient flow through treatment can yield a reduced yet still significant effect mechanistically this effect could be due to the magnetic field effects mfe influencing the electron configuration of compounds in the system thus altering reaction equilibria to favor more volatile chloramine species this treatment is potentially a cost effective method to improve the efficiency of chlorination via the demonstrated reduction of chlorine demand graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords chlorine chloramine monochloramine water treatment static magnetic field data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chlorination is one of the most common forms of water treatment especially in swimming pools due to its effectiveness and low costs however in large scale systems the cost of chlorination can quickly increase as a greater chlorine demand is introduced into the system therefore technologies are desirable that can reduce the chlorine demand and or improve the efficiency of chlorine usage while still maintaining the target disinfection residual there have been anecdotal claims of improvements to water quality in both cooling tower and pool systems as well as reduced chlorination costs of 40 000 usd annually in resort style swimming pools through the use of magnetic technologies p basha personal communication this prompted an investigation into the potential effects of such devices while not commonly used in pool systems magnetic treatment of water may hold promise due to the influence of magnetic fields on chemical reactions with charged or polar intermediates 1 4 including the chloramine forming reactions involving hocl or ocl with nh3 or with organic molecules many water treatment applications such as the disinfection of pool waters utilize free chlorine in the form of hypochlorite ions ocl or hypochlorous acid hocl because of their reactivity with both inorganic and organic contaminants 5 7 the amount of chlorine that is consumed by these reactions is termed the chlorine demand which also dictates the amount of chlorine that must be added to the water to maintain the target disinfection residual when the molar ratio of the cl n is 1 1 chloramines are formed as the free chlorine reacts with nh3 or organic molecules these chloramines have a much weaker oxidative potential than free chlorine and are therefore less desirable as a disinfectant in these systems the sum of all the chlorine species in the system free chlorine chloramines organic chloramines etc can be described as the total chlorine the relationship between the total chlorine as the free chlorine dose is increased in a system with nitrogenous compounds is described in fig 1 as free chlorine is added and the ratio of cl n increases to 1 1 chloramines are oxidized to various nitrogen species n2 no3 ncl3 8 the point at which this occurs is termed the breakpoint fig 1 when the breakpoint occurs all organic and inorganic contaminants are degraded for swimming pools a cl n ratio 1 along with a sufficient free chlorine residual are maintained such that should any contaminant be introduced into the pool it will be degraded while retaining a safe chlorine residual any

decreased from 7 8 0 17 to 7 7 0 12 and 8 0 0 11 to 7 9 0 04 in the test and control respectively following ammonia addition subsequent breakpoint chlorination resulted in a significant increase of 30 8 in final free chlorine concentration and 20 0 in total chlorine concentration when exposed to the magnetic field compared to the control after the second addition of chlorine final ph of the test and control waters were 7 4 0 03 and 7 5 0 06 respectively with a small but significant difference between the two results are the average of four repeated experiments 3 2 experiment 2 effectiveness of brief exposure to magnetic field on chlorine demand compared to constant exposure brief exposure to the static magnetic field followed by removal from the field resulted in a lower reduction in chlorine demand when compared to the longer constant exposure however average total chlorine in mfe from brief exposure samples were still reduced by 7 5 and 7 3 in samples exposed for 0 5 and 1 h respectively when measured 24 h after collection and compared to their corresponding controls fig 4 table 4 in contrast reductions of 12 8 and 10 5 in total chlorine were seen in mfe from constant exposure samples when compared to their corresponding controls average monochloramine concentrations were reduced by 5 9 and 6 1 in mfe from brief exposure samples collected after 0 5 and 1 h respectively and subsequently measured 24 h after collection in contrast reductions of 12 7 and 14 0 monochloramine were seen in mfe from constant exposure samples at their respective timepoints 24 5 and 25 h when compared to their corresponding controls the ph of briefly exposed samples did not vary significantly after each timepoint in contrast the ph in waters under constant magnetic field exposure resulted in a significant difference of 7 6 0 10 and 7 6 0 07 in the test compared to 7 9 0 10 and 7 9 0 11 for the controls at both 24 5 and 25 h respectively after the addition of nh4no3 results are the averages of three replicates 3 3 experiment 3 evaluation of experimental variables on chlorine demand to assess each variable s contribution to any effect on the chlorine demand of the system each variable was substituted or removed to determine which constituents altered any potential effects similar trends were seen when using naocl as the source of chlorine as when ca ocl 2 was used in previous studies fig 5b as well as when nh4cl was substituted for nh4no3 fig 5c however no discernible effect was seen when the ph was buffered to 7 1 fig 5d or when cyanuric acid was removed from the system fig 5e the effects of different variables on the increase in total chlorine and monochloramine are found in table 5 effects on parameters other than total chlorine are found in the supplementary materials tables s2 s5 4 discussion this proof of concept study demonstrates mfe on chlorine demand in simulated pool systems through the reduction in monochloramine and also documents the key constraints required for the manifestation of this phenomenon few studies have evaluated magnetic field effects in chlorinated waters however with chlorination being one of the most common water treatment methods for pool systems improvements to either the disinfection capabilities or minimizing chlorine loss may prove to be a valuable advancement in water treatment while these results cannot perfectly mimic the complexity of a full scale pool system it was possible to demonstrate that the chloramine forming reactions were influenced by this technology in a manner that reduced chlorine demand it is surmised that the effects of magnetic treatment may stem from influencing the chloramine forming reactions that could occur if the magnetic field altered the electron configuration of compounds in the system this study also successfully demonstrated conditions where this effect was and was not observed highlighting the importance of certain water parameters such as cyanuric acid and ph fig 5d and e table 5 in the system these results demonstrate that under certain conditions the chlorine demand in a simulated pool system can be reduced by the presence of a static magnetic field in experiment 1 chlorinated water which had undergone magnetic treatment was exposed to a chlorine demand nh3 and subsequently breakpoint chlorinated to remove that demand tables 1 2 3 this strategy was chosen because it was expected to mimic the conditions that would be experienced in real world swimming pool systems when a bather enters a pool a chlorine demand will be imparted due to the addition of organic and inorganic compounds typically the chlorine residual in a pool is then sufficient to satisfy the chlorine demand while maintaining a free chlorine residual for continued disinfection initial experiments data not shown showed no measurable difference between magnetic treatment and the control when a free chlorine residual was maintained for the entirety of the experiment it is possible that the magnetic treatment does affect this system but the sensitivity of the assay relative to the amount of reactant used was not sufficient to yield a measurable difference however when the chlorine demand exceeded the free chlorine residual for extended periods of time the monochloramine concentration decreased more rapidly in the magnetically treated system tables 1 2 3 the reduction in monochloramine concentration resulted in a lower chlorine demand after 24 h and ultimately resulted in a 30 8 increase on average of free chlorine residual after subsequent breakpoint chlorination it is unrealistic to assume that in most recreational water systems that the water will remain under constant exposure to a magnetic treatment to mimic a short exposure period nh3 was added to chlorinated water in the presence of the magnetic field and a sample subsequently collected in chlorine demand free bottles and removed from the magnetic field after 30 min and 1 h at the time of sampling no significant difference in monochloramine was observed between waters under treatment and the control fig 4 table 4 interestingly 24 h after collection and removal of the sample from the magnetic field it was found that the monochloramine concentration was lower in samples that experienced even a brief exposure to the magnetic field the monochloramine concentration was once again reduced after 24 h post sample collection in the waters under constant exposure 12 7 and 14 0 and to a lesser extent in the samples removed from the field at 0 5 and 1 h 5 9 and 6 1 respectively compared to their controls at the equivalent times section 3 2 the importance of various water parameters was systematically evaluated to understand what conditions are required for the reduction of chlorine demand under magnetic treatment this evaluation included changing the chlorine source naocl ammonia source nh4cl ph buffered at 7 1 and the presence of cyanuric acid fig 5 table 5 tables s2 s5 these data demonstrate that the initial source of chlorine or ammonia did not appear to influence the reduction of the chlorine demand in a magnetic field however both the ph and the presence of cyanuric acid did influence this reduction this indicates that both the ph and cyanuric acid potentially play a role in the reduction of chlorine demand in the previous experiments table 1 it was seen that the ph significantly changed between the treated and non treated water when the ph was buffered the chlorine demand was not reduced these results coupled with the previously described smaller magnitude of ph shift in samples under brief exposure resulting in a lower reduction in monochloramine indicate that the change in ph may not be a result of the change in chlorine demand but rather a driver for that change these experiments highlight four key findings that may point to how chlorine demand could be reduced in the system the mass balance difference section 3 1 the time required after the chloramine formation that result in a reduced chlorine demand section 3 2 the necessity on cyanuric acid section 3 3 and the effects of ph a difference in mass balance can be observed when the magnetic treatment yielded a reduction on monochloramine and was subsequently breakpoint chlorinated table 1 this would imply that chlorine demand was removed from the system a possible explanation for this reduction of monochloramine is that the yield of the reaction may be shifted to favor di or trichloramine which are more volatile resulting in the removal of chloramines through degassing 18 stoichiometric analysis of the results in section 3 1 indicate that the amount cl mmol is lower in the treated system than the control table 2 however the amount of n mmol is the same this is likely due to losses primarily as dichloramine which is more volatile than monochloramine this would in part explain the relatively slow reduction in chlorine demand as degassing would likely occur on the scale of hours to days as noted by schmalz et al 19 the hypothesis that the removal of chlorine demand is due to a secondary process is further supported in experiment 2 fig 4 table 4 evaluating the effects of brief exposure to the magnetic field which at 1 h show no difference in the measured water parameters but do show a difference at 24 5 h in both briefly exposed and constantly exposed samples determining the mechanism of how a magnetic field could produce such effects are beyond the scope of this study however the most obvious drivers of this effect are likely to be ph and the reactant concentration due to chloramine forming reactions being dependent on both yamashita et al 20 noted that a magnetic field may subtly affect the local ph of the system which could subsequently favor di or trichloramine formation a multitude of mechanisms have also been described in which a magnetic field may influence the spin of electrons changing the yield of the reaction 3 the change in electron configuration could be facilitated by the mixing of the system as compounds cross the static magnetic field which in turn could increase the yield of di or trichloramine at a higher ph than what would normally be expected another consideration is the necessity of cyanuric acid which helps prevent the loss of free chlorine by uv light through the complexion between the two molecules 21 it is possible that the presence of cyanuric acid slows down the chloramine forming reactions by reducing the amount of available chlorine that may initially react with the addition of ammonia cyanuric acid may also impact the effective concentration of chlorine in solution this equilibria between bound chlorine and chlorine in solution could be impacted by aromatic ring shielding due to isocyanuric acid the predominant cyanuric acid species in water having weakly aromatic characteristics 22 it could be possible for an external magnetic field to deshield electrons the outer electrons and slightly shift the equilibria of bound and unbound chlorine should the molecule cross the magnetic field due to mixing 23 determining on a mechanistic level how magnetic technologies produce various outcomes in water systems remains contested to this day even in the most well documented magnetic field effect of scale removal 24 25 differences in results between studies can in part be attributed to subtle differences in experimental design ranging from different magnetic fields 26 pipe material 27 flow rates 28 and water characteristics it is likely that a multitude of factors contribute to the reduction of chlorine demand as seen throughout this study and many more may potentially contribute or hinder these effects these experiments address two key issues regarding the applicability of this method to reduce chlorine inputs necessary for recreational pool waters first it demonstrates that the chlorine demand is reduced over time showing how less chlorine could be used to maintain the desired free chlorine residual additionally the experiment 2 fig 4 table 4 demonstrates how a localized effect has the capacity to affect a much larger recirculating system in that a brief exposure to the magnetic field is sufficient to produce an effect on the chlorine demand this experiment showed that so long as the reaction occurred in the presence of the magnetic field the reduction of chlorine demand could still manifest albeit at a reduced level given the complexity of real world systems future work should be conducted to evaluate the translatability of this research to full scale systems real world pool systems contain a variety of organic and inorganic compounds that may react synergistically or antagonistically with this treatment additionally it is possible that the presence of organic nitrogen from bathers 14 urea and creatinine may yield different results than inorganic chloramines and should be the focus of further investigations although these factors will likely influence the efficacy of magnetic water treatment this study has demonstrated that it is possible to alter reactions found in swimming pools in a manner that could reduce chlorine consumption in these systems 5 conclusion magnetic treatment of water has the potential to reduce chlorine demand in simulated pool water systems resulting in net savings for chlorine costs under real world applications this magnetic treatment device provides an energy and cost effective method of reducing chlorination costs in swimming pools a significant reduction in chlorine demand in the form of reduced monochloramine was observed under certain experimental conditions this phenomenon was apparent in non buffered pool waters containing cyanuric acid regardless of the source of chlorine or ammonia that was supplied into the system interestingly the reduction in chlorine demand appears to be based on the presence of the magnetic field during the formation of the chloramines which provides the potential for unique applications even when waters are treated only briefly the reduction in chlorine demand may be due to magnetic field effects on the ph of the system or the electron configuration of the reactants resulting in an increased yield of the more volatile di or trichloramine which may ultimately gas out of the system funding source funding provided by the vodaa

12724,sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have been recently considered for micropollutants degradation in water treatment in the present study cobalt ferrite cofe2o4 a metal organic framework mofs mil 101 fe and graphene oxide go were used to synthesize a novel heterostructure cofe2o4 mil 101 fe go c m g through a hydrothermal method the structural properties of c m g were determined by several characterization methods the samples tested in the degradation of triclosan tcs with peroxymonosulfate pms were able to activate it generating the highly active hydroxyl ho and sulfate radicals so4 the effect and interaction of controlling parameters on tcs removal were investigated complete removal of tcs 500 μg l was achieved with ph 5 0 04 g l catalyst and 8 μm pms in only 30 min the tcs removal declined obviously in the presence of radical scavengers and coexisting ions the leachings of cobalt co and iron fe ions were lower than those of other cofe2o4 composites coupled with pms moreover this process demonstrated high performance in the treatment of tcs in tap and well water accordingly the c m g pms system seems to be a highly effective and environmentally compatible process for micropollutant degradation in water treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords advanced oxidation processes antibacterial agent pms cofe2o4 metal organic frameworks data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are increasingly detected in our environment 1 due to their common use and the development of more accurate analysis techniques among them triclosan tcs is an antibacterial compound used in the formulation of detergents toothpaste soaps body washes lotions hand sanitizers shampoos dishwashing liquids and children s toys 2 3 as a result of the abundant use about 96 of the consumed tcs is discharged into natural water bodies through municipal sewer systems and agricultural runoff 4 5 conventional water and wastewater treatment plants cannot effectively remove it thus tcs and its degradation products such as dioxin and halo chlorinated disinfection by products can leach into the environment consequently these products can enter the human body through drinking water consumption bioaccumulation and biomagnification in the food chain 4 5 additionally tcs is one of the important seven pollutants in water resources such as groundwater and surface water at low concentrations in the range of ng l or μg l that creates antibiotic resistant genes in environmental bacteria 6 8 furthermore human exposure to tcs causes liver cancer neurological effects tumorigenesis skin irritation and antagonistic activity of estrogen and androgen 9 10 according to the human and environmental risks of tcs the federal environmental quality guideline feqgs for tcs was considered 0 47 μg l for water quality 11 since tcs and its degradation products are resistant to conventional water treatment processes the finding a suitable and safe degradation method to remove tcs from water is necessary 1 9 different methodologies such as membrane filtration 12 biological degradation 13 14 adsorption 3 5 and aops such as electrochemical degradation 1 photocatalytic degradation 15 16 ozonation 17 18 fenton process 19 fenton like process 20 21 electro fenton process 22 23 and sr aops 24 26 have been tested for tcs degradation from water and wastewater some of these methods are usually facing given drawbacks including the production of toxic by products e g dioxins and chlorinated or methylated tcs derivatives time consuming slow degradation require high energy inputs and high cost 4 5 27 among them aops processes have been considered a promising option for fast degradation and reducing the toxicity of recalcitrant organic compounds from water 4 recently sr aops have received growing consideration to effectively degrade various recalcitrant organic contaminants 28 so4 which can be generated by the persulfate ps or pms activation has a higher half life time 30 40 μs and a higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 v than ho in a wider ph range 9 24 26 in addition several catalysts have been developed to generate so4 as a result of pms and ps activation such as transition metals 29 31 heterogeneous metal oxides 32 34 and so on eqs 1 and 2 present the sr aops mechanisms 1 hso 5 m n so 4 m n 1 ho 2 s 2 o 8 2 m n so 4 m n 1 so 4 2 among the transition metals co and fe ions as homogeneous catalysts demonstrate the best performance to produce so4 via pms and ps activation 35 however the application of these ions may discharge a high concentration of co ions in water as secondary pollution furthermore human exposure to co ions in water causes serious health problems due to its possible toxic and carcinogenic effects 35 36 in addition the ability of fe2 to active pms and ps is limited due to the scavenger effects that quickly converted it into fe3 37 therefore heterogeneous metal oxides e g co3o4 cofe2o4 mno2 and so on as environmentally compatible catalysts have been employed to eliminate the generation of secondary pollutants 35 among heterogeneous catalysts cofe2o4 is a very promising catalyst for the activation of pms to degrade organic pollutants it has a stable structure low solubility high surface area and low co leaching because of the strong feco link 36 38 conversely some studies reported that the activation of pms by cofe2o4 leached a high concentration of co ions in water 36 39 40 in addition the aggregation phenomenon during the cofe2o4 crystallization frequently takes place because of the very high surface energy resulting in a reduction of the pms activation 8 39 consequently it is essential to design new materials able to inhibit the aggregation and leakage of co ions in this sense novel composites which consist of cofe2o4 and some supports can suppress significantly co ions leakage the interaction between cofe2o4 and these supports can also create new active sites and act as an electron bridge producing very significant synergetic effects 35 recently different materials have been tested in combination with cofe2o4 such as zinc oxide zno 41 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 42 mil 100 fe 43 and go 44 among them go has promising characteristics in a wide variety of applications in catalysis adsorption and energy storage 3 39 44 additionally mofs which are crystalline inorganic organic hybrid materials have also interesting characteristics as supports such as good chemical stability large surface areas and high porosity 35 38 in this study an environmentally compatible process was used for the removal of tcs in μg l concentrations from water using novel c m g heterostructures these materials were more stable than other based cofe2o4 composites as confirms the significantly lower release of metal ions as secondary pollutants consequently the purposes of this study were 1 to assess the efficiency of novel environmentally compatible c m g heterostructures coupled with pms for tcs removal from water 2 to investigate the effects of ph catalyst dose tcs concentration pms dose and reaction time on the process 3 to evaluate the degradation pathway and the effect of scavengers and coexisting ions on the process and 4 the application of the process for tcs degradation from natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all materials in this study were obtained from sigma aldrich co usa and merck co germany and were of high purity

concentration total organic carbon analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan was used for toc measurement 2 4 experimental procedure the experiments were completed in two steps at the start of experiments to consider the effect of ph nanocomposite catalyst dose tcs concentration pms dose and reaction time on tcs degradation a single factor experiments sfe was conducted then according to sfe the central composite design ccd model of response surface methodology rsm was used in experimental design to investigate the interaction between parameters first two stock solutions of 10 and 5 mg l of tcs were made in methanol and dw respectively the c m g nanocomposite stock solution was prepared as 1 g l dispersion into dw in addition the pms stock solution was prepared as 100 μm of pms into dw after that the tcs degradation experiments were carried out separately through c m g coupled with pms in 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks on a shaker at room temperature in each experiment a specific dose of c m g nanocomposite was added to each tcs solution 100 to 500 μg l it was stirred in dark for 10 min at 300 rpm to complete the adsorption desorption equilibrium 26 then the ph was adjusted 3 5 7 9 and 11 by 0 1 n naoh and or hcl next pms 2 to 10 μm was added to the solution finally the solution was shaken in dark conditions with a reaction time of 10 to 100 min at 150 rpm in the end 10 ml of samples were collected and 2 ml of nano3 0 1 m was poured into it for centrifuging at 5 min then the supernatant was collected for experimental analysis in the present study quenching experiments were conducted using 50 mm of tba and etoh as radical scavengers in addition to evaluate the effect of mineral ions that can exist in water 5 and 30 mm of the chloride nitrate and sulfate ions were added to the tcs solution furthermore to investigate the tcs degradation in natural conditions tap and well water samples were taken all these experiments were performed in optimum conditions of the ccd model the tcs removal r by c m g coupled with the pms process was calculated using eq 3 3 r c 0 c e c 0 100 here c0 and ce μg l are the initial and final tcs concentrations respectively details of the experimental design are described in the supplementary file text s2 2 5 analytical methods the dllme dispersive liquid liquid microextraction extraction method as well as gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 7890a gas chromatograph equipped with an agilent 5975c msd mass spectrometer usa analysis was used for the tcs concentrations and its intermediates determination details have been presented in the supplementary file text s3 the phzpc was measured based on asgari et al 45 furthermore the pms was quantified by a spectrophotometric method with modification of the iodometric titration method 46 the h2o2 concentration was measured with the potassium permanganate titration method 47 the concentration of nitrate and nitrite were measured by the united states environmental protection agency usepa cadmium reduction method 8192 and diazotization method 8507 using a dr 5000 hach lange spectrophotometer usa respectively electrical conductivity ec was measured by a portable ec meter az8351 taiwan furthermore dissolved oxygen do was measured through an 8403 az portable type device in the field in addition the turbidity of the water samples was detected by a portable turbidimeter tub 430 taiwan 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary tests the selection of the best conditions reactive and most active catalysts was made according to the highest tcs removal fig 1 compares the removal of tcs by several removal processes as can be seen in fig 1 the application of alone pms shows only 27 4 of tcs was degraded in 30 min it indicates that pms self oxidation could not provide adequate active free radicals and had not enough tcs removal 26 39 moreover it was observed that cofe2o4 alone and application of cofe2o4 coupled with pms cofe2o4 pms increased tcs removal up to 42 4 and 49 7 respectively the tcs conversion with 50 c m g 58 1 is higher than that of cofe2o4 probably as a result of better dispersion of the cofe2o4 on the mil 101 fe go support 44 according to the results obtained from text s4 xps analysis proved an interaction between cofe2o4 and mil 101 fe go in the 50 c m g heterostructure these characteristics can justify the tcs enhanced degradation with 50 c m g in addition tcs conversion increased to 67 8 with 50 c m g in the presence of pms most likely due to the effect of the so4 production 38 40 48 therefore the 50 c m g coupled with pms showed the highest tcs degradation in 30 min thus the 50 c m g heterostructure was chosen for characterization and additional experiments 3 2 characterization of synthesized materials 3 2 1 xrd analysis the xrd patterns of all the synthesized materials are summarized in fig 2 a b based on fig 2 a the xrd patterns of go and mil 101 fe go in the 2θ range from 5 to 70 shows layer structure of go with a diffraction peak at 2θ 10 2 which is like the formerly presented 44 49 50 for mil 101 fe go the main peaks at 2θ are also the same as in other reported studies 51 53 the xrd patterns of cofe2o4 and 10 to 50 of c m g heterostructures are shown in fig 2 b in the 2θ range from 10 to 70 the xrd analysis results for cofe2o4 jcpds 22 1086 represent 6 peaks at 2θ 18 3 111 30 3 220 35 7 311 43 2 400 53 95 511 and 62 8 440 39 40 most of the peaks of cofe2o4 are also observed in the xrd patterns of c m g samples with their intensities increasing with the cofe2o4 content similarly the main peaks related to the presence of mil 101 fe mof located at ca 19 33 49 and 62 5 are observed in the heterostructures again with increasing intensities with higher mof contents in the heterostructure no diffraction peak of go was detected in c m g probably because of the lower crystallinity of go and or its high dispersion 3 2 2 ft ir analysis the ft ir spectra of synthesized materials are illustrated in fig 2 c d as revealed in fig 2 c the go characteristic peaks e g 1036 1396 1610 1720 and 3500 cm 1 can be observed the peak at 1036 cm 1 is associated with the alkoxy co vibrations originating from functional groups containing oxygen such as carbonyl carboxylic and epoxy groups 44 the peak at 1396 cm 1 corresponds to the o h deformation vibrations of tertiary c oh 54 moreover peaks at 1610 and 1720 cm 1 are related to extending vibrations of carboxylic groups coo and co stretching vibrations of cooh groups respectively 44 54 the wide bands at 3500 cm 1 are characteristic of the o h vibrations of the water molecules on the surface of the samples 54 the presence of the vibrations associated with co and co groups confirmed the presence of these characteristic groups of go 49 furthermore ft ir of mil 101 fe go is also represented in fig 2 c the peak at 750 cm 1 corresponds to the c h vibrations in benzene groups 52 55 peaks at 1583 and 1396 cm 1 are related to asymmetric and symmetric carboxyl bond coo vibrations respectively 55 the peak at 1680 cm 1 is associated with co bonds in carboxylic groups are similar to dicarboxylate 52 55 the ft ir pattern of mil 101 fe go proves the interaction between go and mil 101 fe that can cause electron transfer efficiency 52 the ft ir spectrum of pure cofe2o4 in fig 2 d shows a peak at 590 cm 1 related to the coo and feo vibrations 44 the ft ir spectra of 10 to 50 c m g have peaks at 3460 cm 1 is associated to the presence of o h like the go peak in addition a peak of 1070 cm 1 is linked to alkoxy co like go furthermore peaks with a wavenumber of 1390 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 show carboxylic groups the information about xps analysis is reported in the supplementary file text s4 3 2 3 fesem tem and eds analysis the structural morphology and particle size of nanomaterials were determined using fesem and tem the morphologies of cofe2o4 50 nm in diameter and mil 101 fe go 180 nm in diameter have been shown in fig 3 a d as can be seen in fig 3 a b the fesem image of cofe2o4 has a typical cubic spinel structure 40 in addition the tem image fig s2 a indicates that large amounts of cofe2o4 were gathered due to the particle agglomeration phenomenon 39 40 56 the fesem and tem images of mil 101 fe go are shown in fig 3 c d and fig s2 b respectively as can be seen mil 101 fe could be successfully attached to the surface of go therefore a new form of composite crystal material with the polyhedron shape is composed such as the other studies 52 57 59 according to fig 3 e f and fig s2 c d cofe2o4 was formed with uniform distribution on mil 101 fe go and 50 c m g the average diameter of 50 c m g is nearly 30 nm smaller than cofe2o4 the eds spectra of 50 c m g composition fig 4 a shows the existence of elements including c o fe and co the mapping analysis of the 50 c m g shows uniform dispersal of elements on the c m g surface fig 4 b f 3 2 4 bet bjh analysis the adsorption desorption isotherm of n2 of the 50 c m g is revealed in fig 5 the bet surface area of the c m g was 13 7 m2 g and its pore volume was 0 14 cm3 g mean pore diameter 40 85 nm the isotherm of c m g is classified as a typical type iii curve with an h3 type hysteresis loop at high pressure as stated by the iupac classification which is representing of mesoporous structure in addition details of vsm and tga analyses are presented in the supplementary file texts s5 and s6 3 3 tcs degradation 3 3 1 effect of ph the appropriate amount of c m g was added to the tcs solution then the solution ph was adjusted tcs degradation was studied in the ph range from 3 to 11 and the results are depicted in fig 6 a tcs degradation slightly increased from 69 6 to 74 1 by increasing the ph from 3 to 5 after that an increase of ph up to 11 led to a decrease in tcs removal to 51 0 thus ph changes did not have significant effect on tcs removal however the maximum tcs removal was detected at ph 5 in this process the phzpc of cofe2o4 and c m g was obtained at 6 9 and 7 5 respectively fig s5 which were in line with previous findings 36 38 therefore more pms is attracted to c m g causing an increase in the tcs degradation through the so4 generation 51 60 besides the pka1 and pka2 of pms are 0 and 9 4 respectively then pms existed as mono anion form hso5 at the ph range from 3 to 9 4 and it was dianion form so5 2 at ph 9 4 when ph was higher than 9 4 the so5 2 would be reacted with pms to form singlet oxygen and tcs degradation will decrease as a consequence of the lower oxidizing capacity of singlet oxygen compared to so4 and ho 24 61 3 3 2 effect of c m g dose the effect of the c m g dose on tcs removal was examined at the optimal ph of 5 and the outcomes are indicated in fig 6 b the removal of tcs decreased from 90 6 to 74 1 as the c m g dose enhanced from 0 04 to 0 08 g l in addition tcs removal slightly increased from 74 1 to 83 8 with the catalyst dose increased from 0 08 to 0 3 g l in the first stage with an increase in catalyst dose the tcs removal was decreased due to the fast and complete pms activation which results in low efficient use of the radicals formed 26 moreover the nanoparticles exhibited a clumping effect at a high dose which made a low surface area and finally less reactivity to pms and decreased tcs degradation 62 in the second stage tcs removal increased with a rise in the catalyst dose owing to the presence of more active sites for generating so4 and ho from pms activation 26 33 38 in this study 0 04 g l of c m g considered as optimum catalyst dose in experimental conditions pms 6 μm tcs 300 μg l and ph 5 in 30 min with 90 6 tcs removal although wang et al 61 reported when sludge derived biochar catalyst dose was 1 g l tcs 10 mg l was completely eliminated within 120 min in presence of 0 8 mm pms and ph 7 2 in addition another research so et al 27 presented that tcs had completely removed in the experimental condition of mnfe2o4 dose of 0 75 g l 0 75 mm tcs concentration pms dose of 0 11 mm and ph 7 in 20 min 3 3 3 effect of initial tcs concentration to assess the effectiveness of c m g coupled with pms for tcs degradation the influence of initial concentrations of tcs 100 200 300 400 and 500 μg l on its removal has been studied and outcomes are presented in fig 6 c tcs removal increased from 73 0 to 98 4 in this process with increasing the initial tcs concentration from 100 to 500 μg l there is a hypothesis that a high initial concentration made a considerable gradient difference in tcs concentration between water and the c m g surface thus the driving force for mass transfer increased and caused an increase in the removal of tcs 63 the pms decomposition was also independent of the tcs concentration 28 in the present study the 500 μg l of tcs was considered under experimental conditions ph 5 catalyst dose 0 04 g l and pms dose 6 μm in 30 min 3 3 4 effect of pms dose the effect of the pms dose is exhibited in fig 6 d according to fig 6 d with increasing the pms dose from 2 to 10 μm tcs degradation enhances from 70 3 to 100 respectively in addition some studies reported similar results when cofe2o4 go and edta cofe2o4 were catalysts to pms activation in the removal of rhodamine b and orange g respectively 42 44 an increase in pms dose causes an increase in contact between c m g and pms this phenomenon causes the generation of more reactive radicals for tcs degradation 38 40 moreover it is reported that extra pms presence in the solution has the scavenging effect between so4 and ho or hso5 and non radical single oxygen ros 1o2 based on eqs 4 to 7 26 33 in this study the scavenging effect of pms was not detected which can be related to the maximum pms dose of 10 μm which is below the threshold pms level 0 20 mm 33 4 so 4 hso 5 so 5 hso 4 5 ho hso 5 so 5 h 2 o 6 so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 7 so 4 ho hso 4 1 2 o 2 3 3 5 effect of reaction time in the process of c m g coupled with pms reaction time was considered from 10 to 100 min the results showed a nearly constant removal of tcs with changes in reaction time thus the lowest reaction time 10 min was selected as a suitable time for the later trials the information of experimental design has been reported in the supplementary file text s7 3 4 stability and metal ions leaching the stability of the synthesized c m g can be investigated by measurement of the released metal ions in the effluent the process 39 table s7 compares the present study results with the other previous ones in that cofe2o4 is used as a catalyst for pms activation according to this table the leached co and fe ions during the process were 4 and 20 μg l respectively in addition the release of co and fe ions in the same condition with cofe2o4 as catalyst was investigated results depicted that 24 and 28 μg l of co and fe ions respectively were released from cofe2o4 which was higher than the concentrations of leached co and fe ions from c m g these comparisons proved that co ions could be less released probably due to a strong linkage between cofe2o4 go and mil 101 fe nanoparticles in addition the world health organization who has reported the co ions concentration of 1 10 μg l in surface and groundwater and 0 1 5 μg l in drinking water moreover the who has determined the fe ions level in the range of 0 05 0 3 mg l as acceptable values that turbidity and color are not developed in drinking water 64 65 therefore the released concentration of co and fe ions from c m g coupled with pms in the present research is safe for human health in addition the c m g heterostructure was stable due to the lower amount of released metal ions therefore the c m g can be useful to remove organic pollutants from water with consideration of human health because of the low release of toxic metal ions 3 5 effect of radical scavengers and coexisting ions free radicals such as so4 and ho can be produced because of pms activation by the transition metal ions present in the catalysts thus the analysis of the role of the main radical species in the tcs degradation using the c m g pms process is essential among them tba reacts quickly with ho and etoh can react with both so4 and ho 33 in the present study to ensure the reactions between so4 and ho and scavenger agents 50 mm of each tba and etoh were added to the reaction according to fig 7 a tcs removal decreased from 81 7 to 58 7 and 59 4 in the presence of tba and etoh respectively results indicated that both so4 and ho formed in the c m g pms process had important roles in this oxidation process this is in agreement with previous studies that proved that both so4 and ho are active radical species in the cofe2o4 go with the pms system for norfloxacin degradation 39 and cofe2o4 al2o3 to activate pms in sulfachloropyridazine degradation 48 since the mineral ions cl no3 and so4 can exist in water the effect of coexisting ions on the c m g coupled with the pms process was investigated in fig 7 b as can be seen in fig 7 b tcs removal decreased in the presence of 5 and 30 mm of coexisting ions chloride ions cl could decrease tcs removal from 81 7 to 60 6 and 63 9 for 5 and 30 mm respectively moreover the 5 and 30 mm of nitrate ion no3 cause diminished the tcs removal from 81 7 to 69 9 and 58 1 respectively additionally the tcs removal decreased from 81 7 to 72 3 and 50 3 in the presence of 5 and 30 mm of sulfate ion so4 as a result of the interaction between chloride with so4 and ho according to eqs 8 to 13 reactive chlorine radicals cl are produced that have less reactivity than so4 and ho 33 thus mineral ions can reduce the tcs removal due to the act of these ions as radical scavengers under a change in acidic or basic conditions 45 likewise chen et al 39 indicated that norfloxacin degradation by the cofe2o4 go pms process can be decreased in the presence of chloride in contrast yang et al 38 study reported that adding 1 and 5 mm of chloride promoted bisphenol a bpa degradation in the cofe2o4 pms process because the nitrate had a minimum effect on it 8 so 4 cl so 4 2 cl 9 cl cl cl 2 10 2 cl 2 2 cl cl 2 11 cl ho cloh 12 cloh h hcloh 13 hcloh cl h 2 o 3 6 degradation pathway the investigation of the tcs degradation pathway was carried out by dllme gc ms for the c m g pms process according to table s2 b the results indicated that organic compounds in the treated water were like fresh tcs solution fig s8 although it should be noted that other studies proved the presence of organic by products such as 3 chlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and so on in the treated tcs solution after degradation processes 3 24 25 61 66 thus the survey of the tcs organic by products after this process by other methods such as lc ms or lc ms ms is recommended however the mineralization results according to toc measurements in optimum point table s2 b indicated that tcs mineralization was about 61 8 3 7 proposed mechanisms the possible mechanism of c m g coupled with pms for tcs degradation is shown in scheme 1 first a small portion of tcs was adsorbed by c m g according to the adsorption mechanism more positive charges look on the surface of the mil 101 fe go composite as a consequence of the agglomeration of go 58 correspondingly there was a positive charge of c m g owing to ph phzpc as presented in section 3 3 1 and tended to adsorb the anions when ph was 5 67 in addition the value of pka of tcs is 7 9 and the electrostatic attraction between tcs and c m g has risen in ph pka 26 therefore the adsorption capacity of the c m g was enhanced owing to the electrostatic attraction between c m g and tcs 68 moreover the carboxylic and hydroxylic groups of c m g interacted with tcs by hydrogen bonding 58 second the pms were adsorbed on the surface of c m g 69 then fe2 and fe3 on the surface of c m g can activate pms into so5 and so4 through eqs 14 and 15 like application of cofe2o4 and mil 101 fe catalyst in atrazine and dye degradation 40 53 in addition co2 captured h2o to generate activated oh on the surface of c m g according to eq 16 like use of cofe2o4 in activation of pms for bisphenol a and atrazine degradation 38 40 after that hso5 was adsorbed on the oh groups through hydrogen bonds then co2 oh reacts with hso5 and produces coo and so4 eq 17 40 53 as a result of the reaction of coo and h co3 generates according to eq 18 40 53 furthermore the in situ generated fe3 and co3 reacted with a part of tcs to form degradation products 69 afterward ho would be further formed via so4 and oh or h2o eq 19 53 70 as the redox potential of the co2 and co3 pair is 1 92 v between hso5 and so5 is 1 1 v and hso5 and so4 is 2 5 3 1 v 38 redox cycling because of the pms activation process is promoted eq 20 38 40 moreover the o2 is oxidized to o2 thru the co3 reduction process based on eq 21 38 in the current research the c m g coupled with the pms process produced 0 0015 mmol of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 according to eq 22 70 because of hydrolyzation of pms then h2o2 converts to ho and o2 based on eq 23 71 finally these produced radicals degrade the tcs into co2 h2o and other degradation byproducts supplementary file text s8 eq 24 38 71 14 fe 2 hso 5 fe 3 so 5 oh 15 fe 3 hso 5 fe 2 so 4 h 16 co 2 h 2 o co 2 oh h 17 co 2 oh hso 5 coo so 4 h 2 o 18 coo 2 h co 3 h 2

byproducts 3 8 experiments in natural freshwater samples the feasibility of the c m g coupled with the pms process was evaluated to degrade tcs from tap and well waters to prove the potential practical applications of the studied nanocomposite the characteristics of the studied water samples are recorded in table s8 for this purpose 200 μg l of tcs was spiked into tap and well water samples to examine the diverse degradation performance in different water matrixes the removal of tcs in various types of water is indicated in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the removal of tcs is 77 1 and 54 in tap and well water respectively which are lower than that of deionized water 81 7 this difference may be due to the inhibition role of coexisting ions moreover inorganic anions such as no3 and cl can compete with tcs for the cationic sits on the surface of the catalyst and consequently causing a few decreases in the tcs degradation due to having a higher concentration than tcs in the water matrix 5 in addition the high turbidity of the healthy water causes fouling of the catalyst and decreases its removal 72 finally since c m g pms can effectively degrade tcs from tap water thus it has possible practical applications for the removal of lower tcs concentrations from drinking water 3 9 comparison with other tcs degradation reported studies in this section the performance of c m g coupled with pms developed in the present study is compared with some of the most related researches for tcs degradation the tcs removal of this process is higher than in some of the studies that have been shown in table 1 consequently the main advantages of this process in comparison with others are high tcs degradation with low pms dose and reaction time in addition c m g coupled with a low amount of pms can release lower sulfate ions into the water compared with the other process therefore it is useful for environmental and human health protection because the presence of sulfate ions in drinking water causes non pathogenic diarrhea in humans 73 moreover in this study the tcs concentration range was the detectable range in water resources 4 conclusion in this work a novel environmentally compatible c m g nanocomposite was synthesized using a hydrothermal method its activity was assessed for tcs removal coupled with pms as a source of the active radicals tcs can be completely degraded by c m g pms process moreover when 81 7 of tcs was degraded only 61 8 of which was converted to mineral products such as h2o and co2 however the investigation of by products of c m g coupled with the pms process by other methods such as lc ms and lc ms ms is recommended furthermore leaching of co and fe ions along c m g coupled with pms process was lower than cofe2o4 based composites and safe for human health moreover as the existence of sulfate ions in drinking water threaten human health the c m g coupled with a low amount of pms may come out lower sulfate ions into the water and may be useful for environmental and human health protection additionally the c m g pms process exhibited performed well in removing tcs from natural waters in conclusion the present process with c m g nanocomposite would be a promising environmentally compatible process for removing emerging contaminants in water it is recommended to investigate this process sequentially in the field conditions of water and wastewater treatment plants to achieve complete removal of tcs in addition the use of electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy to directly measure free radicals in the treated water of the c m g pms process is recommended it is crucial to investigate the novel c m g catalyst recovery with different methods such as centrifugation magnetic separation and coated catalyst with good separation potential relative to conventional methods e g extraction filtration and centrifugation is also recommended compliance with ethical standards the authors have no

12724,sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have been recently considered for micropollutants degradation in water treatment in the present study cobalt ferrite cofe2o4 a metal organic framework mofs mil 101 fe and graphene oxide go were used to synthesize a novel heterostructure cofe2o4 mil 101 fe go c m g through a hydrothermal method the structural properties of c m g were determined by several characterization methods the samples tested in the degradation of triclosan tcs with peroxymonosulfate pms were able to activate it generating the highly active hydroxyl ho and sulfate radicals so4 the effect and interaction of controlling parameters on tcs removal were investigated complete removal of tcs 500 μg l was achieved with ph 5 0 04 g l catalyst and 8 μm pms in only 30 min the tcs removal declined obviously in the presence of radical scavengers and coexisting ions the leachings of cobalt co and iron fe ions were lower than those of other cofe2o4 composites coupled with pms moreover this process demonstrated high performance in the treatment of tcs in tap and well water accordingly the c m g pms system seems to be a highly effective and environmentally compatible process for micropollutant degradation in water treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords advanced oxidation processes antibacterial agent pms cofe2o4 metal organic frameworks data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are increasingly detected in our environment 1 due to their common use and the development of more accurate analysis techniques among them triclosan tcs is an antibacterial compound used in the formulation of detergents toothpaste soaps body washes lotions hand sanitizers shampoos dishwashing liquids and children s toys 2 3 as a result of the abundant use about 96 of the consumed tcs is discharged into natural water bodies through municipal sewer systems and agricultural runoff 4 5 conventional water and wastewater treatment plants cannot effectively remove it thus tcs and its degradation products such as dioxin and halo chlorinated disinfection by products can leach into the environment consequently these products can enter the human body through drinking water consumption bioaccumulation and biomagnification in the food chain 4 5 additionally tcs is one of the important seven pollutants in water resources such as groundwater and surface water at low concentrations in the range of ng l or μg l that creates antibiotic resistant genes in environmental bacteria 6 8 furthermore human exposure to tcs causes liver cancer neurological effects tumorigenesis skin irritation and antagonistic activity of estrogen and androgen 9 10 according to the human and environmental risks of tcs the federal environmental quality guideline feqgs for tcs was considered 0 47 μg l for water quality 11 since tcs and its degradation products are resistant to conventional water treatment processes the finding a suitable and safe degradation method to remove tcs from water is necessary 1 9 different methodologies such as membrane filtration 12 biological degradation 13 14 adsorption 3 5 and aops such as electrochemical degradation 1 photocatalytic degradation 15 16 ozonation 17 18 fenton process 19 fenton like process 20 21 electro fenton process 22 23 and sr aops 24 26 have been tested for tcs degradation from water and wastewater some of these methods are usually facing given drawbacks including the production of toxic by products e g dioxins and chlorinated or methylated tcs derivatives time consuming slow degradation require high energy inputs and high cost 4 5 27 among them aops processes have been considered a promising option for fast degradation and reducing the toxicity of recalcitrant organic compounds from water 4 recently sr aops have received growing consideration to effectively degrade various recalcitrant organic contaminants 28 so4 which can be generated by the persulfate ps or pms activation has a higher half life time 30 40 μs and a higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 v than ho in a wider ph range 9 24 26 in addition several catalysts have been developed to generate so4 as a result of pms and ps activation such as transition metals 29 31 heterogeneous metal oxides 32 34 and so on eqs 1 and 2 present the sr aops mechanisms 1 hso 5 m n so 4 m n 1 ho 2 s 2 o 8 2 m n so 4 m n 1 so 4 2 among the transition metals co and fe ions as homogeneous catalysts demonstrate the best performance to produce so4 via pms and ps activation 35 however the application of these ions may discharge a high concentration of co ions in water as secondary pollution furthermore human exposure to co ions in water causes serious health problems due to its possible toxic and carcinogenic effects 35 36 in addition the ability of fe2 to active pms and ps is limited due to the scavenger effects that quickly converted it into fe3 37 therefore heterogeneous metal oxides e g co3o4 cofe2o4 mno2 and so on as environmentally compatible catalysts have been employed to eliminate the generation of secondary pollutants 35 among heterogeneous catalysts cofe2o4 is a very promising catalyst for the activation of pms to degrade organic pollutants it has a stable structure low solubility high surface area and low co leaching because of the strong feco link 36 38 conversely some studies reported that the activation of pms by cofe2o4 leached a high concentration of co ions in water 36 39 40 in addition the aggregation phenomenon during the cofe2o4 crystallization frequently takes place because of the very high surface energy resulting in a reduction of the pms activation 8 39 consequently it is essential to design new materials able to inhibit the aggregation and leakage of co ions in this sense novel composites which consist of cofe2o4 and some supports can suppress significantly co ions leakage the interaction between cofe2o4 and these supports can also create new active sites and act as an electron bridge producing very significant synergetic effects 35 recently different materials have been tested in combination with cofe2o4 such as zinc oxide zno 41 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 42 mil 100 fe 43 and go 44 among them go has promising characteristics in a wide variety of applications in catalysis adsorption and energy storage 3 39 44 additionally mofs which are crystalline inorganic organic hybrid materials have also interesting characteristics as supports such as good chemical stability large surface areas and high porosity 35 38 in this study an environmentally compatible process was used for the removal of tcs in μg l concentrations from water using novel c m g heterostructures these materials were more stable than other based cofe2o4 composites as confirms the significantly lower release of metal ions as secondary pollutants consequently the purposes of this study were 1 to assess the efficiency of novel environmentally compatible c m g heterostructures coupled with pms for tcs removal from water 2 to investigate the effects of ph catalyst dose tcs concentration pms dose and reaction time on the process 3 to evaluate the degradation pathway and the effect of scavengers and coexisting ions on the process and 4 the application of the process for tcs degradation from natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all materials in this study were obtained from sigma aldrich co usa and merck co germany and were of high purity

concentration total organic carbon analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan was used for toc measurement 2 4 experimental procedure the experiments were completed in two steps at the start of experiments to consider the effect of ph nanocomposite catalyst dose tcs concentration pms dose and reaction time on tcs degradation a single factor experiments sfe was conducted then according to sfe the central composite design ccd model of response surface methodology rsm was used in experimental design to investigate the interaction between parameters first two stock solutions of 10 and 5 mg l of tcs were made in methanol and dw respectively the c m g nanocomposite stock solution was prepared as 1 g l dispersion into dw in addition the pms stock solution was prepared as 100 μm of pms into dw after that the tcs degradation experiments were carried out separately through c m g coupled with pms in 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks on a shaker at room temperature in each experiment a specific dose of c m g nanocomposite was added to each tcs solution 100 to 500 μg l it was stirred in dark for 10 min at 300 rpm to complete the adsorption desorption equilibrium 26 then the ph was adjusted 3 5 7 9 and 11 by 0 1 n naoh and or hcl next pms 2 to 10 μm was added to the solution finally the solution was shaken in dark conditions with a reaction time of 10 to 100 min at 150 rpm in the end 10 ml of samples were collected and 2 ml of nano3 0 1 m was poured into it for centrifuging at 5 min then the supernatant was collected for experimental analysis in the present study quenching experiments were conducted using 50 mm of tba and etoh as radical scavengers in addition to evaluate the effect of mineral ions that can exist in water 5 and 30 mm of the chloride nitrate and sulfate ions were added to the tcs solution furthermore to investigate the tcs degradation in natural conditions tap and well water samples were taken all these experiments were performed in optimum conditions of the ccd model the tcs removal r by c m g coupled with the pms process was calculated using eq 3 3 r c 0 c e c 0 100 here c0 and ce μg l are the initial and final tcs concentrations respectively details of the experimental design are described in the supplementary file text s2 2 5 analytical methods the dllme dispersive liquid liquid microextraction extraction method as well as gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 7890a gas chromatograph equipped with an agilent 5975c msd mass spectrometer usa analysis was used for the tcs concentrations and its intermediates determination details have been presented in the supplementary file text s3 the phzpc was measured based on asgari et al 45 furthermore the pms was quantified by a spectrophotometric method with modification of the iodometric titration method 46 the h2o2 concentration was measured with the potassium permanganate titration method 47 the concentration of nitrate and nitrite were measured by the united states environmental protection agency usepa cadmium reduction method 8192 and diazotization method 8507 using a dr 5000 hach lange spectrophotometer usa respectively electrical conductivity ec was measured by a portable ec meter az8351 taiwan furthermore dissolved oxygen do was measured through an 8403 az portable type device in the field in addition the turbidity of the water samples was detected by a portable turbidimeter tub 430 taiwan 3 results and discussion 3 1 preliminary tests the selection of the best conditions reactive and most active catalysts was made according to the highest tcs removal fig 1 compares the removal of tcs by several removal processes as can be seen in fig 1 the application of alone pms shows only 27 4 of tcs was degraded in 30 min it indicates that pms self oxidation could not provide adequate active free radicals and had not enough tcs removal 26 39 moreover it was observed that cofe2o4 alone and application of cofe2o4 coupled with pms cofe2o4 pms increased tcs removal up to 42 4 and 49 7 respectively the tcs conversion with 50 c m g 58 1 is higher than that of cofe2o4 probably as a result of better dispersion of the cofe2o4 on the mil 101 fe go support 44 according to the results obtained from text s4 xps analysis proved an interaction between cofe2o4 and mil 101 fe go in the 50 c m g heterostructure these characteristics can justify the tcs enhanced degradation with 50 c m g in addition tcs conversion increased to 67 8 with 50 c m g in the presence of pms most likely due to the effect of the so4 production 38 40 48 therefore the 50 c m g coupled with pms showed the highest tcs degradation in 30 min thus the 50 c m g heterostructure was chosen for characterization and additional experiments 3 2 characterization of synthesized materials 3 2 1 xrd analysis the xrd patterns of all the synthesized materials are summarized in fig 2 a b based on fig 2 a the xrd patterns of go and mil 101 fe go in the 2θ range from 5 to 70 shows layer structure of go with a diffraction peak at 2θ 10 2 which is like the formerly presented 44 49 50 for mil 101 fe go the main peaks at 2θ are also the same as in other reported studies 51 53 the xrd patterns of cofe2o4 and 10 to 50 of c m g heterostructures are shown in fig 2 b in the 2θ range from 10 to 70 the xrd analysis results for cofe2o4 jcpds 22 1086 represent 6 peaks at 2θ 18 3 111 30 3 220 35 7 311 43 2 400 53 95 511 and 62 8 440 39 40 most of the peaks of cofe2o4 are also observed in the xrd patterns of c m g samples with their intensities increasing with the cofe2o4 content similarly the main peaks related to the presence of mil 101 fe mof located at ca 19 33 49 and 62 5 are observed in the heterostructures again with increasing intensities with higher mof contents in the heterostructure no diffraction peak of go was detected in c m g probably because of the lower crystallinity of go and or its high dispersion 3 2 2 ft ir analysis the ft ir spectra of synthesized materials are illustrated in fig 2 c d as revealed in fig 2 c the go characteristic peaks e g 1036 1396 1610 1720 and 3500 cm 1 can be observed the peak at 1036 cm 1 is associated with the alkoxy co vibrations originating from functional groups containing oxygen such as carbonyl carboxylic and epoxy groups 44 the peak at 1396 cm 1 corresponds to the o h deformation vibrations of tertiary c oh 54 moreover peaks at 1610 and 1720 cm 1 are related to extending vibrations of carboxylic groups coo and co stretching vibrations of cooh groups respectively 44 54 the wide bands at 3500 cm 1 are characteristic of the o h vibrations of the water molecules on the surface of the samples 54 the presence of the vibrations associated with co and co groups confirmed the presence of these characteristic groups of go 49 furthermore ft ir of mil 101 fe go is also represented in fig 2 c the peak at 750 cm 1 corresponds to the c h vibrations in benzene groups 52 55 peaks at 1583 and 1396 cm 1 are related to asymmetric and symmetric carboxyl bond coo vibrations respectively 55 the peak at 1680 cm 1 is associated with co bonds in carboxylic groups are similar to dicarboxylate 52 55 the ft ir pattern of mil 101 fe go proves the interaction between go and mil 101 fe that can cause electron transfer efficiency 52 the ft ir spectrum of pure cofe2o4 in fig 2 d shows a peak at 590 cm 1 related to the coo and feo vibrations 44 the ft ir spectra of 10 to 50 c m g have peaks at 3460 cm 1 is associated to the presence of o h like the go peak in addition a peak of 1070 cm 1 is linked to alkoxy co like go furthermore peaks with a wavenumber of 1390 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 show carboxylic groups the information about xps analysis is reported in the supplementary file text s4 3 2 3 fesem tem and eds analysis the structural morphology and particle size of nanomaterials were determined using fesem and tem the morphologies of cofe2o4 50 nm in diameter and mil 101 fe go 180 nm in diameter have been shown in fig 3 a d as can be seen in fig 3 a b the fesem image of cofe2o4 has a typical cubic spinel structure 40 in addition the tem image fig s2 a indicates that large amounts of cofe2o4 were gathered due to the particle agglomeration phenomenon 39 40 56 the fesem and tem images of mil 101 fe go are shown in fig 3 c d and fig s2 b respectively as can be seen mil 101 fe could be successfully attached to the surface of go therefore a new form of composite crystal material with the polyhedron shape is composed such as the other studies 52 57 59 according to fig 3 e f and fig s2 c d cofe2o4 was formed with uniform distribution on mil 101 fe go and 50 c m g the average diameter of 50 c m g is nearly 30 nm smaller than cofe2o4 the eds spectra of 50 c m g composition fig 4 a shows the existence of elements including c o fe and co the mapping analysis of the 50 c m g shows uniform dispersal of elements on the c m g surface fig 4 b f 3 2 4 bet bjh analysis the adsorption desorption isotherm of n2 of the 50 c m g is revealed in fig 5 the bet surface area of the c m g was 13 7 m2 g and its pore volume was 0 14 cm3 g mean pore diameter 40 85 nm the isotherm of c m g is classified as a typical type iii curve with an h3 type hysteresis loop at high pressure as stated by the iupac classification which is representing of mesoporous structure in addition details of vsm and tga analyses are presented in the supplementary file texts s5 and s6 3 3 tcs degradation 3 3 1 effect of ph the appropriate amount of c m g was added to the tcs solution then the solution ph was adjusted tcs degradation was studied in the ph range from 3 to 11 and the results are depicted in fig 6 a tcs degradation slightly increased from 69 6 to 74 1 by increasing the ph from 3 to 5 after that an increase of ph up to 11 led to a decrease in tcs removal to 51 0 thus ph changes did not have significant effect on tcs removal however the maximum tcs removal was detected at ph 5 in this process the phzpc of cofe2o4 and c m g was obtained at 6 9 and 7 5 respectively fig s5 which were in line with previous findings 36 38 therefore more pms is attracted to c m g causing an increase in the tcs degradation through the so4 generation 51 60 besides the pka1 and pka2 of pms are 0 and 9 4 respectively then pms existed as mono anion form hso5 at the ph range from 3 to 9 4 and it was dianion form so5 2 at ph 9 4 when ph was higher than 9 4 the so5 2 would be reacted with pms to form singlet oxygen and tcs degradation will decrease as a consequence of the lower oxidizing capacity of singlet oxygen compared to so4 and ho 24 61 3 3 2 effect of c m g dose the effect of the c m g dose on tcs removal was examined at the optimal ph of 5 and the outcomes are indicated in fig 6 b the removal of tcs decreased from 90 6 to 74 1 as the c m g dose enhanced from 0 04 to 0 08 g l in addition tcs removal slightly increased from 74 1 to 83 8 with the catalyst dose increased from 0 08 to 0 3 g l in the first stage with an increase in catalyst dose the tcs removal was decreased due to the fast and complete pms activation which results in low efficient use of the radicals formed 26 moreover the nanoparticles exhibited a clumping effect at a high dose which made a low surface area and finally less reactivity to pms and decreased tcs degradation 62 in the second stage tcs removal increased with a rise in the catalyst dose owing to the presence of more active sites for generating so4 and ho from pms activation 26 33 38 in this study 0 04 g l of c m g considered as optimum catalyst dose in experimental conditions pms 6 μm tcs 300 μg l and ph 5 in 30 min with 90 6 tcs removal although wang et al 61 reported when sludge derived biochar catalyst dose was 1 g l tcs 10 mg l was completely eliminated within 120 min in presence of 0 8 mm pms and ph 7 2 in addition another research so et al 27 presented that tcs had completely removed in the experimental condition of mnfe2o4 dose of 0 75 g l 0 75 mm tcs concentration pms dose of 0 11 mm and ph 7 in 20 min 3 3 3 effect of initial tcs concentration to assess the effectiveness of c m g coupled with pms for tcs degradation the influence of initial concentrations of tcs 100 200 300 400 and 500 μg l on its removal has been studied and outcomes are presented in fig 6 c tcs removal increased from 73 0 to 98 4 in this process with increasing the initial tcs concentration from 100 to 500 μg l there is a hypothesis that a high initial concentration made a considerable gradient difference in tcs concentration between water and the c m g surface thus the driving force for mass transfer increased and caused an increase in the removal of tcs 63 the pms decomposition was also independent of the tcs concentration 28 in the present study the 500 μg l of tcs was considered under experimental conditions ph 5 catalyst dose 0 04 g l and pms dose 6 μm in 30 min 3 3 4 effect of pms dose the effect of the pms dose is exhibited in fig 6 d according to fig 6 d with increasing the pms dose from 2 to 10 μm tcs degradation enhances from 70 3 to 100 respectively in addition some studies reported similar results when cofe2o4 go and edta cofe2o4 were catalysts to pms activation in the removal of rhodamine b and orange g respectively 42 44 an increase in pms dose causes an increase in contact between c m g and pms this phenomenon causes the generation of more reactive radicals for tcs degradation 38 40 moreover it is reported that extra pms presence in the solution has the scavenging effect between so4 and ho or hso5 and non radical single oxygen ros 1o2 based on eqs 4 to 7 26 33 in this study the scavenging effect of pms was not detected which can be related to the maximum pms dose of 10 μm which is below the threshold pms level 0 20 mm 33 4 so 4 hso 5 so 5 hso 4 5 ho hso 5 so 5 h 2 o 6 so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 7 so 4 ho hso 4 1 2 o 2 3 3 5 effect of reaction time in the process of c m g coupled with pms reaction time was considered from 10 to 100 min the results showed a nearly constant removal of tcs with changes in reaction time thus the lowest reaction time 10 min was selected as a suitable time for the later trials the information of experimental design has been reported in the supplementary file text s7 3 4 stability and metal ions leaching the stability of the synthesized c m g can be investigated by measurement of the released metal ions in the effluent the process 39 table s7 compares the present study results with the other previous ones in that cofe2o4 is used as a catalyst for pms activation according to this table the leached co and fe ions during the process were 4 and 20 μg l respectively in addition the release of co and fe ions in the same condition with cofe2o4 as catalyst was investigated results depicted that 24 and 28 μg l of co and fe ions respectively were released from cofe2o4 which was higher than the concentrations of leached co and fe ions from c m g these comparisons proved that co ions could be less released probably due to a strong linkage between cofe2o4 go and mil 101 fe nanoparticles in addition the world health organization who has reported the co ions concentration of 1 10 μg l in surface and groundwater and 0 1 5 μg l in drinking water moreover the who has determined the fe ions level in the range of 0 05 0 3 mg l as acceptable values that turbidity and color are not developed in drinking water 64 65 therefore the released concentration of co and fe ions from c m g coupled with pms in the present research is safe for human health in addition the c m g heterostructure was stable due to the lower amount of released metal ions therefore the c m g can be useful to remove organic pollutants from water with consideration of human health because of the low release of toxic metal ions 3 5 effect of radical scavengers and coexisting ions free radicals such as so4 and ho can be produced because of pms activation by the transition metal ions present in the catalysts thus the analysis of the role of the main radical species in the tcs degradation using the c m g pms process is essential among them tba reacts quickly with ho and etoh can react with both so4 and ho 33 in the present study to ensure the reactions between so4 and ho and scavenger agents 50 mm of each tba and etoh were added to the reaction according to fig 7 a tcs removal decreased from 81 7 to 58 7 and 59 4 in the presence of tba and etoh respectively results indicated that both so4 and ho formed in the c m g pms process had important roles in this oxidation process this is in agreement with previous studies that proved that both so4 and ho are active radical species in the cofe2o4 go with the pms system for norfloxacin degradation 39 and cofe2o4 al2o3 to activate pms in sulfachloropyridazine degradation 48 since the mineral ions cl no3 and so4 can exist in water the effect of coexisting ions on the c m g coupled with the pms process was investigated in fig 7 b as can be seen in fig 7 b tcs removal decreased in the presence of 5 and 30 mm of coexisting ions chloride ions cl could decrease tcs removal from 81 7 to 60 6 and 63 9 for 5 and 30 mm respectively moreover the 5 and 30 mm of nitrate ion no3 cause diminished the tcs removal from 81 7 to 69 9 and 58 1 respectively additionally the tcs removal decreased from 81 7 to 72 3 and 50 3 in the presence of 5 and 30 mm of sulfate ion so4 as a result of the interaction between chloride with so4 and ho according to eqs 8 to 13 reactive chlorine radicals cl are produced that have less reactivity than so4 and ho 33 thus mineral ions can reduce the tcs removal due to the act of these ions as radical scavengers under a change in acidic or basic conditions 45 likewise chen et al 39 indicated that norfloxacin degradation by the cofe2o4 go pms process can be decreased in the presence of chloride in contrast yang et al 38 study reported that adding 1 and 5 mm of chloride promoted bisphenol a bpa degradation in the cofe2o4 pms process because the nitrate had a minimum effect on it 8 so 4 cl so 4 2 cl 9 cl cl cl 2 10 2 cl 2 2 cl cl 2 11 cl ho cloh 12 cloh h hcloh 13 hcloh cl h 2 o 3 6 degradation pathway the investigation of the tcs degradation pathway was carried out by dllme gc ms for the c m g pms process according to table s2 b the results indicated that organic compounds in the treated water were like fresh tcs solution fig s8 although it should be noted that other studies proved the presence of organic by products such as 3 chlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and so on in the treated tcs solution after degradation processes 3 24 25 61 66 thus the survey of the tcs organic by products after this process by other methods such as lc ms or lc ms ms is recommended however the mineralization results according to toc measurements in optimum point table s2 b indicated that tcs mineralization was about 61 8 3 7 proposed mechanisms the possible mechanism of c m g coupled with pms for tcs degradation is shown in scheme 1 first a small portion of tcs was adsorbed by c m g according to the adsorption mechanism more positive charges look on the surface of the mil 101 fe go composite as a consequence of the agglomeration of go 58 correspondingly there was a positive charge of c m g owing to ph phzpc as presented in section 3 3 1 and tended to adsorb the anions when ph was 5 67 in addition the value of pka of tcs is 7 9 and the electrostatic attraction between tcs and c m g has risen in ph pka 26 therefore the adsorption capacity of the c m g was enhanced owing to the electrostatic attraction between c m g and tcs 68 moreover the carboxylic and hydroxylic groups of c m g interacted with tcs by hydrogen bonding 58 second the pms were adsorbed on the surface of c m g 69 then fe2 and fe3 on the surface of c m g can activate pms into so5 and so4 through eqs 14 and 15 like application of cofe2o4 and mil 101 fe catalyst in atrazine and dye degradation 40 53 in addition co2 captured h2o to generate activated oh on the surface of c m g according to eq 16 like use of cofe2o4 in activation of pms for bisphenol a and atrazine degradation 38 40 after that hso5 was adsorbed on the oh groups through hydrogen bonds then co2 oh reacts with hso5 and produces coo and so4 eq 17 40 53 as a result of the reaction of coo and h co3 generates according to eq 18 40 53 furthermore the in situ generated fe3 and co3 reacted with a part of tcs to form degradation products 69 afterward ho would be further formed via so4 and oh or h2o eq 19 53 70 as the redox potential of the co2 and co3 pair is 1 92 v between hso5 and so5 is 1 1 v and hso5 and so4 is 2 5 3 1 v 38 redox cycling because of the pms activation process is promoted eq 20 38 40 moreover the o2 is oxidized to o2 thru the co3 reduction process based on eq 21 38 in the current research the c m g coupled with the pms process produced 0 0015 mmol of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 according to eq 22 70 because of hydrolyzation of pms then h2o2 converts to ho and o2 based on eq 23 71 finally these produced radicals degrade the tcs into co2 h2o and other degradation byproducts supplementary file text s8 eq 24 38 71 14 fe 2 hso 5 fe 3 so 5 oh 15 fe 3 hso 5 fe 2 so 4 h 16 co 2 h 2 o co 2 oh h 17 co 2 oh hso 5 coo so 4 h 2 o 18 coo 2 h co 3 h 2

byproducts 3 8 experiments in natural freshwater samples the feasibility of the c m g coupled with the pms process was evaluated to degrade tcs from tap and well waters to prove the potential practical applications of the studied nanocomposite the characteristics of the studied water samples are recorded in table s8 for this purpose 200 μg l of tcs was spiked into tap and well water samples to examine the diverse degradation performance in different water matrixes the removal of tcs in various types of water is indicated in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the removal of tcs is 77 1 and 54 in tap and well water respectively which are lower than that of deionized water 81 7 this difference may be due to the inhibition role of coexisting ions moreover inorganic anions such as no3 and cl can compete with tcs for the cationic sits on the surface of the catalyst and consequently causing a few decreases in the tcs degradation due to having a higher concentration than tcs in the water matrix 5 in addition the high turbidity of the healthy water causes fouling of the catalyst and decreases its removal 72 finally since c m g pms can effectively degrade tcs from tap water thus it has possible practical applications for the removal of lower tcs concentrations from drinking water 3 9 comparison with other tcs degradation reported studies in this section the performance of c m g coupled with pms developed in the present study is compared with some of the most related researches for tcs degradation the tcs removal of this process is higher than in some of the studies that have been shown in table 1 consequently the main advantages of this process in comparison with others are high tcs degradation with low pms dose and reaction time in addition c m g coupled with a low amount of pms can release lower sulfate ions into the water compared with the other process therefore it is useful for environmental and human health protection because the presence of sulfate ions in drinking water causes non pathogenic diarrhea in humans 73 moreover in this study the tcs concentration range was the detectable range in water resources 4 conclusion in this work a novel environmentally compatible c m g nanocomposite was synthesized using a hydrothermal method its activity was assessed for tcs removal coupled with pms as a source of the active radicals tcs can be completely degraded by c m g pms process moreover when 81 7 of tcs was degraded only 61 8 of which was converted to mineral products such as h2o and co2 however the investigation of by products of c m g coupled with the pms process by other methods such as lc ms and lc ms ms is recommended furthermore leaching of co and fe ions along c m g coupled with pms process was lower than cofe2o4 based composites and safe for human health moreover as the existence of sulfate ions in drinking water threaten human health the c m g coupled with a low amount of pms may come out lower sulfate ions into the water and may be useful for environmental and human health protection additionally the c m g pms process exhibited performed well in removing tcs from natural waters in conclusion the present process with c m g nanocomposite would be a promising environmentally compatible process for removing emerging contaminants in water it is recommended to investigate this process sequentially in the field conditions of water and wastewater treatment plants to achieve complete removal of tcs in addition the use of electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy to directly measure free radicals in the treated water of the c m g pms process is recommended it is crucial to investigate the novel c m g catalyst recovery with different methods such as centrifugation magnetic separation and coated catalyst with good separation potential relative to conventional methods e g extraction filtration and centrifugation is also recommended compliance with ethical standards the authors have no
