21035,marine hydrokinetic mhk turbines extract renewable energy from oceanic environments however due to the harsh conditions that these turbines operate in system performance naturally degrades over time thus ensuring efficient condition based maintenance is imperative towards guaranteeing reliable operation and reduced costs for marine hydrokinetic power this paper proposes a novel framework aimed at identifying and classifying the severity of rotor blade pitch imbalance faults experienced by marine current turbines mcts in the framework a continuous morlet wavelet transform cmwt is first utilized to acquire the wavelet coefficients encompassed within the 1p frequency range of the turbine s rotor shaft from these coefficients several statistical indices are tabulated into a six dimensional feature space next principle component analysis pca is employed on the resulting feature space for dimensionality reduction and then the application of a k nearest neighbor knn machine learning algorithm is utilized for fault detection and severity classification the effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using a high fidelity mct numerical simulation platform where results demonstrate that the presence of a pitch imbalance fault can be accurately detected 100 of the time and correctly classified based upon severity more than 97 of the time keywords marine current turbine rotor blade imbalance fault fault detection and identification non intrusive techniques machine learning feature representation 1 introduction the kinetic energy housed within open ocean tidal and riverine currents represents a highly concentrated source of energy that is both renewable and sustainable it has been estimated that the energy extracted from the u s gulf stream current alone has the potential to generate up to 18 6 gw 163 twh yr of electrical power haas 2013 additionally the temporally averaged power density encompassed within the section of the gulf stream that runs between south florida and north carolina reaches 3 3 kw m 2 machado et al 2015 while the technically extractable riverine and tidal power encompassed within the entirety of the u s has been calculated at 14 gw 123 twh yr haas 2013 and 50 gw 438 twh yr jacobson 2012 respectively while various forms of marine current turbines mcts are utilized to harness and convert this kinetic energy into electricity for the purposes of this research only horizontal axis mcts equipped with permanent magnetic synchronous generators pmsg are considered presently the most significant challenge impeding the wider scaled adoption of marine based electricity generation is its currently high levelized cost of energy lcoe in itself the lcoe is an integrated metric that factors in the costs associated with building deploying and operating a marine energy device over its lifetime furthermore this metric is used to calculate the maximum amount of revenue obtainable per megawatt hour mwh of electricity generated by the device that is needed to satisfy a minimum rate of return for investors however when this rate of return is low it prevents marine based electricity generation from becoming cost competitive with other forms of contemporary energy generation e g coal gas oil and nuclear power felix et al 2019 research aimed at reducing the lcoe is generally focused on operation and maintenance o m cost reduction for which an estimated 26 32 of the lcoe is attributed to o m costs lawson et al 2014 unfortunately due to the lack of industry maturity research relating to this field remains an under represented area despite this lack of widespread appeal promising research incorporating the use of electrical stator current analysis techniques for rotor blade imbalance fault detection is one of many promising areas of research in this field xie et al 2020 such techniques are prevalently employed because they provide an optimal means of facilitating non intrusive condition based monitoring this type of monitoring is ideal because no additional sensors or data acquisition systems are needed to obtain these signals furthermore non intrusively acquired stator current signals are commonly used to aid in both identifying and quantifying abnormal frequency excitations within the characteristic shaft rotating frequency range 1p frequency range of the turbine s rotor shaft in zhang et al 2017 zhang et al utilized synchronous sampling and empirical mode decomposition emd in conjunction with a generalized likelihood ratio glr test to demodulate the effects of ocean current turbulence and wave fluctuations affecting electrical stator current signals obtained from an oct doing so allowed for much easier fault signature identification within the frequency spectrum of the stator current signal however utilizing emd based methods for fault detection does come with a certain set of challenges specifically these include a lack of a strong theoretical foundation of the method limitations associated with the creation of edge effects strong reliance on the sifting of the stopping criteria and extreme amounts of interpolation in freeman et al 2019 freeman et al utilized a morlet continuous wavelet transform mcwt on the generator power signal of a mct the wavelet coefficient energy contained within the turbine s 1p frequency range was utilized as a fault signature for rotor blade pitch imbalance faults unfortunately the performance of wavelet based fault detection lies within the user s ability to match the shape of the wavelet kernel to the shape of the fault signature thus it is imperative for the user to have an extensive domain knowledge in the wavelet field in saidimohamed et al 2020 a bispectrum based signal processing method was utilized to distinguish between healthy and faulty biofouled rotor blade states in this research the authors applied the bispectrum analysis technique on pmsg stator current signals to investigate higher order statistical dependencies within the frequency spectrums of the signals that are not detectable when using conventional fourier based spectral analysis methods in li et al 2020 a coif4 wavelet was utilized to denoise the effects of wave and turbulence from pmsg stator current signals generated from a mct operating under different wave turbulence and current flow speeds the hilbert transform was then utilized to extract the instantaneous frequencies of the stator signals so that principle component analysis and statistical thresholding could be utilized to perform automatic imbalance fault detection in both of these works however the data was simulated in environmental test flume conditions that are not necessarily representative of true oceanic operating conditions in particular the rotor speed of the turbines were held approximately constant this makes the characteristic 1p frequency of the rotor shaft and hence the extracted electrical signals extracted from the turbine s generator relatively stationary in nature the research performed in this work is focused on using generator power signals for rotor blade pitch imbalance fault detection and classification of variable speed mcts a novel framework has been developed that possesses the following scientific merits 1 the creation of a fault detection framework that does not require the use of a multi sensor network we propose a single sensor based methodology that only requires the use of a shaft key encoder 2 the development of a novel prior knowledge guided feature space that captures the correlations that exist between oceanic environmental parameters and the deeply masked fault signatures inside of the generator s electrical power signal 3 our proposed framework incorporates the application of a dimension reduction technique i e principle component analysis on features extracted from wavelets that adaptively track the fault signatures masked within the signal this optimal fault feature representation learning step facilitates improved downstream machine learning based fault detection and severity classification the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 briefly discusses the mct numerical simulation platform utilized in this work section 3 touches upon the nature of the rotor blade pitch imbalance faults being analyzed section 4 introduces our fault detection framework presented concurrently with a theoretical background literature synopsis section 5 quantifies the results of our simulation experiments and lastly section 6 presents our conclusion and ideas for future work 2 ocean current turbine modeling and simulation while an in depth discussion detailing the creation of the simulation platform utilized for this work is beyond the scope of this paper a high level overview of the merits of the simulation platform are shared as portrayed in fig 1 florida atlantic university s southeast national marine renewable energy center snmrec has designed fabricated and successfully deployed a small scale underwater ocean current turbine oct within the south florida gulf stream vanzwieten et al 2013 the primary intention of the turbine is to be used as a modeling aid to assist in the development of a high fidelity mct numerical simulation platform the data generated by the platform is representative of the data output by the prototype oct and is explicitly used to develop non intrusive machine condition monitoring and prognostic health management solutions our simulation platform incorporates the environmental parameters affecting the temporal and spatial water velocities of ocean currents unique to the south florida gulf stream these parameters were utilized to fine tune the accuracy and fidelity of the platform so that realistic data modeled after that output by the prototype mct could be efficiently generated in large quantities the gulf stream measurements include but are not limited to turbulence intensity shear reduction rate current flow speed ocean wave height shaft power shaft rotating frequency etc these measurements were taken over a 13 month period off the southeast coast of florida vanzwieten et al 2013 specifically data acquire from this study found that the mean current speed at a depth of 20 m is 1 6 m s with the current speed at this depth ranging between 0 4 and 2 5 m s the mean measured current gradient during this time period was 0 004 m s m the maximum allowable wave height that the turbine may be operated in is 1 859 m the gulf stream turbulence intensity ranged between 5 and 20 we validated our numerical simulation platform as a whole using a blade element momentum bem rotor modeling approach which in itself incorporates a dynamic wake inflow model as discussed in vanzwieten et al 2013 the utilized mathematical modeling approach is fundamentally similar to the aerodyn aerodynamics code utilized by nrel s fast wind turbine simulator which has been extensively validated and certified by germanischer lloyd for turbine design and analysis our hydrodynamics model was also validated for calculated rotor performance calculations using nrel s wtperf with peak power and thrust coefficients of 0 447 and 0 694 calculated using our model and 0 444 and 0 685 calculated using wtperf vanzwieten et al 2013 the simulated rotor design was developed optimized using nrel s harpopt code as described in vanzwieten et al 2016a to represent a realistic 20 m diameter variable pitch rotor and the mathematically constructed turbulent flow field in which this rotor was tested is presented in pyakurel et al 2017 this flow field was developed such that it accounts for spatial flow coherence over the swept area of the rotor as suggested in pyakurel et al 2017 additionally the variable pitch rotor utilized by the platform is based upon the work done in vanzwieten et al 2016b for which the degrees of freedom of the rotor were limited to the rotation angle and velocity and incorporates the tidal turbine version of the numerical simulation platform presented in tzelepis et al 2017 other geometric and inertial properties of this rotor were based on the turbine that florida atlantic university s southeast national marine renewable energy center snmrec designed as shown above including vertical shear was very important in this study as the coupling between naturally occurring water shear and a hydrodynamic imbalance such as the simulated blade pitch imbalance is primarily responsible for introducing fault signatures into an mct generated power signal the reason for this is because while the torque power generated by a blade under hydrodynamic fault conditions is constant with respect to time the torque power is still different than that generated from the blades not under fault conditions without current shear the secondary torques created from rotor misalignments system motions and off axis forces induced by this type of fault will not introduce a cyclic power dependency into the generated power signal thus in summary it was found that larger shear magnitudes magnify the fault signature while increased measures of turbulence masks the fault signatures 3 analysis of rotor blade pitch imbalance faults rotor blade pitch imbalance faults are induced by misaligned rotor blades such misalignments create differences in the vertical shear profiles experienced by the blades and have the potential to induce shaft torque variations gong and qiao 2012 these shaft torque variations produce varying dynamic loads and vibrations whose inherent kinetic energy is transferred between the turbine s rotor shaft and generator via the shared electromagnetic coupling between the two it was shown in gong and qiao 2013 that through such interconnections amplitude and frequency modulations am and fm are imparted upon the generator s electrical stator current signal for a direct drive mct under the influence of pitch imbalance faults the shaft torque generated by its variable speed rotor can be described as 1 t t t tw t a stv cos 2 π f st dt where t is the time index t t is the torque experienced by the rotor shaft t tw is the torque resulting from turbulence and wave activity a stv is the amplitude of the shaft torque variation stemming from the pitch imbalance fault and f st is the frequency of the shaft torque variation the resulting am and fm affects both the generator stator current signal i gen t and its fundamental frequency f gen t such that 2 i gen t i vca t a pfc t sin 2 π f st dt ψ pf 3 f gen f vcf t a pff sin 2 π f st dt ϕ pf where in 2 i gen is the amplitude of the stator current signal i vca is the component of the stator current amplitude that is generated from the variable ocean current power a pfc and ψ p f are the respective amplitude and phase components of the signal that are created by the pitch imbalance fault in 3 f gen is the fundamental frequency of the stator current signal f vcf is the component of the fundamental frequency that is created by the variable ocean current power and a pff and ϕ p f are the amplitude and phase components of the signal created by the pitch imbalance fault respectively combining equations 2 and 3 allows for the formulation of the modulated stator current signal 4 c gen i gen t sin 2 π f gen dt where c gen is the am and fm version of the generator stator current signal under pitch imbalance fault conditions lastly if it is assumed that the generator outputs an ideal three phase supply voltage then the instantaneous power can be described as 5 p gen t v gen t c gen t where v gen t is the single phase stator terminal voltage the single phase power of the generator can be described similarly to watson et al 2010 as 6 p gen t 3 2 v max c max cos 2 ω s t ϕ s cos ϕ s m 1 v max c f cos 2 ω s m ω r t ϕ f cos m ω r t ϕ f v max c fn cos 2 ω s m ω r t ϕ fn cos m ω r t ϕ fn where v max is the maximum value of the supply line to line voltage c max is the maximum value of the fundamental supply current m is a positive constant integer ω s is the angular frequency of the stator s supply current signal and c f is the maximum value of the characteristic fault component in the stator current signal at the frequency f gen m f rf where f rf is the rotational frequency of the turbine s rotor shaft additionally ϕ f is the initial value of the phase angle when the characteristic fault component has a frequency of f gen m f rf c fn is the maximum value of the characteristic fault component in the stator current signal at the frequency f gen m f rf and ϕ fn is the initial value of the phase angle when the characteristic fault component has a frequency of f gen m f rf and ω r is the angular velocity of the turbine s rotor this analysis yields the following conclusions 1 rotor blade pitch imbalance faults induce shaft torque variations 2 shaft torque variations create dynamic loads and vibrations that are transferred onto the rotor shaft jiang et al 2009 3 the kinetic energy housed within these dynamic loads and vibrations modulate the generator s electrical power signal 4 the shaft torque variations create excitations within the frequency spectra of the electrical power signals however due to the induced modulation effects the non stationary nature of the generator power signals being analyzed and the occurrence of spectral leakage these excitations become masked within the frequency spectrum of p gen t traditional fourier based frequency analysis methods are unable to fully capture the entire range of dynamics that are present and highlights the need for the use of more robust signal processing techniques 4 proposed fault detection and classification framework our proposed fault detection and severity classification framework is shown in fig 2 the framework begins with a signal acquisition phase whereupon the instantaneous rotor frequency f rot and generator power p gen t signals are acquired from the turbine s generator the signal f rot is only used to determine the 1p frequency range that p gen t is band passed filtered around and is not used afterwards since the cwt is highly adept at analyzing the frequency spectrums of non stationary signals a time frequency spectrogram of p gen t is created utilizing a morlet wavelet based cwt the resulting wavelet coefficients are then tabulated into a six degree feature space where each dimension of the feature space corresponds to a different statistical index calculated from the wavelet coefficients the chosen statistical features are the mean standard deviation skewness kurtosis rms and peak to peak values principle component analysis pca is then employed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space to only the components that correspond to the directions of maximum variation within the data set finally a k nearest neighbor knn machine learning algorithm is employed on the lower dimension feature space for the purpose of fault detection and severity classification more ind depth details for each step of the framework are provided below 4 1 signal acquisition and conditioning band pass filtering is performed on p gen t via the application of a gaussian filter kernel that is mean centered at f rot s average frequency this ensures that the full width and half maximum of the kernel corresponds to the 3 standard deviation 3 std range of f rot this filtering step removes the dc offset sampling noise and any other unrelated frequencies of interest form the spectrum of p gen t 4 2 time frequency spectrum analysis a continuous wavelet transform cwt is used to generate the time frequency spectrum of p gen t the cwt can be interpreted as the convolution between p gen t and several localized wave like functions of oscillatory nature these wave like functions possess finite energy zero mean and are all derived from a single mother wavelet basis function ψ t yan et al 2014 paul 2017 ψ t contains two hyper parameters that can be tuned to increase its robustness for non stationary signal analysis the first parameter is the dilation parameter a which controls the stretching and contraction of ψ t the second parameter is the translation parameter b which shifts ψ t along the length of p gen t ψ t takes the general form ψ t ψ t b a utilizing a range of a s and b s in the equation below 7 t a b w a x t ψ t b a d t the quantities represented by t a b are known as the wavelet coefficients and are measures of cross correlation between p gen t and ψ t paul 2017 values of t a b are usually visualized via a spectrogram image whose axes represent the various translation and dilation parameters of ψ t w a is a weighting function that is customarily set equal to 1 a to ensure that wavelets of the same scale all possess equal amounts of energy lastly the symbol indicates that the complex conjugate of ψ t is used a wide variety of ψ t functions may be used when applying the cwt with the optimal choice largely dependent upon the similarity of shape between ψ t and the fault signature being analyzed since this research is concerned with analyzing 1p band specific frequency activity the increased control precision and shape of the morlet wavelet s windowing kernel made it the ideal ψ t for this research cohen 2014 a complex morlet wavelet w can be constructed by multiplying a gaussian window function with a sine wave w e 2 i π f t e t 2 2 σ 2 where i is the imaginary operator f is the peak frequency in hertz of the sine wave and t is the time in seconds cohen 2019 additionally σ n 2 π f is the parameter that controls the width of the gaussian window function where n dictates the trade off between frequency and time precision furthermore n is an extremely non trivial parameter that controls the heisenberg uncertainty principle for time frequency analysis and heavily influences the quality of results that are achievable from the data cohen 2014 through empirical analysis n was selected to range between 5 and 15 with 100 increments between these values 4 3 feature space creation and optimization the wavelet coefficients generated by the cwt are statistically tabulated into a feature space that is comprised of features corresponding to the mean standard deviation skewness kurtosis rms and peak to peak values pca is then utilized to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space by extracting out only the principle components associated with the directions of maximum variation within the data set pca is a data reduction technique whose aim is to construct a set of principle components based upon the covariance amongst a set of correlated features in an n dimensional data set cohen 2014 each principle component represents a vector in n dimensional space that characterizes the direction of a certain amount of variance contained within the data set performing pca begins with the construction of a covariance matrix covmat cohen 2014 8 c o v m a t n 1 1 x x x x t where x is the given n by m data set or feature matrix being analyzed and x is the mean value of x after the covariance matrix has been calculated an eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix is performed matlab s eig function makes this process convenient and efficient via the use of the functional equation w λ eig x where w is an m by m matrix of the resulting principal components and λ is a diagonal matrix of the associated eigenvalues the eigenvectors characterize patterns within the covariance matrix and can be viewed as a set of new coordinate axes to analyze the feature space with the eigenvalues λ represent the magnitude of the eigenvectors principle components are customarily ordered according to decreasing score value t such that the 1st principle component characterizes the direction of the largest amount of variance within the data set the 2nd principle component characterizes the direction of the 2nd largest amount of variance within the data set and so forth since t x w is the ordered n by m score matrix it can be truncated to contain only the r most relevant principle components such that t r x w r here w r is an m by r matrix and t r is the n by r truncated score matrix obtained from t 4 4 application of machine learning algorithm a knn machine learning algorithm is employed on the truncated feature space for fault detection and severity classification the knn machine learning algorithm is a lazy non parametric supervised learning algorithm that is adept at solving both regression and classification problems the decision making capability of the knn algorithm is based on feature similarity in that the algorithm assumes that similar instances exist in close proximity to each other the prediction of a new instance is determined by a majority voting mechanism in which the class of the new instance is chosen to be the same as that of the majority class of the k nearest instances neighbors to this new instance the most common way to compute the distance between instances is via a euclidean distance measure d i 1 n x x i 2 when classifying a new instance the selection of the most optimal amount of neighbors is usually done empirically for which five were chosen in this work 5 quantification of simulation results 5 1 simulation setup and data set preparation data sets were generated using the mct numerical simulation platform presented in section ii for which 50 random seeds of data were simulated for the experiment for each seed of data a generator power and rotor frequency signal were simulated to correspond to each of the three studied rotor blade imbalance fault cases i e a zero degree case two degree case and a four degree case each signal was sampled at a frequency of 10hz for a 300 s duration the simulation platform utilized a mean turbulence intensity of 10 and a shear reduction rate of 0 0035 m s m with depth the mean flow speed of the simulated ocean currents during the 300 s interval was 2 m s at a max height of 20 m above the center of rotation of the rotor to control the rotor speed an industry standard fixed gain torque τ k ω 2 controller was used to maintain an operating speed near that of maximum power production 5 2 simulation results fig 3 a displays the p gen t signals corresponding to seed 1 of the data set in fig 3 b d the time frequency spectrums of the p gen t signals are shown the bottom portion of the spectrums portray the sum of the wavelet coefficient energy contained within the 1p frequency region for which the center red line represent the mean of f rot and the two boundary red lines represents the 3std range limit of f rot while there does appear to be clear distinctions amongst the 1p band specific frequency regions within these time frequency spectrums establishing a consistent means of accurately quantifying the difference in this frequency activity through out the entirety of our data set is the primary objective of this framework to aid in developing a means of accurately quantifying the 1p band specific frequency activity for each fault cases a six dimensional statistical feature space was created to concisely describe the statistical characteristics of the wavelet coefficient energy captured within this frequency range of interest fig 4 is a plot of the pearson s correlation matrix which is used to simultaneously investigation the linear dependencies between the different wavelet coefficient statistical features used to create the feature space as depicted in the correlation matrix strong correlations exist between the mean standard deviation peak to peak and rms features additionally it is also shown in the figure that a strong correlation exist between the skewness and kurtosis features as well pca is then employed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space for which fig 5 a depicts the cumulative sum of variance possessed by the principle components here it is shown that approximately 95 of the total variance contained within the feature space can be captured by the first two principle components alone fig 5 b c show the relative percentage wise contribution that each statistical features makes towards the creation of principle components one and two respectively as shown principle component one has its largest contributions made by the rms feature and reveals a trend of increasing average wavelet coefficient magnitude with respect to increased fault severity principle component 2 is dominated primarily by the skewness and kurtosis features which is indicative of the degree of distortion that the wavelet coefficient values possess away from a normal distribution the skewness and kurtosis features take into account the extreme values of the wavelet coefficients in addition to just the mean therefore as the fault severity increases so too will the magnitudes of the most extreme values of the wavelet coefficients lastly fig 5 d is the projection matrix obtained when the coordinate axes of the feature space are aligned to coincide with the directions of principle components one and two to further increase the succinctness of the clustering within fig 5 d concentration ellipses are drawn around the barycenter of points belonging to each fault class in summary the totality of fig 5 highlights the major benefit of using pca specifically pca does not simply use a single or small subset of features when performing clustering for classification purposes instead pca creates a linear combination of all of the features contained within the feature space so as to capture all of the variance contained within a data set this in turn allows for the portrayal of the maximum amount of separation between classes lastly repeated cross validation was utilized to train the knn classifier repeated 10 fold cross validation was performed 10 distinct times on a 70 training set split the trained classifier was then tested on the remaining 30 test split displayed in fig 6 a fig 6 b shows the resulting confusion matrix where the reported accuracy confirms that the classifier is able to correctly predict the presence of a fault 100 of the time and correctly classify the severity of the fault 97 78 of the time through empirical analysis the knn algorithm was optimized to used five neighbors for which a simple euclidean distance measure was used to determine the distance between each neighbor 5 3 comparative study with state of the art when compared to the work performed by li zhichao et al we are under the impression that more insightful pca inferences are able to be made when using our method as the significance of the insight gained from using pca is not shared in li zhichao et al s work in other words the physical meaning of the features dimensions in this newly created principal component subspace is not clear after pca is performed it is stated by the authors that the t 2 and q statistical metrics represent the changes in the principal and residual subspaces respectively however it is unclear what these changes actually represent in regards to the instantaneous frequency signals used to construct the original pca data matrix in contrast our proposed framework is able to discern what the most important dimensions features i e rms skewness are in regards to fault detection when applying pca on our feature space data matrix additionally correlations that exist between the oceanic environmental operating parameters our chosen statistical metric features and the resulting effects that these correlations have on the generator power signal are also discernible for instance as the turbulence intensity of the ocean increases so does the standard deviation of the feature space also as the ocean s current flow speed increases so does the rms value of the feature space insights like these are able to be obtained because instead of constructing the pac data matrix using the denonised instantaneous frequency signals of the generator stator current which does not offer any insight or intuition towards the nature of the features used to construct this pca data matrix our framework applied pca on engineered features extracted from the wavelet coefficients themselves the merit behind such an approach lies in the fact that as fault severity grows changes in the wavelet coefficients are able to be measured and tracked however changes in the wavelet coefficients also indirectly correlate to changes within the shape of wavelet basis function therefore since the wavelet basis function is being indirectly measured and tracked the fault signature inherent within the generator power signal is also measured and tracked readers are encouraged to reference section 4 2 time frequency spectrum analysis for more details a brief comparative study is presented to compare the performance of our framework to the approach proposed in li et al 2020 to facilitate this study table 1 concisely summarizes the results of both studies with metrics that are most relevant to fault detection and diagnosis applications as shown in the table our type ii error rate was found to be 0 which is of extreme significance because it means that no incipient faults went undetected in contrast the type ii error rate in li et al 2020 was found to be 4 60 admittedly our type i error rate was found to be higher at 3 33 compared to 0 80 in li et al 2020 however according to li et al 2020 a error rate under 5 is generally acceptable within this field of study since type ii errors are more problematic in fdd based research than type i errors we consider our framework to be superior at least in this regard and attribute this improved success to the incorporation of machine learning approach within our framework from the start we were intrigued by the idea of utilizing a physics guided machine learning approach to combat mct imbalance fault detection problems in such approaches the machine learning portion of the framework is forced to learn from a hybrid information source that constrains it to learn in a manner that respects the underlining physics of the modeled marine current turbine for reference hybrid information sources are composed of data and prior knowledge for which prior knowledge is defined as being pre existent and separate from the original data source used to train the model in the context of our research our prior knowledge source consists of the oceanic environmental operating parameters that were obtained from the florida gulf stream vanzwieten et al 2013 incorporating physics based hybrid modeling via prior knowledge infusion into the machine learning portion of our framework allows it to take on a scope of emphasis that deals with online fault severity classification i e classification of a healthy state 2 degree fault 4 degree fault etc as opposed to a binary healthy vs faulty classification criteria as performed in li et al 2020 this enhanced scope has merit because it allows us to track the degradation of the faulty component over time which in turn lends itself well to future online prognostic health management and remaining useful rul estimations 5 4 computational costs analysis our framework has a moderate computational cost for the initial offline training phase that is dependent upon both the wavelet hyper parameter optimization and on the amount of data needed to be preprocessed and trained for the machine learning algorithm this initial offline phase took us approximately two days to complete however it was something that only needs to be done once per development of fault where such faults usually manifests themselves over a period of months afterwards the computational cost remained extremely low for which the tic toc function provided by matlab revealed that only 11 2640 s of elapsed time was needed to process a new sample instance new instances can be then be processed as little or as frequently as needed such as several times per hour or several times per month for reference such an instance consists of a 100 s long generator power signal sampled at a 10 hz sampling frequency additionally our framework does not require the use of a complex sensor network e g ones containing vibration strain torque acoustic emission sensors etc used in contemporary fault detection and condition monitoring systems when combined together the relatively low computational costs and low reliance on intrusive sensory networks allows our proposed framework to be effortlessly integrated into existing mct control systems 6 conclusions the objective of this research was to develop a fault detection and severity classification framework for mct rotor blade imbalance faults in the proposed framework a morlet cwt was first utilized to view the time frequency spectra of the turbine s electrical power signal next the wavelet coefficient energy encompassed within the 1p band specific frequency region of interest was extracted and statistically tabulated into a six degree feature space pca was then utilized to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space down to the two that possessed the most variance lastly a knn machine learning algorithm was employed on the resulting two dimensional feature space for fault detection and severity classification this research found that the knn machine learning algorithm correctly predicted the presence of pitch imbalance faults 100 of the time and correctly classify the severity of the fault 97 78 of the time these findings corresponded to a type ii error rate of 0 and a type i error rate of 3 33 in the future it is hoped that the robustness of this framework can be expanded to allow for the prediction and classification of an extended range of faults affecting mct systems such as bearing and gearbox faults for instance credit authorship contribution statement brittny freeman

21035,marine hydrokinetic mhk turbines extract renewable energy from oceanic environments however due to the harsh conditions that these turbines operate in system performance naturally degrades over time thus ensuring efficient condition based maintenance is imperative towards guaranteeing reliable operation and reduced costs for marine hydrokinetic power this paper proposes a novel framework aimed at identifying and classifying the severity of rotor blade pitch imbalance faults experienced by marine current turbines mcts in the framework a continuous morlet wavelet transform cmwt is first utilized to acquire the wavelet coefficients encompassed within the 1p frequency range of the turbine s rotor shaft from these coefficients several statistical indices are tabulated into a six dimensional feature space next principle component analysis pca is employed on the resulting feature space for dimensionality reduction and then the application of a k nearest neighbor knn machine

results demonstrate that the presence of a pitch imbalance fault can be accurately detected 100 of the time and correctly classified based upon severity more than 97 of the time keywords marine current turbine rotor blade imbalance fault fault detection and identification non intrusive techniques machine learning feature representation 1 introduction the kinetic energy housed within open ocean tidal and riverine currents represents a highly concentrated source of energy that is both renewable and sustainable it has been estimated that the energy extracted from the u s gulf stream current alone has the potential to generate up to 18 6 gw 163 twh yr of electrical power haas 2013 additionally the temporally averaged power density encompassed within the section of the gulf stream that runs between south florida and north carolina reaches 3 3 kw m 2 machado et al 2015 while the technically extractable riverine and tidal power encompassed within the entirety of the u s has been calculated at 14 gw 123 twh yr haas 2013 and 50 gw 438 twh yr jacobson 2012 respectively while various forms of marine current turbines mcts are utilized to harness and convert this kinetic energy into electricity for the purposes of this research only horizontal axis mcts equipped with permanent magnetic synchronous generators pmsg are considered presently the most significant challenge impeding the wider scaled adoption of marine based electricity generation is its currently high levelized cost of energy lcoe in itself the lcoe is an integrated metric that factors in the costs associated with building deploying and operating a marine energy device over its lifetime furthermore this metric is used to calculate the maximum amount of revenue obtainable per megawatt hour mwh of electricity generated by the device that is needed to satisfy a minimum rate of return for investors however when this rate of return is low it prevents marine based electricity generation from becoming cost competitive with other forms of contemporary energy generation e g coal gas oil and nuclear power felix et al 2019 research aimed at reducing the lcoe is generally focused on operation and maintenance o m cost reduction for which an estimated 26 32 of the lcoe is attributed to o m costs lawson et al 2014 unfortunately due to the lack of industry maturity research relating to this field remains an under represented area despite this lack of widespread appeal promising research incorporating the use of electrical stator current analysis techniques for rotor blade imbalance fault detection is one of many promising areas of research in this field xie et al 2020 such techniques are prevalently employed because they provide an optimal means of facilitating non intrusive condition based monitoring this type of monitoring is ideal because no additional sensors or data acquisition systems are needed to obtain these signals furthermore non intrusively acquired stator current signals are commonly used to aid in both identifying and quantifying abnormal frequency excitations within the characteristic shaft rotating frequency range 1p frequency range of the turbine s rotor shaft in zhang et al 2017 zhang et al utilized synchronous sampling and empirical mode decomposition emd in conjunction with a generalized likelihood ratio glr test to demodulate the effects of ocean current turbulence and wave fluctuations affecting electrical stator current signals obtained from an oct doing so allowed for much easier fault signature identification within the frequency spectrum of the stator current signal however utilizing emd based methods for fault detection does come with a certain set of challenges specifically these include a lack of a strong theoretical foundation of the method limitations associated with the creation of edge effects strong reliance on the sifting of the stopping criteria and extreme amounts of interpolation in freeman et al 2019 freeman et al utilized a morlet continuous wavelet transform mcwt on the generator power signal of a mct the wavelet coefficient energy contained within the turbine s 1p frequency range was utilized as a fault signature for rotor blade pitch imbalance faults unfortunately the performance of wavelet based fault detection lies within the user s ability to match the shape of the wavelet kernel to the shape of the fault signature thus it is imperative for the user to have an extensive domain knowledge in the wavelet field in saidimohamed et al 2020 a bispectrum based signal processing method was utilized to distinguish between healthy and faulty biofouled rotor blade states in this research the authors applied the bispectrum analysis technique on pmsg stator current signals to investigate higher order statistical dependencies within the frequency spectrums of the signals that are not detectable when using conventional fourier based spectral analysis methods in li et al 2020 a coif4 wavelet was utilized to denoise the effects of wave and turbulence from pmsg stator current signals generated from a mct operating under different wave turbulence and current flow speeds the hilbert transform was then utilized to extract the instantaneous frequencies of the stator signals so that principle component analysis and statistical thresholding could be utilized to perform automatic imbalance fault detection in both of these works however the data was simulated in environmental test flume conditions that are not necessarily representative of true oceanic operating conditions in particular the rotor speed of the turbines were held approximately constant this makes the characteristic 1p frequency of the rotor shaft and hence the extracted electrical signals extracted from the turbine s generator relatively stationary in nature the research performed in this work is focused on using generator power signals for rotor blade pitch imbalance fault detection and classification of variable speed mcts a novel framework has been developed that possesses the following scientific merits 1 the creation of a fault detection framework that does not require the use of a multi sensor network we propose a single sensor based methodology that only requires the use of a shaft key encoder 2 the development of a novel prior knowledge guided feature space that captures the correlations that exist between oceanic environmental parameters and the deeply masked fault signatures inside of the generator s electrical power signal 3 our proposed framework incorporates the application of a dimension reduction technique i e principle component analysis on features extracted from wavelets that adaptively track the fault signatures masked within the signal this optimal fault feature representation learning step facilitates improved downstream machine learning based fault detection and severity classification the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 briefly discusses the mct numerical simulation platform utilized in this work section 3 touches upon the nature of the rotor blade pitch imbalance faults being analyzed section 4 introduces our fault detection framework presented concurrently with a theoretical background literature synopsis section 5 quantifies the results of our simulation experiments and lastly section 6 presents our conclusion and ideas for future work 2 ocean current turbine modeling and simulation while an in depth discussion detailing the creation of the simulation platform utilized for this work is beyond the scope of this paper a high level overview of the merits of the simulation platform are shared as portrayed in fig 1 florida atlantic university s southeast national marine renewable energy center snmrec has designed fabricated and successfully deployed a small scale underwater ocean current turbine oct within the south florida gulf stream vanzwieten et al 2013 the primary intention of the turbine is to be used as a modeling aid to assist in the development of a high fidelity mct numerical simulation platform the data generated by the platform is representative of the data output by the prototype oct and is explicitly used to develop non intrusive machine condition monitoring and prognostic health management solutions our simulation platform incorporates the environmental parameters affecting the temporal and spatial water velocities of ocean currents unique to the south florida gulf stream these parameters were utilized to fine tune the accuracy and fidelity of the platform so that realistic data modeled after that output by the prototype mct could be efficiently generated in large quantities the gulf stream measurements include but are not limited to turbulence intensity shear reduction rate current flow speed ocean wave height shaft power shaft rotating frequency etc these measurements were taken over a 13 month period off the southeast coast of florida vanzwieten et al 2013 specifically data acquire from this study found that the mean current speed at a depth of 20 m is 1 6 m s with the current speed at this depth ranging between 0 4 and 2 5 m s the mean measured current gradient during this time period was 0 004 m s m the maximum allowable wave height that the turbine may be operated in is 1 859 m the gulf stream turbulence intensity ranged between 5 and 20 we validated our numerical simulation platform as a whole using a blade element momentum bem rotor modeling approach which in itself incorporates a dynamic wake inflow model as discussed in vanzwieten et al 2013 the utilized mathematical modeling approach is fundamentally similar to the aerodyn aerodynamics code utilized by nrel s fast wind turbine simulator which has been extensively validated and certified by germanischer lloyd for turbine design and analysis our hydrodynamics model was also validated for calculated rotor performance calculations using nrel s wtperf with peak power and thrust coefficients of 0 447 and 0 694 calculated using our model and 0 444 and 0 685 calculated using wtperf vanzwieten et al 2013 the simulated rotor design was developed optimized using nrel s harpopt code as described in vanzwieten et al 2016a to represent a realistic 20 m diameter variable pitch rotor and the mathematically constructed turbulent flow field in which this rotor was tested is presented in pyakurel et al 2017 this flow field was developed such that it accounts for spatial flow coherence over the swept area of the rotor as suggested in pyakurel et al 2017 additionally the variable pitch rotor utilized by the platform is based upon the work done in vanzwieten et al 2016b for which the degrees of freedom of the rotor were limited to the rotation angle and velocity and incorporates the tidal turbine version of the numerical simulation platform presented in tzelepis et al 2017 other geometric and inertial properties of this rotor were based on the turbine that florida atlantic university s southeast national marine renewable energy center snmrec designed as shown above including vertical shear was very important in this study as the coupling between naturally occurring water shear and a hydrodynamic imbalance such as the simulated blade pitch imbalance is primarily responsible for introducing fault signatures into an mct generated power signal the reason for this is because while the torque power generated by a blade under hydrodynamic fault conditions is constant with respect to time the torque power is still different than that generated from the blades not under fault conditions without current shear the secondary torques created from rotor misalignments system motions and off axis forces induced by this type of fault will not introduce a cyclic power dependency into the generated power signal thus in summary it was found that larger shear magnitudes magnify the fault signature while increased measures of turbulence masks the fault signatures 3 analysis of rotor blade pitch imbalance faults rotor blade pitch imbalance faults are induced by misaligned rotor blades such misalignments create differences in the vertical shear profiles experienced by the blades and have the potential to induce shaft torque variations gong and qiao 2012 these shaft torque variations produce varying dynamic loads and vibrations whose inherent kinetic energy is transferred between the turbine s rotor shaft and generator via the shared electromagnetic coupling between the two it was shown in gong and qiao 2013 that through such interconnections amplitude and frequency modulations am and fm are imparted upon the generator s electrical stator current signal for a direct drive mct under the influence of pitch imbalance faults the shaft torque generated by its variable speed rotor can be described as 1 t t t tw t a stv cos 2 π f st dt where t is the time index t t is the torque experienced by the rotor shaft t tw is the torque resulting from turbulence and wave activity a stv is the amplitude of the shaft torque variation stemming from the pitch imbalance fault and f st is the frequency of the shaft torque variation the resulting am and fm affects both the generator stator current signal i gen t and its fundamental frequency f gen t such that 2 i gen t i vca t a pfc t sin 2 π f st dt ψ pf 3 f gen f vcf t a pff sin 2 π f st dt ϕ pf where in 2 i gen is the amplitude of the stator current signal i vca is the component of the stator current amplitude that is generated from the variable ocean current power a pfc and ψ p f are the respective amplitude and phase components of the signal that are created by the pitch imbalance fault in 3 f gen is the fundamental frequency of the stator current signal f vcf is the component of the fundamental frequency that is created by the variable ocean current power and a pff and ϕ p f are the amplitude and phase components of the signal created by the pitch imbalance fault respectively combining equations 2 and 3 allows for the formulation of the modulated stator current signal 4 c gen i gen t sin 2 π f gen dt where c gen is the am and fm version of the generator stator current signal under pitch imbalance fault conditions lastly if it is assumed that the generator outputs an ideal three phase supply voltage then the instantaneous power can be described as 5 p gen t v gen t c gen t where v gen t is the single phase stator terminal voltage the single phase power of the generator can be described similarly to watson et al 2010 as 6 p gen t 3 2 v max c max cos 2 ω s t ϕ s cos ϕ s m 1 v max c f cos 2 ω s m ω r t ϕ f cos m ω r t ϕ f v max c fn cos 2 ω s m ω r t ϕ fn cos m ω r t ϕ fn where v max is the maximum value of the supply line to line voltage c max is the maximum value of the fundamental supply current m is a positive constant integer ω s is the angular frequency of the stator s supply current signal and c f is the maximum value of the characteristic fault component in the stator current signal at the frequency f gen m f rf where f rf is the rotational frequency of the turbine s rotor shaft additionally ϕ f is the initial value of the phase angle when the characteristic fault component has a frequency of f gen m f rf c fn is the maximum value of the characteristic fault component in the stator current signal at the frequency f gen m f rf and ϕ fn is the initial value of the phase angle when the characteristic fault component has a frequency of f gen m f rf and ω r is the angular velocity of the turbine s rotor this analysis yields the following conclusions 1 rotor blade pitch imbalance faults induce shaft torque variations 2 shaft torque variations create dynamic loads and vibrations that are transferred onto the rotor shaft jiang et al 2009 3 the kinetic energy housed within these dynamic loads and vibrations modulate the generator s electrical power signal 4 the shaft torque variations create excitations within the frequency spectra of the electrical power signals however due to the induced modulation effects the non stationary nature of the generator power signals being analyzed and the occurrence of spectral leakage these excitations become masked within the frequency spectrum of p gen t traditional fourier based frequency analysis methods are unable to fully capture the entire range of dynamics that are present and highlights the need for the use of more robust signal processing techniques 4 proposed fault detection and classification framework our proposed fault detection and severity classification framework is shown in fig 2 the framework begins with a signal acquisition phase whereupon the instantaneous rotor frequency f rot and generator power p gen t signals are acquired from the turbine s generator the signal f rot is only used to determine the 1p frequency range that p gen t is band passed filtered around and is not used afterwards since the cwt is highly adept at analyzing the frequency spectrums of non stationary signals a time frequency spectrogram of p gen t is created utilizing a morlet wavelet based cwt the resulting wavelet coefficients are then tabulated into a six degree feature space where each dimension of the feature space corresponds to a different statistical index calculated from the wavelet coefficients the chosen statistical features are the mean standard deviation skewness kurtosis rms and peak to peak values principle component analysis pca is then employed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space to only the components that correspond to the directions of maximum variation within the data set finally a k nearest neighbor knn machine learning algorithm is employed on the lower dimension feature space for the purpose of fault detection and severity classification more ind depth details for each step of the framework are provided below 4 1 signal acquisition and conditioning band pass filtering is performed on p gen t via the application of a gaussian filter kernel that is mean centered at f rot s average frequency this ensures that the full width and half maximum of the kernel corresponds to the 3 standard deviation 3 std range of f rot this filtering step removes the dc offset sampling noise and any other unrelated frequencies of interest form the spectrum of p gen t 4 2 time frequency spectrum analysis a continuous wavelet transform cwt is used to generate the time frequency spectrum of p gen t the cwt can be interpreted as the convolution between p gen t and several localized wave like functions of oscillatory nature these wave like functions possess finite energy zero mean and are all derived from a single mother wavelet basis function ψ t yan et al 2014 paul 2017 ψ t contains two hyper parameters that can be tuned to increase its robustness for non stationary signal analysis the first parameter is the dilation parameter a which controls the stretching and contraction of ψ t the second parameter is the translation parameter b which shifts ψ t along the length of p gen t ψ t takes the general form ψ t ψ t b a utilizing a range of a s and b s in the equation below 7 t a b w a x t ψ t b a d t the quantities represented by t a b are known as the wavelet coefficients and are measures of cross correlation between p gen t and ψ t paul 2017 values of t a b are usually visualized via a spectrogram image whose axes represent the various translation and dilation parameters of ψ t w a is a weighting function that is customarily set equal to 1 a to ensure that wavelets of the same scale all possess equal amounts of energy lastly the symbol indicates that the complex conjugate of ψ t is used a wide variety of ψ t functions may be used when applying the cwt with the optimal choice largely dependent upon the similarity of shape between ψ t and the fault signature being analyzed since this research is concerned with analyzing 1p band specific frequency activity the increased control precision and shape of the morlet wavelet s windowing kernel made it the ideal ψ t for this research cohen 2014 a complex morlet wavelet w can be constructed by multiplying a gaussian window function with a sine wave w e 2 i π f t e t 2 2 σ 2 where i is the imaginary operator f is the peak frequency in hertz of the sine wave and t is the time in seconds cohen 2019 additionally σ n 2 π f is the parameter that controls the width of the gaussian window function where n dictates the trade off between frequency and time precision furthermore n is an extremely non trivial parameter that controls the heisenberg uncertainty principle for time frequency analysis and heavily influences the quality of results that are achievable from the data cohen 2014 through empirical analysis n was selected to range between 5 and 15 with 100 increments between these values 4 3 feature space creation and optimization the wavelet coefficients generated by the cwt are statistically tabulated into a feature space that is comprised of features corresponding to the mean standard deviation skewness kurtosis rms and peak to peak values pca is then utilized to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space by extracting out only the principle components associated with the directions of maximum variation within the data set pca is a data reduction technique whose aim is to construct a set of principle components based upon the covariance amongst a set of correlated features in an n dimensional data set cohen 2014 each principle component represents a vector in n dimensional space that characterizes the direction of a certain amount of variance contained within the data set performing pca begins with the construction of a covariance matrix covmat cohen 2014 8 c o v m a t n 1 1 x x x x t where x is the given n by m data set or feature matrix being analyzed and x is the mean value of x after the covariance matrix has been calculated an eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix is performed matlab s eig function makes this process convenient and efficient via the use of the functional equation w λ eig x where w is an m by m matrix of the resulting principal components and λ is a diagonal matrix of the associated eigenvalues the eigenvectors characterize patterns within the covariance matrix and can be viewed as a set of new coordinate axes to analyze the feature space with the eigenvalues λ represent the magnitude of the eigenvectors principle components are customarily ordered according to decreasing score value t such that the 1st principle component characterizes the direction of the largest amount of variance within the data set the 2nd principle component characterizes the direction of the 2nd largest amount of variance within the data set and so forth since t x w is the ordered n by m score matrix it can be truncated to contain only the r most relevant principle components such that t r x w r here w r is an m by r matrix and t r is the n by r truncated score matrix obtained from t 4 4 application of machine learning algorithm a knn machine learning algorithm is employed on the truncated feature space for fault detection and severity classification the knn machine learning algorithm is a lazy non parametric supervised learning algorithm that is adept at solving both regression and classification problems the decision making capability of the knn algorithm is based on feature similarity in that the algorithm assumes that similar instances exist in close proximity to each other the prediction of a new instance is determined by a majority voting mechanism in which the class of the new instance is chosen to be the same as that of the majority class of the k nearest instances neighbors to this new instance the most common way to compute the distance between instances is via a euclidean distance measure d i 1 n x x i 2 when classifying a new instance the selection of the most optimal amount of neighbors is usually done empirically for which five were chosen in this work 5 quantification of simulation results 5 1 simulation setup and data set preparation data sets were generated using the mct numerical simulation platform presented in section ii for which 50 random seeds of data were simulated for the experiment for each seed of data a generator power and rotor frequency signal were simulated to correspond to each of the three studied rotor blade imbalance fault cases i e a zero degree case two degree case and a four degree case each signal was sampled at a frequency of 10hz for a 300 s duration the simulation platform utilized a mean turbulence intensity of 10 and a shear reduction rate of 0 0035 m s m with depth the mean flow speed of the simulated ocean currents during the 300 s interval was 2 m s at a max height of 20 m above the center of rotation of the rotor to control the rotor speed an industry standard fixed gain torque τ k ω 2 controller was used to maintain an operating speed near that of maximum power production 5 2 simulation results fig 3 a displays the p gen t signals corresponding to seed 1 of the data set in fig 3 b d the time frequency spectrums of the p gen t signals are shown the bottom portion of the spectrums portray the sum of the wavelet coefficient energy contained within the 1p frequency region for which the center red line represent the mean of f rot and the two boundary red lines represents the 3std range limit of f rot while there does appear to be clear distinctions amongst the 1p band specific frequency regions within these time frequency spectrums establishing a consistent means of accurately quantifying the difference in this frequency activity through out the entirety of our data set is the primary objective of this framework to aid in developing a means of accurately quantifying the 1p band specific frequency activity for each fault cases a six dimensional statistical feature space was created to concisely describe the statistical characteristics of the wavelet coefficient energy captured within this frequency range of interest fig 4 is a plot of the pearson s correlation matrix which is used to simultaneously investigation the linear dependencies between the different wavelet coefficient statistical features used to create the feature space as depicted in the correlation matrix strong correlations exist between the mean standard deviation peak to peak and rms features additionally it is also shown in the figure that a strong correlation exist between the skewness and kurtosis features as well pca is then employed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space for which fig 5 a depicts the cumulative sum of variance possessed by the principle components here it is shown that approximately 95 of the total variance contained within the feature space can be captured by the first two principle components alone fig 5 b c show the relative percentage wise contribution that each statistical features makes towards the creation of principle components one and two respectively as shown principle component one has its largest contributions made by the rms feature and reveals a trend of increasing average wavelet coefficient magnitude with respect to increased fault severity principle component 2 is dominated primarily by the skewness and kurtosis features which is indicative of the degree of distortion that the wavelet coefficient values possess away from a normal distribution the skewness and kurtosis features take into account the extreme values of the wavelet coefficients in addition to just the mean therefore as the fault severity increases so too will the magnitudes of the most extreme values of the wavelet coefficients lastly fig 5 d is the projection matrix obtained when the coordinate axes of the feature space are aligned to coincide with the directions of principle components one and two to further increase the succinctness of the clustering within fig 5 d concentration ellipses are drawn around the barycenter of points belonging to each fault class in summary the totality of fig 5 highlights the major benefit of using pca specifically pca does not simply use a single or small subset of features when performing clustering for classification purposes instead pca creates a linear combination of all of the features contained within the feature space so as to capture all of the variance contained within a data set this in turn allows for the portrayal of the maximum amount of separation between classes lastly repeated cross validation was utilized to train the knn classifier repeated 10 fold cross validation was performed 10 distinct times on a 70 training set split the trained classifier was then tested on the remaining 30 test split displayed in fig 6 a fig 6 b shows the resulting confusion matrix where the reported accuracy confirms that the classifier is able to correctly predict the presence of a fault 100 of the time and correctly classify the severity of the fault 97 78 of the time through empirical analysis the knn algorithm was optimized to used five neighbors for which a simple euclidean distance measure was used to determine the distance between each neighbor 5 3 comparative study with state of the art when compared to the work performed by li zhichao et al we are under the impression that more insightful pca inferences are able to be made when using our method as the significance of the insight gained from using pca is not shared in li zhichao et al s work in other words the physical meaning of the features dimensions in this newly created principal component subspace is not clear after pca is performed it is stated by the authors that the t 2 and q statistical metrics represent the changes in the principal and residual subspaces respectively however it is unclear what these changes actually represent in regards to the instantaneous frequency signals used to construct the original pca data matrix in contrast our proposed framework is able to discern what the most important dimensions features i e rms skewness are in regards to fault detection when applying pca on our feature space data matrix additionally correlations that exist between the oceanic environmental operating parameters our chosen statistical metric features and the resulting effects that these correlations have on the generator power signal are also discernible for instance as the turbulence intensity of the ocean increases so does the standard deviation of the feature space also as the ocean s current flow speed increases so does the rms value of the feature space insights like these are able to be obtained because instead of constructing the pac data matrix using the denonised instantaneous frequency signals of the generator stator current which does not offer any insight or intuition towards the nature of the features used to construct this pca data matrix our framework applied pca on engineered features extracted from the wavelet coefficients themselves the merit behind such an approach lies in the fact that as fault severity grows changes in the wavelet coefficients are able to be measured and tracked however changes in the wavelet coefficients also indirectly correlate to changes within the shape of wavelet basis function therefore since the wavelet basis function is being indirectly measured and tracked the fault signature inherent within the generator power signal is also measured and tracked readers are encouraged to reference section 4 2 time frequency spectrum analysis for more details a brief comparative study is presented to compare the performance of our framework to the approach proposed in li et al 2020 to facilitate this study table 1 concisely summarizes the results of both studies with metrics that are most relevant to fault detection and diagnosis applications as shown in the table our type ii error rate was found to be 0 which is of extreme significance because it means that no incipient faults went undetected in contrast the type ii error rate in li et al 2020 was found to be 4 60 admittedly our type i error rate was found to be higher at 3 33 compared to 0 80 in li et al 2020 however according to li et al 2020 a error rate under 5 is generally acceptable within this field of study since type ii errors are more problematic in fdd based research than type i errors we consider our framework to be superior at least in this regard and attribute this improved success to the incorporation of machine learning approach within our framework from the start we were intrigued by the idea of utilizing a physics guided machine learning approach to combat mct imbalance fault detection problems in such approaches the machine learning portion of the framework is forced to learn from a hybrid information source that constrains it to learn in a manner that respects the underlining physics of the modeled marine current turbine for reference hybrid information sources are composed of data and prior knowledge for which prior knowledge is defined as being pre existent and separate from the original data source used to train the model in the context of our research our prior knowledge source consists of the oceanic environmental operating parameters that were obtained from the florida gulf stream vanzwieten et al 2013 incorporating physics based hybrid modeling via prior knowledge infusion into the machine learning portion of our framework allows it to take on a scope of emphasis that deals with online fault severity classification i e classification of a healthy state 2 degree fault 4 degree fault etc as opposed to a binary healthy vs faulty classification criteria as performed in li et al 2020 this enhanced scope has merit because it allows us to track the degradation of the faulty component over time which in turn lends itself well to future online prognostic health management and remaining useful rul estimations 5 4 computational costs analysis our framework has a moderate computational cost for the initial offline training phase that is dependent upon both the wavelet hyper parameter optimization and on the amount of data needed to be preprocessed and trained for the machine learning algorithm this initial offline phase took us approximately two days to complete however it was something that only needs to be done once per development of fault where such faults usually manifests themselves over a period of months afterwards the computational cost remained extremely low for which the tic toc function provided by matlab revealed that only 11 2640 s of elapsed time was needed to process a new sample instance new instances can be then be processed as little or as frequently as needed such as several times per hour or several times per month for reference such an instance consists of a 100 s long generator power signal sampled at a 10 hz sampling frequency additionally our framework does not require the use of a complex sensor network e g ones containing vibration strain torque acoustic emission sensors etc used in contemporary fault detection and condition monitoring systems when combined together the relatively low computational costs and low reliance on intrusive sensory networks allows our proposed framework to be effortlessly integrated into existing mct control systems 6 conclusions the objective of this research was to develop a fault detection and severity classification framework for mct rotor blade imbalance faults in the proposed framework a morlet cwt was first utilized to view the time frequency spectra of the turbine s electrical power signal next the wavelet coefficient energy encompassed within the 1p band specific frequency region of interest was extracted and statistically tabulated into a six degree feature space pca was then utilized to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space down to the two that possessed the most variance lastly a knn machine learning algorithm was employed on the resulting two dimensional feature space for fault detection and severity classification this research found that the knn machine learning algorithm correctly predicted the presence of pitch imbalance faults 100 of the time and correctly classify the severity of the fault 97 78 of the time these findings corresponded to a type ii error rate of 0 and a type i error rate of 3 33 in the future it is hoped that the robustness of this framework can be expanded to allow for the prediction and classification of an extended range of faults affecting mct systems such as bearing and gearbox faults for instance credit authorship contribution statement brittny freeman

21036,pile driven plate anchors are typically oriented vertically during installation to function properly in a mooring system they must be rotated or keyed to an angle normal to the mooring line load keying involves reduction in anchor embedment with concomitant reduced load capacity so realistic prediction of embedment loss during keying is essential to design this study investigates the kinematic behavior and load capacity of a vertically installed strip plate anchor embedded in uniform cohesionless soil using large deformation finite element ldfe analysis embedment loss during keying is evaluated as a function of load eccentricity load angle and plate thickness the model indicates that the plate angle at which maximum pullout resistance occurs increases with increasing eccentricity the finite element simulations also show the embedment loss during keying decreases with increasing load eccentricity loss of anchor embedment increases with increasing pullout angle the model also predicts that the loss in anchor embedment increases with decreasing anchor thickness especially when eccentricity is small the simulations show anchor during keying was essentially independent of the soil elastic modulus to have virtually no effect on keying behavior for shallow anchors but elastic effects can be significant for deeply embedded anchors 1 introduction due to their high geotechnical efficiency and relatively compact size plate anchors are an attractive option for mooring floating structures deep embedment of a plate anchor offers the further advantages of high load capacity and high resistance to uplift which is essential to semi taut and taut mooring systems while the potential for plate installation in sands by suction o loughlin and barron 2012 has yet to be fully explored pile driven installation forrest et al 1995 navfac 2011 is already a proven approach in this case the plate anchor has a vertical orientation after penetration to its designated depth penetration is achieved by attaching the anchor plate to a pile follower and driving to the target embedment depth using a conventional impact or vibratory hammer extraction of the follower after plate installation is achieved using a vibratory hammer aside from the case of purely horizontal loading a keying step see fig 1 is required to orient the anchor into the direction of the mooring line load keying of plate anchors in clay has been studied previously through finite element simulations plastic limit analyses and centrifuge model tests by investigators including o loughlin et al 2006 gaudin et al 2009 song et al 2009 wang et al 2011 yang et al 2012 and tian et al 2014 a general understanding of the keying process has evolved in regard to how the anchor translates both horizontally and vertically as it rotates to its target orientation which is approximately perpendicular to the direction of loading fig 1a at shallow mooring line inclinations say 30 from horizontal the horizontal motion is generally forward i e toward the direction of loading however at larger inclination angles reverse motion can actually occur fig 1b the upward vertical displacement is of particular concern since a loss of anchor embedment leads to a reduction in pullout capacity al hakeem and aubeny 2019 the anchor resisting force during keying involves a complex process of counteracting effects on the one hand the bearing factor of the plate increases as the anchor aligns toward a direction normal to the mooring line however upward migration of the anchor into weaker soil tends to counteract this trend thus load resistance does not necessarily increase monotonically during keying fig 1c rather it can peak and decline at some point before the target plate orientation is reached although a substantial degree of attention has focused on keying of plates in clay in recent years simulation of the keying process in cohesionless soil has been limited very limited experimental data are available for plate anchor keying in sand and to the author s knowledge no analytical or numerical studies have been performed experimental validation is definitely essential in future studies but beyond the scope of this study the primary objective of the present study focuses on a significant gap in knowledge of the performance of vertically installed plate anchors subjected to different angles of mooring line load in other words keying behavior in sand 2 problem definition the present study considers the performance of a vertically installed strip plate anchor embedded in uniform cohesionless soil and modeled as a two dimensional plane strain problem as previously mentioned the keying process of the plate anchor is a large deformation problem because large vertical and horizontal displacements occur during orientation see fig 1 accordingly a large deformation finite element ldfe analysis is employed using the finite element code abaqus standard simulia 2014 fig 2 shows the anchor geometry the cases analyzed consider anchor widths of b 0 5 and 1 0 m t b 0 05 and 0 1 and embedment depths of h b 5 and 10 the soil resistance on the shank is neglected in this study thus the shank only serves to control the eccentricity of loading this study also considers only the case of the shank attached at the middle of the plate experience with plate anchors in clays tian et al 2015a b shows that offsetting the shank from the center of the plate can also significantly affect anchor performance the effect of padeye offset on keying performance is not considered in the present study but needs to be considered in future studies 3 finite element model 3 1 finite element mesh and boundary conditions the soil domain is discretized into a mesh of eight node quadrilateral reduced integration abaqus element in cpe8r while the anchor plate is considered to be perfectly rigid due to its high stiffness with a unit weight equal to that of the surrounding soil fig 3 shows a typical with respect to element dimensions near the plate and distance to far field boundaries finite element mesh used in this study based on preliminary simulations the horizontal far field boundary is set at a distance from the plate equal to twice the initial anchor tip embedment depth 2h the bottom boundary is set at four anchor widths 4b below the tip these dimensions are consistent with keying simulations in clays by tian et al 2014a a displacement controlled fe procedure is utilized in the current analysis imposed displacement on the reference point of the rigid body i e the plate anchor at the padeye is used to simulate the keying process of the plate anchor the selected displacement increments of δ t 0 001b between the remeshing steps is small enough to ensure that the lagrangian calculation remains accurate and avoid any mesh distortion preliminary finite element analyses were conducted to establish the minimum element dimension h min in the vicinity of the plate using h min b 1 10 1 20 1 30 and 1 40 different mesh re discretization strategies using a smoothing algorithm were conducted to check for mesh sensitivity based on these analyses a minimum element dimension h min b 1 20 is adopted for all simulations 3 2 large deformation analysis to simulate the continuous rotation and pullout of the plate anchor a large deformation finite element analysis ldfe is conducted in this study by using a remeshing and interpolation technique using small strains ritss approach in this approach deformation of the soil domain is divided into several small increments to avoid any excessive mesh distortion this approach is based on a standard lagrangian finite element analysis using finite element code abaqus standard for each increment when static or quasi static problems are solved with abaqus standard which is implicit solver it may have difficulty converging because of contact or material complexities resulting in a large number of iterations analyses in abaqus standard are expensive because each iteration requires a large set of linear equations to be solved after the analysis of each small increment the convection of field variables i e the stresses and material properties is performed by polynomial interpolation from the old mesh to the new one the remeshing and convection steps are repeated until the accumulated deformations reached the desired value complete ritss analysis approach is implemented by python script files using abaqus built in functions such as restart and map solution to automate the process of keying during the keying process the soil in the vicinity of the plate anchor is remolded this remolding causes a reduction in soil strength that may be recovered over the course of soil reconsolidation long et al 2009 also the anchor chain slides and cuts through the soil during uplift in an inverted catenary shape and this generates an additional frictional capacity along the length of the chain long et al 2009 however for simplification of the problem and reduction in computational time the remolding and chain effects are not considered in the following analyses 3 3 soil plate interface the soil anchor interface is modeled using the abaqus standard contact surface approach the tangential i e frictional interface between the outer surface of the anchor and soil was simulated using the coulomb friction coefficient μ tan φ u where φ u is the soil anchor interface friction angle the φ u values depend on the interface characteristics and relative movement between the anchor and soil roy et al 2015 a value of μ 0 5 is used in the present study the present analyses consider embedment depths of 5b 10b which based on experience in normally consolidated clays song et al 2006 o loughlin et al 2006 wang et al 2010a are sufficient to overcome any tendency for the base of the plate to separate from the soil during keying therefore all simulations in the present study consider a no breakaway i e fully bonded condition between the anchor and adjacent soil during the keying process using an abaqus constraint tie this constraint make the tied pair of surfaces i e the anchor soil contact surfaces have the same translational and rotational movement since the soil was essentially cohesionless and fully drained conditions are assumed the suction force under the base of the anchor is taken as zero a wished in place strip plate anchor installed vertically in sand is taken as the initial condition see fig 1 in other words installation disturbance effects are not considered in this study finite element simulations of keying plate anchors in clay have typically neglected installation disturbance effects with satisfactory results with regards to comparisons to experimental data song et al 2009 wang et al 2010 potential soil anchor separation is not considered in this study but should be considered in cases of shallow embedment depth 3 4 soil model the soil medium is modeled as an elastic perfectly plastic material with a mohr coulomb yield criterion a non associated flow rule governed by a dilation angle ψ describes plastic flow behavior the governing equations for the mohr coulomb failure surface and flow potential function are expressed in abaqus 2014 in haigh westergard space as define in eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 f r m c q p tan φ c 0 where r mc is the measure of the shape of the yield surface in the deviatoric stress plane p is the mean stress q is the deviatoric stress c is cohesion and φ is the friction angle 2 g ε c o tan ψ 2 r m w q 2 p tan ψ where ψ is the dilation angle ε is a parameter referred to as the meridional eccentricity c o is the initial cohesion yield stress in this study the soil behavior is modeled as being fully drained chung et al 2006 provide a basis for assessing the validity of this assumption on a case specific basis in terms of a dimensionless velocity factor v v b c v where v is displacement rate b is plate width and c v is coefficient of consolidation assuming that a strip anchor behaves similarly to a t bar a velocity factor v 30 for plates correspond to fully undrained conditions while v 0 1 corresponds to drained conditions for example considering a 1 m wide plate dragged through a fine sand having c v 0 2 m2 s a displacement rate v 1 2 m min would correspond to drained conditions soil parameters for the present fe analyses are shown in table 1 the soil properties φ ψ e and k o correspond to data on loose sands d r 35 at confining stress level 30 100 kn m2 as measured by rowe and davis 1982 the mohr coulomb model assumes friction and dilation angles to be independent of the magnitude of plastic strain this is recognized as being a simplification of observed soil behavior future studies of plate anchor keying should employ a constitutive model capable of simulating strain level dependent frictional and dilational behavior e g roy et al 2015 3 5 comparison to previous keying simulations while to the authors knowledge no ldfe studies have been published to date for keying in sand a previous study of keying in clay by tian et al 2014a provides a basis for evaluating the ldfe model used in this study tian et al 2014a validated their simulations through comparisons to available ldfe analysis and experiment data in wang et al 2011 the simulations were for keying of a strip anchor embedded in a uniform clay with unit weight γ 9 23 kn m3 undrained strength s u 18 kpa elastic modulus e 500s u and poisson s ratio ν 0 49 the anchor had a width b 0 4 m embedment h b 3 and eccentricity e 0 625 m fig 4 shows good agreement between the current simulations and those of tian et al 2014a 3 6 comparison to pullout measurements in sand to the authors knowledge no measured data exist for keying of plate anchors in sand however pullout test data do exist for horizontal strip anchors in sand subjected to vertical loads rowe and davis 1982 to provide some assessment of the ability of the current ldfe model to reliably simulate strip anchor behavior in sand keying simulations for the case of vertical loading of an initially vertical plate with eccentricity e b 1 are compared to the rowe davis simple pullout tests table 1 shows the soil conditions for the rowe davis dataset the strip anchors in these comparisons have a width b 0 051 m table 2 compares breakout factors n q values from the ldfe simulations near the end of keying process to the experimental rowe and davis 1982 pullout test data differences between the current fe study and measurements are within 5 4 fundamental aspects of keying behavior in sand this section utilizes the ldfe model described above to explore keying behavior of a plate anchor in sand with respect to mobilized load resistance horizontal and vertical displacements and rotations the performance of vertically installed plate anchors without shanks with t b 0 05 and 0 1 and with initial embedment depths of h b 5 and 10 are considered as shown in fig 2 the keying process is simulated using a submerged unit weight of γ 8 kn m3 friction angle of φ 33 soil dilation angle of ψ 4 and elastic soil stiffness e 10 mpa unless otherwise stated this value is selected based on the power function of hardin and black 1966 and janbu 1963 is varies with mean effective stress p according to the following equation e k p a p p a n where k 150 and n 0 5 are material constants obtained from triaxial test p a is the atmospheric pressure 100 kpa a number of authors have adopted this equation in fe modeling of soil structure interaction daiyan et al 2011 guo and stolle 2005 taleb and moore 1999 yimsiri et al 2004 roy et al 2016 further discussion on the selection of elastic parameters can be found in those studies selection of p as the effective overburden pressure was taken at the center of the plate anchor for the anchor embedment depths under consideration this leads to an estimated range of elastic moduli values e 7300 to 13 000 kpa e 10 000 is taken as representative of this range table 3 provides a full summary of all soil and geometric parameters used in the study the pullout resistance at any embedment depth can be expressed in terms of the dimensionless breakout factor n q defined as 3 n q p u γ bh mod where p u is the ultimate load force γ is the unit weight of the soil b is the anchor width and h mod is the depth from the soil surface to the anchor center which changed due to loss in the anchor embedment δ z fig 5 shows a typical relationship between breakout n q and normalized vertical displacement δ t b curve for a vertical pullout angle of θ 90 the simulations showed four major phases during the keying process i e θ 90 as illustrated in fig 5 the first phase i e from point 1 to point 2 comprises primarily elastic deformations with minor rotation while in the second phase i e from point 2 to point 3 the anchor experiences a large rotation to θ 2 45 accompanied by only a modest increase in pullout capacity in the third phase i e from point 3 to point 4 the anchor pullout resistance approaches its maximum value and it maximum rotation θ 90 the fourth phase i e from point 4 to point 5 comprises nearly pure translational movement of a horizontal anchor and a nearly constant bearing factor since the anchor embedment depth h b varies during anchor rotation from one phase to another with concomitant changes in overburden stress the breakout values were calculated using the updated values of embedment depth h mod b to isolate the effect of anchor orientation on breakout resistance fig 6 shows the breakout n q and rotation α curve of vertical keying i e θ 90 for various e b ratios the simulations show the angle of orientation α at which the maximum pullout capacity occurs increases with the increasing e b ratio for instance the maximum pullout capacity occurs before the end of the keying process at an orientation approximately where α 70 for e b 0 25 versus α 85 for e b 1 5 5 factors affecting the keying process the most critical effect from the rotation of the plate anchor is the loss in embedment depth presented as δ z b which leads to a reduction in the potential anchor capacity the factors investigated in the following analyses include the anchor padeye eccentricity ratio e b loading inclination angle θ effect of anchor thickness in terms of t b and effect of the elastic soil stiffness e and initial embedment depth h b 5 1 effect of loading eccentricity e b on anchor rotation behavior the influence of the eccentricity loading ratio e b during vertical pullout is studied using ldfe analysis considering four eccentricity ratios e b 0 25 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 fig 7 shows the relationship between the anchor orientation α and the normalized loss in anchor embedment δ z b as measured at the anchor center for a strip plate with a width b 1 0 m and t b 0 1 the ldfe results show that when e b 1 0 and 1 5 the loss in anchor embedment mainly occurs during the last 20 of anchor rotation when e b 0 5 and 0 25 the predicted loss in anchor embedment δ z b is greater and a longer distance is required to approach the same anchor rotation α which means that as the e b increased the anchor rotated at a faster rate the dependence of the embedment loss on padeye eccentricity in sand is similar to that which was reported by o loughlin et al 2006 and song et al 2006 for clay also fig 8 shows that the vertical anchor padeye movement δ t b increases almost linearly with increased anchor rotation up to the onset of phase 4 where the rotation displacement curve becomes nonlinear and translational movement becomes dominant fig 9 shows that a lower eccentricity ratio e b leads to a larger movement required for the anchor to reach its pullout capacity this larger embedment loss reduces the pullout capacity as shown in this figure fig 9 also indicates that a minimal loss in anchor embedment i e the highest potential pullout capacity can be achieved with an anchor with an e b equal at least to the anchor breadth b regardless of the plate thickness in other words once the eccentricity exceeds the plate width e b a minimal loss in anchor embedment occurs decreasing e b from 1 5 to 0 25 caused a decrease in pullout capacity of approximately 20 as shown in fig 9 the relationship between the loss in anchor embedment δ z b measured at the anchor center and the total displacement of the anchor padeye δ t b are shown in fig 10 for a large eccentricity e b 1 5 minimal loss in anchor embedment δ z occurs during the early stages of keying i e small δ t as eccentricity e b decreases the loss of embedment occurs at progressively earlier stages of the keying process for all eccentricities the trajectory approaches a nearly vertical path δt δz 1 as the anchor reaches its maximum pullout capacity for an eccentricity e b equal to 0 25 vertical displacement δ z b increases linearly with total displacement δ t b starting from the beginning of keying process these findings are similar to those reported by long et al 2009 for clay the simulations in fig 11 show that the movement of the anchor padeye for vertical pullout followed a similar pattern for different e b ratios the results show that as the e b increased the total vertical displacement δ t required to reach pullout capacity also increased once the translational movement became dominant the pullout anchor capacity developed rapidly fig 12 shows that the trajectory of the anchor padeye movement which corresponds to phases 2 to 3 and 3 to 4 in the breakout displacement curve illustrated in fig 5 is accompanied by a reverse horizontal movement as the anchor approaches its full rotation in phase 4 the vertical displacement became dominant as eccentricity e b increases the total reverse horizontal movement at full rotation in phase 4 becomes larger fig 13 shows the trajectory of the anchor center for a plate thickness t b 0 05 at earlier stages of keying reverse movement occurs during rotation during the later stages of keying the anchor either experiences nearly pure vertical motion for e b 0 5 or the direction of trajectory reverses to a forward horizontal motion for e b 1 and 1 5 the backward horizontal movement monotonically decreases with increasing e b 5 2 effects of pullout angle θ on anchor rotation behavior the following series of ldfe analyses investigated keying behavior for load angles 30 45 and 90 from horizontal fig 14 shows anchor rotation versus vertical displacement at different load angles for thickness t b 0 05 and eccentricity e b 1 0 the maximum loss in anchor embedment predictably increases with increasing pullout angle θ since more rotation is required to key the anchor the analyses indicate that the anchor does not rotate to an orientation fully normal to the direction of applied loading for example ultimate rotations of α 28 and 41 occur for load angles of 30 and 45 respectively at large displacements numerical instabilities during the simulations required termination of the analyses at the points shown in fig 14 after an initial loading stage where the plate rotates rapidly the plate rotation asymptotically approaches a constant value the loss in embedment δ z b at which the plate approaches a constant rotation angle α increases with increasing θ with small changes in saα occurring beyond vertical displacements δ z b of 0 30 0 33 and 0 75 for load angles of 30 45 and 90 even at large displacements the ultimate load plate angle α falls short of the load angle θ by 2 3 fig 15 shows that a nearly linear relationship exists between the maximum loss in anchor embedment and anchor pullout angle θ at a given e b ratio the dependence on loss of embedment of pullout angle θ for sand is similar to that reported for clay by song et al 2009 and long et al 2009 fig 16 shows the padeye trajectories e b 1 0 at different pullout angles the simulations indicated that the amount of backward movement primarily depended on the pullout loading angle θ during the latter stages of keying the direction of the trajectory approaches the direction of loading which can result in a net forward movement of the padey in the case of a flat load angle e g θ 30 5 3 influence of anchor thickness t b to investigate the effects of the anchor thickness ratio t b on keying behavior ldfe analyses are performed for pure vertical loading for thicknesses t b 0 05 and 0 1 and loading eccentricity e b varied from 0 25 to 1 5 the initial anchor embedment is set at h b 10 fig 17 shows that for the smaller thickness t b 0 05 the predicted loss in anchor embedment δ z b was greater and a longer distance is required to approach the final orientation demonstrating that a thicker anchor the anchor rotates more rapidly and loses less embedment during keying this effect became minimal for a higher padeye eccentricity e b 1 5 as shown in fig 17c fig 18 further demonstrates that a thinner plate anchor experiences a greater loss in anchor embedment δ z b during keying especially for small e b ratios fig 18 shows the combined effects of plate thickness and padeye eccentricity on maximum loss of embedment embedment loss increases monotonically with eccentricity up to about e b 1 0 after which no further embedment loss occurs increasing the plate thickness decreases embedment loss by a modest amount with the effect being most noticeable at lower padeye eccentricity the ldfe predicted trajectories in fig 19 show that the effect of plate thickness manifests itself primarily in the latter stages of the keying process and the effect is most significant for small padeye eccentricity e g e b 0 5 at greater eccentricity e b 1 to 1 5 plate thickness had small to no effect on trajectory noting that a thinner plate is advantageous from the standpoint of reducing penetration resistance during plate installation wang et al 2009 the potential drawback of a thin plate leading to increased loss of embedment during keying appears to be inconsequential 5 4 effects of soil stiffness e and embedment depth h b on rotation behavior the effects of elastic soil stiffness e on the responses of a plate anchor during the keying process are investigated for different elastic soil stiffness e i e 3 000 6 000 and 10 000 kpa the simulations are conducted for embedment depths h b 3 and 10 e b 1 0 t b 0 05 and vertical pullout θ 90 figs 20 21 and 23 demonstrate that the keying behavior of shallow anchors e g h b 3 is essentially independent of soil elastic stiffness e by contrast the predicted keying embedment loss and pullout capacity of deeply embedded anchors e g h b 10 are sensitive to e the influence of elastic soil stiffness e on the breakout n q factor for relatively deeply embedded anchors e g h b 10 is obvious in fig 20b which shows the uplift dimensionless curves for different e values the results show a trend in reduced elastic soil stiffness e leading to increased levels of displacement at which the ultimate load is approached the differences in displacement response lead to about 10 difference in pullout capacity at the end of the keying as e increased from 3000 to 10 000 kpa fig 21a shows simulations of plate inclination angle α versus embedment loss δ z b for e 3 000 6 000 and 10 000 kpa to be identical for shallow anchors by contrast the effects of e on the embedment loss δ z b are evident for deeply embedded anchors e g h b 10 fig 21b the simulations for h b 10 show that the maximum embedment loss decreases in a nonlinear manner fig 22 with increasing elastic soil stiffness e for instance the maximum embedment loss for e b 1 0 and e 10 000 kpa was about 30 smaller than the corresponding calculation for e 3000 kpa in conclusion the influence of elastic soil stiffness e on keying behavior may be considered negligible under conditions of shallow embedment but can be quite significant for conditions of deep embedment fig 23 shows the predicted influence of e on the anchor trajectory during keying for h b 3 and 10 the simulations showed that the anchor padeye trajectory for h b 10 was significantly influenced by e in the latter phases of the keying process fig 23b while the anchor padeye trajectory for h b 3 was independent of e in all anchor keying phases fig 23a however the shallow and deep trajectories were qualitatively similar in that the rotational movement was accompanied by vertical and backwards horizontal movement figs 24 and 25 which use e 10 000 kpa illustrate the influence of initial embedment depth h b on anchor keying response for h b 3 5 and 10 fig 24 shows that the anchor rotation with the loss in anchor embedment was approximately independent of the embedment depth fig 25 shows that the pre and post pullout capacities mainly depend on h b however as h b increases the loss of embedment depth where the pullout capacity reached the ultimate anchor capacity increases only slightly 6 soil flow mechanisms to investigate the soil flow mechanisms surrounding the anchor plate during the keying process a typical contour of total displacement for vertical pullout θ 90 e b 1 0 t b 0 05 and h b 10 0 using e 10 000 kpa is shown in figs 26 28 these figures present the soil flow mechanism as the anchor position evolves at various phases during the anchor keying process a fully localized soil flow mechanism occurs around the anchor when α increased from 0 to approximately 60 as shown in fig 26 this is due to the rotational movement of the plate anchor during this phase being dominant and the bearing resistance of the plate anchor remaining steady or increasing slightly during rotation as keying progresses a combination of rotational and translational movements of the anchor occur i e when α exceeded approximately 60 with the localized flow mechanism transitioning to an enlarged mechanism that extends toward the surface fig 27 as the plate anchor approached the final stages of the keying process i e the highest potential pullout capacity fig 28 a transition from a deep localized rotational mechanism to a shallow translational mechanism develops with failure bands beginning from the corner of the plate anchor and extending to the free surface for the anchor embedment h b 10 the failure mechanism initiates as a localized rotational failure during keying but evolves into a shallow translational failure at a deeper embedment e g h b 18 the soil flow around the anchor is fully localized at all phases of keying fig 29 due to the diminishing effect of the free surface 7 conclusions the keying process behavior and pullout capacity of a vertically installed strip plate anchor embedded in uniform cohesionless soil is investigated using large deformation finite element ldfe previous studies have been performed for keying of plate anchors in clays but to the authors knowledge this is the first numerical simulation of plate anchor keying in sands irrecoverable loss of embedment calculations accompanied the keying rotation which led to a significant reduction in the uplift capacity the keying process is investigated with respect to load eccentricity e b pullout angle θ and plate thickness t b this study demonstrates the peak pullout capacity does not occur at the end of the anchor keying process the angle of orientation α at which the maximum pullout capacity occurred increases with increasing e b ratio ranging between 70 and 85 see fig 6 the ldfe results show that as the loading eccentricity ratio e b increases the loss in anchor embedment δ z b during rotation decreases see fig 8 also for eccentricity exceeding the anchor width e b a minimal loss in anchor embedment i e the highest pullout capacity occurs decreasing e b from 1 5 to 0 25 causedsa decrease in pullout capacity of approximately 20 see fig 9 fig 18 also shows that a smaller relative anchor thickness ratio t b leads to a higher the loss in anchor embedment δ z b especially for small e b ratios the calculated trajectory of the anchor padeye showesthat the amount of backward reverse movement primarily depends upon the pullout loading angle θ and backward movement can be entirely absent when the loading angle θ was small see fig 16 the numerical results from the figures i e e b and pullout angle θ show that the loading eccentricity e b has a much larger effect on the embedment loss than the pullout angle the effect of t b on the loss of anchor embedment δ z b becomes more pronounced for smaller values of e b see fig 18 the keying behavior of the plate anchor is essentially independent of the soil elastic stiffness e for shallowly embedded anchors but it is influenced by e for deeply

21036,pile driven plate anchors are typically oriented vertically during installation to function properly in a mooring system they must be rotated or keyed to an angle normal to the mooring line load keying involves reduction in anchor embedment with concomitant reduced load capacity so realistic prediction of embedment loss during keying is essential to design this study investigates the kinematic behavior and load capacity of a vertically installed strip plate anchor embedded in uniform cohesionless soil using large deformation finite element ldfe analysis embedment loss during keying is evaluated as a function of load eccentricity load angle and plate thickness the model indicates that the plate angle at which maximum pullout resistance occurs increases with increasing eccentricity the finite element simulations also show the embedment loss during keying decreases with increasing load eccentricity loss of anchor embedment increases with increasing pullout angle the model also predicts that the loss in anchor embedment increases with decreasing anchor thickness especially when eccentricity is small the simulations show anchor during keying was essentially independent of the soil elastic modulus to have virtually no effect on keying behavior for shallow anchors but elastic effects can be significant for deeply embedded anchors 1 introduction due to their high geotechnical efficiency and relatively compact size plate anchors are an attractive option for mooring floating structures deep embedment of a plate anchor offers the further advantages of high load capacity and high resistance to uplift which is essential to semi taut and taut mooring systems while the potential for plate installation in sands by suction o loughlin and barron 2012 has yet to be fully explored pile driven installation forrest et al 1995 navfac 2011 is already a proven approach in this case the plate anchor has a vertical orientation after penetration to its designated depth penetration is achieved by attaching the anchor plate to a pile follower and driving to the target embedment depth using a conventional impact or vibratory hammer extraction of the follower after plate installation is achieved using a vibratory hammer aside from the case of purely horizontal loading a keying step see fig 1 is required to orient the anchor into the direction of the mooring line load keying of plate anchors in clay has been studied previously through finite element simulations plastic limit analyses and centrifuge model tests by investigators including o loughlin et al 2006 gaudin et al 2009 song et al 2009 wang et al 2011 yang et al 2012 and tian et al 2014 a general understanding of the keying process has evolved in regard to how the anchor translates both horizontally and vertically as it rotates to its target orientation which is approximately perpendicular to the direction of loading fig 1a at shallow mooring line inclinations say 30 from horizontal the horizontal motion is generally forward i e toward the direction of loading however at larger inclination angles reverse motion can actually occur fig 1b the upward vertical displacement is of particular concern since a loss of anchor embedment leads to a reduction in pullout capacity al hakeem and aubeny 2019 the anchor resisting force during keying involves a complex process of counteracting effects on the one hand the bearing factor of the plate increases as the anchor aligns toward a direction normal to the mooring line however upward migration of the anchor into weaker soil tends to counteract this trend thus load resistance does not necessarily increase monotonically during keying fig 1c rather it can peak and decline at some point before the target plate orientation is reached although a substantial degree of attention has focused on keying of plates in clay in recent years simulation of the keying process in cohesionless soil has been limited very limited experimental data are available for plate anchor keying in sand and to the author s knowledge no analytical or numerical studies have been performed experimental validation is definitely essential in future studies but beyond the scope of this study the primary objective of the present study focuses on a significant gap in knowledge of the performance of vertically installed plate anchors subjected to different angles of mooring line load in other words keying behavior in sand 2 problem definition the present study considers the performance of a vertically installed strip plate anchor embedded in uniform cohesionless soil and modeled as a two dimensional plane strain problem as previously mentioned the keying process of the plate anchor is a large deformation problem because large vertical and horizontal displacements occur during orientation see fig 1 accordingly a large deformation finite element ldfe analysis is employed using the finite element code abaqus standard simulia 2014 fig 2 shows the anchor geometry the cases analyzed consider anchor widths of b 0 5 and 1 0 m t b 0 05 and 0 1 and embedment depths of h b 5 and 10 the soil resistance on the shank is neglected in this study thus the shank only serves to control the eccentricity of loading this study also considers only the case of the shank attached at the middle of the plate experience with plate anchors in clays tian et al 2015a b shows that offsetting the shank from the center of the plate can also significantly affect anchor performance the effect of padeye offset on keying performance is not considered in the present study but needs to be considered in future studies 3 finite element model 3 1 finite element mesh and boundary conditions the soil domain is discretized into a mesh of eight node quadrilateral reduced integration abaqus element in cpe8r while the anchor plate is considered to be perfectly rigid due to its high stiffness with a unit weight equal to that of the surrounding soil fig 3 shows a typical with respect to element dimensions near the plate and distance to far field boundaries finite element mesh used in this study based on preliminary simulations the horizontal far field boundary is set at a distance from the plate equal to twice the initial anchor tip embedment depth 2h the bottom boundary is set at four anchor widths 4b below the tip these dimensions are consistent with keying simulations in clays by tian et al 2014a a displacement controlled fe procedure is utilized in the current analysis imposed displacement on the reference point of the rigid body i e the plate anchor at the padeye is used to simulate the keying process of the plate anchor the selected displacement increments of δ t 0 001b between the remeshing steps is small enough to ensure that the lagrangian calculation remains accurate and avoid any mesh distortion preliminary finite element analyses were conducted to establish the minimum element dimension h min in the vicinity of the plate using h min b 1 10 1 20 1 30 and 1 40 different mesh re discretization strategies using a smoothing algorithm were conducted to check for mesh sensitivity based on these analyses a minimum element dimension h min b 1 20 is adopted for all simulations 3 2 large deformation analysis to simulate the continuous rotation and pullout of the plate anchor a large deformation finite element analysis ldfe is conducted in this study by using a remeshing and interpolation technique using small strains ritss approach in this approach deformation of the soil domain is divided into several small increments to avoid any excessive mesh distortion this approach is based on a standard lagrangian finite element analysis using finite element code abaqus standard for each increment when static or quasi static problems are solved with abaqus standard which is implicit solver it may have difficulty converging because of contact or material complexities resulting in a large number of iterations analyses in abaqus standard are expensive because each iteration requires a large set of linear equations to be solved after the analysis of each small increment the convection of field variables i e the stresses and material properties is performed by polynomial interpolation from the old mesh to the new one the remeshing and convection steps are repeated until the accumulated deformations reached the desired value complete ritss analysis approach is implemented by python script files using abaqus built in functions such as restart and map solution to automate the process of keying during the keying process the soil in the vicinity of the plate anchor is remolded this remolding causes a reduction in soil strength that may be recovered over the course of soil reconsolidation long et al 2009 also the anchor chain slides and cuts through the soil during uplift in an inverted catenary shape and this generates an additional frictional capacity along the length of the chain long et al 2009 however for simplification of the problem and reduction in computational time the remolding and chain effects are not considered in the following analyses 3 3 soil plate interface the soil anchor interface is modeled using the abaqus standard contact surface approach the tangential i e frictional interface between the outer surface of the anchor and soil was simulated using the coulomb friction coefficient μ tan φ u where φ u is the soil anchor interface friction angle the φ u values depend on the interface characteristics and relative movement between the anchor and soil roy et al 2015 a value of μ 0 5 is used in the present study the present analyses consider embedment depths of 5b 10b which based on experience in normally consolidated clays song et al 2006 o loughlin et al 2006 wang et al 2010a are sufficient to overcome any tendency for the base of the plate to separate from the soil during keying therefore all simulations in the present study consider a no breakaway i e fully bonded condition between the anchor and adjacent soil during the keying process using an abaqus constraint tie this constraint make the tied pair of surfaces i e the anchor soil contact surfaces have the same translational and rotational movement since the soil was essentially cohesionless and fully drained conditions are assumed the suction force under the base of the anchor is taken as zero a wished in place strip plate anchor installed vertically in sand is taken as the initial condition see fig 1 in other words installation disturbance effects are not considered in this study finite element simulations of keying plate anchors in clay have typically neglected installation disturbance effects with satisfactory results with regards to comparisons to experimental data song et al 2009 wang et al 2010 potential soil anchor separation is not considered in this study but should be considered in cases of shallow embedment depth 3 4 soil model the soil medium is modeled as an elastic perfectly plastic material with a mohr coulomb yield criterion a non associated flow rule governed by a dilation angle ψ describes plastic flow behavior the governing equations for the mohr coulomb failure surface and flow potential function are expressed in abaqus 2014 in haigh westergard space as define in eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 f r m c q p tan φ c 0 where r mc is the measure of the shape of the yield surface in the deviatoric stress plane p is the mean stress q is the deviatoric stress c is cohesion and φ is the friction angle 2 g ε c o tan ψ 2 r m w q 2 p tan ψ where ψ is the dilation angle ε is a parameter referred to as the meridional eccentricity c o is the initial cohesion yield stress in this study the soil behavior is modeled as being fully drained chung et al 2006 provide a basis for assessing the validity of this assumption on a case specific basis in terms of a dimensionless velocity factor v v b c v where v is displacement rate b is plate width and c v is coefficient of consolidation assuming that a strip anchor behaves similarly to a t bar a velocity factor v 30 for plates correspond to fully undrained conditions while v 0 1 corresponds to drained conditions for example considering a 1 m wide plate dragged through a fine sand having c v 0 2 m2 s a displacement rate v 1 2 m min would correspond to drained conditions soil parameters for the present fe analyses are shown in table 1 the soil properties φ ψ e and k o correspond to data on loose sands d r 35 at confining stress level 30 100 kn m2 as measured by rowe and davis 1982 the mohr coulomb model assumes friction and dilation angles to be independent of the magnitude of plastic strain this is recognized as being a simplification of observed soil behavior future studies of plate anchor keying should employ a constitutive model capable of simulating strain level dependent frictional and dilational behavior e g roy et al 2015 3 5 comparison to previous keying simulations while to the authors knowledge no ldfe studies have been published to date for keying in sand a previous study of keying in clay by tian et al 2014a provides a basis for evaluating the ldfe model used in this study tian et al 2014a validated their simulations through comparisons to available ldfe analysis and experiment data in wang et al 2011 the simulations were for keying of a strip anchor embedded in a uniform clay with unit weight γ 9 23 kn m3 undrained strength s u 18 kpa elastic modulus e 500s u and poisson s ratio ν 0 49 the anchor had a width b 0 4 m embedment h b 3 and eccentricity e 0 625 m fig 4 shows good agreement between the current simulations and those of tian et al 2014a 3 6 comparison to pullout measurements in sand to the authors knowledge no measured data exist for keying of plate anchors in sand however pullout test data do exist for horizontal strip anchors in sand subjected to vertical loads rowe and davis 1982 to provide some assessment of the ability of the current ldfe model to reliably simulate strip anchor behavior in sand keying simulations for the case of vertical loading of an initially vertical plate with eccentricity e b 1 are compared to the rowe davis simple pullout tests table 1 shows the soil conditions for the rowe davis dataset the strip anchors in these comparisons have a width b 0 051 m table 2 compares breakout factors n q values from the ldfe simulations near the end of keying process to the experimental rowe and davis 1982 pullout test data differences between the current fe study and measurements are within 5 4 fundamental aspects of keying behavior in sand this section utilizes the ldfe model described above to explore keying behavior of a plate anchor in sand with respect to mobilized load resistance horizontal and vertical displacements and rotations the performance of vertically installed plate anchors without shanks with t b 0 05 and 0 1 and with initial embedment depths of h b 5 and 10 are considered as shown in fig 2 the keying process is simulated using a submerged unit weight of γ 8 kn m3 friction angle of φ 33 soil dilation angle of ψ 4 and elastic soil stiffness e 10 mpa unless otherwise stated this value is selected based on the power function of hardin and black 1966 and janbu 1963 is varies with mean effective stress p according to the following equation e k p a p p a n where k 150 and n 0 5 are material constants obtained from triaxial test p a is the atmospheric pressure 100 kpa a number of authors have adopted this equation in fe modeling of soil structure interaction daiyan et al 2011 guo and stolle 2005 taleb and moore 1999 yimsiri et al 2004 roy et al 2016 further discussion on the selection of elastic parameters can be found in those studies selection of p as the effective overburden pressure was taken at the center of the plate anchor for the anchor embedment depths under consideration this leads to an estimated range of elastic moduli values e 7300 to 13 000 kpa e 10 000 is taken as representative of this range table 3 provides a full summary of all soil and geometric parameters used in the study the pullout resistance at any embedment depth can be expressed in terms of the dimensionless breakout factor n q defined as 3 n q p u γ bh mod where p u is the ultimate load force γ is the unit weight of the soil b is the anchor width and h mod is the depth from the soil surface to the anchor center which changed due to loss in the anchor embedment δ z fig 5 shows a typical relationship between breakout n q and normalized vertical displacement δ t b curve for a vertical pullout angle of θ 90 the simulations showed four major phases during the keying process i e θ 90 as illustrated in fig 5 the first phase i e from point 1 to point 2 comprises primarily elastic deformations with minor rotation while in the second phase i e from point 2 to point 3 the anchor experiences a large rotation to θ 2 45 accompanied by only a modest increase in pullout capacity in the third phase i e from point 3 to point 4 the anchor pullout resistance approaches its maximum value and it maximum rotation θ 90 the fourth phase i e from point 4 to point 5 comprises nearly pure translational movement of a horizontal anchor and a nearly constant bearing factor since the anchor embedment depth h b varies during anchor rotation from one phase to another with concomitant changes in overburden stress the breakout values were calculated using the updated values of embedment depth h mod b to isolate the effect of anchor orientation on breakout resistance fig 6 shows the breakout n q and rotation α curve of vertical keying i e θ 90 for various e b ratios the simulations show the angle of orientation α at which the maximum pullout capacity occurs increases with the increasing e b ratio for instance the maximum pullout capacity occurs before the end of the keying process at an orientation approximately where α 70 for e b 0 25 versus α 85 for e b 1 5 5 factors affecting the keying process the most critical effect from the rotation of the plate anchor is the loss in embedment depth presented as δ z b which leads to a reduction in the potential anchor capacity the factors investigated in the following analyses include the anchor padeye eccentricity ratio e b loading inclination angle θ effect of anchor thickness in terms of t b and effect of the elastic soil stiffness e and initial embedment depth h b 5 1 effect of loading eccentricity e b on anchor rotation behavior the influence of the eccentricity loading ratio e b during vertical pullout is studied using ldfe analysis considering four eccentricity ratios e b 0 25 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 fig 7 shows the relationship between the anchor orientation α and the normalized loss in anchor embedment δ z b as measured at the anchor center for a strip plate with a width b 1 0 m and t b 0 1 the ldfe results show that when e b 1 0 and 1 5 the loss in anchor embedment mainly occurs during the last 20 of anchor rotation when e b 0 5 and 0 25 the predicted loss in anchor embedment δ z b is greater and a longer distance is required to approach the same anchor rotation α which means that as the e b increased the anchor rotated at a faster rate the dependence of the embedment loss on padeye eccentricity in sand is similar to that which was reported by o loughlin et al 2006 and song et al 2006 for clay also fig 8 shows that the vertical anchor padeye movement δ t b increases almost linearly with increased anchor rotation up to the onset of phase 4 where the rotation displacement curve becomes nonlinear and translational movement becomes dominant fig 9 shows that a lower eccentricity ratio e b leads to a larger movement required for the anchor to reach its pullout capacity this larger embedment loss reduces the pullout capacity as shown in this figure fig 9 also indicates that a minimal loss in anchor embedment i e the highest potential pullout capacity can be achieved with an anchor with an e b equal at least to the anchor breadth b regardless of the plate thickness in other words once the eccentricity exceeds the plate width e b a minimal loss in anchor embedment occurs decreasing e b from 1 5 to 0 25 caused a decrease in pullout capacity of approximately 20 as shown in fig 9 the relationship between the loss in anchor embedment δ z b measured at the anchor center and the total displacement of the anchor padeye δ t b are shown in fig 10 for a large eccentricity e b 1 5 minimal loss in anchor embedment δ z occurs during the early stages of keying i e small δ t as eccentricity e b decreases the loss of embedment occurs at progressively earlier stages of the keying process for all eccentricities the trajectory approaches a nearly vertical path δt δz 1 as the anchor reaches its maximum pullout capacity for an eccentricity e b equal to 0 25 vertical displacement δ z b increases linearly with total displacement δ t b starting from the beginning of keying process these findings are similar to those reported by long et al 2009 for clay the simulations in fig 11 show that the movement of the anchor padeye for vertical pullout followed a similar pattern for different e b ratios the results show that as the e b increased the total vertical displacement δ t required to reach pullout capacity also increased once the translational movement became dominant the pullout anchor capacity developed rapidly fig 12 shows that the trajectory of the anchor padeye movement which corresponds to phases 2 to 3 and 3 to 4 in the breakout displacement curve illustrated in fig 5 is accompanied by a reverse horizontal movement as the anchor approaches its full rotation in phase 4 the vertical displacement became dominant as eccentricity e b increases the total reverse horizontal movement at full rotation in phase 4 becomes larger fig 13 shows the trajectory of the anchor center for a plate thickness t b 0 05 at earlier stages of keying reverse movement occurs during rotation during the later stages of keying the anchor either experiences nearly pure vertical motion for e b 0 5 or the direction of trajectory reverses to a forward horizontal motion for e b 1 and 1 5 the backward horizontal movement monotonically decreases with increasing e b 5 2 effects of pullout angle θ on anchor rotation behavior the following series of ldfe analyses investigated keying behavior for load angles 30 45 and 90 from horizontal fig 14 shows anchor rotation versus vertical displacement at different load angles for thickness t b 0 05 and eccentricity e b 1 0 the maximum loss in anchor embedment predictably increases with increasing pullout angle θ since more rotation is required to key the anchor the analyses indicate that the anchor does not rotate to an orientation fully normal to the direction of applied loading for example ultimate rotations of α 28 and 41 occur for load angles of 30 and 45 respectively at large displacements numerical instabilities during the simulations required termination of the analyses at the points shown in fig 14 after an initial loading stage where the plate rotates rapidly the plate rotation asymptotically approaches a constant value the loss in embedment δ z b at which the plate approaches a constant rotation angle α increases with increasing θ with small changes in saα occurring beyond vertical displacements δ z b of 0 30 0 33 and 0 75 for load angles of 30 45 and 90 even at large displacements the ultimate load plate angle α falls short of the load angle θ by 2 3 fig 15 shows that a nearly linear relationship exists between the maximum loss in anchor embedment and anchor pullout angle θ at a given e b ratio the dependence on loss of embedment of pullout angle θ for sand is similar to that reported for clay by song et al 2009 and long et al 2009 fig 16 shows the padeye trajectories e b 1 0 at different pullout angles the simulations indicated that the amount of backward movement primarily depended on the pullout loading angle θ during the latter stages of keying the direction of the trajectory approaches the direction of loading which can result in a net forward movement of the padey in the case of a flat load angle e g θ 30 5 3 influence of anchor thickness t b to investigate the effects of the anchor thickness ratio t b on keying behavior ldfe analyses are performed for pure vertical loading for thicknesses t b 0 05 and 0 1 and loading eccentricity e b varied from 0 25 to 1 5 the initial anchor embedment is set at h b 10 fig 17 shows that for the smaller thickness t b 0 05 the predicted loss in anchor embedment δ z b was greater and a longer distance is required to approach the final orientation demonstrating that a thicker anchor the anchor rotates more rapidly and loses less embedment during keying this effect became minimal for a higher padeye eccentricity e b 1 5 as shown in fig 17c fig 18 further demonstrates that a thinner plate anchor experiences a greater loss in anchor embedment δ z b during keying especially for small e b ratios fig 18 shows the combined effects of plate thickness and padeye eccentricity on maximum loss of embedment embedment loss increases monotonically with eccentricity up to about e b 1 0 after which no further embedment loss occurs increasing the plate thickness decreases embedment loss by a modest amount with the effect being most noticeable at lower padeye eccentricity the ldfe predicted trajectories in fig 19 show that the effect of plate thickness manifests itself primarily in the latter stages of the keying process and the effect is most significant for small padeye eccentricity e g e b 0 5 at greater eccentricity e b 1 to 1 5 plate thickness had small to no effect on trajectory noting that a thinner plate is advantageous from the standpoint of reducing penetration resistance during plate installation wang et al 2009 the potential drawback of a thin plate leading to increased loss of embedment during keying appears to be inconsequential 5 4 effects of soil stiffness e and embedment depth h b on rotation behavior the effects of elastic soil stiffness e on the responses of a plate anchor during the keying process are investigated for different elastic soil stiffness e i e 3 000 6 000 and 10 000 kpa the simulations are conducted for embedment depths h b 3 and 10 e b 1 0 t b 0 05 and vertical pullout θ 90 figs 20 21 and 23 demonstrate that the keying behavior of shallow anchors e g h b 3 is essentially independent of soil elastic stiffness e by contrast the predicted keying embedment loss and pullout capacity of deeply embedded anchors e g h b 10 are sensitive to e the influence of elastic soil stiffness e on the breakout n q factor for relatively deeply embedded anchors e g h b 10 is obvious in fig 20b which shows the uplift dimensionless curves for different e values the results show a trend in reduced elastic soil stiffness e leading to increased levels of displacement at which the ultimate load is approached the differences in displacement response lead to about 10 difference in pullout capacity at the end of the keying as e increased from 3000 to 10 000 kpa fig 21a shows simulations of plate inclination angle α versus embedment loss δ z b for e 3 000 6 000 and 10 000 kpa to be identical for shallow anchors by contrast the effects of e on the embedment loss δ z b are evident for deeply embedded anchors e g h b 10 fig 21b the simulations for h b 10 show that the maximum embedment loss decreases in a nonlinear manner fig 22 with increasing elastic soil stiffness e for instance the maximum embedment loss for e b 1 0 and e 10 000 kpa was about 30 smaller than the corresponding calculation for e 3000 kpa in conclusion the influence of elastic soil stiffness e on keying behavior may be considered negligible under conditions of shallow embedment but can be quite significant for conditions of deep embedment fig 23 shows the predicted influence of e on the anchor trajectory during keying for h b 3 and 10 the simulations showed that the anchor padeye trajectory for h b 10 was significantly influenced by e in the latter phases of the keying process fig 23b while the anchor padeye trajectory for h b 3 was independent of e in all anchor keying phases fig 23a however the shallow and deep trajectories were qualitatively similar in that the rotational movement was accompanied by vertical and backwards horizontal movement figs 24 and 25 which use e 10 000 kpa illustrate the influence of initial embedment depth h b on anchor keying response for h b 3 5 and 10 fig 24 shows that the anchor rotation with the loss in anchor embedment was approximately independent of the embedment depth fig 25 shows that the pre and post pullout capacities mainly depend on h b however as h b increases the loss of embedment depth where the pullout capacity reached the ultimate anchor capacity increases only slightly 6 soil flow mechanisms to investigate the soil flow mechanisms surrounding the anchor plate during the keying process a typical contour of total displacement for vertical pullout θ 90 e b 1 0 t b 0 05 and h b 10 0 using e 10 000 kpa is shown in figs 26 28 these figures present the soil flow mechanism as the anchor position evolves at various phases during the anchor keying process a fully localized soil flow mechanism occurs around the anchor when α increased from 0 to approximately 60 as shown in fig 26 this is due to the rotational movement of the plate anchor during this phase being dominant and the bearing resistance of the plate anchor remaining steady or increasing slightly during rotation as keying progresses a combination of rotational and translational movements of the anchor occur i e when α exceeded approximately 60 with the localized flow mechanism transitioning to an enlarged mechanism that extends toward the surface fig 27 as the plate anchor approached the final stages of the keying process i e the highest potential pullout capacity fig 28 a transition from a deep localized rotational mechanism to a shallow translational mechanism develops with failure bands beginning from the corner of the plate anchor and extending to the free surface for the anchor embedment h b 10 the failure mechanism initiates as a localized rotational failure during keying but evolves into a shallow translational failure at a deeper embedment e g h b 18 the soil flow around the anchor is fully localized at all phases of keying fig 29 due to the diminishing effect of the free surface 7 conclusions the keying process behavior and pullout capacity of a vertically installed strip plate anchor embedded in uniform cohesionless soil is investigated using large deformation finite element ldfe previous studies have been performed for keying of plate anchors in clays but to the authors knowledge this is the first numerical simulation of plate anchor keying in sands irrecoverable loss of embedment calculations accompanied the keying rotation which led to a significant reduction in the uplift capacity the keying process is investigated with respect to load eccentricity e b pullout angle θ and plate thickness t b this study demonstrates the peak pullout capacity does not occur at the end of the anchor keying process the angle of orientation α at which the maximum pullout capacity occurred increases with increasing e b ratio ranging between 70 and 85 see fig 6 the ldfe results show that as the loading eccentricity ratio e b increases the loss in anchor embedment δ z b during rotation decreases see fig 8 also for eccentricity exceeding the anchor width e b a minimal loss in anchor embedment i e the highest pullout capacity occurs decreasing e b from 1 5 to 0 25 causedsa decrease in pullout capacity of approximately 20 see fig 9 fig 18 also shows that a smaller relative anchor thickness ratio t b leads to a higher the loss in anchor embedment δ z b especially for small e b ratios the calculated trajectory of the anchor padeye showesthat the amount of backward reverse movement primarily depends upon the pullout loading angle θ and backward movement can be entirely absent when the loading angle θ was small see fig 16 the numerical results from the figures i e e b and pullout angle θ show that the loading eccentricity e b has a much larger effect on the embedment loss than the pullout angle the effect of t b on the loss of anchor embedment δ z b becomes more pronounced for smaller values of e b see fig 18 the keying behavior of the plate anchor is essentially independent of the soil elastic stiffness e for shallowly embedded anchors but it is influenced by e for deeply embedded anchors credit authorship contribution statement nabil al hakeem collaborated with supervisor charles aubeny in the basic conception of this study he also performed the numerical formal

21037,explosives are considered an effective method of breaking an ice jam or clearing an ice barrier as underwater explosions can have a severely destructive impact on ice sheets investigating the damage mechanism and dynamic characteristics of the ice sheet is significant this paper presents a study on the ice damage characteristics subjected to single and combination explosives utilizing the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale technique to solve the fluid structure interaction fsi processes between the fluid and ice structures the numerical model is validated by reference results and experimental data the damage evolution and mechanism of the ice sheet are analysed the different responses of the ice sheet subjected to underwater contact and underwater explosions are discussed in addition the critical explosion charge just sufficient to break the ice is investigated moreover the ice damage characteristics from two explosives in combination are analysed the results demonstrate that the damage to the ice sheet induced by the underwater explosion is significantly larger than an underwater contact explosion with an equal charge mass the blast efficiency of the two combination explosives with a suitable spacing distance in the horizontal direction is higher than that of a single explosive with an equal charge mass the analyses and results provide a reference for the ice breaking engineering keywords ice sheet damage fluid structure interaction underwater explosion single explosive combination explosives 1 introduction structural dynamic behaviour as exhibited by warships jin and ding 2011 langrand et al 2009 sprague and geers 2006 zhang et al 2005 underwater vehicles zong et al 1999 2000 rc dams li et al 2018 wang et al 2014a zhang et al 2014a and ice sheets has drawn attention in recent years regarding explosion load and impact dynamic effects an important task is to predict the explosion effects and damage efficiency for the design of structures or damage assessment klenow and bradley 2006 specifically significant loads including shock waves and bubble pulsation have short but high intensities for underwater explosions which can be destructive to structures barras et al 2012 chen et al 2009 hsu et al 2014 kim and shin 2008 li and rong 2011 2012 petrov and schmidt 2015 phan et al 2019 shin 2004 wang et al 2014b yang et al 2019b zhang et al 2011 2013 underwater blasts below the ice sheet are an important method of cleaning ice jams or dredging channels owing to their high efficiency the damage characteristics of the ice sheet under different charge conditions are of great significance many severely cold regions such as the yellow river will experience ice jam disasters of varying degrees each year due to their special geographical location and conditions this can affect the normal production and life of the local people for this reason blasting methods are used to clear river ice jams during the ice jam season of the yellow river each year the underwater blasting method for breaking the ice can effectively utilise the energy of explosives and achieve safe and efficient blasting effects for underwater explosion engineering most research is focused on ship engineering ge et al 2017 studied the similarities between the model and prototype based on the centrifugal similarity criteria using the ale method of the ls dyna code the results showed good agreement with the centrifugal experiment results gannon 2019 focused on simulating the interaction between an underwater explosion a submerged cylinder and a free surface or rigid bottom accounting for shock wave propagation cavitation and gas bubble migration jetting jin et al 2018 studied the dynamics of a sandwich structure owing to the interaction between the underwater explosion bubble and structure three different regimes of bubble behaviour were distinguished wang et al 2014b and meng et al 2019 numerically investigated the shock wave propagation characteristics and cavitation effects of an underwater explosion near a plate structure shock wave and bubble pulsation loads are the main loads during an underwater explosion process these extremely complicated processes can cause severe damage to structures in the field of underwater blast for ice breaking most achievements concerning ice sheet damage under blast loads are based on experimental results barash 1962 and mellor 1983 conducted a series of experiments on underwater explosion for ice breaking the formulas were summarized to predict the range of damage to ice subjected to underwater explosions which can be utilised in explosive design theoretical and experimental research on needle ice and snow ice behaviour under shock and explosive loading have been conducted orlov 2019 orlova and orlov 2015 conducting underwater explosion test research is costly dangerous and time consuming there are many limitations such as the limitation of winter environmental conditions and the transportation storage of explosives regarding numerical research mansour and seireg 1983 developed a computer program for investigating ice breaking via impulsive loads based on the fem method wang et al 2017 simplified the underwater explosion process to an empirical formula loading an ice sheet to simulate the ice damage modeled via a meshless method referred to as peridynamics their research modeled the ice sheet as meshless particles utilizing large scale computational resources the water air and soil materials were ignored their results revealed the ice crack propagation phenomenon using numerical method the dynamic analysis of ice performance is complicated as the explosion process exhibits a strong time variation for short duration high amplitude blast loading in addition the analysis involved varying processes such as explosive detonation shock wave propagation multiple reflections structure fluid interaction and structural response yang et al 2019a however the damage mechanisms of ice sheets subjected to underwater blast loads in a fully coupled process which is of great importance in improving the icebreaking efficiency have not been investigated therefore it is necessary to propose an effective and reasonable fully coupled ice water numerical model to study the damage characteristics of an ice sheet subjected to underwater explosion loads mellor 1983 noted that in dealing with real problems of ice blast engineering it is necessary to use a row of charges multiple rows of charges or some other kind of charge pattern as the distance between the different charges can affect whether a through channel can be formed the positions of explosives in water the selection of explosive quantities and the layout of explosives often have different effects on the blasting of ice sheets regarding the damaged surface and size of the ice sheet a single multiple row of charges are often used in real engineering applications fu et al 2020 nevertheless it appears that few published studies exist to provide a numerical investigation of ice damage characteristics under different explosive conditions despite the significance of ice blast engineering thus the numerical dynamic response of the ice sheet subjected to single explosive and combination explosives underwater blasting below the ice sheet is conducted in this study it is well known that an underwater explosion for icebreaking is a typical fsi issue considering that the ale method has been applied to solve all kinds of fsi issues especially for various explosion problems such as underwater explosions gannon 2019 ge et al 2017 praba and ramajeyathilagam 2020 air explosions yao et al 2018 and underwater concrete explosions wang et al 2020 and is also widely used in the study of ice structure interaction engineering gao et al 2015 liu et al 2011 because of its advantages of in addressing nonlinear and large scale deformation problem the ale method has been utilised to investigate the damage characteristics of ice sheets subjected to underwater explosion loads including shock wave loads bubble pulsation and water spike impacting the fully coupled model established based on experiments has been validated based on the calibrated coupled numerical model the objectives of the present work are as follows a to investigate the different ice damage characteristics under the underwater due to an underwater contact explosion and underwater explosion b to study the critical charge under different ice thicknesses to ensure the full use of the explosive s energy c to compare and discuss the different blast efficiencies of ice sheets subjected to combination explosives and equivalent single explosives 2 theory of background 2 1 arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method there are two typical methods for solving continuum mechanics the lagrangian and eulerian algorithms the ale algorithm has been developed to combine the advantages of the lagrangian and eulerian algorithms which have been widely used in solving fsi events donea et al 2004 haufe et al 2004 kim and shin 2008 tai et al 2011 wang and gadala 1997 the conservation of

is used to calculate the amount of material transported through the grid making the numerical solution of the control equation much more complicated than the lagrange equation the calculation of each time step is divided into two stages first the lagrangian process is performed calculating the amount of internal energy change caused by the velocity the internal and external forces and the mass transport momentum and internal energy generated by convection the numerical processing in ls dyna uses the central difference method to update the grid position and the time step needs to meet the courant stability condition the simplified calculation frame of the ale method is shown in fig 1 a more detailed introduction can be found in donea et al 2004 hallquist 2007 kim and shin 2008 2 2 fluid structure interface treatment the ale method accomplishes the fluid structure interaction process by calculation the penalty force between the fluid and structure interaction surface shown in fig 2 first the solid surface mesh is treated as a surface segment set whose n n structural coupling points are generated on each surface segment each coupling point is assessed as to whether is in contact with the fluid substance interface the fluid coupling point at each position is defined when they are in contact then a massless spring is connected between the structural coupling point and the fluid coupling point the penalty force is calculated between them as they are subjected to tensile and compressive forces 2 3 material models 2 3 1 explosive the tnt explosive is modeled as a high

the failure criterion has occurred for ice damage simulation when p p c and p c stands for the pressure cut off for material tensile strength pressure the cut off pressure was p c 2 mpa further failure criterions are assumed to occur if ε e f f p ε max p the effective plastic strain reaching the failure strain or the value ε max p being set to 0 35 the element thus loses its ability to carry tension and the deviatoric stresses are set to zero there are some assumptions about the ice material of the coastal ice sheet in the present work the ice is isotropic and homogeneous and belongs to the sheet level the effect of the temperature gradient and crystallization characteristic on the ice sheet properties are assumed to be negligible when the underwater explosion load is transient and strong 2 4 numerical validation it is necessary to verify the bubble dynamics calculation model for the ale method to calculate the bubble dynamics of an underwater explosion this is the key to solving the fluid solid coupling problem of the underwater explosion process the experimental data verified in this paper were obtained from the literature klaseboer et al 2005 a rigid plate is placed near the 55 g explosive the explosive center of the explosive is located at a depth of 3 5 m and the size of the plate is 1 5 m 1 5 m 1 5 m which is on the left side of the explosive the central region of the numerical model adopted a dense mesh size of 5 cm and the outer zone mesh size was 10 cm fig 3 and fig 4 compare the bubble shape at different times for the experiment and numerical calculation when the bubble begins to expand it is approximately spherical and the rigid plate has an obstructive effect on the expansion of the bubble with the increase in bubble the volume when the maximum volume of the bubble is reached the bubble has an apparent cut off effect and expands to the rigid wall then the bubble begins to collapse owing to the effect of gravity the bubble is shown as an urn like shape before developing into an oblique upward jet it can be noted that during the initial stage of jet generation the jet exhibits a slightly upwardly sloping direction which can be attributed to the combined effect of buoyancy and attraction to the wall with increasing time the direction of the jet appears increasingly perpendicular to the wall perhaps because the attraction of the steel plate dominates due to the increased proximity of the rigid plate in the final stage of the collapse no jet jets were directly observed in the experiment the time for the bubble to expand to the maximum volume was 50 ms the time to shrink to the minimum volume was 100 ms and the minimum volume time was 98 ms there is a slight error possibly due to experimental measurement errors or numerical errors caused by material simulation and grid size during the numerical simulation however the numerical bubble shape is in good agreement with the observed experimental data 3 description of the finite element model 3 1 numerical model the explicit nonlinear fem program ls dyna was utilised in the present work owing to its high efficiency and accuracy in modelling an underwater explosion control of the hourglass was applied and the fluid bulk viscosity was introduced the eight node elements were used to establish the model of water soil air and ice the fully coupled approach method was applied to calculate the interaction between fluids and structures the ice sheet was modeled as a lagrangian mesh and the water air and soil were modeled as a eulerian mesh in which the materials can flow the fluid structure interaction coupling algorithm was adopted in the numerical model by defining the keyword constrained lagrange in solid the constitutive material parameters adopted in the present work are stated in section 2 3 the non reflecting boundary was used outside of the selected eulerian meshes to realise the transmitted boundary conditions by setting the keyword boundary non reflecting and gravity as considered in the calculation the numerical model size of the underwater explosion for breaking ice tests based on the ale method is shown in fig 5 the research in this article is a large scale underwater explosion for ice breaking thus the entire selected size was a length and width of 20 m and a height of 12 5 m to eliminate the influence of boundary effects as the research model is highly symmetrical a symmetrical boundary condition was applied the calculation dimensions of the fluid domain are 10 m 10 m 12 5 m the thickness of the ice is 27 cm and the depth of water was 2 2 m guaranteeing the accuracy of calculation and avoiding non convergence in the calculation process a combination mesh size of 5 cm and 10 cm as used for the euler domain and the ratio of the size of the ice structure to the euler mesh was 1 2 the total number of elements was 1944075 elements after conducting a series of numerical trials meanwhile the spherical detonation explosive was defined by setting the keywords initial volume fraction geometry to ensure that the detonation gases could flow in the grid and the bubble could accomplish a series of motion processes coupled with lagrangian elements 3 2 numerical result the underwater explosion loads can be divided into shock waves and bubbles these loads will damage the ice sheet fig 6 shows the numerical process of the ice sheet subjected to an underwater explosion of 200 g tnt charge the bubble movement including expanding and shrinking and the water spike forming process are observed in fig 6 fig 7 shows the changing three dimensional bubble shape during the explosion at time 2 5 ms the explosive produces a spherical bubble then the bubble begins to expand before 52 5 ms the bubble shape resembles a tear drop because the expanding speed of the upper surface of the bubble is faster than the bottom surface of the bubble the radius of the bubble reaches 77 22 cm at a time of 52 5 ms after the bubble reaches the maximum radius the upper surface of the bubble begins to shrink forward after 112 5 ms the bubble begins to split into two including a small perforative bubble towards the water bottom fig 8 shows the multi material changing process of an underwater explosion at different times and fig 9 shows the dynamic damage characteristics of the ice sheet before 2 5 ms the main load of the underwater explosion is a shock wave which can cause the ice sheet to form an initial damage zone owing to the high peak value of the underwater explosion shock wave the shock wave reaches the bottom of the ice layer which is destroyed with spread of the shock wave and the shock wave is rapidly transferred into a compressive stress wave throughout the ice sheet as the wave stress propagates through ice sheet the ice sheet will experience tensile stress when the tensile stress exceeds the tensile of ice cracks are formed including the radial and circular cracks at 18 ms a bump on the ice sheet can be observed because the water moves up subjected to bubble expansion during this process the ice sheet suffers tensile stress which causes the ice sheet cracks to grow as the bubbles continue to expand the water spike begins to gradually form under the impact of the water spike the ice layer continues to suffer from tensile and shear damage when the ice layer is damaged to a certain extent the water spike injects out of the ice layer causing the root of the ice to break meanwhile the bubble begins to shrink and the bubble jet is formed and moves towards the water bottom by shrinking the bubble will absorb the ice sheet moving downward causing further damage to the ice sheet the cracks can clearly be seen from the numerical results fig 10 shows a comparison of the damage size of the ice sheet subjected to an underwater explosion between the numerical and experimental results the experimental conditions were the same as the numerical results the results indicate that the central region of the ice sheet will suffer severe damage because of strong impaction such as ice fragments the radius of the ice fragment is approximate 1 02 m and the radius of the damaged area of the ice sheet is 1 26 m the calculation error of the numerical results compared with the experimental result is 5 15 which is within 10 this verifies the accuracy of the model and method making it available for calculating the engineering for ice breaking subjected to underwater blast the formation and progress failure of ice sheets due to an underwater explosion load can be deduced as follows when the explosive explodes underwater it forms a strong spherical shock wave and spreads out when the shock wave reaches the ice layer a strong impact action is loaded onto the ice layer causing the ice layer to produce local damage areas with radial cracks and circular cracks in the ice layer the reason for causing radial cracks is that as the compressive stress wave propagates in the ice layer it will produce tensile stress and tensile deformation in the tangential direction the ultimate tensile strength of the ice layer is much smaller than the ultimate compressive strength and hence when the tensile stress exceeds the failed tensile strength of the ice layer the ice material fails thus radial cracks can be formed subjected to tensile waves in a short time after the explosion the compression wave of the ice surface is unloaded leading to the formation of tensile stress in the radial direction therefore when the tensile stress exceeds the tensile strength of the ice sheet in the radial direction the circular cracks will be further generated thus it can be inferred that the damage type of the ice sheet is mainly the formation of a crack damage zone in the early stage subjected to a shock wave load in the bubble loading stage the bubble pulsation load and water spike impaction cause the ice layer to suffer stretch and shear on the initial damage area caused by the shock wave subjecting the damaged ice area to a series of phenomena including bulging breaking rebounding and lifting the shock wave load is the main influence on the fracture size of the damaged area on the ice sheet therefore it is necessary to make full use of the energy of the shock wave load to improve the efficiency of the explosion for ice breaking 4 discussion 4 1 ice sheet damage characteristics for single explosive 4 1 1 underwater contact explosion to investigate the differences in the ice damage characteristics under the underwater contact explosion and underwater explosion the 200 g tnt charge is contacted with the ice sheet in water and the thickness of ice is 27 cm fig 11 shows the numerical results of the ice sheet damage process subjected to an underwater contact explosion at 0 5 ms both the bottom and upper surface ice sheet were damaged under the strong shock wave impact a small ice hole on the upper surface measured 18 cm can be seen in the center of the ice sheet at this time the damaged size of the bottom surface reaches 42 cm the size of the bottom surface is larger than that of the upper surface because the strong shock wave acted directly at the bottom surface of the ice sheet with the shock wave propagation the damaged area expands larger when the time reached 5 ms the damaged size of the ice sheet reached its maximum and the damage size of the ice hole was nearly 72 cm the damage size of the underwater explosion for icebreaking is 44 larger than that of the underwater contact explosion this is because the load causing the ice sheet damage from the underwater explosion is the combined interaction between the shock wave and bubble loads while the load causing the ice sheet damaged for an underwater contact explosion is mainly shock wave loads as the bubble is near the ice structure the ice structure can restrict the expansion development of the bubble therefore the underwater explosion type for ice breaking can improve the explosion efficiency compared to contact explosion for an equal charge mass 4 1 2 critical explosive to make full use of the explosion energy to avoid wasting explosives this section mainly studies the damage characteristics of the ice sheet under the action of a critical charge for different ice layer thicknesses and detonation distances there is a critical charge that just sufficient to critically damage the ice layer if the critical charge is exceeded the ice layer will experience significant damage non dimensional numbers are defined as 9 ξ r t 10 k d t where r is the radius of charge t is the thickness of the ice sheet and d is the detonation distance fig 12 shows the dynamic response stress cloud diagram of the ice layer under the critical explosive in the following cases t is chosen as 54 cm when ξ is 0 035 the ice layer produces critical damage the bubbles expand and contract under the ice to cause slight damage to the bottom of the ice layer without causing more severe damage this is referred to as critical state of cracking without breaking when ξ is less than 0 035 the ice layer does not experience the damage owing to the existence of the ice layer structure the explosion is too small and the bubble explodes underwater to generate an initial shock wave the bubble begins to expand and contract and begins to move toward the ice layer until the bubble shrinks to the minimum volume fig 13 shows the critical radius of charge to the ice thickness ratio under different detonation distances and the ice thickness ratios when the ice thickness ranges from 20 to 60 cm it can be seen from fig 13 that ξ and k can be approximated as a linear relationship when the detonation distance increases the critical charge can also increase for each ice thickness conversely if ξ and k are not linearly related the ice sheet can be damaged by the explosion load at this time the detonation charge mass is larger than the critical charge otherwise the ice sheet cannot be damaged by the explosion load when the detonation charge is less than the critical charge 4 2 ice sheet damage characteristics for two explosives combination in explosion blast engineering for icebreaking the combined explosives layout is usually utilised for ice breaking engineering to improve explosion efficiency in this section the ice sheet damage characteristics are investigated under two combination of explosives first the two explosives each with mass 100 g are modeled in the vertical layout and the distance between them two is 0 5 rd the explosion process is shown in fig 14 the horizontal diameter of the double bubble fusion is 148 cm and the vertical diameter is 160 cm the bubble shape changes to an ellipsoid however in the case of a single explosive with an equivalent charge the horizontal and vertical diameters of the bubbles reach 160 cm with a spherical shape change in the damage shape change of the ice layer owing to the expansion of the bubbles the bulging phenomenon of the ice layer is obvious because the bubble radius of the double explosives is smaller than the bubble radius of the bubble of the single equivalent explosive the degree of bulging of the ice layer is not as high as that of the single explosive however the degree of ice bulging is significant but the phenomenon of tensile fracture of ice due to ice bulging can still be seen in fig 14 in the case of double explosives the ice damage radius is 78 cm while the equivalent single explosive has a damage radius of 102 cm and its damage range is less than 25 5 of the equivalent explosive the reason for the reduction in the size of the damage is the vertical arrangement of the double explosives on the one hand the shock wave weakening phenomenon is generated due to the superimposed effect of the shock wave on the other hand owing to the fusion of the bubbles the expansion range of the bubbles is reduced which reduces the degree of expansion of the ice layer the ice damage range was reduced therefore it can be inferred that the explosion efficiency of the arrangement of the two explosives is lower than that of the single equivalent explosive thus adopting the horizontal explosive arrangement should be considered as shown in fig 15 fig 15 shows the ice damage characteristics of two explosives arranged horizontally at different intervals the spacing distance l of the two horizontal explosives is 0 5rd rd 1 5rd and 2rd it can be seen from fig 15 that with the increasing explosives distances the horizontal damage range of the ice layer significantly increases this is because when the horizontal distance of the two explosives is small the bubbles clearly merge when the distance increases to a certain value the bubbles no longer merge therefore the horizontal diameter of the water increases in the horizontal direction owing to the expansion of the bubbles there is a clear difference in the movement state of the bubbles owing to the difference in the distance between the two explosives at the beginning of the explosion the explosives produced independent spherical bubbles and the bubbles then began to expand when the two bubbles expanded to the maximum radius if the distance between the two bubbles was greater than the sum of the maximum radius of the two bubbles the bubbles would not merge otherwise they would it can be seen from fig 15 that when t 32 5 ms the ice layer forms a single bulge when the distance between the two explosives is 0 5rd rd when the spacing distance is 1 5rd 2rd the ice layer forms two bulges phenomenon when the distance is 0 5rd the horizontal diameter of the double bubble fusion is 180 cm and when the distance is 2rd the horizontal diameter distance of the double bubble is 320 cm therefore the horizontal distance increases by 77 77 demonstrating that an appropriate distance between the explosives has a significant influence on the damaged area of the ice fig 16 shows the ice damage model under the conditions of different explosives spacing when the distance between the two explosives is 0 5rd the ice damage area is approximately circular as the distance between the two explosives increases the circular damage zone becomes elliptical and the ratio of the long axis to the short axis gradually increases when the distance increases to 2rd the damaged area becomes circular developing the largest damaged area if the distance between the two explosives is greater than 2 rd the coalesced cracks area cannot be formed table 1 and fig 17 give the damage sizes of the ice sheet under different explosives spacing distance it can be seen from the result that the radius of the damaged zone increases when the explosive spacing is larger than 0 5rd the explosion efficiency of two explosives with a distance less than 0 8rd is smaller than a single explosive with an equivalent mass besides the transverse radius length is larger than the radial radius length both in the fragment and crack zones it is obviously can be seen that the explosion damage size of the ice sheet is largest when the spacing distance is 2rd to form a coalescence crack zone to investigate whether the ice sheet damage characteristics with an ice thickness ranging from 20 60 cm has similar characteristics to the ice thickness with 27 cm subjected to an underwater explosion a typical numerical trial with a typical ice thickness of 40 cm a single charge of 300 g and a detonation distance of 45 cm was conducted fig 18 shows the multi materia change process of the underwater explosion at different times for a single explosive when compared to fig 8 it can be seen from fig 18 that the ice damage process has similarity including the following typical processes a the shock wave generated by the initial detonation of explosives quickly impacts the ice layer causing initial damage to the ice layer b the bulging movement of the ice layer is caused by the expansion process of the bubbles and the ice layer is subjected to the tensile force causing the damage and cracks of the ice layer to develop fully c the subsequent motion of the bubbles and the impact of the water spike cause the ice layer to be fractured and crushed d the expansion and collapse of the bubbles cause the crack zone of ice layer to be further stretched and sheared resulting in a fragment and crack zone forming in the ice sheet fig 19 shows the damage process of an ice sheet subjected to two combination explosives each with a charge of 150 g and a spacing of l 2 rd where rd is the calculated damage size of the ice sheet under one charge detonated as a combination of charges the ice damage process is similar to that shown in fig 15 d two detonation bubbles expand fully without merging resulting in the formation of a larger area of damage to the ice sheet figs 20 and 21 show the damage mode of the ice sheet with a thickness of 40 cm under a single explosive and combination explosives from fig 20 it can be seen that the damage to the ice sheet has two typical damage zones namely fragment zone and crack zone while fig 21 has formed a typical coalescence crack zone similar to fig 15 d with an elliptical shape the fragment size of the ice sheet under a single 300 g explosive reaches 113 6 cm and the crack size zone of the ice sheet is 155 4 cm for two explosive charges the size of the elliptical transverse axes fragment size of the ice sheet is 210 cm and the size of the elliptical transverse axis crack the size of the ice sheet is 227 9 cm the size of the elliptical radial axis fragment size of the ice sheet is 119 cm and the size of the elliptical radial axes crack the size of the ice sheet is 126 0 cm thus the area of the fragment zone of a single explosive is 4 05 m2 while the area of the fragment zone of the combination explosives is 7 9 m2 meanwhile the area of the crack zone of a single explosive is 7 58 m2 when the area of the crack zone of combination explosives is 9 01 m2 the ice breaking efficiency of the combination explosives is higher than that of an equivalent single explosive when the combination explosives are arrayed with a proper spacing distance in summary a row combination charge application with an appropriate charge mass and spacing distance for underwater explosion ice breaking can improve the icebreaking efficiency of the underwater explosions 5 conclusion the present work aims to investigate the dynamic response and damage mechanism of the ice sheet subjected to single explosives and two explosives in combination beneath the ice sheet the reliability of the numerical model to calculate the ice sheet subjected to blast load was verified by the reference result and field blast data based on this research the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the present numerical model based on the ale technique is available and reliable for simulating the damage characteristics of the ice sheet under various blast conditions 2 the ice breaking mechanism due to underwater explosions can be inferred based on the numerical result i during the early stage of the underwater explosion the shock wave causes initial damage to the ice layer including high pressure crushing damage to the bottom surface of the ice layer ii in the mid stage of the underwater explosion due to the continuous expansion and contraction of bubbles the water surface rises to form a water spike at this stage the ice layer is subjected to the impact from the water causing the layer to rise and the initial cracks fully expand owing to the easy tensile failure of the ice layer iii in the late stage of the underwater explosion owing to the shrinkage collapse and secondary expansion of the bubbles the ice layer is adsorbed causing further tensile damage and breaking the damaged ice a broken fragment zone of the ice sheet is formed in the cracked zone 3 for a single explosive the efficiency of an ice breaking underwater contact explosion is less than that of an underwater explosion for ice breaking at a proper detonation distance this is because the underwater contact explosion cannot fully expand the detonation bubble and form a water spike to impact the ice sheet thus an underwater explosion is usually an efficient method of breaking the ice sheet in addition there is a critical charge for each ice thickness and detonation distance that can just break the ice sheet thus for a specific ice thickness once the detonation distance is set a critical charge can be uniquely determined 4 for two combination explosives the ice breaking efficiency is lower than for an equivalent single explosive charge when the two explosives arrayed in vertically this is because when the combination explosives are arranged vertically the peak value of the shock wave reaching the ice surface is smaller than the peak value generated by a single equivalent mass explosive when the shock wave is generated by the upper explosive result of the damage to the ice layer the ice surface has an explosion venting effect so the ability of the lower explosive to damage the ice layer is greatly weakened however for multiple explosives their horizontal spacing has a great effect on the ice breaking efficiency subjected to an underwater explosion when the explosive spacing is less than 0 8rd the ice breaking efficiency is less than the equivalent charge the 2rd space distance should be chosen to achieve the highest icebreaking efficiency to form a coalescence crack zone for the present work all main findings are based on specific assumptions of the coastal ice sheet material the ice is isotropic and homogeneous and belongs to sheet level with thickness of 20 cm 60 cm care should be taken when the ice is too thin or too thick and more available ice material models should be developed for wider application in underwater ice blast engineering credit authorship contribution statement ying wang

21037,explosives are considered an effective method of breaking an ice jam or clearing an ice barrier as underwater explosions can have a severely destructive impact on ice sheets investigating the damage mechanism and dynamic characteristics of the ice sheet is significant this paper presents a study on the ice damage characteristics subjected to single and combination explosives utilizing the

breaking engineering keywords ice sheet damage fluid structure interaction underwater explosion single explosive combination explosives 1 introduction structural dynamic behaviour as exhibited by warships jin and ding 2011 langrand et al 2009 sprague and geers 2006 zhang et al 2005 underwater vehicles zong et al 1999 2000 rc dams li et al 2018 wang et al 2014a zhang et al 2014a and ice sheets has drawn attention in recent years regarding explosion load and impact dynamic effects an important task is to predict the explosion effects and damage efficiency for the design of structures or damage assessment klenow and bradley 2006 specifically significant loads including shock waves and bubble pulsation have short but high intensities for underwater explosions which can be destructive to structures barras et al 2012 chen et al 2009 hsu et al 2014 kim and shin 2008 li and rong 2011 2012 petrov and schmidt 2015 phan et al 2019 shin 2004 wang et al 2014b yang et al 2019b zhang et al 2011 2013 underwater blasts below the ice sheet are an important method of cleaning ice jams or dredging channels owing to their high efficiency the damage characteristics of the ice sheet under different charge conditions are of great significance many severely cold regions such as the yellow river will experience ice jam disasters of varying degrees each year due to their special geographical location and conditions this can affect the normal production and life of the local people for this reason blasting methods are used to clear river ice jams during the ice jam season of the yellow river each year the underwater blasting method for breaking the ice can effectively utilise the energy of explosives and achieve safe and efficient blasting effects for underwater explosion engineering most research is focused on ship engineering ge et al 2017 studied the similarities between the model and prototype based on the centrifugal similarity criteria using the ale method of the ls dyna code the results showed good agreement with the centrifugal experiment results gannon 2019 focused on simulating the interaction between an underwater explosion a submerged cylinder and a free surface or rigid bottom accounting for shock wave propagation cavitation and gas bubble migration jetting jin et al 2018 studied the dynamics of a sandwich structure owing to the interaction between the underwater explosion bubble and structure three different regimes of bubble behaviour were distinguished wang et al 2014b and meng et al 2019 numerically investigated the shock wave propagation characteristics and cavitation effects of an underwater explosion near a plate structure shock wave and bubble pulsation loads are the main loads during an underwater explosion process these extremely complicated processes can cause severe damage to structures in the field of underwater blast for ice breaking most achievements concerning ice sheet damage under blast loads are based on experimental results barash 1962 and mellor 1983 conducted a series of experiments on underwater explosion for ice breaking the formulas were summarized to predict the range of damage to ice subjected to underwater explosions which can be utilised in explosive design theoretical and experimental research on needle ice and snow ice behaviour under shock and explosive loading have been conducted orlov 2019 orlova and orlov 2015 conducting underwater explosion test research is costly dangerous and time consuming there are many limitations such as the limitation of winter environmental conditions and the transportation storage of explosives regarding numerical research mansour and seireg 1983 developed a computer program for investigating ice breaking via impulsive loads based on the fem method wang et al 2017 simplified the underwater explosion process to an empirical formula loading an ice sheet to simulate the ice damage modeled via a meshless method referred to as peridynamics their research modeled the ice sheet as meshless particles utilizing large scale computational resources the water air and soil materials were ignored their results revealed the ice crack propagation phenomenon using numerical method the dynamic analysis of ice performance is complicated as the explosion process exhibits a strong time variation for short duration high amplitude blast loading in addition the analysis involved varying processes such as explosive detonation shock wave propagation multiple reflections structure fluid interaction and structural response yang et al 2019a however the damage mechanisms of ice sheets subjected to underwater blast loads in a fully coupled process which is of great importance in improving the icebreaking efficiency have not been investigated therefore it is necessary to propose an effective and reasonable fully coupled ice water numerical model to study the damage characteristics of an ice sheet subjected to underwater explosion loads mellor 1983 noted that in dealing with real problems of ice blast engineering it is necessary to use a row of charges multiple rows of charges or some other kind of charge pattern as the distance between the different charges can affect whether a through channel can be formed the positions of explosives in water the selection of explosive quantities and the layout of explosives often have different effects on the blasting of ice sheets regarding the damaged surface and size of the ice sheet a single multiple row of charges are often used in real engineering applications fu et al 2020 nevertheless it appears that few published studies exist to provide a numerical investigation of ice damage characteristics under different explosive conditions despite the significance of ice blast engineering thus the numerical dynamic response of the ice sheet subjected to single explosive and combination explosives underwater blasting below the ice sheet is conducted in this study it is well known that an underwater explosion for icebreaking is a typical fsi issue considering that the ale method has been applied to solve all kinds of fsi issues especially for various explosion problems such as underwater explosions gannon 2019 ge et al 2017 praba and ramajeyathilagam 2020 air explosions yao et al 2018 and underwater concrete explosions wang et al 2020 and is also widely used in the study of ice structure interaction engineering gao et al 2015 liu et al 2011 because of its advantages of in addressing nonlinear and large scale deformation problem the ale method has been utilised to investigate the damage characteristics of ice sheets subjected to underwater explosion loads including shock wave loads bubble pulsation and water spike impacting the fully coupled model established based on experiments has been validated based on the calibrated coupled numerical model the objectives of the present work are as follows a to investigate the different ice damage characteristics under the underwater due to an underwater contact explosion and underwater explosion b to study the critical charge under different ice thicknesses to ensure the full use of the explosive s energy c to compare and discuss the different blast efficiencies of ice sheets subjected to combination explosives and equivalent single explosives 2 theory of background 2 1 arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method there are two typical methods for solving continuum mechanics the lagrangian and eulerian algorithms the ale algorithm has been developed to combine the advantages of the lagrangian and eulerian algorithms which have been widely used in solving fsi events donea et al 2004 haufe et al 2004 kim and shin 2008 tai et al 2011 wang and gadala 1997 the conservation of

where ρ is mass density x is displacement v is material velocity u is grid velocity σ and ε are stress and strain tensors respectively and e is energy the convection term in the ale control equation is used to calculate the amount of material transported through the grid making the numerical solution of the control equation much more complicated than the lagrange equation the calculation of each time step is divided into two stages first the lagrangian process is performed calculating the amount of internal energy change caused by the velocity the internal and external forces and the mass transport momentum and internal energy generated by convection the numerical processing in ls dyna uses the central difference method to update the grid position and the time step needs to meet the courant stability condition the simplified calculation frame of the ale method is shown in fig 1 a more detailed introduction can be found in donea et al 2004 hallquist 2007 kim and shin 2008 2 2 fluid structure interface treatment the ale method accomplishes the fluid structure interaction process by calculation the penalty force between the fluid and structure interaction surface shown in fig 2 first the solid surface mesh is treated as a surface segment set whose n n structural coupling points are generated on each surface segment each coupling point is assessed as to whether is in contact with the fluid substance interface the fluid coupling point at each position is defined when they are in contact then a massless spring is connected between the structural coupling point and the fluid coupling point the penalty force is calculated between them as they are subjected to tensile and compressive forces 2 3 material models 2 3 1 explosive the tnt explosive is modeled as a high

to study the impact of hail ice on the composite structure by kim and kedward 2000 and kim et al 2003 many scholars have used other material models to study ice engineering issues for example the mat plasticity compression tension eos model is used to study ice hail impact problems and a drucker prager plasticity criteria based on plastic theory is applied to study ice damage subjected to impacting load pernas sánchez et al 2018 pernas sánchez et al 2012 in the present work this article focuses on the ice damage mechanism under the conditions of an underwater explosion considering the ice material complexity we used the mat isotropic elastic failure to investigate the damage characteristics of ice based on the assumptions of an isotropic and homogenous level sheet a more detailed

failure criterions are assumed to occur if ε e f f p ε max p the effective plastic strain reaching the failure strain or the value ε max p being set to 0 35 the element thus loses its ability to carry tension and the deviatoric stresses are set to zero there are some assumptions about the ice material of the coastal ice sheet in the present work the ice is isotropic and homogeneous and belongs to the sheet level the effect of the temperature gradient and crystallization characteristic on the ice sheet properties are assumed to be negligible when the underwater explosion load is transient and strong 2 4 numerical validation it is necessary to verify the bubble dynamics calculation model for the ale method to calculate the bubble dynamics of an underwater explosion this is the key to solving the fluid solid coupling problem of the underwater explosion process the experimental data verified in this paper were obtained from the literature klaseboer et al 2005 a rigid plate is placed near the 55 g explosive the explosive center of the explosive is located at a depth of 3 5 m and the size of the plate is 1 5 m 1 5 m 1 5 m which is on the left side of the explosive the central region of the numerical model adopted a dense mesh size of 5 cm and the outer zone mesh size was 10 cm fig 3 and fig 4 compare the bubble shape at different times for the experiment and numerical calculation when the bubble begins to expand it is approximately spherical and the rigid plate has an obstructive effect on the expansion of the bubble with the increase in bubble the volume when the maximum volume of the bubble is reached the bubble has an apparent cut off effect and expands to the rigid wall then the bubble begins to collapse owing to the effect of gravity the bubble is shown as an urn like shape before developing into an oblique upward jet it can be noted that during the initial stage of jet generation the jet exhibits a slightly upwardly sloping direction which can be attributed to the combined effect of buoyancy and attraction to the wall with increasing time the direction of the jet appears increasingly perpendicular to the wall perhaps because the attraction of the steel plate dominates due to the increased proximity of the rigid plate in the final stage of the collapse no jet jets were directly observed in the experiment the time for the bubble to expand to the maximum volume was 50 ms the time to shrink to the minimum volume was 100 ms and the minimum volume time was 98 ms there is a slight error possibly due to experimental measurement errors or numerical errors caused by material simulation and grid size during the numerical simulation however the numerical bubble shape is in good agreement with the observed experimental data 3 description of the finite element model 3 1 numerical model the explicit nonlinear fem program ls dyna was utilised in the present work owing to its high efficiency and accuracy in modelling an underwater explosion control of the hourglass was applied and the fluid bulk viscosity was introduced the eight node elements were used to establish the model of water soil air and ice the fully coupled approach method was applied to calculate the interaction between fluids and structures the ice sheet was modeled as a lagrangian mesh and the water air and soil were modeled as a eulerian mesh in which the materials can flow the fluid structure interaction coupling algorithm was adopted in the numerical model by defining the keyword constrained lagrange in solid the constitutive material parameters adopted in the present work are stated in section 2 3 the non reflecting boundary was used outside of the selected eulerian meshes to realise the transmitted boundary conditions by setting the keyword boundary non reflecting and gravity as considered in the calculation the numerical model size of the underwater explosion for breaking ice tests based on the ale method is shown in fig 5 the research in this article is a large scale underwater explosion for ice breaking thus the entire selected size was a length and width of 20 m and a height of 12 5 m to eliminate the influence of boundary effects as the research model is highly symmetrical a symmetrical boundary condition was applied the calculation dimensions of the fluid domain are 10 m 10 m 12 5 m the thickness of the ice is 27 cm and the depth of water was 2 2 m guaranteeing the accuracy of calculation and avoiding non convergence in the calculation process a combination mesh size of 5 cm and 10 cm as used for the euler domain and the ratio of the size of the ice structure to the euler mesh was 1 2 the total number of elements was 1944075 elements after conducting a series of numerical trials meanwhile the spherical detonation explosive was defined by setting the keywords initial volume fraction geometry to ensure that the detonation gases could flow in the grid and the bubble could accomplish a series of motion processes coupled with lagrangian elements 3 2 numerical result the underwater explosion loads can be divided into shock waves and bubbles these loads will damage the ice sheet fig 6 shows the numerical process of the ice sheet subjected to an underwater explosion of 200 g tnt charge the bubble movement including expanding and shrinking and the water spike forming process are observed in fig 6 fig 7 shows the changing three dimensional bubble shape during the explosion at time 2 5 ms the explosive produces a spherical bubble then the bubble begins to expand before 52 5 ms the bubble shape resembles a tear drop because the expanding speed of the upper surface of the bubble is faster than the bottom surface of the bubble the radius of the bubble reaches 77 22 cm at a time of 52 5 ms after the bubble reaches the maximum radius the upper surface of the bubble begins to shrink forward after 112 5 ms the bubble begins to split into two including a small perforative bubble towards the water bottom fig 8 shows the multi material changing process of an underwater explosion at different times and fig 9 shows the dynamic damage characteristics of the ice sheet before 2 5 ms the main load of the underwater explosion is a shock wave which can cause the ice sheet to form an initial damage zone owing to the high peak value of the underwater explosion shock wave the shock wave reaches the bottom of the ice layer which is destroyed with spread of the shock wave and the shock wave is rapidly transferred into a compressive stress wave throughout the ice sheet as the wave stress propagates through ice sheet the ice sheet will experience tensile stress when the tensile stress exceeds the tensile of ice cracks are formed including the radial and circular cracks at 18 ms a bump on the ice sheet can be observed because the water moves up subjected to bubble expansion during this process the ice sheet suffers tensile stress which causes the ice sheet cracks to grow as the bubbles continue to expand the water spike begins to gradually form under the impact of the water spike the ice layer continues to suffer from tensile and shear damage when the ice layer is damaged to a certain extent the water spike injects out of the ice layer causing the root of the ice to break meanwhile the bubble begins to shrink and the bubble jet is formed and moves towards the water bottom by shrinking the bubble will absorb the ice sheet moving downward causing further damage to the ice sheet the cracks can clearly be seen from the numerical results fig 10 shows a comparison of the damage size of the ice sheet subjected to an underwater explosion between the numerical and experimental results the experimental conditions were the same as the numerical results the results indicate that the central region of the ice sheet will suffer severe damage because of strong impaction such as ice fragments the radius of the ice fragment is approximate 1 02 m and the radius of the damaged area of the ice sheet is 1 26 m the calculation error of the numerical results compared with the experimental result is 5 15 which is within 10 this verifies the accuracy of the model and method making it available for calculating the engineering for ice breaking subjected to underwater blast the formation and progress failure of ice sheets due to an underwater explosion load can be deduced as follows when the explosive explodes underwater it forms a strong spherical shock wave and spreads out when the shock wave reaches the ice layer a strong impact action is loaded onto the ice layer causing the ice layer to produce local damage areas with radial cracks and circular cracks in the ice layer the reason for causing radial cracks is that as the compressive stress wave propagates in the ice layer it will produce tensile stress and tensile deformation in the tangential direction the ultimate tensile strength of the ice layer is much smaller than the ultimate compressive strength and hence when the tensile stress exceeds the failed tensile strength of the ice layer the ice material fails thus radial cracks can be formed subjected to tensile waves in a short time after the explosion the compression wave of the ice surface is unloaded leading to the formation of tensile stress in the radial direction therefore when the tensile stress exceeds the tensile strength of the ice sheet in the radial direction the circular cracks will be further generated thus it can be inferred that the damage type of the ice sheet is mainly the formation of a crack damage zone in the early stage subjected to a shock wave load in the bubble loading stage the bubble pulsation load and water spike impaction cause the ice layer to suffer stretch and shear on the initial damage area caused by the shock wave subjecting the damaged ice area to a series of phenomena including bulging breaking rebounding and lifting the shock wave load is the main influence on the fracture size of the damaged area on the ice sheet therefore it is necessary to make full use of the energy of the shock wave load to improve the efficiency of the explosion for ice breaking 4 discussion 4 1 ice sheet damage characteristics for single explosive 4 1 1 underwater contact explosion to investigate the differences in the ice damage characteristics under the underwater contact explosion and underwater explosion the 200 g tnt charge is contacted with the ice sheet in water and the thickness of ice is 27 cm fig 11 shows the numerical results of the ice sheet damage process subjected to an underwater contact explosion at 0 5 ms both the bottom and upper surface ice sheet were damaged under the strong shock wave impact a small ice hole on the upper surface measured 18 cm can be seen in the center of the ice sheet at this time the damaged size of the bottom surface reaches 42 cm the size of the bottom surface is larger than that of the upper surface because the strong shock wave acted directly at the bottom surface of the ice sheet with the shock wave propagation the damaged area expands larger when the time reached 5 ms the damaged size of the ice sheet reached its maximum and the damage size of the ice hole was nearly 72 cm the damage size of the underwater explosion for icebreaking is 44 larger than that of the underwater contact explosion this is because the load causing the ice sheet damage from the underwater explosion is the combined interaction between the shock wave and bubble loads while the load causing the ice sheet damaged for an underwater contact explosion is mainly shock wave loads as the bubble is near the ice structure the ice structure can restrict the expansion development of the bubble therefore the underwater explosion type for ice breaking can improve the explosion efficiency compared to contact explosion for an equal charge mass 4 1 2 critical explosive to make full use of the explosion energy to avoid wasting explosives this section mainly studies the damage characteristics of the ice sheet under the action of a critical charge for different ice layer thicknesses and detonation distances there is a critical charge that just sufficient to critically damage the ice layer if the critical charge is exceeded the ice layer will experience significant damage non dimensional numbers are defined as 9 ξ r t 10 k d t where r is the radius of charge t is the thickness of the ice sheet and d is the detonation distance fig 12 shows the dynamic response stress cloud diagram of the ice layer under the critical explosive in the following cases t is chosen as 54 cm when ξ is 0 035 the ice layer produces critical damage the bubbles expand and contract under the ice to cause slight damage to the bottom of the ice layer without causing more severe damage this is referred to as critical state of cracking without breaking when ξ is less than 0 035 the ice layer does not experience the damage owing to the existence of the ice layer structure the explosion is too small and the bubble explodes underwater to generate an initial shock wave the bubble begins to expand and contract and begins to move toward the ice layer until the bubble shrinks to the minimum volume fig 13 shows the critical radius of charge to the ice thickness ratio under different detonation distances and the ice thickness ratios when the ice thickness ranges from 20 to 60 cm it can be seen from fig 13 that ξ and k can be approximated as a linear relationship when the detonation distance increases the critical charge can also increase for each ice thickness conversely if ξ and k are not linearly related the ice sheet can be damaged by the explosion load at this time the detonation charge mass is larger than the critical charge otherwise the ice sheet cannot be damaged by the explosion load when the detonation charge is less than the critical charge 4 2 ice sheet damage characteristics for two explosives combination in explosion blast engineering for icebreaking the combined explosives layout is usually utilised for ice breaking engineering to improve explosion efficiency in this section the ice sheet damage characteristics are investigated under two combination of explosives first the two explosives each with mass 100 g are modeled in the vertical layout and the distance between them two is 0 5 rd the explosion process is shown in fig 14 the horizontal diameter of the double bubble fusion is 148 cm and the vertical diameter is 160 cm the bubble shape changes to an ellipsoid however in the case of a single explosive with an equivalent charge the horizontal and vertical diameters of the bubbles reach 160 cm with a spherical shape change in the damage shape change of the ice layer owing to the expansion of the bubbles the bulging phenomenon of the ice layer is obvious because the bubble radius of the double explosives is smaller than the bubble radius of the bubble of the single equivalent explosive the degree of bulging of the ice layer is not as high as that of the single explosive however the degree of ice bulging is significant but the phenomenon of tensile fracture of ice due to ice bulging can still be seen in fig 14 in the case of double explosives the ice damage radius is 78 cm while the equivalent single explosive has a damage radius of 102 cm and its damage range is less than 25 5 of the equivalent explosive the reason for the reduction in the size of the damage is the vertical arrangement of the double explosives on the one hand the shock wave weakening phenomenon is generated due to the superimposed effect of the shock wave on the other hand owing to the fusion of the bubbles the expansion range of the bubbles is reduced which reduces the degree of expansion of the ice layer the ice damage range was reduced therefore it can be inferred that the explosion efficiency of the arrangement of the two explosives is lower than that of the single equivalent explosive thus adopting the horizontal explosive arrangement should be considered as shown in fig 15 fig 15 shows the ice damage characteristics of two explosives arranged horizontally at different intervals the spacing distance l of the two horizontal explosives is 0 5rd rd 1 5rd and 2rd it can be seen from fig 15 that with the increasing explosives distances the horizontal damage range of the ice layer significantly increases this is because when the horizontal distance of the two explosives is small the bubbles clearly merge when the distance increases to a certain value the bubbles no longer merge therefore the horizontal diameter of the water increases in the horizontal direction owing to the expansion of the bubbles there is a clear difference in the movement state of the bubbles owing to the difference in the distance between the two explosives at the beginning of the explosion the explosives produced independent spherical bubbles and the bubbles then began to expand when the two bubbles expanded to the maximum radius if the distance between the two bubbles was greater than the sum of the maximum radius of the two bubbles the bubbles would not merge otherwise they would it can be seen from fig 15 that when t 32 5 ms the ice layer forms a single bulge when the distance between the two explosives is 0 5rd rd when the spacing distance is 1 5rd 2rd the ice layer forms two bulges phenomenon when the distance is 0 5rd the horizontal diameter of the double bubble fusion is 180 cm and when the distance is 2rd the horizontal diameter distance of the double bubble is 320 cm therefore the horizontal distance increases by 77 77 demonstrating that an appropriate distance between the explosives has a significant influence on the damaged area of the ice fig 16 shows the ice damage model under the conditions of different explosives spacing when the distance between the two explosives is 0 5rd the ice damage area is approximately circular as the distance between the two explosives increases the circular damage zone becomes elliptical and the ratio of the long axis to the short axis gradually increases when the distance increases to 2rd the damaged area becomes circular developing the largest damaged area if the distance between the two explosives is greater than 2 rd the coalesced cracks area cannot be formed table 1 and fig 17 give the damage sizes of the ice sheet under different explosives spacing distance it can be seen from the result that the radius of the damaged zone increases when the explosive spacing is larger than 0 5rd the explosion efficiency of two explosives with a distance less than 0 8rd is smaller than a single explosive with an equivalent mass besides the transverse radius length is larger than the radial radius length both in the fragment and crack zones it is obviously can be seen that the explosion damage size of the ice sheet is largest when the spacing distance is 2rd to form a coalescence crack zone to investigate whether the ice sheet damage characteristics with an ice thickness ranging from 20 60 cm has similar characteristics to the ice thickness with 27 cm subjected to an underwater explosion a typical numerical trial with a typical ice thickness of 40 cm a single charge of 300 g and a detonation distance of 45 cm was conducted fig 18 shows the multi materia change process of the underwater explosion at different times for a single explosive when compared to fig 8 it can be seen from fig 18 that the ice damage process has similarity including the following typical processes a the shock wave generated by the initial detonation of explosives quickly impacts the ice layer causing initial damage to the ice layer b the bulging movement of the ice layer is caused by the expansion process of the bubbles and the ice layer is subjected to the tensile force causing the damage and cracks of the ice layer to develop fully c the subsequent motion of the bubbles and the impact of the water spike cause the ice layer to be fractured and crushed d the expansion and collapse of the bubbles cause the crack zone of ice layer to be further stretched and sheared resulting in a fragment and crack zone forming in the ice sheet fig 19 shows the damage process of an ice sheet subjected to two combination explosives each with a charge of 150 g and a spacing of l 2 rd where rd is the calculated damage size of the ice sheet under one charge detonated as a combination of charges the ice damage process is similar to that shown in fig 15 d two detonation bubbles expand fully without merging resulting in the formation of a larger area of damage to the ice sheet figs 20 and 21 show the damage mode of the ice sheet with a thickness of 40 cm under a single explosive and combination explosives from fig 20 it can be seen that the damage to the ice sheet has two typical damage zones namely fragment zone and crack zone while fig 21 has formed a typical coalescence crack zone similar to fig 15 d with an elliptical shape the fragment size of the ice sheet under a single 300 g explosive reaches 113 6 cm and the crack size zone of the ice sheet is 155 4 cm for two explosive charges the size of the elliptical transverse axes fragment size of the ice sheet is 210 cm and the size of the elliptical transverse axis crack the size of the ice sheet is 227 9 cm the size of the elliptical radial axis fragment size of the ice sheet is 119 cm and the size of the elliptical radial axes crack the size of the ice sheet is 126 0 cm thus the area of the fragment zone of a single explosive is 4 05 m2 while the area of the fragment zone of the combination explosives is 7 9 m2 meanwhile the area of the crack zone of a single explosive is 7 58 m2 when the area of the crack zone of combination explosives is 9 01 m2 the ice breaking efficiency of the combination explosives is higher than that of an equivalent single explosive when the combination explosives are arrayed with a proper spacing distance in summary a row combination charge application with an appropriate charge mass and spacing distance for underwater explosion ice breaking can improve the icebreaking efficiency of the underwater explosions 5 conclusion the present work aims to investigate the dynamic response and damage mechanism of the ice sheet subjected to single explosives and two explosives in combination beneath the ice sheet the reliability of the numerical model to calculate the ice sheet subjected to blast load was verified by the reference result and field blast data based on this research the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the present numerical model based on the ale technique is available and reliable for simulating the damage characteristics of the ice sheet under various blast conditions 2 the ice breaking mechanism due to underwater explosions can be inferred based on the numerical result i during the early stage of the underwater explosion the shock wave causes initial damage to the ice layer including high pressure crushing damage to the bottom surface of the ice layer ii in the mid stage of the underwater explosion due to the continuous expansion and contraction of bubbles the water surface rises to form a water spike at this stage the ice layer is subjected to the impact from the water causing the layer to rise and the initial cracks fully expand owing to the easy tensile failure of the ice layer iii in the late stage of the underwater explosion owing to the shrinkage collapse and secondary expansion of the bubbles the ice layer is adsorbed causing further tensile damage and breaking the damaged ice a broken fragment zone of the ice sheet is formed in the cracked zone 3 for a single explosive the efficiency of an ice breaking underwater contact explosion is less than that of an underwater explosion for ice breaking at a proper detonation distance this is because the underwater contact explosion cannot fully expand the detonation bubble and form a water spike to impact the ice sheet thus an underwater explosion is usually an efficient method of breaking the ice sheet in addition there is a critical charge for each ice thickness and detonation distance that can just break the ice sheet thus for a specific ice thickness once the detonation distance is set a critical charge can be uniquely determined 4 for two combination explosives the ice breaking efficiency is lower than for an equivalent single explosive charge when the two explosives arrayed in vertically this is because when the combination explosives are arranged vertically the peak value of the shock wave reaching the ice surface is smaller than the peak value generated by a single equivalent mass explosive when the shock wave is generated by the upper explosive result of the damage to the ice layer the ice surface has an explosion venting effect so the ability of the lower explosive to damage the ice layer is greatly weakened however for multiple explosives their horizontal spacing has a great effect on the ice breaking efficiency subjected to an underwater explosion when the explosive spacing is less than 0 8rd the ice breaking efficiency is less than the equivalent charge the 2rd space distance should be chosen to achieve the highest icebreaking efficiency to form a coalescence crack zone for the present work all main findings are based on specific assumptions of the coastal ice sheet material the ice is isotropic and homogeneous and belongs to sheet level with thickness of 20 cm 60 cm care should be taken when the ice is too thin or too thick and more available ice material models should be developed for wider application in underwater ice blast engineering credit authorship contribution statement ying wang

21038,the design and optimisation of a mooring system for a floating platform typically necessitates engineering experience and time consuming numerical simulations a novel hybrid bpnn fem approach based on the modified bp neural network and fem is proposed to more conveniently predict the statistic pretension and dynamic tension series of mooring systems with several design variables under irregular sea states the accuracy of this approach has been validated using several statistical error metrics this procedure can be used to optimize the mooring system design of the floating platform in a more economical manner than time intensive numerical simulations an optional mooring selection is proposed based on the maximum safe operation window and the requirements for the platform drift and mooring line safety performance a deep water semi submersible platform is presented as an example to demonstrate the hybrid approach this platform comprises twelve mooring lines and the design variables include the mooring radius values for the azimuthal spacing of the mooring lines and the length of the various segments of the mooring lines the impact of environmental load incidences is also considered in this process the prediction results are in reasonable agreement with those obtained using the fem keywords bp neural network mooring design semi submersible platform tension prediction 1 introduction production activities supported by floating structures have been increasingly conducted in deep and ultra deep water because of the scarcity of offshore oil and gas resources with improvements in floating structures the semi submersible platform has developed to the seventh generation with many advantages including a wide working depth strong wind and wave resistance ability and a large deck space the research on the dynamic performance of the semi submersible platform aims at a better platform design safer operation higher survivability and work efficiency an anchor station keeping system is considerably important to a semi submersible drilling platform and the appropriate pretension setting of the mooring system is required to ensure the safe operation of a deep water floating platform if the pretension is substantially large the mooring line will experience a large dynamic tension which is not conducive to the safety of the mooring line and if the pretension is too small the dynamic response of the platform will be substantially large and it will fail to meet the requirements for normal operation failures of the mooring system can easily be caused by the harsh marine environment if the mooring system is not set properly the mooring system is selected based on the floating structure s service requirement including the offset and tension limits therefore it is necessary to study the optimisation of deep water mooring systems under various working conditions optimizing the design of the mooring system of a floating platform is very complex using conventional optimisation techniques singh 1996 shafieefar and rezvani 2007 there has been an increasing interest in optimizing the mooring system using various algorithms with the increasing use of deep water floating structures a genetic algorithm ga is popular in the optimisation procedure of the catenary mooring lines and risers with a number of independent variables involved in the design such as line length line tension platform heading and mooring pattern shafieefar and rezvani 2007 felix gonzalez and mercier 2016 there are also other algorithms used for the optimisation of the mooring system one single and fully integrated design methodology was proposed for the mooring systems and the risers of a deep water floating production system fps girón et al 2014 in addition because of the nonlinear behaviour of mooring lines felix gonzalez and mercier 2016 views heuristic search techniques as a good choice for mooring design it is important to determine the response of a floating body to optimize the mooring system and brommundt et al 2012 defined the linear response of a platform by frequency domain analysis and then carried out the mooring system optimisation for floating wind turbines accounting for the environmental loads from various directions in the design process of the mooring system many factors must be considered not only to meet the safety and operational requirements but also to regard the cost as an important optimisation objective campanile et al 2018 conducted the mooring design and selection for floating offshore wind turbines based on cost analysis however the optimisation of the mooring system requires determining the dynamic response of floating structure which will lead to a high computational cost as it is derived from complex finite element time domain simulation tools moreover several independent variables will require analysis for hundreds and thousands of load combinations de pina et al 2013 with the functions of associative memory classification recognition optimisation calculation and nonlinear mapping artificial neural networks anns have been popular in the field of architecture and ocean engineering prediction since the 1990s guarize et al 2007 trained the original short structural response obtained by a finite element method fem approach using an ann and obtained a much longer time simulation the hybrid ann approach has been verified to be accurate for predicting a structural response with strong nonlinearity similarly de pina et al 2013 proposed one procedure associating an ann with a nonlinear model that can obtain the response of platform essentially in agreement with the results provided by fem based on nonlinear dynamic analysis finally de pina et al 2014b 2016 presented the development of anns for the analysis of any arbitrarily defined spread mooring configuration for fps anns are reliable and have been popular across various research subjects such as wave heights prediction kumar et al 2017 wang et al 2018 fatigue damage analysis is generally based on an extremely long time domain that is obtained by fem and results in high computational costs the prediction of the tension in mooring lines by ann can adequately solve this problem quéau et al 2014 carried out a stress analysis of the steel catenary risers that includes a sensitivity study and an approximation of the static stress range aqdam et al 2018 presented the new design of the radial basis function neural network for damage diagnosis the approach is of great importance for monitoring the health of the mooring lines in floating structures there are many types of anns models and different models can be chosen based on the object and precision of simulation de pina et al 2014a adopted an approach based on wavelet networks which is a combination of feed forward neural network and wavelet transform and the results showed reasonable agreement with those obtained with fem li et al 2018 reported a functional relationship between the environmental conditions and the probability density for the mooring lines tension using an ann and reduced the computational cost other scholars used an artificial network and fem to predict safe sea state to ensure the normal operation of marine engineering structures yasseri et al 2010 bearing the above in mind this paper presents the development of a hybrid nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs narx back propagation neural network bpnn model referred to as the narx bpnn model for predicting the mooring line performance of floating structures the model can be utilised to solve the mooring system design and selection in the preliminary design stage owing to the complex non gaussian properties of a mooring line s response under hydrodynamic loads numerical simulations and theoretical derivations are time consuming and tedious a narx model can consider external past and present values to predict a target time series which combined with artificial neural network ann models can provide a practical technique to solve the mooring response prediction for performance assessment compared with the simple finite element method fem based on nonlinear dynamic analysis this approach is extended to conveniently predict the response of the floating structure and can perform almost as well moreover a detailed case study utilising various design variables was conducted to evaluate the performance and robustness of the developed model the optimal delay span and neurons in hidden layers are analysed and determined by the statistical error analysis using test data of an example semi submersible platform to improve the accuracy of the ann model the application of various activation functions such as sigmoid and radial basis radbas functions are investigated in this study furthermore the conventional bpnn model improves static response prediction through the bpnn and narx bpnn models a predictive approach can be realised for mooring system performance monitoring and to search for the appropriate parameters for mooring system design notably the principle of platform selection is that both offset and mooring tensions meet the service requirements in addition this model can provide technical feasibility and a reference for mooring performance detection in practical situations with platform motion as an input because that the long time tension response is more difficult to record and monitor than floating body motions the structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows section 2 briefly introduces the main characteristics of the bpnn section 3 describes the optimisation model of the floating platform and the use of a bpnn to predict the pretension of mooring lines with various mooring parameters section 4 describes the hybrid approach bp fem model used to obtain a long time domain response prediction for the floating platform a short time history simulation obtained by fem was trained by the bpnn and the prediction results were verified by a statistical analysis of the error in section 5 an optimal design selection for the mooring system is defined considering environmental conditions with different incidences finally in section 6 some concluding remarks are presented based on a case study 2 back propagation neural network a bpnn rumelhart et al 1986 is a multi layer feedforward neural network which is trained based on the error reverse propagation algorithm it is currently is one of the most popular neural networks the bpnn can learn and store several input output schema mapping relationships without revealing the underlying mathematical equations in advance its learning rule is to use the steepest descent method to adjust the weights and thresholds of the network through backpropagation such that the topology of the network model comprises an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer as depicted in fig 1 2 1 training of bpnn for static response prediction under the stimulation of external input samples x x 1 x 2 x n the neural network continuously adjusts the connection weights w h w ij and w o w jk in the hidden and output layer respectively to maintain a network output close to the expected output y y 1 y 2 y m haykin 1994 widrow et al 1994 the threshold values a h and b o and the number of neurons k are also adopted to construct a neural network model the output values for hidden layer h connected with those parameters can then be generated as follows 1 h f w h x a h where f is the excitation function which can be defined in this model as follows 2 f s 1 1 e s for the outputs of the bp model o can be obtained by combining the value of the hidden layer connection weights and threshold values as follows 3 o w o h b o the error is then calculated by comparing the output values o with the expected values y e y o and the connection weights can be adjusted similarly the network neural threshold a h b o can also be updated according to the error the training procedure continues iteratively until the output error reaches the expected value e ε then the results obtained from the neural network can be considered on par with those obtained from conventional approaches the design of the mooring system of the floating platform requires the consideration of multiple variables with a large selection range and the associated computational cost is too onerous therefore some representative parameters can be selected for computation and the results obtained can be used to train a bpnn model a general rule for the structural design parameters and structural responses can then be defined the bpnn is built using the sets of input and output data from the librium module in the finite element analysis software program ansys aqwa the static pretension for a mooring system with various design variables in the preliminary design stage can be calculated using the established network furthermore the relationship between the design variables and pretension can be efficiently obtained the process for mooring tension prediction using ann models includes the following steps 1 selection of an appropriate ann mode and data processing rule 2 preparation of the database collection and allocation for training validation and testing 3 training of the ann model and determination of optimal network parameters and 4 prediction of target variables 2 2 modified bpnn for dynamic response prediction previous studies have investigated the time series response prediction in the dynamic analyses of engineering structures petrov 1998 sagrilo et al 2002 ferreira et al 2016 the fem is an essential approach to study the dynamic response of structures however for large marine structures solving the long time historical response is typically very time consuming particularly for the optimisation design with a large number of combinations this is owing to the nonlinearity of the structural system and the small time step required to yield reliable results a sequential set of data points with a predetermined time step can be obtained from a dynamic response analysis procedure then a set of time series vectors r t can be defined with a group of discrete values r 1 r 2 r n the mooring line tension response r t is regarded as a target random variable and arranged in a particular order excited by external loading to predict the long time domain dynamic response of mooring line tension a narx model combined with a bpnn model was constructed for monitoring and performance assessment applications in this model target values of a time series r t are predicted using the present and past external series w t the motions of a floating body in 3 degrees of freedom are adopted as input variables therefore the narx bpnn model can consider both present and past values of external excitation to predict the time series tension as follows 4 r t f c w x t 1 w x t n x w y t 1 w y t n y w z t 1 w z t n z where f is a neural network model here a bpnn is adopted and c comprises the neural network parameters such as weight bias and activation function in the network the optimal choice is typically defined based on statistical error analysis for a dynamic analysis of floating structures the tension response of the mooring system is generally related to the fairlead point motions guarize et al 2007 which are assumed to be identical to the floating structure motions such as surge w x t sway w y t and heave w z t corresponding to the mooring line tension r t the dynamic response of the floating structures is selected as the input of the neural network the structural motion response over n time periods is used as the input value for the network training of the tension output at a particular time t although the narx bpnn model can be applied to time series prediction an appropriate network is required for an accurate forecasting this step is conducted using test data from a target floating system the weight coefficient can be determined based on a gradient descent algorithm and the threshold values are adjusted using a feedforward backpropagation procedure after the input and target variables have been presented to the network in the process of constructing the neural network the selection of the number of hidden layer neurons was investigated which has a significant impact on the accuracy and efficiency of prediction the number of neurons in the hidden layer is identified by a trial and error procedure the most accurate values in the network mode are employed for a long time domain prediction the optimal time delay span of the input variables 1 2 n x n y n z is chosen when the exogenous inputs are known the activation function is an important part of neural network to improve the accuracy of the narx bpnn model a primary exploration was performed using the same training data with various activation functions notably the optimal network parameters and functions must be determined by prediction error analysis in this study a short dynamic response series is first obtained by finite element analysis and the results are then used to train in a narx bpnn model it is important to note that the tension in the mooring lines is a dynamic process in which both present and previous structural responses have an effect on the subsequent tension response the performance of the network is then evaluated using statistical error parameters such as the root mean square error the optimal network parameters are determined and the network model is implemented and trained based on the chosen parameters using matlab mathworks finally the longer time series response for the floating platform tension response can be predicted based on the trained neural network model the architecture of the hybrid model is illustrated in fig 2 3 design of the mooring system this section presents the response of the semi submersible using the bpnn fem model for two cases i the pretension prediction of a catenary moored platform with twelve mooring lines ii the long tension response series prediction of the mooring lines 3 1 semi submersible model and design variables the application example in this study is of a semi submersible with twelve catenary lines moored in water with a depth of 1500 m it is a multi functional platform comprising two pontoons four columns and four braces as depicted in fig 3 the hydrodynamic element model is shown in fig 4 the most relevant dimensions of the floating platform are listed in table 1 for a floating structure in a service sea area the mooring system will have a significant impact on the dynamic response however the response of the mooring system is linked to a series of self conditions such as the layout pattern and geometry and the material parameters for the mooring line including its strength and anchor positions shafieefar and rezvani 2007 in this study the mooring system comprises four groups of three mooring lines with a particular angle between each line the catenary mooring line comprises three segments the top and bottom segments of the mooring line are chains and the middle segment is a polyester rope ferreira et al 2016 the length of each catenary line is constant and the parameters or optimisation variables considered include the azimuthal angles of the three mooring lines θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 the mooring radius r and the length of each segment of one mooring line bottom and middle segment l 1 l 2 this indicates that the material properties of the line are immutable as depicted in fig 3 naturally the platform heading is also significant and the impact of the direction of the environmental loads will be investigated in section 5 table 2 lists the relevant parameters for each mooring line the optimisation variables selected for the mooring line are listed in table 3 polyester ropes are made of materials with visco elastic properties thus their stiffness characteristics vary with the load duration and magnitude the number and frequency of load cycles and the loading history simplified models are adopted to capture the most important characteristics and yield conservative predictions of line tensions and vessel offsets the static dynamic stiffness is recommended by the american bureau of shipping guidance note 2011 as 5 e a δ f δ ε where δ f is the change in the load δ ε is the change in strain and ea is the stiffness or the modulus times the cross sectional area of the rope a non dimensional stiffness k r can be expressed as 6 k r e a m b s where mbs is the minimum breaking strength the catenary equations used in aqwa can be expressed as 7 h a e t a e 1 2 2 w z a e a e x h w sinh 1 w l h h l a e v w l t h 2 v 2 where l is the unstretched suspended length w is the submerged weight per unit length ae represents the stiffness per length x and z are the horizontal and vertical distances between the fairlead point on the structure and the contact point on the seabed respectively h describes the horizontal tension and v and t are the vertical and total tension force at the fairlead point respectively actually the properties of composite mooring line chain polyester chain such as axial stiffness and breaking strength are defined in the drift module of ansys aqwa in terms of one or more catenaries numerical approach is used to calculate the stiffness matrix of composite mooring line the relevant parameters for each mooring line are listed in table 2 the time integration of equation of motion and tension are conducted in the numerical software it has been found necessary to use an extremely reliable two stage predictor corrector integration scheme to predict the position and velocity of the structures at the following time increment the forces are then recomputed with the new position and velocity and the process is repeated to create step by step the time history of motion the mooring radius is generally restricted by the space requirement of subsea structures and typically has a limited variation range for the chosen of optimisation parameters for the mooring radius this study referred to shafieefar and rezvani 2007 in which the anchor position horizontal distance between the anchor and fairlead is adopted as an optimisation design parameter this parameter affects the structural response the optimisation parameters were selected in reference to a previous study shafieefarand and rezvani 2007 xu et al 2018 within a suitable range here the length of the top segment is predefined the length of intermediate segment is variable and the bottom segment length can be derived from the total length de pina et al 2016 the anchor point is regarded as a variable the mooring radius r in this study represents the shortest distance between the anchor and the fairlead point projected on the sea floor as depicted in fig 3 and the angle between the mooring radius and the horizontal axis is assumed to be θ in the design stage based on the mooring radius and the azimuthal angles a simplified expression to solve the anchor position is expressed using the following equations 8 x m x f r cos θ 9 y m y f r sin θ where x m y m and x f y f are the positions of the anchor point and the fairlead respectively r represents the mooring radius θ is the azimuthal angle between the mooring line and the horizontal axis 3 2 generation of the database adjusting the pretension of the mooring system during operation affects the efficiency of the operation leads to steep economic loses and introduces a high risk of obtaining a broken winch and chain stop failure under the condition of high mooring line pretension although some pretension adjustments appear in the operation manuals they are rarely implemented hence adjusting the pretension is not recommended during operation unless it is necessary to ensure platform security once the pretension of the mooring lines is set when the working conditions change the pretension scheme should satisfy the requirements of various environmental conditions to an extent thus to design and select a mooring system the pretension of the mooring lines should be calculated first and the optimal target for the pretension in the operation condition is the maximum safe operation window in this study the database includes five main variables of the mooring system with 2000 combinations as listed in table 3 generally the pretension can be calculated using static analysis in this study the overall model of a semi submersible platform and the mooring system has been created in the hydrodynamic analysis software ansys aqwa the static analysis of the mooring system can be conducted in the librium module and the pretension results can be obtained after the mooring system design is determined the dynamic response analysis can then be conducted in the drift module by considering all the variables of the mooring system a total of 2000 combinations are produced the bpnn model is adopted to predict the pretension of mooring lines in which the mooring design parameters are used as the input and the pretension is in the output layer the narx bpnn model is utilised to predict the dynamic tension response which is related to both the present and past values of the external excitation the platform motions are adopted as the input variables for this model to verify the hybrid method the pretension of the mooring system is solved by the fem for all cases and the results obtained by the bpnn fem model are compared with those obtained only by the fem the architecture of the bpnn model for pretension prediction is depicted in fig 5 in this section the relationship between the pretension and optimisation variables was investigated fig 6 shows that the pretension of the mooring line increases with the middle segment length and mooring radius however the influence of the mooring radius is more significant in addition the azimuthal angles of the three mooring lines have no effect on the pretension when other parameters are defined 3 3 training and pretension prediction if the neural network adapts too aggressively to the training data the errors in the test data will increase to avoid overfitting the full database obtained in section 3 2 will be divided into three parts training validation and test subsets de pina et al 2016 the training process will stop when the validation error stops decreasing or even increases as shown in fig 7 in this study the database allocation refers to de pina et al 2016 where 40 of the full database is employed for training 800 reserving 60 for testing 1200 amongst those training datapoints 80 were selected for training 640 and 20 for validation 160 to maintain the accuracy and stability of the training process the training data needs to be normalized via the following equation hashemi fath 2017 10 x n o r m x x min x max x min where x represents the actual value of the training data and x max and x min are the maximum and minimum values of the training data respectively the normalization of the data avoids the large network prediction error caused by the large difference in order of magnitude in input and output data similarly the normalized data must be subjected to a denormalization process after network training to generate the actual output data 11 x x n o r m x max x min x min figs 8 and 9 show that pretension predicted by bp neural network is in agreement with that obtained with the fem and the maximum error is less than 1 0 4 dynamic response prediction of semi submersible as mentioned previously a mooring system for a semi submersible is required to meet the service requirements such as offset and tension limits after the layout and parameters of the mooring system are determined the dynamic response of the floating structure should be analysed the bpnn fem approach is applied to estimate the time history response of the mooring lines with maximum tension the procedure of the hybrid approach is illustrated in fig 10 4 1 data processing in the following case studies environmental loads with various incidences are applied to the platform with the following parameters the wind loads are based on the api spectrum with an average speed of 36 50 m s at 10 m above sea level the wave loads are represented using the jonswap model with h s 8 4 m and h p 12 1 s the current loads consist of a uniform flow with a velocity of 1 07 m s the dynamic response of the semi submersible platform is analysed using the fem and bpnn fem methods respectively with both environmental loads acting simultaneously in the same direction generally the incidence directions of the wind waves and currents vary in different seasons therefore any direction combinations of the environmental loads should be considered in the numerical calculation for a structural safety assessment the most unfavourable conditions are chosen for verification in the following studies the environmental loads are assumed to be in the same incidence direction and a total of five directions are considered 0 22 5 45 67 5 90 a short dynamic response series for each incidence direction is obtained by finite element analysis and the results are then used to train in a narx bpnn model to predict mooring line tension in the optimisation the application of neural network greatly improves the calculation efficiency the aforementioned semi submersible platform which is designed for a service depth of 1500 m is employed as a case study to demonstrate the application of the hybrid approach the mooring line dynamic tension is dependent on the motion of the floating structure and the environmental conditions under a given environmental load 36 50 m s 8 4 m 12 1 s 1 07 m s 0 the dynamic response of the floating system can be obtained using the drift module of ansys aqwa the theory for the hydrodynamic analysis of a semi submersible platform is primarily based on three dimension potential theory and the morison equation the motion of the semi submersible platform can be expressed as follows 12 m a x t c x t kx t 0 t r t τ x τ d τ f t where m and a are the body mass matrix and the infinite added mass matrix respectively c is the damping matrix k is the total stiffness matrix r is the velocity impulse function matrix and f is total external force including the mooring tensions a 3 h dynamic analysis of floating structures is performed using the fem to assess the statistical properties of the structural response in this study an actual 3 h dynamic response of the semi submersible platform is conducted a total of 500 s response series including the motion and the most loaded line tension which is line 7 under the environmental loads in the 0 direction is applied for neural network training and validation as represented in figs 11 14 to ensure the accuracy of the training the initial unstable 500 s response are removed after it is established that the narx bpnn model is trained well the rest tension time series 9800 s can be predicted using motion response as input in practical situations the long time motion response of the floating structure is easier to monitor and record than the tension response and the trained neural network model can be utilised to monitor the mooring tension performance using the motion of the floating body as the input 4 2 data training validation and output as previously mentioned the results for dynamic response prediction are related to the previous time series therefore the impact of various delays n x n y n z and the number of neurons on the predicted results is explored the accuracy and verification of the trained neural network must be expressed by some statistical parameters hashemi fath 2017 4 2 1 maximum absolute relative error max are the relative error between the predicted and actual values can be expressed using the following equation 13 e i x a c t u x p r e d x a c t u i 100 i 1 2 n where x actu and x pred refer to the actual and predicted values using the trained neural network respectively in addition n denotes the number of validation datapoints the maximum absolute relative error can then be expressed as follows 14 e max max e i i 1 2 n 4 2 2 mean absolute relative error mare the mean absolute relative error can be obtained via the following equation 15 m a r e 1 n i 1 n e i 4 2 3 root mean square error rmse the root mean square error can be calculated using the following equation 16 r s m e 1 n i 1 n x i a c t u x i p r e d 2 4 2 4 standard deviation sd the standard deviation can be expressed as follows 17 s d 1 n 1 i 1 n x i a c t u x i p r e d x i a c t u 2 4 2 5 maximum tension absolute relative error mtare the maximum relative error between predicted and actual tension can be obtained as follows 18 e t e n t e n f e m max t e n b p max t e n f e m max 100 where ten femmax and ten bpmax represent the maximum tension in the time history analysis of the mooring lines obtained by the fem and bp fem respectively the data for the 500 s in the dynamic time series is used as the training and verification data of the narx bpnn model the time interval of the sequence is 1 2s among the training data 80 was selected for training 333 and 20 for validation 83 the motion histories sway surge heave are used as the input neurons and the narx bpnn model expressed in section 2 2 is adopted to predict the tension time series for the mooring tension long time series prediction 9800 s in this study the motions of floating structures combined with the narx model are used as the input for the trained network model 10 neurons in the hidden layer are implemented using matlab a preliminary parametric study is performed to define the choice of 10 neurons as depicted in fig 15 and the final choice is consistent with the results presented in the literature de pina et al 2016 increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layers could not significantly improve the accuracy of the prediction results with increasing computation times the statistical parameters of the trained network are listed in table 4 and the results show an error emax of approximately 10 which appears to be further optimised it should be noted however that the tension performance assessment in this study focuses on the maximum values and statistical properties of the tension series the eten expressed using eq 18 indicates that the prediction error for the maximum response values are less than 5 and other parameters indicate that the predicted results are in good agreement with the fem results for statistical properties in this section the effect of the activation function on the prediction accuracy is also investigated a radial function was applied to replace the sigmoid function in the narx bpnn model with a modified time span the prediction results of this case are shown in fig 16 the statistic errors are also adopted to determine the preferred activation function the comparison results are listed in table 5 from the results it is observed that the narx bpnn model using the two types of activation functions can both provide ideal prediction results however the results obtained using the sigmoid activation function are better in this case because the statistical parameters are lower the resulting difference between both models is minimal to carefully verify the efficiency of the predicted mooring tension time series the mooring tension spectrum analysis was implemented using matlab based on the fast fourier transform and a hanning window is utilised to smooth the spectrum the tension spectrums obtained from the fem and narx bpnn models are illustrated in fig 17 it can be clearly observed that the frequency components demonstrate good consistency for various models here the most appropriate parameters of the modified bpnn models are determined and the accuracy of the prediction results is verified using statistical error measurements in the following part of the study the dynamic narx bpnn model is constructed using the delay span n x 20 n y 20 n z 20 10 neurons in hidden layers and a sigmoid function is adopted as the activation function a 3 h motion and tension response analysis of the floating structure should typically be performed to ensure the stability of the statistical properties after modelling the floating system using numerical software it takes approximately half an hour for one case calculation however it cost a few seconds about 7 5 s to predict the mooring tension response after the narx bpnn model was constructed moreover this model exhibits obvious advantages when the performance of the mooring lines is not easy to observe for long time periods in practical situations the pretension can be calculated using the librium module and it is none of business with the platform motion while the construction of the coupled floating system with various design combinations is too onerous accurate pretension prediction results can be obtained within seconds with the trained bpnn model thus the application of a neural network significantly improves the calculation efficiency 5 optimal selection of mooring system for different load conditions a deep water semi submersible mooring system is primarily used for position maintenance to ensure a successful drilling operation the offset of the platform should not exceed the prescribed circumference to guarantee the integrity of the structure and function of the mooring system the mooring lines should not be disconnected or broken and the minimum safety factor of the mooring line tension should not be less than the permitted value moreover the mooring system should not be exposed to other failure circumstances such as anchor and fatigue failure in this study the constraints for the selection of a mooring system are the platform offset and the full mooring line tension i e other failure situations are ignored it is considered that the average and maximum drift of the platform during operation should not exceed 4 and 8 of the water depth respectively the minimum safety factor of the mooring line should not be less than 1 67 according to the api rp 2sk 2005 for intact conditions it should be noted that the candidate design variables referred to in previous literature shafieefarand and rezvani 2007 xu et al 2018 are listed in table 3 the short dynamic response series for a given incident direction can only be used to train in a narx bpnn model for predicting mooring line tension under the same wave incident direction such as for an incident direction 30 the 500 s worth of data in the time series is utilised as the training and verification of the narx bpnn model and the long time tension series can be predicted using the constructed ann model under this 30 wave incident direction namely the precise predicting mooring line tensions in the optimisation can only be obtained under the condition that the incident direction of prediction are consistent with the trained model for axisymmetric semi submersible platform system a total of seven short time series from common incidence directions such as 0 22 5 30 45 60 67 5 and 90 are used in the training respectively then the seven constructed ann models are utilised to predict the dynamic tension response of the most loaded mooring line with various design variables under these seven incidence directions finally we can choose the most optimal design parameters based on the predicted results the disadvantage of this model is that no optimisation techniques such as genetic algorithm can be combined due to repeated training processes once considering arbitrary incident directions 5 1 dynamic response of semi submersible under various load conditions in each case analysis the 500 s responses are used as the training data set which is randomly divided into training and validation samples in the modelling process of the modified bpnn model the subsequent 9800 s datapoints are used for testing to predict the tension of the mooring lines and compare the results with numerical simulation the parameters n x 20 n y 20 n z 20 and n t 10 are chosen as the delay span and neural number respectively and their optimality is validated in table 4 seventy five cases including five main optimisation parameters are investigated to more intuitively demonstrate the prediction impact of the bpnn fem two visual schematics are displayed in following study including that for the tension prediction and actual dynamic response of the mooring line and the correlation coefficients between the predicted and actual tension data at the three stages of training validation and testing 5 2 azimuthal angles optimisation the dynamic response of the mooring system is discrepant for various azimuthal angles with fixed design parameters r 3500 m and l2 2400 m in this subsection the cases with identical remaining parameters are studied the maximum offset of the platform and maximum mooring lines tension for each direction are illustrated in figs 18 and 19 the long tension series prediction is performed using a trained neural network as presented in the previous section the most loaded mooring line tension obtained using the narx bpnn model and fem is shown in fig 20 the correlation coefficients between the predicted and actual tension data are displayed in fig 21 actually the accuracy of the neural network constructed for each design case is similar table 6 presents the statistical errors for the prediction results for just two cases due to paper space limitations with azimuthal angles θ 1 35 θ 2 38 θ 3 43 and θ 1 37 θ 2 40 θ 3 45 the influence of different angles on the response of mooring system is almost negligible the absolute relative differences of the maximum tension in the mooring line in all cases are within the range 0 5 there is a total of 25 cases in which the environmental loads acting on the semi submersible platform are set in different directions from the results it can be observed that the azimuthal angle has no effect on the maximum tension of the mooring lines however it does have a significant effect on the motion response of the platform which varies greatly under the various direction loads with other azimuthal angles to meet the requirements of the specification the second arrangement mode θ 1 37 θ 2 40 θ 3 45 is chosen in the subsequent calculation 5 3 length of middle segment optimisation based on the results of section 5 2 the influence of the length of the middle segment of the mooring lines on the dynamic response of the semi submersible platform is investigated using the appropriate azimuthal angle and a particular mooring radius θ 1 37 θ 2 40 θ 3 45 and r 3500 m the results show that the length of the middle segment has a significant influence on the maximum tension of the mooring line but has minimal effect on the motion response of the platform as observed in figs 22 and 23 in the third case the maximum tension of the mooring system is minimal therefore the length of the middle segment used in the following investigation to explore the effects of other parameters is l2 2400 m similar to the aforementioned the mooring line tension response and the correlation coefficients between the predicted and actual results are depicted in figs 24 and 25 respectively statistical errors in tension prediction are displayed just for one case l2 2350 m in table 7 indicating that the results obtained using a neural network are in agreement with those obtained using the fem and the results for l2 2400 m are coincident with θ 1 37 θ 2 40 θ 3 45 listed in table 7 because the mooring system has same design parameters in those two cases this result can be used as a reference to reduce the cost of the deep water mooring system 5 4 mooring radius optimisation in this part the dynamic response of a semi submersible platform with various mooring radii under different environmental loads is investigated θ 1 37 θ 2 40 θ 3 45 and l2 2400 m similarly the best previously determined values are used for the other mooring parameters figs 26 and 27 show that the larger the mooring radius of the semi submersible platform the greater the drift in addition the maximum tension of the mooring lines is not necessary the lowest due to the weight or other factors in this study the dynamic response of the semi submersible at r 3500 m meets the requirements of the specification figs 28 and 29 display the mooring line tension response obtained using various models and the correlation coefficients between the predicted and actual data respectively table 8 lists the statistical errors in tension prediction for r 3550 m and the results for optimal choice r 3500 m are coincident with θ 1 37 θ 2 40 θ 3 45 listed in table 6 6 conclusions in the present study a hybrid bpnn fem approach was developed and verified for a semi submersible mooring design model the primary features of this approach are as follows using the trained bpnn to predict pretension and a narx bpnn model for the tension dynamic response of the submersible mooring system with various design variables selecting the mooring system parameters with the maximum operation window period to evaluate the accuracy of the model the long time history response of the semi submersible platform was solved by the fem and the analysis of the statistical error for the response prediction was conducted a total of 2000 combinations of several variables of the mooring system were calculated and the static pretension prediction obtained using a bpnn model was in agreement with those obtained by the fem the maximum statistical error is less than 1 the narx bpnn model is used to predict the dynamic tension of the mooring lines in a total of 75 cases in which the maximum tension error is within 0 5 based on the results of this study key conclusions can be drawn 1 the bpnn and narx bpnn models demonstrate good applicability to static and dynamic response prediction potentially providing a significant improvement to the calculation efficiency of the marine structures analysis in the preliminary design stage 2 the number of hidden layer neurons and the optimal time span are identified by a trial and error approach the neural network model that generated the most accurate results is employed to predict the tension response the maximum values and statistical properties of the predicted tension series are in good agreement with those obtained using the fem 3 the sigmoid function used as the activation function exhibits better prediction performance than the radbas function in this case however both models can provide ideal results and the difference is minimal 4 for the mooring system design for the semi submersible platform the laws of the structural response are investigated under the influence of various design variables and the optimal design parameters can be determined based on the predicted results 5 a relatively accurate prediction of the time domain tension can be made using the trained neural network based on the platform s motion response in addition to the preliminary design of the platform mooring system this hybrid approach is also useful for other areas of research regarding floating marine structures such as fatigue analysis or response monitoring of mooring lines in practical situations the bpnn based models can provide a convenient method to define the optimal mooring system based on several candidate design variables however optimisation techniques need to be further investigated and adopted in this procedure to provide a comprehensive guide to

21038,the design and optimisation of a mooring system for a floating platform typically necessitates engineering experience and time consuming numerical simulations a novel hybrid bpnn fem approach based on the modified bp neural network and fem is proposed to more conveniently predict the statistic pretension and dynamic tension series of mooring systems with several design variables under irregular sea states the accuracy of this approach has been validated using several statistical error metrics this procedure can be used to optimize the mooring system design of the floating platform in a more economical manner than time intensive numerical simulations an optional mooring selection is proposed based on the maximum safe operation window and the requirements for the platform drift and mooring line safety performance a deep water semi submersible platform is presented as an example to demonstrate the hybrid approach this platform comprises twelve mooring lines and the design variables include the mooring radius values for the azimuthal spacing of the mooring lines and the length of the various segments of the mooring lines the impact of environmental load incidences is also considered in this process the prediction results are in reasonable agreement with those obtained using the fem keywords bp neural network mooring design semi submersible platform tension prediction 1 introduction production activities supported by floating structures have been increasingly conducted in deep and ultra deep water because of the scarcity of offshore oil and gas resources with improvements in floating structures the semi submersible platform has developed to the seventh generation with many advantages including a wide working depth strong wind and wave resistance ability and a large deck space the research on the dynamic performance of the semi submersible platform aims at a better platform design safer operation higher survivability and work efficiency an anchor station keeping system is considerably important to a semi submersible drilling platform and the appropriate pretension setting of the mooring system is required to ensure the safe operation of a deep water floating platform if the pretension is substantially large the mooring line will experience a large dynamic tension which is not conducive to the safety of the mooring line and if the pretension is too small the dynamic response of the platform will be substantially large and it will fail to meet the requirements for normal operation failures of the mooring system can easily be caused by the harsh marine environment if the mooring system is not set properly the mooring system is selected based on the floating structure s service requirement including the offset and tension limits therefore it is necessary to study the optimisation of deep water mooring systems under various working conditions optimizing the design of the mooring system of a floating platform is very complex using conventional optimisation techniques singh 1996 shafieefar and rezvani 2007 there has been an increasing interest in optimizing the mooring system using various algorithms with the increasing use of deep water floating structures a genetic algorithm ga is popular in the optimisation procedure of the catenary mooring lines and risers with a number of independent variables involved in the design such as line length line tension platform heading and mooring pattern shafieefar and rezvani 2007 felix gonzalez and mercier 2016 there are also other algorithms used for the optimisation of the mooring system one single and fully integrated design methodology was proposed for the mooring systems and the risers of a deep water floating production system fps girón et al 2014 in addition because of the nonlinear behaviour of mooring lines felix gonzalez and mercier 2016 views heuristic search techniques as a good choice for mooring design it is important to determine the response of a floating body to optimize the mooring system and brommundt et al 2012 defined the linear response of a platform by frequency domain analysis and then carried out the mooring system optimisation for floating wind turbines accounting for the environmental loads from various directions in the design process of the mooring system many factors must be considered not only to meet the safety and operational requirements but also to regard the cost as an important optimisation objective campanile et al 2018 conducted the mooring design and selection for floating offshore wind turbines based on cost analysis however the optimisation of the mooring system requires determining the dynamic response of floating structure which will lead to a high computational cost as it is derived from complex finite element time domain simulation tools moreover several independent variables will require analysis for hundreds and thousands of load combinations de pina et al 2013 with the functions of associative memory classification recognition optimisation calculation and nonlinear mapping artificial neural networks anns have been popular in the field of architecture and ocean engineering prediction since the 1990s guarize et al 2007 trained the original short structural response obtained by a finite element method fem approach using an ann and obtained a much longer time simulation the hybrid ann approach has been verified to be accurate for predicting a structural response with strong nonlinearity similarly de pina et al 2013 proposed one procedure associating an ann with a nonlinear model that can obtain the response of platform essentially in agreement with the results provided by fem based on nonlinear dynamic analysis finally de pina et al 2014b 2016 presented the development of anns for the analysis of any arbitrarily defined spread mooring configuration for fps anns are reliable and have been popular across various research subjects such as wave heights prediction kumar et al 2017 wang et al 2018 fatigue damage analysis is generally based on an extremely long time domain that is obtained by fem and results in high computational costs the prediction of the tension in mooring lines by ann can adequately solve this problem quéau et al 2014 carried out a stress analysis of the steel catenary risers that includes a sensitivity study and an approximation of the static stress range aqdam et al 2018 presented the new design of the radial basis function neural network for damage diagnosis the approach is of great importance for monitoring the health of the mooring lines in floating structures there are many types of anns models and different models can be chosen based on the object and precision of simulation de pina et al 2014a adopted an approach based on wavelet networks which is a combination of feed forward neural network and wavelet transform and the results showed reasonable agreement with those obtained with fem li et al 2018 reported a functional relationship between the environmental conditions and the probability density for the mooring lines tension using an ann and reduced the computational cost other scholars used an artificial network and fem to predict safe sea state to ensure the normal operation of marine engineering structures yasseri et al 2010 bearing the above in mind this paper presents the development of a hybrid nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs narx back propagation neural network bpnn model referred to as the narx bpnn model for predicting the mooring line performance of floating structures the model can be utilised to solve the mooring system design and selection in the preliminary design stage owing to the complex non gaussian properties of a mooring line s response under hydrodynamic loads numerical simulations and theoretical derivations are time consuming and tedious a narx model can consider external past and present values to predict a target time series which combined with artificial neural network ann models can provide a practical technique to solve the mooring response prediction for performance assessment compared with the simple finite element method fem based on nonlinear dynamic analysis this approach is extended to conveniently predict the response of the floating structure and can perform almost as well moreover a detailed case study utilising various design variables was conducted to evaluate the performance and robustness of the developed model the optimal delay span and neurons in hidden layers are analysed and determined by the statistical error analysis using test data of an example semi submersible platform to improve the accuracy of the ann model the application of various activation functions such as sigmoid and radial basis radbas functions are investigated in this study furthermore the conventional bpnn model improves static response prediction through the bpnn and narx bpnn models a predictive approach can be realised for mooring system performance monitoring and to search for the appropriate parameters for mooring system design notably the principle of platform selection is that both offset and mooring tensions meet the service requirements in addition this model can provide technical feasibility and a reference for mooring performance detection in practical situations with platform motion as an input because that the long time tension response is more difficult to record and monitor than floating body motions the structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows section 2 briefly introduces the main characteristics of the bpnn section 3 describes the optimisation model of the floating platform and the use of a bpnn to predict the pretension of mooring lines with various mooring parameters section 4 describes the hybrid approach bp fem model used to obtain a long time domain response prediction for the floating platform a short time history simulation obtained by fem was trained by the bpnn and the prediction results were verified by a statistical analysis of the error in section 5 an optimal design selection for the mooring system is defined considering environmental conditions with different incidences finally in section 6 some concluding remarks are presented based on a case study 2 back propagation neural network a bpnn rumelhart et al 1986 is a multi layer feedforward neural network which is trained based on the error reverse propagation algorithm it is currently is one of the most popular neural networks the bpnn can learn and store several input output schema mapping relationships without revealing the underlying mathematical equations in advance its learning rule is to use the steepest descent method to adjust the weights and thresholds of the network through backpropagation such that the topology of the network model comprises an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer as depicted in fig 1 2 1 training of bpnn for static response prediction under the stimulation of external input samples x x 1 x 2 x n the neural network continuously adjusts the connection weights w h w ij and w o w jk in the hidden and output layer respectively to maintain a network output close to the expected output y y 1 y 2 y m haykin 1994 widrow et al 1994 the threshold values a h and b o and the number of neurons k are also adopted to construct a neural network model the output values for hidden layer h connected with those parameters can then be generated as follows 1 h f w h x a h where f is the excitation function which can be defined in this model as follows 2 f s 1 1 e s for the outputs of the bp model o can be obtained by combining the value of the hidden layer connection weights and threshold values as follows 3 o w o h b o the error is then calculated by comparing the output values o with the expected values y e y o and the connection weights can be adjusted similarly the network neural threshold a h b o can also be updated according to the error the training procedure continues iteratively until the output error reaches the expected value e ε then the results obtained from the neural network can be considered on par with those obtained from conventional approaches the design of the mooring system of the floating platform requires the consideration of multiple variables with a large selection range and the associated computational cost is too onerous therefore some representative parameters can be selected for computation and the results obtained can be used to train a bpnn model a general rule for the structural design parameters and structural responses can then be defined the bpnn is built using the sets of input and output data from the librium module in the finite element analysis software program ansys aqwa the static pretension for a mooring system with various design variables in the preliminary design stage can be calculated using the established network furthermore the relationship between the design variables and pretension can be efficiently obtained the process for mooring tension prediction using ann models includes the following steps 1 selection of an appropriate ann mode and data processing rule 2 preparation of the database collection and allocation for training validation and testing 3 training of the ann model and determination of optimal network parameters and 4 prediction of target variables 2 2 modified bpnn for dynamic response prediction previous studies have investigated the time series response prediction in the dynamic analyses of engineering structures petrov 1998 sagrilo et al 2002 ferreira et al 2016 the fem is an essential approach to study the dynamic response of structures however for large marine structures solving the long time historical response is typically very time consuming particularly for the optimisation design with a large number of combinations this is owing to the nonlinearity of the structural system and the small time step required to yield reliable results a sequential set of data points with a predetermined time step can be obtained from a dynamic response analysis procedure then a set of time series vectors r t can be defined with a group of discrete values r 1 r 2 r n the mooring line tension response r t is regarded as a target random variable and arranged in a particular order excited by external loading to predict the long time domain dynamic response of mooring line tension a narx model combined with a bpnn model was constructed for monitoring and performance assessment applications in this model target values of a time series r t are predicted using the present and past external series w t the motions of a floating body in 3 degrees of freedom are adopted as input variables therefore the narx bpnn model can consider both present and past values of external excitation to predict the time series tension as follows 4 r t f c w x t 1 w x t n x w y t 1 w y t n y w z t 1 w z t n z where f is a neural network model here a bpnn is adopted and c comprises the neural network parameters such as weight bias and activation function in the network the optimal choice is typically defined based on statistical error analysis for a dynamic analysis of floating structures the tension response of the mooring system is generally related to the fairlead point motions guarize et al 2007 which are assumed to be identical to the floating structure motions such as surge w x t sway w y t and heave w z t corresponding to the mooring line tension r t the dynamic response of the floating structures is selected as the input of the neural network the structural motion response over n time periods is used as the input value for the network training of the tension output at a particular time t although the narx bpnn model can be applied to time series prediction an appropriate network is required for an accurate forecasting this step is conducted using test data from a target floating system the weight coefficient can be determined based on a gradient descent algorithm and the threshold values are adjusted using a feedforward backpropagation procedure after the input and target variables have been presented to the network in the process of constructing the neural network the selection of the number of hidden layer neurons was investigated which has a significant impact on the accuracy and efficiency of prediction the number of neurons in the hidden layer is identified by a trial and error procedure the most accurate values in the network mode are employed for a long time domain prediction the optimal time delay span of the input variables 1 2 n x n y n z is chosen when the exogenous inputs are known the activation function is an important part of neural network to improve the accuracy of the narx bpnn model a primary exploration was performed using the same training data with various activation functions notably the optimal network parameters and functions must be determined by prediction error analysis in this study a short dynamic response series is first obtained by finite element analysis and the results are then used to train in a narx bpnn model it is important to note that the tension in the mooring lines is a dynamic process in which both present and previous structural responses have an effect on the subsequent tension response the performance of the network is then evaluated using statistical error parameters such as the root mean square error the optimal network parameters are determined and the network model is implemented and trained based on the chosen parameters using matlab mathworks finally the longer time series response for the floating platform tension response can be predicted based on the trained neural network model the architecture of the hybrid model is illustrated in fig 2 3 design of the mooring system this section presents the response of the semi submersible using the bpnn fem model for two cases i the pretension prediction of a catenary moored platform with twelve mooring lines ii the long tension response series prediction of the mooring lines 3 1 semi submersible model and design variables the application example in this study is of a semi submersible with twelve catenary lines moored in water with a depth of 1500 m it is a multi functional platform comprising two pontoons four columns and four braces as depicted in fig 3 the hydrodynamic element model is shown in fig 4 the most relevant dimensions of the floating platform are listed in table 1 for a floating structure in a service sea area the mooring system will have a significant impact on the dynamic response however the response of the mooring system is linked to a series of self conditions such as the layout pattern and geometry and the material parameters for the mooring line including its strength and anchor positions shafieefar and rezvani 2007 in this study the mooring system comprises four groups of three mooring lines with a particular angle between each line the catenary mooring line comprises three segments the top and bottom segments of the mooring line are chains and the middle segment is a polyester rope ferreira et al 2016 the length of each catenary line is constant and the parameters or optimisation variables considered include the azimuthal angles of the three mooring lines θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 the mooring radius r and the length of each segment of one mooring line bottom and middle segment l 1 l 2 this indicates that the material properties of the line are immutable as depicted in fig 3 naturally the platform heading is also significant and the impact of the direction of the environmental loads will be investigated in section 5 table 2 lists the relevant parameters for each mooring line the optimisation variables selected for the mooring line are listed in table 3 polyester ropes are made of materials with visco elastic properties thus their stiffness characteristics vary with the load duration and magnitude the number and frequency of load cycles and the loading history simplified models are adopted to capture the most important characteristics and yield conservative predictions of line tensions and vessel offsets the static dynamic stiffness is recommended by the american bureau of shipping guidance note 2011 as 5 e a δ f δ ε where δ f is the change in the load δ ε is the change in strain and ea is the stiffness or the modulus times the cross sectional area of the rope a non dimensional stiffness k r can be expressed as 6 k r e a m b s where mbs is the minimum breaking strength the catenary equations used in aqwa can be expressed as 7 h a e t a e 1 2 2 w z a e a e x h w sinh 1 w l h h l a e v w l t h 2 v 2 where l is the unstretched suspended length w is the submerged weight per unit length ae represents the stiffness per length x and z are the horizontal and vertical distances between the fairlead point on the structure and the contact point on the seabed respectively h describes the horizontal tension and v and t are the vertical and total tension force at the fairlead point respectively actually the properties of composite mooring line chain polyester chain such as axial stiffness and breaking strength are defined in the drift module of ansys aqwa in terms of one or more catenaries numerical approach is used to calculate the stiffness matrix of composite mooring line the relevant parameters for each mooring line are listed in table 2 the time integration of equation of motion and tension are conducted in the numerical software it has been found necessary to use an extremely reliable two stage predictor corrector integration scheme to predict the position and velocity of the structures at the following time increment the forces are then recomputed with the new position and velocity and the process is repeated to create step by step the time history of motion the mooring radius is generally restricted by the space requirement of subsea structures and typically has a limited variation range for the chosen of optimisation parameters for the mooring radius this study referred to shafieefar and rezvani 2007 in which the anchor position horizontal distance between the anchor and fairlead is adopted as an optimisation design parameter this parameter affects the structural response the optimisation parameters were selected in reference to a previous study shafieefarand and rezvani 2007 xu et al 2018 within a suitable range here the length of the top segment is predefined the length of intermediate segment is variable and the bottom segment length can be derived from the total length de pina et al 2016 the anchor point is regarded as a variable the mooring radius r in this study represents the shortest distance between the anchor and the fairlead point projected on the sea floor as depicted in fig 3 and the angle between the mooring radius and the horizontal axis is assumed to be θ in the design stage based on the mooring radius and the azimuthal angles a simplified expression to solve the anchor position is expressed using the following equations 8 x m x f r cos θ 9 y m y f r sin θ where x m y m and x f y f are the positions of the anchor point and the fairlead respectively r represents the mooring radius θ is the azimuthal angle between the mooring line and the horizontal axis 3 2 generation of the database adjusting the pretension of the mooring system during operation affects the efficiency of the operation leads to steep economic loses and introduces a high risk of obtaining a broken winch and chain stop failure under the condition of high mooring line pretension although some pretension adjustments appear in the operation manuals they are rarely implemented hence adjusting the pretension is not recommended during operation unless it is necessary to ensure platform security once the pretension of the mooring lines is set when the working conditions change the pretension scheme should satisfy the requirements of various environmental conditions to an extent thus to design and select a mooring system the pretension of the mooring lines should be calculated first and the optimal target for the pretension in the operation condition is the maximum safe operation window in this study the database includes five main variables of the mooring system with 2000 combinations as listed in table 3 generally the pretension can be calculated using static analysis in this study the overall model of a semi submersible platform and the mooring system has been created in the hydrodynamic analysis software ansys aqwa the static analysis of the mooring system can be conducted in the librium module and the pretension results can be obtained after the mooring system design is determined the dynamic response analysis can then be conducted in the drift module by considering all the variables of the mooring system a total of 2000 combinations are produced the bpnn model is adopted to predict the pretension of mooring lines in which the mooring design parameters are used as the input and the pretension is in the output layer the narx bpnn model is utilised to predict the dynamic tension response which is related to both the present and past values of the external excitation the platform motions are adopted as the input variables for this model to verify the hybrid method the pretension of the mooring system is solved by the fem for all cases and the results obtained by the bpnn fem model are compared with those obtained only by the fem the architecture of the bpnn model for pretension prediction is depicted in fig 5 in this section the relationship between the pretension and optimisation variables was investigated fig 6 shows that the pretension of the mooring line increases with the middle segment length and mooring radius however the influence of the mooring radius is more significant in addition the azimuthal angles of the three mooring lines have no effect on the pretension when other parameters are defined 3 3 training and pretension prediction if the neural network adapts too aggressively to the training data the errors in the test data will increase to avoid overfitting the full database obtained in section 3 2 will be divided into three parts training validation and test subsets de pina et al 2016 the training process will stop when the validation error stops decreasing or even increases as shown in fig 7 in this study the database allocation refers to de pina et al 2016 where 40 of the full database is employed for training 800 reserving 60 for testing 1200 amongst those training datapoints 80 were selected for training 640 and 20 for validation 160 to maintain the accuracy and stability of the training process the training data needs to be normalized via the following equation hashemi fath 2017 10 x n o r m x x min x max x min where x represents the actual value of the training data and x max and x min are the maximum and minimum values of the training data respectively the normalization of the data avoids the large network prediction error caused by the large difference in order of magnitude in input and output data similarly the normalized data must be subjected to a denormalization process after network training to generate the actual output data 11 x x n o r m x max x min x min figs 8 and 9 show that pretension predicted by bp neural network is in agreement with that obtained with the fem and the maximum error is less than 1 0 4 dynamic response prediction of semi submersible as mentioned previously a mooring system for a semi submersible is required to meet the service requirements such as offset and tension limits after the layout and parameters of the mooring system are determined the dynamic response of the floating structure should be analysed the bpnn fem approach is applied to estimate the time history response of the mooring lines with maximum tension the procedure of the hybrid approach is illustrated in fig 10 4 1 data processing in the following case studies environmental loads with various incidences are applied to the platform with the following parameters the wind loads are based on the api spectrum with an average speed of 36 50 m s at 10 m above sea level the wave loads are represented using the jonswap model with h s 8 4 m and h p 12 1 s the current loads consist of a uniform flow with a velocity of 1 07 m s the dynamic response of the semi submersible platform is analysed using the fem and bpnn fem methods respectively with both environmental loads acting simultaneously in the same direction generally the incidence directions of the wind waves and currents vary in different seasons therefore any direction combinations of the environmental loads should be considered in the numerical calculation for a structural safety assessment the most unfavourable conditions are chosen for verification in the following studies the environmental loads are assumed to be in the same incidence direction and a total of five directions are considered 0 22 5 45 67 5 90 a short dynamic response series for each incidence direction is obtained by finite element analysis and the results are then used to train in a narx bpnn model to predict mooring line tension in the optimisation the application of neural network greatly improves the calculation efficiency the aforementioned semi submersible platform which is designed for a service depth of 1500 m is employed as a case study to demonstrate the application of the hybrid approach the mooring line dynamic tension is dependent on the motion of the floating structure and the environmental conditions under a given environmental load 36 50 m s 8 4 m 12 1 s 1 07 m s 0 the dynamic response of the floating system can be obtained using the drift module of ansys aqwa the theory for the hydrodynamic analysis of a semi submersible platform is primarily based on three dimension potential theory and the morison equation the motion of the semi submersible platform can be expressed as follows 12 m a x t c x t kx t 0 t r t τ x τ d τ f t where m and a are the body mass matrix and the infinite added mass matrix respectively c is the damping matrix k is the total stiffness matrix r is the velocity impulse function matrix and f is total external force including the mooring tensions a 3 h dynamic analysis of floating structures is performed using the fem to assess the statistical properties of the structural response in this study an actual 3 h dynamic response of the semi submersible platform is conducted a total of 500 s response series including the motion and the most loaded line tension which is line 7 under the environmental loads in the 0 direction is applied for neural network training and validation as represented in figs 11 14 to ensure the accuracy of the training the initial unstable 500 s response are removed after it is established that the narx bpnn model is trained well the rest tension time series 9800 s can be predicted using motion response as input in practical situations the long time motion response of the floating structure is easier to monitor and record than the tension response and the trained neural network model can be utilised to monitor the mooring tension performance using the motion of the floating body as the input 4 2 data training validation and output as previously mentioned the results for dynamic response prediction are related to the previous time series therefore the impact of various delays n x n y n z and the number of neurons on the predicted results is explored the accuracy and verification of the trained neural network must be expressed by some statistical parameters hashemi fath 2017 4 2 1 maximum absolute relative error max are the relative error between the predicted and actual values can be expressed using the following equation 13 e i x a c t u x p r e d x a c t u i 100 i 1 2 n where x actu and x pred refer to the actual and predicted values using the trained neural network respectively in addition n denotes the number of validation datapoints the maximum absolute relative error can then be expressed as follows 14 e max max e i i 1 2 n 4 2 2 mean absolute relative error mare the mean absolute relative error can be obtained via the following equation 15 m a r e 1 n i 1 n e i 4 2 3 root mean square error rmse the root mean square error can be calculated using the following equation 16 r s m e 1 n i 1 n x i a c t u x i p r e d 2 4 2 4 standard deviation sd the standard deviation can be expressed as follows 17 s d 1 n 1 i 1 n x i a c t u x i p r e d x i a c t u 2 4 2 5 maximum tension absolute relative error mtare the maximum relative error between predicted and actual tension can be obtained as follows 18 e t e n t e n f e m max t e n b p max t e n f e m max 100 where ten femmax and ten bpmax represent the maximum tension in the time history analysis of the mooring lines obtained by the fem and bp fem respectively the data for the 500 s in the dynamic time series is used as the training and verification data of the narx bpnn model the time interval of the sequence is 1 2s among the training data 80 was selected for training 333 and 20 for validation 83 the motion histories sway surge heave are used as the input neurons and the narx bpnn model expressed in section 2 2 is adopted to predict the tension time series for the mooring tension long time series prediction 9800 s in this study the motions of floating structures combined with the narx model are used as the input for the trained network model 10 neurons in the hidden layer are implemented using matlab a preliminary parametric study is performed to define the choice of 10 neurons as depicted in fig 15 and the final choice is consistent with the results presented in the literature de pina et al 2016 increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layers could not significantly improve the accuracy of the prediction results with increasing computation times the statistical parameters of the trained network are listed in table 4 and the results show an error emax of approximately 10 which appears to be further optimised it should be noted however that the tension performance assessment in this study focuses on the maximum values and statistical properties of the tension series the eten expressed using eq 18 indicates that the prediction error for the maximum response values are less than 5 and other parameters indicate that the predicted results are in good agreement with the fem results for statistical properties in this section the effect of the activation function on the prediction accuracy is also investigated a radial function was applied to replace the sigmoid function in the narx bpnn model with a modified time span the prediction results of this case are shown in fig 16 the statistic errors are also adopted to determine the preferred activation function the comparison results are listed in table 5 from the results it is observed that the narx bpnn model using the two types of activation functions can both provide ideal prediction results however the results obtained using the sigmoid activation function are better in this case because the statistical parameters are lower the resulting difference between both models is minimal to carefully verify the efficiency of the predicted mooring tension time series the mooring tension spectrum analysis was implemented using matlab based on the fast fourier transform and a hanning window is utilised to smooth the spectrum the tension spectrums obtained from the fem and narx bpnn models are illustrated in fig 17 it can be clearly observed that the frequency components demonstrate good consistency for various models here the most appropriate parameters of the modified bpnn models are determined and the accuracy of the prediction results is verified using statistical error measurements in the following part of the study the dynamic narx bpnn model is constructed using the delay span n x 20 n y 20 n z 20 10 neurons in hidden layers and a sigmoid function is adopted as the activation function a 3 h motion and tension response analysis of the floating structure should typically be performed to ensure the stability of the statistical properties after modelling the floating system using numerical software it takes approximately half an hour for one case calculation however it cost a few seconds about 7 5 s to predict the mooring tension response after the narx bpnn model was constructed moreover this model exhibits obvious advantages when the performance of the mooring lines is not easy to observe for long time periods in practical situations the pretension can be calculated using the librium module and it is none of business with the platform motion while the construction of the coupled floating system with various design combinations is too onerous accurate pretension prediction results can be obtained within seconds with the trained bpnn model thus the application of a neural network significantly improves the calculation efficiency 5 optimal selection of mooring system for different load conditions a deep water semi submersible mooring system is primarily used for position maintenance to ensure a successful drilling operation the offset of the platform should not exceed the prescribed circumference to guarantee the integrity of the structure and function of the mooring system the mooring lines should not be disconnected or broken and the minimum safety factor of the mooring line tension should not be less than the permitted value moreover the mooring system should not be exposed to other failure circumstances such as anchor and fatigue failure in this study the constraints for the selection of a mooring system are the platform offset and the full mooring line tension i e other failure situations are ignored it is considered that the average and maximum drift of the platform during operation should not exceed 4 and 8 of the water depth respectively the minimum safety factor of the mooring line should not be less than 1 67 according to the api rp 2sk 2005 for intact conditions it should be noted that the candidate design variables referred to in previous literature shafieefarand and rezvani 2007 xu et al 2018 are listed in table 3 the short dynamic response series for a given incident direction can only be used to train in a narx bpnn model for predicting mooring line tension under the same wave incident direction such as for an incident direction 30 the 500 s worth of data in the time series is utilised as the training and verification of the narx bpnn model and the long time tension series can be predicted using the constructed ann model under this 30 wave incident direction namely the precise predicting mooring line tensions in the optimisation can only be obtained under the condition that the incident direction of prediction are consistent with the trained model for axisymmetric semi submersible platform system a total of seven short time series from common incidence directions such as 0 22 5 30 45 60 67 5 and 90 are used in the training respectively then the seven constructed ann models are utilised to predict the dynamic tension response of the most loaded mooring line with various design variables under these seven incidence directions finally we can choose the most optimal design parameters based on the predicted results the disadvantage of this model is that no optimisation techniques such as genetic algorithm can be combined due to repeated training processes once considering arbitrary incident directions 5 1 dynamic response of semi submersible under various load conditions in each case analysis the 500 s responses are used as the training data set which is randomly divided into training and validation samples in the modelling process of the modified bpnn model the subsequent 9800 s datapoints are used for testing to predict the tension of the mooring lines and compare the results with numerical simulation the parameters n x 20 n y 20 n z 20 and n t 10 are chosen as the delay span and neural number respectively and their optimality is validated in table 4 seventy five cases including five main optimisation parameters are investigated to more intuitively demonstrate the prediction impact of the bpnn fem two visual schematics are displayed in following study including that for the tension prediction and actual dynamic response of the mooring line and the correlation coefficients between the predicted and actual tension data at the three stages of training validation and testing 5 2 azimuthal angles optimisation the dynamic response of the mooring system is discrepant for various azimuthal angles with fixed design parameters r 3500 m and l2 2400 m in this subsection the cases with identical remaining parameters are studied the maximum offset of the platform and maximum mooring lines tension for each direction are illustrated in figs 18 and 19 the long tension series prediction is performed using a trained neural network as presented in the previous section the most loaded mooring line tension obtained using the narx bpnn model and fem is shown in fig 20 the correlation coefficients between the predicted and actual tension data are displayed in fig 21 actually the accuracy of the neural network constructed for each design case is similar table 6 presents the statistical errors for the prediction results for just two cases due to paper space limitations with azimuthal angles θ 1 35 θ 2 38 θ 3 43 and θ 1 37 θ 2 40 θ 3 45 the influence of different angles on the response of mooring system is almost negligible the absolute relative differences of the maximum tension in the mooring line in all cases are within the range 0 5 there is a total of 25 cases in which the environmental loads acting on the semi submersible platform are set in different directions from the results it can be observed that the azimuthal angle has no effect on the maximum tension of the mooring lines however it does have a significant effect on the motion response of the platform which varies greatly under the various direction loads with other azimuthal angles to meet the requirements of the specification the second arrangement mode θ 1 37 θ 2 40 θ 3 45 is chosen in the subsequent calculation 5 3 length of middle segment optimisation based on the results of section 5 2 the influence of the length of the middle segment of the mooring lines on the dynamic response of the semi submersible platform is investigated using the appropriate azimuthal angle and a particular mooring radius θ 1 37 θ 2 40 θ 3 45 and r 3500 m the results show that the length of the middle segment has a significant influence on the maximum tension of the mooring line but has minimal effect on the motion response of the platform as observed in figs 22 and 23 in the third case the maximum tension of the mooring system is minimal therefore the length of the middle segment used in the following investigation to explore the effects of other parameters is l2 2400 m similar to the aforementioned the mooring line tension response and the correlation coefficients between the predicted and actual results are depicted in figs 24 and 25 respectively statistical errors in tension prediction are displayed just for one case l2 2350 m in table 7 indicating that the results obtained using a neural network are in agreement with those obtained using the fem and the results for l2 2400 m are coincident with θ 1 37 θ 2 40 θ 3 45 listed in table 7 because the mooring system has same design parameters in those two cases this result can be used as a reference to reduce the cost of the deep water mooring system 5 4 mooring radius optimisation in this part the dynamic response of a semi submersible platform with various mooring radii under different environmental loads is investigated θ 1 37 θ 2 40 θ 3 45 and l2 2400 m similarly the best previously determined values are used for the other mooring parameters figs 26 and 27 show that the larger the mooring radius of the semi submersible platform the greater the drift in addition the maximum tension of the mooring lines is not necessary the lowest due to the weight or other factors in this study the dynamic response of the semi submersible at r 3500 m meets the requirements of the specification figs 28 and 29 display the mooring line tension response obtained using various models and the correlation coefficients between the predicted and actual data respectively table 8 lists the statistical errors in tension prediction for r 3550 m and the results for optimal choice r 3500 m are coincident with θ 1 37 θ 2 40 θ 3 45 listed in table 6 6 conclusions in the present study a hybrid bpnn fem approach was developed and verified for a semi submersible mooring design model the primary features of this approach are as follows using the trained bpnn to predict pretension and a narx bpnn model for the tension dynamic response of the submersible mooring system with various design variables selecting the mooring system parameters with the maximum operation window period to evaluate the accuracy of the model the long time history response of the semi submersible platform was solved by the fem and the analysis of the statistical error for the response prediction was conducted a total of 2000 combinations of several variables of the mooring system were calculated and the static pretension prediction obtained using a bpnn model was in agreement with those obtained by the fem the maximum statistical error is less than 1 the narx bpnn model is used to predict the dynamic tension of the mooring lines in a total of 75 cases in which the maximum tension error is within 0 5 based on the results of this study key conclusions can be drawn 1 the bpnn and narx bpnn models demonstrate good applicability to static and dynamic response prediction potentially providing a significant improvement to the calculation efficiency of the marine structures analysis in the preliminary design stage 2 the number of hidden layer neurons and the optimal time span are identified by a trial and error approach the neural network model that generated the most accurate results is employed to predict the tension response the maximum values and statistical properties of the predicted tension series are in good agreement with those obtained using the fem 3 the sigmoid function used as the activation function exhibits better prediction performance than the radbas function in this case however both models can provide ideal results and the difference is minimal 4 for the mooring system design for the semi submersible platform the laws of the structural response are investigated under the influence of various design variables and the optimal design parameters can be determined based on the predicted results 5 a relatively accurate prediction of the time domain tension can be made using the trained neural network based on the platform s motion response in addition to the preliminary design of the platform mooring system this hybrid approach is also useful for other areas of research regarding floating marine structures such as fatigue analysis or response monitoring of mooring lines in practical situations the bpnn based models can provide a convenient method to define the optimal mooring system based on several candidate design variables however optimisation techniques need to be further investigated and adopted in this procedure to provide a comprehensive guide to

21039,local scour around a porous surface piercing square monopile in steady current fan yang lili qu guoqiang tang lin lu state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology dalian 116024 china state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology dalian 116024 china state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology dalian 116024 china corresponding author local scour around a porous monopile with the square cross section in steady current is investigated experimentally a variety of porosity p 0 38 8 is explored alongside with different attack angles ranging from α 0 60 in the live bed flow condition time history of the scour development equilibrium scour depth time scale and the scour hole profile have been systematically studied the increase of the streamwise porosity is found to largely weaken the horseshoe vortex in the upstream monopile and leads to a decrease of scour depth however the transverse porosity has limited contribution to the local scour around the monopile a secondary scour is revealed for the porous monopile with attack angles α 30 and 45 which is due to the sudden increase of the velocity amplifications at the corner of the monopile the effectiveness of stone layer protection as countermeasure against local scour around a porous monopile has also been studied the characteristics of the scour hole have been quantified it is showed that the stone layers can effectively eliminate the scour hole in particular the larger the diameter of the protection layers or the height to diameter ratio the greater the effectiveness of the countermeasure 1 introduction when a vertical pile is placed on the bed in the steady current the flow will undergo substantial changes i a horseshoe vortex is formed in front of the pile ii vortex shedding is formed in the lee side of the pile and iii the streamlines contract at the sides of the pile in addition there exists a downflow as a consequence of flow deceleration in front of the pile for a square pile the velocity amplification in the upstream corners is also a key mechanism as the structure is placed on an erodible seabed the overall effect of these changes will lead to the increase of the sediment transport resulting in local scour around the pile sumer and fredsoe 2002 due to its significant influence on the instability and failure of the coastal and offshore engineering local scour around a monopile in steady current has been investigated extensively breusers et al 1977 roulund et al 2005 whitehouse et al 2011 melville et al 2015 ahmad et al 2017 karimi et al 2017 numerous studies focus on the surface piercing pile about the development of the scour to the equilibrium scour depth and the time scale of this process melville and sutherland 1988 whitehouse 1998 sumer and fredsoe 2002 for instance melville and chiew 1999 found that the equilibrium time scale was a function of the flow intensify the flow depth and the sediment coarseness for the clear water scour in the study it was found that the scour started very rapidly and reached 50 80 of its equilibrium values at the first 10 of the equilibrium time scale dey and raikar 2007 applied the acoustic doppler velocity adv to analyze the evolution of the turbulent flow characteristics of the horseshoe vortex and observed strong turbulence within the developing scour hole in considering multiple parameters on the development of equilibrium scour depth around piles melville and sutherland 1988 introduced a design method for the estimation of the scour depth as shown in eq 1 breusers nicollet et al 1977 and richardson and davis 1995 applied similar equations with consideration of different factors 1 s 0 d k i k y k d k σ k s k α k h in which k i is a certain empirical formula or factor that have the influence of one specific parameter on the equilibrium scour depth s 0 in eq 1 k i is the factor of flow intensity k y is the factor of the flow depth k d is a formula for the influence of sediment size k σ is the factor of the sediment gradation k s is the factor of the shape of the cross section k α is the alignment factor k h is to quantify the influence of the height to diameter ratio in the conditions of clear water and live bed zhao cheng et al 2010 and yao et al 2018 investigated the equilibrium scour depth as a function of the pile height to diameter ratio it was concluded that for a larger height to diameter ratio the scour depth achieved was similar to that for an infinitely tall pile and for short piles the effects of height to diameter ratio was found to be dependent on the effect of flow intensity based on the above previous works on predicting the equilibrium scour depth the time development of scour for a surface piercing pile can be well calculated through empirical functions sumer and fredsoe 2002 introduced an exponential function eq 2 to describe the development of the scour depth 2 s t s 0 1 e x p t t where s is the scour depth s 0 is the equilibrium scour depth t is the time and t is defined as the time scale of scour whitehouse 1998 employed an exponent on the ratio t t within the exponential term in eq 2 3 s t s 0 1 e x p t t i briaud et al 1999 proposed a hyperbolic function 4 s t s 0 t t t 0 sumer and fredsoe 2002 found that the time scale of scour around a surface piercing pile follows 5 t d 2 g s 1 d 50 3 1 2 t 6 t δ 2000 d θ s 2 2 where d is the representative dimension of the vertical pile diameter for a circular pile or dimension perpendicular to flow for a rectangular pile δ is the boundary layer thickness and t is the non dimensional time scale of scour in the applications of coastal and offshore engineering subsea structures with complex configurations are always adopted as prototypes for many engineering structures such as the caisson valve stations of small height to width ratio structures and pile foundation structures with large height to width ratio the previous study on the local scour of subsea structures with complex configurations is mainly on the local scour and global scour around the structures very limited work has been conducted on the permeable feature for subsea structures with complex configurations through the experimental apparatus for a small height to width cubic caisson dhi snamprogetti 1992 and yang et al 2020 explored the development of scour in the influence of the porosity p which is defined by 7 p a p a c r o s s in which a p is the total area of permeable parts in the longitudinal vertical section surface and a c r o s s is the area of the longitudinal vertical section of the cubic caisson porosity p was denoted as the ability that the water passes through the subsea structures yang et al 2020 reported that the scour initiated at two upstream corners rather than the middle section of the front boundary which indicated that the horseshoe vortex in front of the pile is not the governing factor on the local scour around the structures but the velocity amplification at two upstream corners the incoming flow rate is divergent into two different paths which are inside and outside of the porous caisson and this physical mechanism induces the observations that the increase of the porosity leads to a decrease of the scour depth a correcting parameter k p was introduced to illustrate the influence of porosity on the equilibrium scour depth and time scale for the local scour around the porous caisson as follows 8 k p s 0 s 0 β 1 p 2 d 0 75 in which s 0 is the equilibrium scour depth for an infinitely tall sold pile and β is an empirical coefficient for the cubic square caisson in the live bed condition yang et al 2020 proposed this empirical coefficient can be taken as 0 806 0 835 however this value was based on specific conditions without considering the surface piercing pile the effect of streamwise porosity two dimensional porosity p 2d transverse porosity three dimensional porosity p 3d and attack angle α has been well investigated and their influence on the equilibrium scour depth matches well with the exponential fitting function eq 8 yang tang et al 2020 also reported the time scale of the scour process for the cubic structures it was concluded that the time scale results were a function of the porosity but no obvious correlation was observed further in line with the framework above it is apparent that further investigations should be employed to systematically explore the development of local scour for a surface piecing pile with the large height to width ratio which is usually regarded as the prototype of the certain pile foundation system for instance it is clear that for a surface piercing pile the horseshoe vortex results in the sediment transport in front of the pile however it is not clear how the existence of the porosity affects the horseshoe vortex on the other hand as the local scour is the main cause to the failure of the subsea structures scour protection installed at the base of a monopile also attracts substantial interests in decades chiew 1995 chiew and lim 2000 lauchlan and melville 2001 de vos de rouck et al 2011 2012 nielsen et al 2011 nielsen et al 2013 sumer and nielsen 2013 breusers and raudkivi 1991 and melville and coleman 2000 gave detailed accounts of protection measures on the bridge piers either in the form of a stone protection layer in the form of a protective mattress melville and coleman 2000 recommended that the ideal level for the placement of the stone layer was at the level of the expected lowest bed form in the vicinity of the bridge piers sumer and fredsoe 2002 proposed that it was a key issue to determine the extent of the stone protection layer as well as the thickness of the protection layer however scour protection itself would cause erosion the local scour at the layer edge might lead to the deformations of the stone layer and failure of the scour protections of the monopile foundations whitehouse harris et al 2011 referred to it as the edge scour induced by the secondary flow that transferred sediment away from the junction between the seabed and stone layers raaijmakers rudolph et al 2007 franco et al 2009 and raaijmakers et al 2010 reported the edge scour along the perimeter of the stone protection layer was up to 2 5 m summarizing the studies above further systematical investigations on the scour protections for a porous surface piercing monopile are warranted the influence of the extent of the stone protection layer and the thickness of the protection layer together with the sizes of stones are essential to be quantified through flow measurements via the particle image velocimetry piv nielsen et al 2011 and petersen et al 2015 reported two major mechanisms of the edge scour around a stone protection cover 1 the horseshoe vortex in front of the structures and the flow acceleration at the transverse sides due to the presence of the stone cover 2 a pair of symmetrical counter pairing vortices generated in the downstream of the monopile and scour protections which suspends the sediment in the wake area the horseshoe vortex and flow accelerations in the near field carries the sediment away from the pile which induces the turbulence around the individual stones and the enhanced local shear stress in the experiment it can be observed that the sediment beneath the stone is removed in some cases the stones at the edge of the protection layer are observed to sink into the scour hole due to the failure stability of the sand beneath them on the other hand a portion of the sand is also observed to be brought into the stone layer by the streamwise flow the paring counter rotating streamwise vortices in the wake erode considerable sediment away from the pile with scour protection layer and drive the suspended sediment towards the centerline to form a pileup in the wake motivated by quantifying 1 the influence of porosity on the surface piercing pile and 2 the effectiveness of scour protection by stone layers the present work reports a systematical experimental study of the scour around surface piercing piles the key study is to quantify the influence of streamwise porosity transverse porosity and attack angles on the equilibrium scour depth and time scale of the scour process and the effectiveness of protection layers dimensions and stone sizes the remainder of the present work is organized as follows section 2 describes the test facility experimental setup and the scour measurements section 3 and section 4 then present the main results and discussions for the influence of porosity and scour protections respectively conclusions are given in section 5 2 test facility model setup the experimental tests in the present work were conducted in the o tube facility at state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology in china working as an impeller driven fully enclosed circulating water channel the o tube facility has a working section of 20m 1 5m 1 6 m length width depth a 0 4 m deep sand bed was made in the test section of 6 0 m in length and extended to cover the whole test section fig 1 presents the schematic drawing of the experimental setup as shown in fig 1 the streamwise direction is defined as y direction which is along the flow direction z direction is referred as the vertical direction and the x direction is defined by the spanwise direction the o tube facility can generate various flow and combined flow conditions including steady current oscillatory flow as well as steady oscillatory combined flow conditions in the present experiments only the steady current condition was carried out the water depth was kept 1 0 m for all cases square model piles are made of acrylic material in the present experiment surface piercing monopile has a square cross section with an edge width of d 20 mm and height of l 1600 mm which results in a blockage ratio of less than 1 6 in the horizontal direction the blockage effect is believed to be minor the model piles have a 0 4m 0 4 m base plate installed deep within the sand bed to ensure the stability during the test the feature of porosity was achieved through the porous holes set in the surface of the piles 2d porosity p 2d is defined as the porous holes set in surface ad and bc in streamwise direction of the pile as shown in fig 2 a and with porous holes in surface ab and cd in the transverse direction of the pile 3d porosity p 3d was achieved as presented in fig 2 b a variety of porosity were considered ranging from p 0 to p 38 8 table 2 shows the experiments performed in the present work the porous surface piercing square monopile was orientated ranging from α 15 to α 60 relative to the incoming flow direction a non cohesive uniform silica sand was used in the present experiments as shown in table 1 the median particle size is d 50 0 378 mm and has the geometric standard deviation d 84 d 50 1 18 the specific gravity s is 2 67 the critical shields parameter θ cr is calculated by the improved empirical formulae proposed by soulsby 1997 which was widely applied by many previous literature 9 θ c r 0 30 1 1 2 d 0 055 1 e x p 0 020 d where the non dimensional particle size d is defined as 10 d g s 1 υ 2 1 3 d 50 the shields parameter due to total friction was obtained according to the measured velocity profile and the shields parameter θ s due to skin friction is defined as 11 θ s τ s ρ g s 1 d 50 u f s 2 g s 1 d 50 where τ s is the shear stress due to the skin friction experienced by the sea ben from the flow ρ is the water density g is the acceleration due to the gravity s is the specific gravity of sand d 50 is the median particle size of sand υ is the kinematical viscosity of water and u f s is the friction velocity associated with skin friction defined by 12 u f s τ s ρ 1 2 in which the shear stress due to skin friction τ s can be calculated by the empirical formula for flat and surface by soulsby 1997 13 τ s ρ c d u 2 where the logarithmic relationship for c d is 14 c d κ ln z 0 s h 1 2 in which κ is the karman constant equaling 0 4 u is the depth averaged flow velocity z 0 s is the roughness height due to the skin friction and h is the water depth the skin friction shields parameter is used to judge whether a test is under live bed or clear water conditions live bed condition prevails as θ s θ cr 1 with signs of sediment motion as for clear water condition θ s θ cr 1 the steady current was generated at u 0 36 m s corresponding to θ s θ cr 1 138 in live bed conditions the scour protection with multiple stone layers was placed circularly around the pile on the top of the sand bed the stone layer was made of crushed angular stones with sizes of d s 2 cm and 5 cm each of the stone layers applied in the experiments had a geometrical standard deviation of σ g 1 5 the layer of stones is ranging from n 0 1 and 2 corresponding to the height of the stone layer h s 0 10 cm the case with h s 0 is exactly the test b4 with p 3d 26 33 as discussed in sec 4 1 the layer height to pile diameter is in the range of h s d 0 0 5 which is the normal range for the engineering application petersen et al 2015 the diameter of the stone protection layer is ranging in d p 36 72 cm enabling the layer diameter to pile diameter in the range of d p d 3 6 the zero slopes of the scour protection layer α 0 was applied for all cases total 12 cases were launched to explore the above three parameters on the scour protections for a porous square pile and the detailed is summarized in table 4 photos of the experimental setup of case p2 p5 p8 and p11 are shown in fig 29 as examples it should be noted that the duration of testing time is more than t 8 h for all cases developing to the equilibrium state the features of local scour discussed in the following are based on the data at the equilibrium state 3 measurements of scour and flow velocity the velocity profile across the water depth was measured using a nortek vectrino acoustic doppler velocimetry adv with sampling frequency of 20 hz and sampling time of 180s for each sampling point velocity profiles in the vertical direction were measured at the location where the model pipe was set the velocities were measured after generating flow for 10min fig 3 shows the distribution of mean velocity over the water depth the boundary layer thickness is around 0 35 m through the velocity profile the velocity profiles at two locations along the x direction as shown in fig 3 b were tested for quantifying the distributions of x direction no obvious difference is observed which indicates that the good uniformity of the velocity is achieved in the transverse direction a fitted curve according to the measured velocities below z 0 8 m was also plotted in fig 3 a the fitted curve follows the logarithmic law as follows 15 u z u f t κ ln z z 0 t where u f t is the friction velocity associated with the total shear stress z 0 t is the total roughness the total shear stress is the shear stress due to the combined effect of skin friction and friction due to bedforms such as bed ripples soulsby 1997 according to the fitted curve the velocity generated by the steady current is u 0 39 m s in each experiment performed adv was set in the upstream 1 5 m away from the location of the square pile and 50 mm above the sand bed to measure the freestream velocity as shown in fig 1 to measure the hydrodynamic features during the scour around the model pile two ultrasound doppler velocimetry udv probes were adopted as shown in fig 4 probes can measure variations of velocity within 500 mm range with a sampling rate of 20 hz and can record variations of depth with a sampling rate of 20hz udv can transmit and receive the reflected ultrasonic waves and usually the position with the strongest reflected signal is exactly on the sand surface therefore the development of the scour depth can be inferred from the change of the sand surface the udv applied in the current measurements of velocity can measure a velocity profile within 25 mm range with a cell size of 1 mm the measuring range of udv is at 50 80 mm away from the probe as a key parameter indicating the quality of the data the snr correlation of the signal is always monitoring during the test it was found that the 35 points in the middle range normally have correlation values higher than 95 and the correlation values drop with the increase of the distance to the probe for the other 10 points in the analysis the samples with correlation lower than 95 were removed probe 1 was attached in the front corner of the model pile to record the development of scour depth since the scour was expected to be the most significant at this point of the structure yao et al 2018 and probe 2 was applied at the middle of the front surface to measure the z velocity of the downflow the inference tests were launched that two udv sensors have no interruption with each other a three dimensional scour profile laser scanner was applied during the experiment to monitor the scour and gradations the three dimensional scour profiles were achieved using an infrared scanner which can cover a range of 2 m 2 m with resolution of 1 mm the similar setup has been used by yao et al 2018 and zhao et al 2012 the general procedure for experiments performed was as follows i install the model pile steadily in the test section of the o tube ii level the sand bed iii fill water into the o tube and slow down the filling speed to avoid any disturbances to the sand surface iv after starting to record data through adv udv and video run the pump of o tube until the equilibrium stage of local scour is reached vi ramp down the pump and drain the water out of the o tube vii scan the final scour profile with a 3d laser scanner supplementary to these experiments were performed to measure the development of sand bed profiles at different instants at certain instants for 10min 30min 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h and 8 h the flow was stopped and the water was drained off to ensure the accuracy the bed profiles were measured through 3d scanner after the measurement of the bed profiles the o tube was refilled with a slow speed of the water filling pump to avoid disturbances to the terrain around the model piles and continued to run till the next time instant this method are widely employed in the scouring experiments which can be efficient considering the data acquisition zhao et al 2012 yao et al 2018 the following supplementary also has the strong support this method fig 5 shows the comparison between the continuous record and the record at certain instants it should be noted that the record point is at the most upstream edge of the square cylinder which experiences the largest scour hole due to the previous literature it can be seen from fig 5 that the data of two methods have a good agreement with each other which indicates the above method can be applied in the present experiment 4 results 4 1 streamwise transverse porosity the influence of streamwise porosity two dimensional porosity p 2d has been explored in this section tests a1 a6 have p 2d ranging from 0 to 38 8 as shown in table 2 to provide an example of the development of scour fig 6 presents contours of bed profiles for test a5 with p 2d 26 33 at four different instants at t 10min in fig 6 a the scour initials from the two upstream corners and the middle section of the front boundary but it is hard to distinguish which is first it is believed that both the horseshoe vortex in the upstream and velocity amplifications at the upstream corners contribute to the sand erosion at the junction of the pile based on the study of yao et al 2018 the sand is washed out from the pile and forms a pile up in the wake with the development of the scour the scour hole around the pile is deepened and widened the pile up in the wake is further pushed towards downstream to describe the scour profile observed in the experiments fig 5 d presents the scour profiles at four different moments fig 7 shows the contours of the bed profiles at t 8 h for test a1 with p 2d 0 test a3 with p 2d 9 and test a5 with p 2d 38 8 as the comparison it is can be seen that with an increase of p 2d from 0 to 38 5 a decreasing trend is observed for both the range of scour holes and the distance of pile ups in the wake the coverage of scour hole for test a3 is around 350mm 350 mm and for a distance of pile up in the wake test a3 achieves at around 1100 mm which is 10 reduction of the results of test a1 the counterparts of test a5 have even smaller values of the coverage of scour holes and locations of pile up achieving around 260mm 260 mm and 700 m respectively to illustrate the influence of p 2d on the scour hole of porous square piles the summary of the coverage of scour hole and locations of pile up is presented in fig 8 together with trend lines it should be noted that the transverse dimension of the scour hole is employed in the analysis though it is slightly smaller than the streamwise dimension the coverage of scour hole and locations of pile up are all normalized by the effective diameter of the pile with the increase of the p 2d r d and l d decrease monotonically the coverage of scour hole decreases from r d 3 1 of p 2d 0 to around r d 2 2 of p 2d 38 8 locations of pile up decreases from l d 9 8 of p 2d 0 to around l d 6 5 of p 2d 38 8 the reductions of r d and l d is up to 30 with the influence of p 2d it should be noted that due to the existence of the flow in the spanwise direction x direction the three dimensional effect on the local scour around the cylinder will be presented in the scour profile plots the three dimensionality of the flow in the scouring experiments has been reported by many researchers zhao et al 2010 whitehouse et al 2011 the deviations of the asymmetrical distributions along positive and negative x direction were measured smaller than 5 which indicates that the three dimensional effect can be negligible and the measurement of scour is reasonable fig 9 presents the equilibrium scour profiles aligned with cross section a a and b b for test a1 a6 it can be seen that the distributions are reasonably symmetrical at the left and right sides as shown in fig 9 the deepest point is at the edge of the pile and the increase of porosity does have influence on the reduction of the scour depth as shown in fig 9 a the slope of the scour hole also decreases with the increase of the porosity coming with the decrease of the transverse dimension of scour hole in fig 9 b for cross section b b the deepest scour point is observed at the front boundary of the square pile which indicates the influence of horseshoe vortex for the back boundary the scour hole is also observed at test a1 a4 however with a further increase of porosity the scour hole at the back boundary is gradually diminished for test a5 it is hard to distinguish the scour hole in the back and for test a6 it is interesting to see that the sediment washed out from the upstream corners accumulates in the back junction and the locations of pile up in the wake is closer to the pile with the increase of porosity which is also validated by fig 8 b the accumulations at the back boundary for test a5 and test a6 are believed to be a part of the pile ups in the wake and it is noted that the height of the pile up in the wake seems to be independent of the porosity even the locations vary based on the distributions of scour profiles in figs 9 and 10 shows the slope angles of the scour hole profiles with cross section a a and b b respectively for cross section a a the slope angles on the left and right sides of the pile are defined as α l and α r respectively the slope angles on the upstream and downstream sides of the pile in the cross section b b are denoted as α u and α d the slopes at the left and right sides has an reasonable symmetrical feature also shown in fig 9 whilst the downstream slopes are always smaller than the upstream slopes for cross section a a in fig 10 a α l and α r have minor differences and are observed to be independent of porosity α l and α r have the range of 25 35 which is close to the internal friction angle γ 32 4 for the cohesive sand used in the experiments the similar observations are also presented for α u in cross section b b in fig 10 b this indicates that the existence of horseshoe vortex in the upstream always leads to a strong local scour however α d experiences an obvious reduction with the increase of the porosity which is corresponding to the weakening scour in the back boundary as discussed in fig 9 it is believed that the contraction of the streamline induced by the horseshoe vortex is weakened and the influence of velocity amplification is also reduced due to the presence of flow diverting through the porous holes on the other hand the sediment deposition on the lee side of the cylinder is formed due to the erosion from the upstream with the increase of the porosity the location of the sediment deposition is nearer the cylinder with a smaller height as shown in fig 9 b the time history of local scour for test a1 a6 is presented in fig 11 the measurements of scour depth were taken at the upstream side verge of the square pile through udv1 as indicated in fig 4 it can be seen that the scour depth increases rapidly at the first 10min and at first t 0 5 h the developments of the local scour for test a1 a6 are quite alike to each other and no major difference can be distinguished the differences among curves of test a1 a6 can be clearly seen as t 0 5 h comparing across the cases it is apparent that results of tests with p 2d 10 show minor differences and as p 2d 10 the scour depth decreases drastically as p 2d increases the reduction of the scour depth s in the equilibrium stage is up to 67 from s d 2 2 for p 2d 0 to s d 1 32 for p 2d 38 8 as p 2d increases from 0 to 38 8 the needed time at which the equilibrium state reaches is larger and this indicates that the as p 2d increases the scour rate decreases it should be noted that each time history shown in fig 11 for tests a1 a6 were run until the equilibrium state was observed or the scour depth was close to the equilibrium stage for the local scour fig 12 presents an example fitted to the experimental data using eq 2 by sumer and fredsoe 2002 eq 3 by whitehouse 1998 and eq 4 by briaud et al 1999 for the time history of the local scour for test a5 with p 2d 26 3 it can be seen from fig 12 that the exponential equation eq 3 with modified form by whitehouse et al 1998 matches well with the dotted data and is better than the exponential equation of eq 2 and hyperbolic function of eq 4 table 3 shows the square of correlation coefficient r 2of the fitted curves from eqs 2 4 the r 2 of the exponential equation eq 3 with modified form are generally larger than those achieved by eqs 2 and 4 on the other hand the equilibrium scour depths fitted from the exponential equations eq 3 with modified form are more conservative than the exponential equations eq 2 and hyperbolic equations eq 4 therefore exponential equation eq 3 is applied to the predictions of the equilibrium scour depth and time scale in the present work it should be noted that in the present experiments the tests are stopped before the equilibrium the stage the fitted equilibrium scour depth is an approximation rather than a direct observation which is regarded as the reliable results of the experimental closing to the equilibrium the development of the scour is self similar and well approximated by the fitted mathematical expressions which can be taken as the true value of the experiments as presented in fig 12 fig 13 presents the non dimensional time scale for the porous square pile and the trend lines have been draw approximating the data in yang et al 2020 s investigations the time scale t has no obvious correlation with the porosity for a porous cubic caisson however the time scale t in the present work increases with the increases of porosity as shown in fig 13 the sediment transport rate is also observed to be smaller see fig 11 it is suspected that the weakening of the horseshoe vortex will lead to a smaller sediment transport rate and a larger time scale both melville and chiew 1999 and yao et al 2018 present an increasing time scale t as the influence of the horseshoe vortex is weakened which can be reasonable supports for the observation to interpret the development of scour around a pile yao et al 2018 demonstrated that the time scale t is proportional to the equilibrium scour depth which indicates a deeper scour holes require longer to process and inversely proportional to the local transport rate which means as the local transport rate increases scour happens more quickly as shown in eq 16 16 g s 1 d 50 3 1 2 d 2 t 0 t s 0 2 d 2 1 φ l in which φ l is the dimensionless local transport rate it can be seen that in eq 17 17 t 2 t 2 s 0 d 2 1 φ l removing the influence of the equilibrium scour depth in the time scale the non dimensional time scale t 2 increases monotonically with porosity which corresponds to the decreasing local transport rate with increasing of the porosity as p 2d increases from p 2d 9 38 3 t 2 increases more than five times the value which is corresponding to less than 1 5 of the local transport rate see fig 14 experiments of test b1 b4 were run to explore the influence of transverse porosity three dimensional porosity p 3d in the present work two groups were presented in table 2 group i the porosity on the front and back boundaries streamwise direction keep at p 2d 9 whilst the transverse porosity p 3d at two side boundaries varies from 9 to 26 3 group ii the porosity on the front and back boundaries keep at p 2d 26 3 whilst the transverse porosity p 3d varies from 9 to 26 3 test a3 with p 2d 9 and test a5 with p 2d 26 3 are taken as the references fig 15 presents the time history of local scour measured at the upstream corners for group i and ii respectively it is very interesting to see that the curves of group i and group ii collapse together and have an exact similar development of scour this indicates that the existence of p 3d will not mainly contribute to the local scour around the pile the contours of bed profiles for test b1 and b2 with t 10 h are presented in fig 16 observations of scour holes around the pile and pile ups in the wake are very similar to the results of test a3 as shown in fig 7 as for the cubic porous square caisson with a low height to width ratio in yang et al 2020 the existence of the transverse porosity p 3d results in a reduction of 10 on the equilibrium scour depth the mechanism is ascribed to the transverse flow rate would weaken the velocity amplification at two upstream corners of the square caisson in test b1 b4 for a surface piercing porous square pile the main factor that governs the local scour around the structures is the horseshoe vortex induced by the adverse pressure gradient in the upstream it is speculated that the existence of the transverse porosity p 3d doesn t affect the horseshoe vortex and further have no obvious weakening influence on the development of local scour around the square pile fig 17 shows the equilibrium scour depth with variations of porosity for test a1 a6 and b1 b4 together with the data of dhi snamprogetti 1992 and yang et al 2020 on a porous square caisson as the porosity achieves p 1 the equilibrium scour depth equals zero this implies that if no structure in the test section no local scour is observed which is similar to the results of dhi snamprogetti 1992 and yang et al 2020 it can be seen from fig 17 that the equilibrium scour depth s 0 decreases sharply with the increase of porosity similar to yang et al 2020 s results for p 10 the equilibrium scour depth s 0 shares very minor differences at p 0 s 0 achieves at 2 2d whilst s 0 is at 1 3d for p 38 8 the reduction is up to 67 which is similar to the reductions rate in the results of dhi snamprogetti 1992 67 and yang et al 2020 63 for a small height to width structure the influence of the horseshoe vortex can be omitted and the velocity amplifications play the key role leading to the maximum scour depth occurring at the two upstream corners based on the mechanism yang et al 2020 explained the influence of porosity was due to the flow was divergent to two paths through the structures outside the structure and inside the structure and an exponential equation eq 8 was introduced to fit the data as shown in fig 17 the empirical coefficient β is β 1 0 8357 for yang et al 2020 s data and β 2 1 5711 for dhi snamprogetti 1992 s results for a surface piercing porous square pile three flow mechanisms are expected to contribute to the local scour i the horseshoe vortex induced by the adverse pressure gradient in front of the pile ii the velocity amplification at two upstream corners due to the square cross section iii vortex shedding in the wake sumer and fredsoe 2002 it is believed that the weakening of the local scour due to the influence of the porosity depends on the weakening of both horseshoe vortex and velocity amplifications this is validated by the data of test a1 a6 and b1 b4 in the current work collectively match with the exponential equation eq 8 as shown in fig 17 and the empirical coefficient β 3 is 2 1551 as follows 18 s 0 d β 3 1 p 0 75 in which the square of correlation coefficient r 2 is at r 2 0 9989 it should be noted that β 3 β 1 2 58 when comparing with results of yang et al 2020 the reason can be ascribed to the influence of the height to width ratio as the experimental setup and flow intensity are very similar the discrepancies are believed to be ascribed to the influence of the height to width ratio as discussed in yao et al 2018 s study as the flow intensity is at around θ s θ cr 1 28 the equilibrium scour depth s 0 for an infinitely tall pile is about two times of its counterpart for a low height to ratio structure on the other hand it may be also due to the fact that the water depth in yang et al 2020 is around 1 77 2 5 times of the caisson s diameter whilst the present work is around 8 5 times melville and sutherland 1988 reported that the scour depth would be influenced if the water is shallow though no systematic analysis has been launched as a pile is placed on the seabed with the incoming flow the pressure gradient is produced in its vicinity and leads to separations of boundary layers on the wall upstream of the pile the separated boundary layer rolls up towards the downstream forming the horseshoe vortex the main vortex rotating in the junction further results in a strong velocity gradient in the upstream of the pile and induces a downflow in the upstream of the pile baker 1979 1980 according to fig 17 the weakening of horseshoe vortex is speculated to be due to the effect of porosity the quantitative analysis is given as follows the acceleration of the flow velocity is induced by the constriction of the pile and the momentum transfer at the junction where the pile surface and the water channel boundary join the momentum transfer with the pile surface contributes to the development of the vertical velocity profile hajivalie et al 2012 in the junction of the pile the strong turbulence and the vertical velocities lead to the horseshoe vortex which is the main cause of the local scour around the pile as shown in fig 4 udv2 is attached at the front surface of the porous square pile for measuring the z velocity w along the longitude direction of the pile it should be noted that the velocity discussed in the following part is based on the time averaged values which is originated from the time history of velocity examples of fig 23 from udv udv2 is enabled to record the velocity in the z direction within the range of z d 2 5 to 0 5 it is noted that the installation of udv2 is 5 cm away from the pile surface and 0 5 m away from the sand bed to capture the velocity variations fig 18 shows the distributions of normalized averaged velocity along the z direction for test a1 a6 the z velocity w is normalized by the values of w 0 at the position of h d 2 which is free from the influence of the horseshoe vortex in the junction it can be seen from fig 18 that as the probe s recording is touching the scour hole velocity w increases dramatically at h d 0 5 1 5 the maximum values of w velocity occurs within the scour hole in which the horseshoe vortex rotates and stretches around the velocity gradient is introduced simply defined by the difference of the maximum and minimum velocity on their height difference δ w δ h fig 19 shows the velocity gradient δ w δ h with variations of porosity it is apparent that the velocity gradient δ w δ h decrease with the increase of porosity the decrease of the velocity gradient δ w δ h is up to 80 as δ w δ h 0 82 for p 2d 0 to δ w δ h 0 35 for p 2d 38 8 the dominant influence factor of sediment transport is the momentum transfer due to the fluid sediment interactions barbe cruise et al 1992 summarized that the momentum transfer in the vertical direction experiences two paths which are 1 vertical mixing with fluid and 2 vertical motion of grains keeping interaction with surrounding fluid the vertical momentum transfers in the upper recirculating cells moves the bed sediment into the upper layer and the movement of sediment particles is not significantly active in the lower layer as a signal of weakening momentum transfer the reduction of δ w δ h is believed to be corresponding to the weakened down flow in the upstream and further validates the conclusion that the horseshoe vortex is weakened due to the influence of the porosity an offshore engineering structure always has a complex configuration such as a piled structure comprises of horizontal vertical and inclined members when the structure is exposed to the flow the local scour around the structure should take the particular configuration into account fog and jønsson 1997 reported the minimization of scour development should be considered in the open design of the valve station with the porosity feature dahlberg 1983 reviews the scour observations in the north sea around pile supported offshore oil platform the scour depth could be as much as 3 m whereas the design criteria were exceed by up to 1 5 m 4 2 attack angle effect the influence of the attack angles has been explored based on the porous square pile with streamwise p 2d and transverse porosity p 3d two groups are employed i test c1 c4 p 2d and p 3d all equal 9 03 and the attack angle varies from α 0 60 ii test c5 c8 p 2d and p 3d all equal 26 33 with the attack angle varying from α 0 60 fig 20 shows the contour of bed profiles for test c1 c4 with p 2d p 3d 9 03 as shown in fig 20 the existence of an attack angle leads to asymmetrical scour profiles around the pile and the maximum scour depth is observed to be at the most upstream side corners of the pile the largest range of the scour hole is observed at α 45 as shown in fig 20 c and with increase of the attack angle α the dimensions of pile up in the wake decreases the pile up with α 60 has the smallest height the results of group ii with p 38 75 share very similar observations fig 21 a and b present the time history of the local scour measured at the upstream edge of the porous square pile for group i and ii two phases are observed as denoted in fig 21 for group i it is observed that the scour develops very fast as it initials and gradually slows down increases of porosity will lead to a decrease of the scour depth the development of the scour for test b1 with α 0 is always the largest whilst test c4 with α 60 is the smallest however at t 3 h of test c2 with α 30 and t 7 h of test c3 with α 45 show interesting phenomena that a secondary scour is observed after the scour reaches a plateau similar observations also occur at group ii in fig 21 b for example the development of scour for test c7 propagates quickly and reaches a plateau at t 1 8 h 2 5 h and with the test running a new developing scour is observed at t 6 h and the slope of the curve increases the secondary scour continues propagating till the equilibrium state is achieved t 10 h the secondary scour is developed based on the scour hole of the first time scour considering the effect of alignment by laursen 1960 and ettema et al 1998 k α 45 k α 0 is around 1 2 whilst due to the second scour the equilibrium scour depth experiences a sharp increase and also has the similar values of test b4 with α 0 although it is far smaller than the counterpart of test c5 in phase i featured by the variations of slopes of phase ii test c2 and c6 with α 30 and test c3 and c7 with α 45 are observed with the secondary time scour to quantify the mechanism of the secondary time scour at α 30 and 45 at the side corners of the porous pile supplementary tests were conducted to measure contours of bed level at different instants for test c6 with α 30 two advs were employed to measured u velocity at the side corner a and c at certain instants as shown in the sketch of fig 25 adv1 is located the most upstream edge of the cylinder whilst adv2 is located at the second most upstream edge two adv are located outside the boundary layer of the seabed level as well as the square pile surface to avoid any disturbance on the data acquisition as illustrated by sumer and fredsøe 2002 yoon et al 2010 the existence of the sharp edge would lead velocity accerlation in the vicinity which results in the strong shear stress at the corner and further strong erosion of the sediment as discussed by sumer and fredsøe 2002 dey and raikar 2007 observed a very high fluctuation of velocity in the scour hole during the erosion it was proposed that the flow structures induced strong turbulence in the scour hole in the present work the measurement of velocity and fluctuation are summarized in figs 22 25 as presented in fig 22 the scour around the pile kept almost unchanged at 30min and 1 h and experienced a sharp increase at t 2 h and 4 h the pile up in the wake is observed to be moved towards far downstream with a larger size both scour holes at the side corner a and c are deepened with the extensive erosion in the middle section of the front boundary ac the corresponding u velocity for the side corner a and c by adv1 and adv2 respectively is presented in fig 25 it should be noted that the corner c is the recording point for α 60 u velocity for the side corner a and c is normalized by the freestream velocity u 0 it can be seen from fig 25 that u for the side corner a and c are quite close at the first t 2 h with u a being slightly larger at t 2 h the discrepancy between a and c is dramatic and this leads to strong erosion at the corner a u a experiences an increase at t 3 h as shown in fig 25 a whilst the u c is still kept at the low value the fluctuated velocity u has very similar observations in fig 25 b u is defined by the root mean square value of the velocity can be defined u 1 n i 1 n u i u 2 strong turbulence is observed at the corner a after the secondary scour is observed at t 2 h by adv1 the weak corner c by adv2 is however less fluctuated the above discussion can also be supported by the measurements of w w 0 at certain instants by udv2 as shown in fig 24 it can be seen that at t 2 h w w 0 is less fluctuated and share the minor variations with the scour continuing this indicates that phase i is gradually achieved with the propagation of the scour w w 0 experiences an extraordinary increase at t 2 h which indicates that the horseshoe vortex becomes stronger at phase ii scour based on the discussion of sec 4 1 the cases with α 30 and 45 is expected to have the weaker local scour and smaller scour depth rather than an increase of the scour depth due to the secondary scour with reference to the surface piercing piles two inferences can now be made to understand the secondary scour phenomenon as shown in fig 21 firstly the increase of p 2d and p 3d will lead to a weakening of the local scour around the pile as shown in fig 15 the maximum reduction of the scour can be up to 70 as the horseshoe vortex in the front of the pile plays a key role in the development of the local scour around the surface piercing pile the increase of porosity results in a smaller adverse pressure gradient which would lead smaller bed area subjected to the flow concentration caused by the horseshoe vortex contractions of the streamlines and velocity amplifications therefore it leads to a smaller scour depth around the pile with an increase of the attack angle this mechanism is recorded through observations of phase i in fig 21 secondly as the scour hole in the upstream is further developed the sediment in the junction is being eroded and washed out to the downstream and leaves a deeper scour hole in front the pile as the buried part of the square pile model is solid p 0 the influence of horseshoe vortex governs the development of local scour again and this results in a secondary scour for both α 30 and 45 this is can be validated by the drastic increase of velocity u and fluctuation component u at the corner a and strengthened downflow as illustrated by w w 0 it is understandable that due to the velocity amplifications for the square pile the local shear stress is larger at the corner which is more closing to the upstream larger local flow rate which leads to strong sediment transport and the local scour at the weak corner would be weakened due to the decrease of local flow rate resulting in a reduction of scour depth it is validated by the cases with α 30 and 60 in which the corner of α 30 is the stronger side and the counterpart of α 60 is the weaker one and this explains why the case with α 60 always has the smallest scour depth fig 26 shows the non dimensional time scale t of scour with the different attack angles based on eq 3 by whitehouse 1998 it can be seen that the time scale of scour increases with the increase of the attack angle as discussed above the sediment transport rate for a large attack angle α 30 is smaller than the cases with a smaller attack angle and this observation is exaggerated for cases with p 26 33 the high values of t for α 30 and 45 correspond to the secondary scour described in fig 21 which leads to a longer time to reach the equilibrium state fig 27 shows the variations of non dimensional time scale t2 with the attack angle a as illustrated in eq 14 t 2 is corresponding to the local transport rate of the scour it can be seen that t 2 is almost independent of the influence of porosity at α 15 and with increasing of α t 2 increases dramatically at p 9 03 whilst t 2 for p 26 33 shows relatively slight increase 4 3 scour protection scour protections are typically placed around the monopile foundations to avoid the scour erosions the stone protection layer is one of the major scour protections for cylindrical structures as discussed in the literature however the stone protection layer itself would cause local scour influenced by the increase of the local velocity the local bed shear stress in turn increases in this section multiple layer stone protection is introduced and its effect is quantified on the porous square piles the sketch is shown in fig 28 the model pile was embedded vertically in the sediment bed extending to the base of the flume and was kept fixed similar with the experimental setup of the porous monopiles the water depth was kept at 1 0 m and the live bed condition was achieved with θ s θ cr 1 28 it should be noted that the applied model pile is the one for p 3d 26 33 test b4 and the results of test b4 without scour protections are set as the reference fig 30 shows the contours of bed level profiles for case p1 p3 to explore the influence of the diameter of the stone protection d p under the same size of stone d s 2 cm and same layer n 1 three local scour areas can be identified 1 edge scour alongside the perimeter of the scour protection layer from the upstream side to the transverse side 2 a two legged scour hole forms in the downstream originating from the transverse sides 3 a ridge forms between the two legs of the scour hole extending towards the downstream it can be seen from fig 30 that increase of d p can reduce the local scour around the porous square pile very efficiently the pile up in the wake reduces from s 8 8 cm 7 9 cm then to 6 2 cm as d p increases from 36cm to 48 cm then to 72 cm the size of scour hole around the square pile is also observed to be smaller with increase of d p it is believed that the existence of the stone protections could largely weaken the horseshoe vortex and reduce the local scour and it is interesting that as d p increases 100 from 36 cm to 72 cm the reductions of scour depth and size of the scour holes are very limited it is believed that the momentum transfers around the junction of the pile don t vary much though d p experiences a double increase which leads to less affected velocity profiles and the energy loss thus the effect of d p on the local scour is limited hjorth 1975 baker 1979 sumer et al 1997 and roulund et al 2015 reported that the amplification of the bed shear stress can be up to the values of 5 9 on the transverse side of the monopile understandably the increased local velocity will increase the bed shear stress around the side edge of the monopile with the scour protection layer and further increase the local scour as d p d increases the amplification of the bed shear stress decreases petersen sumer et al 2015 suggested that the effect gradually disappeared as d p d 2 5 3 as the scour stone protection can be regarded as the submerged pile located in the perimeter of the square pile the structure can induce the difference flow structures such as the horseshoe vortex and further lead to the variations of the bed shear stress similar with the velocity measurement in figs 18 and 31 shows the measurement of normalized velocity w w 0 in y direction along the pile axis by udv it can be seen clearly that velocity w shows dramatical decrease as the increase of the diameter of the stone protection the stone size as well as layers it is believed that the existence of the stone protection stops the downflow at the front surface and weakens the horseshoe vortex at the junction this leads to a reduction in the scour depth and in the dimensions of the sand deposit in the wake which correspond to the discussion by the bed contours baker 1985 reported that size and strength of the horseshoe vortex decreased dramatically with the decrease of the pile height which corresponded to the drop of the velocity gradient and the adverse pressure gradient in front of the stone protection chou and chao 2000 further showed that the horseshoe vortices evolved into a wavy structure in the cross flow direction and branched itself into smaller regular vortices which came with the drop of the velocity gradient and the adverse pressure gradient fig 31 presents the amplification of the bed shear stress over the centerline of upstream and downstream of the monopile in the proximity of the scour protection layer by petersen et al 2015 and roulund et al 2005 in the upstream the adverse pressure gradient induces a strong recirculation in the junction and generates the horseshoe vortex in front of the pile the mechanism further leads to strong negative shear stress as shown in fig 32 it can be seen that the horseshoe vortex is weaker as d s increases the reason is ascribed to low height of the scour protection layer zhao zhu et al 2012 and yao et al 2018 reported that the horseshoe vortex was no longer the main reason for the local scour around low height to width h d 1 structures whilst the stone protection layer in the present work has h d 0 42 on the other hand the stone protection layer is also a porous structure which could be able to weakened the horseshoe vortex as illustrated in sec 4 1 in the downstream the strong negative shear stress is induced by the opposed streamwise flow in the junction and the turbulent flow structures such as the counter rotating vortices in the wake the two legged scour hole is left as the footprint of the paring counter rotating vortices based on the observations on bed profiles as discussed in fig 30 the equilibrium scour depth s 0 of edge scour in the near field of the scour protection layer can be described by the flowing non dimensional relation of the governing parameters 19 s 0 d f θ d p d h s d p n in which θ is the shields parameter kept constant in the present tests d p d is the ratio of stone layer diameter to pile diameter h s d p is referred as the aspect ratio of the stone protection layer and n is the number of stone layers which is also regarded as h s d s by nielsen et al 2011 and petersen et al 2015 normalized by the equilibrium scour depth of the referenced case fig 33 presents the s 0 s 0 ref against d p d it can be seen that the highest scour is at d p d 1 i e no protection with increase of d p d the equilibrium scour depth decreases dramatically this is ascribed to that the increase of protection layer dimension the amplification of the bed shear stress at the perimeter decreases together with decrease of the local velocity petersen sumer et al 2015 suspected that the equilibrium scour depth is dependent on the number of stone protection layers n with minor evidence the data in the present work support petersen et al 2015 s indications as shown in fig 33 the equilibrium scour for n 2 is always smaller than their counterparts of n 1 as for the aspect ratio of the stone protection layer h s d p in fig 34 the normalized scour depth s 0 d p is observed to be increased with the increase of h s d p and the trend agrees well with yao et al 2018 s study on the low aspect ratio structures the normalized length of scour hole l s is plotted against d p d and the normalized height of the sand ridge h 0 in the wake is shown in fig 35 it should be noted that l s is the length measured from the center of the pile to the end of the scour hole fig 35 show the decreasing trend with increase of d p d which is similar to the results of fig 33 this effect corresponds to the downstream vortices as discussed above it was found that the sand ripples developed gradually around the stone protection layers and can be clearly observed after t 10min due to the live bed flow conditions applied in the present work the sand ripples would have very minor influence on the scour depth due to their small sizes it should be noted the dimensions of sand ripples on the dimensions of the scour hole is an order of magnitude larger than the counterparts in the practice and this influential parameter should be considered in the practical applications on the other hand the volume of sediments eroded around the stone protection layers is observed to be far larger than the sediments deposited in the wake i e ridges this indicates that the bed load and suspended load of sediment transport co exist during the tests the considered shields parameter in the present work is θ s 0 0336 combining with the considered range of shields parameter θ s 0 06 0 23 it is clearly that with further increase of the shields parameter the effect of the stone protection on the porous layer should be different 5 conclusion the local scour around a porous monopile in steady current has been investigated through the experimental apparatus the porous monopile is regarded as the model of a series of subsea structures by considering the influence of streamwise and transverse porosity along with the attack angle effect based on the measurement with the scour running the time history of the scour development equilibrium scour depth time scale and the scour hole profiles have been systematically studied a parametrical study on the scour protection layer for a porous monopile was also carried out the following conclusions can be drawn 1 with an increase of the porosity in the streamwise direction of the pile the scour depth is observed to decrease sharply the reduction of the equilibrium scour depth s 0 is up to 70 the increase of porosity also leads to a decrease of the local sediment transport rate the mechanism is ascribed to the weakening of the horseshoe vortex due to the presence of the porous holes and this can be validated by the weakening downflow in the velocity measurement however the porosity on the transverse direction of the pile has a limited influence on the development of the scour 2 the equilibrium scour depth varying with the porosity for the surface piercing pile fits well with the exponential equation and further supports that the porosity also weakens the velocity amplification at two side corners 3 an interesting phenomenon of the secondary scour is observed at porous plies with inclined attack angle α 30 and 45 the solid part buried in the sand bed is presented as the sediment in the junction is washed out towards the downstream which leads to a strong decrease of the porosity this observation leads to a largely increased velocity and strong turbulence in the strong side which in turn erodes more sediment for the occurrence of the secondary scour 4 for the stone protection layer for the porous pile the increase of the diameter of the stone layer is observed to significantly minimize the scour holes in the near field and the accumulated ridges in the wake the height to diameter ratio h s d p of the stone protection layer share a similar trend that the increase of h s d p comes with the increases of the equilibrium scour depth the stone layer n has a dramatic effect on the local scour larger n results in a smaller scour depth due to its strong porous feature the parameters tested in the present work are in the normal range of the practical

dalian university of technology dalian 116024 china corresponding author local scour around a porous monopile with the square cross section in steady current is investigated experimentally a variety of porosity p 0 38 8 is explored alongside with different attack angles ranging from α 0 60 in the live bed flow condition time history of the scour development equilibrium scour depth time scale and the scour hole profile have been systematically studied the increase of the streamwise porosity is found to largely weaken the horseshoe vortex in the upstream monopile and leads to a decrease of scour depth however the transverse porosity has limited contribution to the local scour around the monopile a secondary scour is revealed for the porous monopile with attack angles α 30 and 45 which is due to the sudden increase of the velocity amplifications at the corner of the monopile the effectiveness of stone layer protection as countermeasure against local scour around a porous monopile has also been studied the characteristics of the scour hole have been quantified it is showed that the stone layers can effectively eliminate the scour hole in particular the larger the diameter of the protection layers or the height to diameter ratio the greater the effectiveness of the countermeasure 1 introduction when a vertical pile is placed on the bed in the steady current the flow will undergo substantial changes i a horseshoe vortex is formed in front of the pile ii vortex shedding is formed in the lee side of the pile and iii the streamlines contract at the sides of the pile in addition there exists a downflow as a consequence of flow deceleration in front of the pile for a square pile the velocity amplification in the upstream corners is also a key mechanism as the structure is placed on an erodible seabed the overall effect of these changes will lead to the increase of the sediment transport resulting in local scour around the pile sumer and fredsoe 2002 due to its significant influence on the instability and failure of the coastal and offshore engineering local scour around a monopile in steady current has been investigated extensively breusers et al 1977 roulund et al 2005 whitehouse et al 2011 melville et al 2015 ahmad et al 2017 karimi et al 2017 numerous studies focus on the surface piercing pile about the development of the scour to the equilibrium scour depth and the time scale of this process melville and sutherland 1988 whitehouse 1998 sumer and fredsoe 2002 for instance melville and chiew 1999 found that the equilibrium time scale was a function of the flow intensify the flow depth and the sediment coarseness for the clear water scour in the study it was found that the scour started very rapidly and reached 50 80 of its equilibrium values at the first 10 of the equilibrium time scale dey and raikar 2007 applied the acoustic doppler velocity adv to analyze the evolution of the turbulent flow characteristics of the horseshoe vortex and observed strong turbulence within the developing scour hole in considering multiple parameters on the development of equilibrium scour depth around piles melville and sutherland 1988 introduced a design method for the estimation of the scour depth as shown in eq 1 breusers nicollet et al 1977 and richardson and davis 1995 applied similar equations with consideration of different factors 1 s 0 d k i k y k d k σ k s k α k h in which k i is a certain empirical formula or factor that have the influence of one specific parameter on the equilibrium scour depth s 0 in eq 1 k i is the factor of flow intensity k y is the factor of the flow depth k d is a formula for the influence of sediment size k σ is the factor of the sediment gradation k s is the factor of the shape of the cross section k α is the alignment factor k h is to quantify the influence of the height to diameter ratio in the conditions of clear water and live bed zhao cheng et al 2010 and yao et al 2018 investigated the equilibrium scour depth as a function of the pile height to diameter ratio it was concluded that for a larger height to diameter ratio the scour depth achieved was similar to that for an infinitely tall pile and for short piles the effects of height to diameter ratio was found to be dependent on the effect of flow intensity based on the above previous works on predicting the equilibrium scour depth the time development of scour for a surface piercing pile can be well calculated through empirical functions sumer and fredsoe 2002 introduced an exponential function eq 2 to describe the development of the scour depth 2 s t s 0 1 e x p t t where s is the scour depth s 0 is the equilibrium scour depth t is the time and t is defined as the time scale of scour whitehouse 1998 employed an exponent on the ratio t t within the exponential term in eq 2 3 s t s 0 1 e x p t t i briaud et al 1999 proposed a hyperbolic function 4 s t s 0 t t t 0 sumer and fredsoe 2002 found that the time scale of scour around a surface piercing pile follows 5 t d 2 g s 1 d 50 3 1 2 t 6 t δ 2000 d θ s 2 2 where d is the representative dimension of the vertical pile diameter for a circular pile or dimension perpendicular to flow for a rectangular pile δ is the boundary layer thickness and t is the non dimensional time scale of scour in the applications of coastal and offshore engineering subsea structures with complex configurations are always adopted as prototypes for many engineering structures such as the caisson valve stations of small height to width ratio structures and pile foundation structures with large height to width ratio the previous study on the local scour of subsea structures with complex configurations is mainly on the local scour and global scour around the structures very limited work has been conducted on the permeable feature for subsea structures with complex configurations through the experimental apparatus for a small height to width cubic caisson dhi snamprogetti 1992 and yang et al 2020 explored the development of scour in the influence of the porosity p which is defined by 7 p a p a c r o s s in which a p is the total area of permeable parts in the longitudinal vertical section surface and a c r o s s is the area of the longitudinal vertical section of the cubic caisson porosity p was denoted as the ability that the water passes through the subsea structures yang et al 2020 reported that the scour initiated at two upstream corners rather than the middle section of the front boundary which indicated that the horseshoe vortex in front of the pile is not the governing factor on the local scour around the structures but the velocity amplification at two upstream corners the incoming flow rate is divergent into two different paths which are inside and outside of the porous caisson and this physical mechanism induces the observations that the increase of the porosity leads to a decrease of the scour depth a correcting parameter k p was introduced to illustrate the influence of porosity on the equilibrium scour depth and time scale for the local scour around the porous caisson as follows 8 k p s 0 s 0 β 1 p 2 d 0 75 in which s 0 is the equilibrium scour depth for an infinitely tall sold pile and β is an empirical coefficient for the cubic square caisson in the live bed condition yang et al 2020 proposed this empirical coefficient can be taken as 0 806 0 835 however this value was based on specific conditions without considering the surface piercing pile the effect of streamwise porosity two dimensional porosity p 2d transverse porosity three dimensional porosity p 3d and attack angle α has been well investigated and their influence on the equilibrium scour depth matches well with the exponential fitting function eq 8 yang tang et al 2020 also reported the time scale of the scour process for the cubic structures it was concluded that the time scale results were a function of the porosity but no obvious correlation was observed further in line with the framework above it is apparent that further investigations should be employed to systematically explore the development of local scour for a surface piecing pile with the large height to width ratio which is usually regarded as the prototype of the certain pile foundation system for instance it is clear that for a surface piercing pile the horseshoe vortex results in the sediment transport in front of the pile however it is not clear how the existence of the porosity affects the horseshoe vortex on the other hand as the local scour is the main cause to the failure of the subsea structures scour protection installed at the base of a monopile also attracts substantial interests in decades chiew 1995 chiew and lim 2000 lauchlan and melville 2001 de vos de rouck et al 2011 2012 nielsen et al 2011 nielsen et al 2013 sumer and nielsen 2013 breusers and raudkivi 1991 and melville and coleman 2000 gave detailed accounts of protection measures on the bridge piers either in the form of a stone protection layer in the form of a protective mattress melville and coleman 2000 recommended that the ideal level for the placement of the stone layer was at the level of the expected lowest bed form in the vicinity of the bridge piers sumer and fredsoe 2002 proposed that it was a key issue to determine the extent of the stone protection layer as well as the thickness of the protection layer however scour protection itself would cause erosion the local scour at the layer edge might lead to the deformations of the stone layer and failure of the scour protections of the monopile foundations whitehouse harris et al 2011 referred to it as the edge scour induced by the secondary flow that transferred sediment away from the junction between the seabed and stone layers raaijmakers rudolph et al 2007 franco et al 2009 and raaijmakers et al 2010 reported the edge scour along the perimeter of the stone protection layer was up to 2 5 m summarizing the studies above further systematical investigations on the scour protections for a porous surface piercing monopile are warranted the influence of the extent of the stone protection layer and the thickness of the protection layer together with the sizes of stones are essential to be quantified through flow measurements via the particle image velocimetry piv nielsen et al 2011 and petersen et al 2015 reported two major mechanisms of the edge scour around a stone protection cover 1 the horseshoe vortex in front of the structures and the flow acceleration at the transverse sides due to the presence of the stone cover 2 a pair of symmetrical counter pairing vortices generated in the downstream of the monopile and scour protections which suspends the sediment in the wake area the horseshoe vortex and flow accelerations in the near field carries the sediment away from the pile which induces the turbulence around the individual stones and the enhanced local shear stress in the experiment it can be observed that the sediment beneath the stone is removed in some cases the stones at the edge of the protection layer are observed to sink into the scour hole due to the failure stability of the sand beneath them on the other hand a portion of the sand is also observed to be brought into the stone layer by the streamwise flow the paring counter rotating streamwise vortices in the wake erode considerable sediment away from the pile with scour protection layer and drive the suspended sediment towards the centerline to form a pileup in the wake motivated by quantifying 1 the influence of porosity on the surface piercing pile and 2 the effectiveness of scour protection by stone layers the present work reports a systematical experimental study of the scour around surface piercing piles the key study is to quantify the influence of streamwise porosity transverse porosity and attack angles on the equilibrium scour depth and time scale of the scour process and the effectiveness of protection layers dimensions and stone sizes the remainder of the present work is organized as follows section 2 describes the test facility experimental setup and the scour measurements section 3 and section 4 then present the main results and discussions for the influence of porosity and scour protections respectively conclusions are given in section 5 2 test facility model setup the experimental tests in the present work were conducted in the o tube facility at state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology in china working as an impeller driven fully enclosed circulating water channel the o tube facility has a working section of 20m 1 5m 1 6 m length width depth a 0 4 m deep sand bed was made in the test section of 6 0 m in length and extended to cover the whole test section fig 1 presents the schematic drawing of the experimental setup as shown in fig 1 the streamwise direction is defined as y direction which is along the flow direction z direction is referred as the vertical direction and the x direction is defined by the spanwise direction the o tube facility can generate various flow and combined flow conditions including steady current oscillatory flow as well as steady oscillatory combined flow conditions in the present experiments only the steady current condition was carried out the water depth was kept 1 0 m for all cases square model piles are made of acrylic material in the present experiment surface piercing monopile has a square cross section with an edge width of d 20 mm and height of l 1600 mm which results in a blockage ratio of less than 1 6 in the horizontal direction the blockage effect is believed to be minor the model piles have a 0 4m 0 4 m base plate installed deep within the sand bed to ensure the stability during the test the feature of porosity was achieved through the porous holes set in the surface of the piles 2d porosity p 2d is defined as the porous holes set in surface ad and bc in streamwise direction of the pile as shown in fig 2 a and with porous holes in surface ab and cd in the transverse direction of the pile 3d porosity p 3d was achieved as presented in fig 2 b a variety of porosity were considered ranging from p 0 to p 38 8 table 2 shows the experiments performed in the present work the porous surface piercing square monopile was orientated ranging from α 15 to α 60 relative to the incoming flow direction a non cohesive uniform silica sand was used in the present experiments as shown in table 1 the median particle size is d 50 0 378 mm and has the geometric standard deviation d 84 d 50 1 18 the specific gravity s is 2 67 the critical shields parameter θ cr is calculated by the improved empirical formulae proposed by soulsby 1997 which was widely applied by many previous literature 9 θ c r 0 30 1 1 2 d 0 055 1 e x p 0 020 d where the non dimensional particle size d is defined as 10 d g s 1 υ 2 1 3 d 50 the shields parameter due to total friction was obtained according to the measured velocity profile and the shields parameter θ s due to skin friction is defined as 11 θ s τ s ρ g s 1 d 50 u f s 2 g s 1 d 50 where τ s is the shear stress due to the skin friction experienced by the sea ben from the flow ρ is the water density g is the acceleration due to the gravity s is the specific gravity of sand d 50 is the median particle size of sand υ is the kinematical viscosity of water and u f s is the friction velocity associated with skin friction defined by 12 u f s τ s ρ 1 2 in which the shear stress due to skin friction τ s can be calculated by the empirical formula for flat and surface by soulsby 1997 13 τ s ρ c d u 2 where the logarithmic relationship for c d is 14 c d κ ln z 0 s h 1 2 in which κ is the karman constant equaling 0 4 u is the depth averaged flow velocity z 0 s is the roughness height due to the skin friction and h is the water depth the skin friction shields parameter is used to judge whether a test is under live bed or clear water conditions live bed condition prevails as θ s θ cr 1 with signs of sediment motion as for clear water condition θ s θ cr 1 the steady current was generated at u 0 36 m s corresponding to θ s θ cr 1 138 in live bed conditions the scour protection with multiple stone layers was placed circularly around the pile on the top of the sand bed the stone layer was made of crushed angular stones with sizes of d s 2 cm and 5 cm each of the stone layers applied in the experiments had a geometrical standard deviation of σ g 1 5 the layer of stones is ranging from n 0 1 and 2 corresponding to the height of the stone layer h s 0 10 cm the case with h s 0 is exactly the test b4 with p 3d 26 33 as discussed in sec 4 1 the layer height to pile diameter is in the range of h s d 0 0 5 which is the normal range for the engineering application petersen et al 2015 the diameter of the stone protection layer is ranging in d p 36 72 cm enabling the layer diameter to pile diameter in the range of d p d 3 6 the zero slopes of the scour protection layer α 0 was applied for all cases total 12 cases were launched to explore the above three parameters on the scour protections for a porous square pile and the detailed is summarized in table 4 photos of the experimental setup of case p2 p5 p8 and p11 are shown in fig 29 as examples it should be noted that the duration of testing time is more than t 8 h for all cases developing to the equilibrium state the features of local scour discussed in the following are based on the data at the equilibrium state 3 measurements of scour and flow velocity the velocity profile across the water depth was measured using a nortek vectrino acoustic doppler velocimetry adv with sampling frequency of 20 hz and sampling time of 180s for each sampling point velocity profiles in the vertical direction were measured at the location where the model pipe was set the velocities were measured after generating flow for 10min fig 3 shows the distribution of mean velocity over the water depth the boundary layer thickness is around 0 35 m through the velocity profile the velocity profiles at two locations along the x direction as shown in fig 3 b were tested for quantifying the distributions of x direction no obvious difference is observed which indicates that the good uniformity of the velocity is achieved in the transverse direction a fitted curve according to the measured velocities below z 0 8 m was also plotted in fig 3 a the fitted curve follows the logarithmic law as follows 15 u z u f t κ ln z z 0 t where u f t is the friction velocity associated with the total shear stress z 0 t is the total roughness the total shear stress is the shear stress due to the combined effect of skin friction and friction due to bedforms such as bed ripples soulsby 1997 according to the fitted curve the velocity generated by the steady current is u 0 39 m s in each experiment performed adv was set in the upstream 1 5 m away from the location of the square pile and 50 mm above the sand bed to measure the freestream velocity as shown in fig 1 to measure the hydrodynamic features during the scour around the model pile two ultrasound doppler velocimetry udv probes were adopted as shown in fig 4 probes can measure variations of velocity within 500 mm range with a sampling rate of 20 hz and can record variations of depth with a sampling rate of 20hz udv can transmit and receive the reflected ultrasonic waves and usually the position with the strongest reflected signal is exactly on the sand surface therefore the development of the scour depth can be inferred from the change of the sand surface the udv applied in the current measurements of velocity can measure a velocity profile within 25 mm range with a cell size of 1 mm the measuring range of udv is at 50 80 mm away from the probe as a key parameter indicating the quality of the data the snr correlation of the signal is always monitoring during the test it was found that the 35 points in the middle range normally have correlation values higher than 95 and the correlation values drop with the increase of the distance to the probe for the other 10 points in the analysis the samples with correlation lower than 95 were removed probe 1 was attached in the front corner of the model pile to record the development of scour depth since the scour was expected to be the most significant at this point of the structure yao et al 2018 and probe 2 was applied at the middle of the front surface to measure the z velocity of the downflow the inference tests were launched that two udv sensors have no interruption with each other a three dimensional scour profile laser scanner was applied during the experiment to monitor the scour and gradations the three dimensional scour profiles were achieved using an infrared scanner which can cover a range of 2 m 2 m with resolution of 1 mm the similar setup has been used by yao et al 2018 and zhao et al 2012 the general procedure for experiments performed was as follows i install the model pile steadily in the test section of the o tube ii level the sand bed iii fill water into the o tube and slow down the filling speed to avoid any disturbances to the sand surface iv after starting to record data through adv udv and video run the pump of o tube until the equilibrium stage of local scour is reached vi ramp down the pump and drain the water out of the o tube vii scan the final scour profile with a 3d laser scanner supplementary to these experiments were performed to measure the development of sand bed profiles at different instants at certain instants for 10min 30min 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h and 8 h the flow was stopped and the water was drained off to ensure the accuracy the bed profiles were measured through 3d scanner after the measurement of the bed profiles the o tube was refilled with a slow speed of the water filling pump to avoid disturbances to the terrain around the model piles and continued to run till the next time instant this method are widely employed in the scouring experiments which can be efficient considering the data acquisition zhao et al 2012 yao et al 2018 the following supplementary also has the strong support this method fig 5 shows the comparison between the continuous record and the record at certain instants it should be noted that the record point is at the most upstream edge of the square cylinder which experiences the largest scour hole due to the previous literature it can be seen from fig 5 that the data of two methods have a good agreement with each other which indicates the above method can be applied in the present experiment 4 results 4 1 streamwise transverse porosity the influence of streamwise porosity two dimensional porosity p 2d has been explored in this section tests a1 a6 have p 2d ranging from 0 to 38 8 as shown in table 2 to provide an example of the development of scour fig 6 presents contours of bed profiles for test a5 with p 2d 26 33 at four different instants at t 10min in fig 6 a the scour initials from the two upstream corners and the middle section of the front boundary but it is hard to distinguish which is first it is believed that both the horseshoe vortex in the upstream and velocity amplifications at the upstream corners contribute to the sand erosion at the junction of the pile based on the study of yao et al 2018 the sand is washed out from the pile and forms a pile up in the wake with the development of the scour the scour hole around the pile is deepened and widened the pile up in the wake is further pushed towards downstream to describe the scour profile observed in the experiments fig 5 d presents the scour profiles at four different moments fig 7 shows the contours of the bed profiles at t 8 h for test a1 with p 2d 0 test a3 with p 2d 9 and test a5 with p 2d 38 8 as the comparison it is can be seen that with an increase of p 2d from 0 to 38 5 a decreasing trend is observed for both the range of scour holes and the distance of pile ups in the wake the coverage of scour hole for test a3 is around 350mm 350 mm and for a distance of pile up in the wake test a3 achieves at around 1100 mm which is 10 reduction of the results of test a1 the counterparts of test a5 have even smaller values of the coverage of scour holes and locations of pile up achieving around 260mm 260 mm and 700 m respectively to illustrate the influence of p 2d on the scour hole of porous square piles the summary of the coverage of scour hole and locations of pile up is presented in fig 8 together with trend lines it should be noted that the transverse dimension of the scour hole is employed in the analysis though it is slightly smaller than the streamwise dimension the coverage of scour hole and locations of pile up are all normalized by the effective diameter of the pile with the increase of the p 2d r d and l d decrease monotonically the coverage of scour hole decreases from r d 3 1 of p 2d 0 to around r d 2 2 of p 2d 38 8 locations of pile up decreases from l d 9 8 of p 2d 0 to around l d 6 5 of p 2d 38 8 the reductions of r d and l d is up to 30 with the influence of p 2d it should be noted that due to the existence of the flow in the spanwise direction x direction the three dimensional effect on the local scour around the cylinder will be presented in the scour profile plots the three dimensionality of the flow in the scouring experiments has been reported by many researchers zhao et al 2010 whitehouse et al 2011 the deviations of the asymmetrical distributions along positive and negative x direction were measured smaller than 5 which indicates that the three dimensional effect can be negligible and the measurement of scour is reasonable fig 9 presents the equilibrium scour profiles aligned with cross section a a and b b for test a1 a6 it can be seen that the distributions are reasonably symmetrical at the left and right sides as shown in fig 9 the deepest point is at the edge of the pile and the increase of porosity does have influence on the reduction of the scour depth as shown in fig 9 a the slope of the scour hole also decreases with the increase of the porosity coming with the decrease of the transverse dimension of scour hole in fig 9 b for cross section b b the deepest scour point is observed at the front boundary of the square pile which indicates the influence of horseshoe vortex for the back boundary the scour hole is also observed at test a1 a4 however with a further increase of porosity the scour hole at the back boundary is gradually diminished for test a5 it is hard to distinguish the scour hole in the back and for test a6 it is interesting to see that the sediment washed out from the upstream corners accumulates in the back junction and the locations of pile up in the wake is closer to the pile with the increase of porosity which is also validated by fig 8 b the accumulations at the back boundary for test a5 and test a6 are believed to be a part of the pile ups in the wake and it is noted that the height of the pile up in the wake seems to be independent of the porosity even the locations vary based on the distributions of scour profiles in figs 9 and 10 shows the slope angles of the scour hole profiles with cross section a a and b b respectively for cross section a a the slope angles on the left and right sides of the pile are defined as α l and α r respectively the slope angles on the upstream and downstream sides of the pile in the cross section b b are denoted as α u and α d the slopes at the left and right sides has an reasonable symmetrical feature also shown in fig 9 whilst the downstream slopes are always smaller than the upstream slopes for cross section a a in fig 10 a α l and α r have minor differences and are observed to be independent of porosity α l and α r have the range of 25 35 which is close to the internal friction angle γ 32 4 for the cohesive sand used in the experiments the similar observations are also presented for α u in cross section b b in fig 10 b this indicates that the existence of horseshoe vortex in the upstream always leads to a strong local scour however α d experiences an obvious reduction with the increase of the porosity which is corresponding to the weakening scour in the back boundary as discussed in fig 9 it is believed that the contraction of the streamline induced by the horseshoe vortex is weakened and the influence of velocity amplification is also reduced due to the presence of flow diverting through the porous holes on the other hand the sediment deposition on the lee side of the cylinder is formed due to the erosion from the upstream with the increase of the porosity the location of the sediment deposition is nearer the cylinder with a smaller height as shown in fig 9 b the time history of local scour for test a1 a6 is presented in fig 11 the measurements of scour depth were taken at the upstream side verge of the square pile through udv1 as indicated in fig 4 it can be seen that the scour depth increases rapidly at the first 10min and at first t 0 5 h the developments of the local scour for test a1 a6 are quite alike to each other and no major difference can be distinguished the differences among curves of test a1 a6 can be clearly seen as t 0 5 h comparing across the cases it is apparent that results of tests with p 2d 10 show minor differences and as p 2d 10 the scour depth decreases drastically as p 2d increases the reduction of the scour depth s in the equilibrium stage is up to 67 from s d 2 2 for p 2d 0 to s d 1 32 for p 2d 38 8 as p 2d increases from 0 to 38 8 the needed time at which the equilibrium state reaches is larger and this indicates that the as p 2d increases the scour rate decreases it should be noted that each time history shown in fig 11 for tests a1 a6 were run until the equilibrium state was observed or the scour depth was close to the equilibrium stage for the local scour fig 12 presents an example fitted to the experimental data using eq 2 by sumer and fredsoe 2002 eq 3 by whitehouse 1998 and eq 4 by briaud et al 1999 for the time history of the local scour for test a5 with p 2d 26 3 it can be seen from fig 12 that the exponential equation eq 3 with modified form by whitehouse et al 1998 matches well with the dotted data and is better than the exponential equation of eq 2 and hyperbolic function of eq 4 table 3 shows the square of correlation coefficient r 2of the fitted curves from eqs 2 4 the r 2 of the exponential equation eq 3 with modified form are generally larger than those achieved by eqs 2 and 4 on the other hand the equilibrium scour depths fitted from the exponential equations eq 3 with modified form are more conservative than the exponential equations eq 2 and hyperbolic equations eq 4 therefore exponential equation eq 3 is applied to the predictions of the equilibrium scour depth and time scale in the present work it should be noted that in the present experiments the tests are stopped before the equilibrium the stage the fitted equilibrium scour depth is an approximation rather than a direct observation which is regarded as the reliable results of the experimental closing to the equilibrium the development of the scour is self similar and well approximated by the fitted mathematical expressions which can be taken as the true value of the experiments as presented in fig 12 fig 13 presents the non dimensional time scale for the porous square pile and the trend lines have been draw approximating the data in yang et al 2020 s investigations the time scale t has no obvious correlation with the porosity for a porous cubic caisson however the time scale t in the present work increases with the increases of porosity as shown in fig 13 the sediment transport rate is also observed to be smaller see fig 11 it is suspected that the weakening of the horseshoe vortex will lead to a smaller sediment transport rate and a larger time scale both melville and chiew 1999 and yao et al 2018 present an increasing time scale t as the influence of the horseshoe vortex is weakened which can be reasonable supports for the observation to interpret the development of scour around a pile yao et al 2018 demonstrated that the time scale t is proportional to the equilibrium scour depth which indicates a deeper scour holes require longer to process and inversely proportional to the local transport rate which means as the local transport rate increases scour happens more quickly as shown in eq 16 16 g s 1 d 50 3 1 2 d 2 t 0 t s 0 2 d 2 1 φ l in which φ l is the dimensionless local transport rate it can be seen that in eq 17 17 t 2 t 2 s 0 d 2 1 φ l removing the influence of the equilibrium scour depth in the time scale the non dimensional time scale t 2 increases monotonically with porosity which corresponds to the decreasing local transport rate with increasing of the porosity as p 2d increases from p 2d 9 38 3 t 2 increases more than five times the value which is corresponding to less than 1 5 of the local transport rate see fig 14 experiments of test b1 b4 were run to explore the influence of transverse porosity three dimensional porosity p 3d in the present work two groups were presented in table 2 group i the porosity on the front and back boundaries streamwise direction keep at p 2d 9 whilst the transverse porosity p 3d at two side boundaries varies from 9 to 26 3 group ii the porosity on the front and back boundaries keep at p 2d 26 3 whilst the transverse porosity p 3d varies from 9 to 26 3 test a3 with p 2d 9 and test a5 with p 2d 26 3 are taken as the references fig 15 presents the time history of local scour measured at the upstream corners for group i and ii respectively it is very interesting to see that the curves of group i and group ii collapse together and have an exact similar development of scour this indicates that the existence of p 3d will not mainly contribute to the local scour around the pile the contours of bed profiles for test b1 and b2 with t 10 h are presented in fig 16 observations of scour holes around the pile and pile ups in the wake are very similar to the results of test a3 as shown in fig 7 as for the cubic porous square caisson with a low height to width ratio in yang et al 2020 the existence of the transverse porosity p 3d results in a reduction of 10 on the equilibrium scour depth the mechanism is ascribed to the transverse flow rate would weaken the velocity amplification at two upstream corners of the square caisson in test b1 b4 for a surface piercing porous square pile the main factor that governs the local scour around the structures is the horseshoe vortex induced by the adverse pressure gradient in the upstream it is speculated that the existence of the transverse porosity p 3d doesn t affect the horseshoe vortex and further have no obvious weakening influence on the development of local scour around the square pile fig 17 shows the equilibrium scour depth with variations of porosity for test a1 a6 and b1 b4 together with the data of dhi snamprogetti 1992 and yang et al 2020 on a porous square caisson as the porosity achieves p 1 the equilibrium scour depth equals zero this implies that if no structure in the test section no local scour is observed which is similar to the results of dhi snamprogetti 1992 and yang et al 2020 it can be seen from fig 17 that the equilibrium scour depth s 0 decreases sharply with the increase of porosity similar to yang et al 2020 s results for p 10 the equilibrium scour depth s 0 shares very minor differences at p 0 s 0 achieves at 2 2d whilst s 0 is at 1 3d for p 38 8 the reduction is up to 67 which is similar to the reductions rate in the results of dhi snamprogetti 1992 67 and yang et al 2020 63 for a small height to width structure the influence of the horseshoe vortex can be omitted and the velocity amplifications play the key role leading to the maximum scour depth occurring at the two upstream corners based on the mechanism yang et al 2020 explained the influence of porosity was due to the flow was divergent to two paths through the structures outside the structure and inside the structure and an exponential equation eq 8 was introduced to fit the data as shown in fig 17 the empirical coefficient β is β 1 0 8357 for yang et al 2020 s data and β 2 1 5711 for dhi snamprogetti 1992 s results for a surface piercing porous square pile three flow mechanisms are expected to contribute to the local scour i the horseshoe vortex induced by the adverse pressure gradient in front of the pile ii the velocity amplification at two upstream corners due to the square cross section iii vortex shedding in the wake sumer and fredsoe 2002 it is believed that the weakening of the local scour due to the influence of the porosity depends on the weakening of both horseshoe vortex and velocity amplifications this is validated by the data of test a1 a6 and b1 b4 in the current work collectively match with the exponential equation eq 8 as shown in fig 17 and the empirical coefficient β 3 is 2 1551 as follows 18 s 0 d β 3 1 p 0 75 in which the square of correlation coefficient r 2 is at r 2 0 9989 it should be noted that β 3 β 1 2 58 when comparing with results of yang et al 2020 the reason can be ascribed to the influence of the height to width ratio as the experimental setup and flow intensity are very similar the discrepancies are believed to be ascribed to the influence of the height to width ratio as discussed in yao et al 2018 s study as the flow intensity is at around θ s θ cr 1 28 the equilibrium scour depth s 0 for an infinitely tall pile is about two times of its counterpart for a low height to ratio structure on the other hand it may be also due to the fact that the water depth in yang et al 2020 is around 1 77 2 5 times of the caisson s diameter whilst the present work is around 8 5 times melville and sutherland 1988 reported that the scour depth would be influenced if the water is shallow though no systematic analysis has been launched as a pile is placed on the seabed with the incoming flow the pressure gradient is produced in its vicinity and leads to separations of boundary layers on the wall upstream of the pile the separated boundary layer rolls up towards the downstream forming the horseshoe vortex the main vortex rotating in the junction further results in a strong velocity gradient in the upstream of the pile and induces a downflow in the upstream of the pile baker 1979 1980 according to fig 17 the weakening of horseshoe vortex is speculated to be due to the effect of porosity the quantitative analysis is given as follows the acceleration of the flow velocity is induced by the constriction of the pile and the momentum transfer at the junction where the pile surface and the water channel boundary join the momentum transfer with the pile surface contributes to the development of the vertical velocity profile hajivalie et al 2012 in the junction of the pile the strong turbulence and the vertical velocities lead to the horseshoe vortex which is the main cause of the local scour around the pile as shown in fig 4 udv2 is attached at the front surface of the porous square pile for measuring the z velocity w along the longitude direction of the pile it should be noted that the velocity discussed in the following part is based on the time averaged values which is originated from the time history of velocity examples of fig 23 from udv udv2 is enabled to record the velocity in the z direction within the range of z d 2 5 to 0 5 it is noted that the installation of udv2 is 5 cm away from the pile surface and 0 5 m away from the sand bed to capture the velocity variations fig 18 shows the distributions of normalized averaged velocity along the z direction for test a1 a6 the z velocity w is normalized by the values of w 0 at the position of h d 2 which is free from the influence of the horseshoe vortex in the junction it can be seen from fig 18 that as the probe s recording is touching the scour hole velocity w increases dramatically at h d 0 5 1 5 the maximum values of w velocity occurs within the scour hole in which the horseshoe vortex rotates and stretches around the velocity gradient is introduced simply defined by the difference of the maximum and minimum velocity on their height difference δ w δ h fig 19 shows the velocity gradient δ w δ h with variations of porosity it is apparent that the velocity gradient δ w δ h decrease with the increase of porosity the decrease of the velocity gradient δ w δ h is up to 80 as δ w δ h 0 82 for p 2d 0 to δ w δ h 0 35 for p 2d 38 8 the dominant influence factor of sediment transport is the momentum transfer due to the fluid sediment interactions barbe cruise et al 1992 summarized that the momentum transfer in the vertical direction experiences two paths which are 1 vertical mixing with fluid and 2 vertical motion of grains keeping interaction with surrounding fluid the vertical momentum transfers in the upper recirculating cells moves the bed sediment into the upper layer and the movement of sediment particles is not significantly active in the lower layer as a signal of weakening momentum transfer the reduction of δ w δ h is believed to be corresponding to the weakened down flow in the upstream and further validates the conclusion that the horseshoe vortex is weakened due to the influence of the porosity an offshore engineering structure always has a complex configuration such as a piled structure comprises of horizontal vertical and inclined members when the structure is exposed to the flow the local scour around the structure should take the particular configuration into account fog and jønsson 1997 reported the minimization of scour development should be considered in the open design of the valve station with the porosity feature dahlberg 1983 reviews the scour observations in the north sea around pile supported offshore oil platform the scour depth could be as much as 3 m whereas the design criteria were exceed by up to 1 5 m 4 2 attack angle effect the influence of the attack angles has been explored based on the porous square pile with streamwise p 2d and transverse porosity p 3d two groups are employed i test c1 c4 p 2d and p 3d all equal 9 03 and the attack angle varies from α 0 60 ii test c5 c8 p 2d and p 3d all equal 26 33 with the attack angle varying from α 0 60 fig 20 shows the contour of bed profiles for test c1 c4 with p 2d p 3d 9 03 as shown in fig 20 the existence of an attack angle leads to asymmetrical scour profiles around the pile and the maximum scour depth is observed to be at the most upstream side corners of the pile the largest range of the scour hole is observed at α 45 as shown in fig 20 c and with increase of the attack angle α the dimensions of pile up in the wake decreases the pile up with α 60 has the smallest height the results of group ii with p 38 75 share very similar observations fig 21 a and b present the time history of the local scour measured at the upstream edge of the porous square pile for group i and ii two phases are observed as denoted in fig 21 for group i it is observed that the scour develops very fast as it initials and gradually slows down increases of porosity will lead to a decrease of the scour depth the development of the scour for test b1 with α 0 is always the largest whilst test c4 with α 60 is the smallest however at t 3 h of test c2 with α 30 and t 7 h of test c3 with α 45 show interesting phenomena that a secondary scour is observed after the scour reaches a plateau similar observations also occur at group ii in fig 21 b for example the development of scour for test c7 propagates quickly and reaches a plateau at t 1 8 h 2 5 h and with the test running a new developing scour is observed at t 6 h and the slope of the curve increases the secondary scour continues propagating till the equilibrium state is achieved t 10 h the secondary scour is developed based on the scour hole of the first time scour considering the effect of alignment by laursen 1960 and ettema et al 1998 k α 45 k α 0 is around 1 2 whilst due to the second scour the equilibrium scour depth experiences a sharp increase and also has the similar values of test b4 with α 0 although it is far smaller than the counterpart of test c5 in phase i featured by the variations of slopes of phase ii test c2 and c6 with α 30 and test c3 and c7 with α 45 are observed with the secondary time scour to quantify the mechanism of the secondary time scour at α 30 and 45 at the side corners of the porous pile supplementary tests were conducted to measure contours of bed level at different instants for test c6 with α 30 two advs were employed to measured u velocity at the side corner a and c at certain instants as shown in the sketch of fig 25 adv1 is located the most upstream edge of the cylinder whilst adv2 is located at the second most upstream edge two adv are located outside the boundary layer of the seabed level as well as the square pile surface to avoid any disturbance on the data acquisition as illustrated by sumer and fredsøe 2002 yoon et al 2010 the existence of the sharp edge would lead velocity accerlation in the vicinity which results in the strong shear stress at the corner and further strong erosion of the sediment as discussed by sumer and fredsøe 2002 dey and raikar 2007 observed a very high fluctuation of velocity in the scour hole during the erosion it was proposed that the flow structures induced strong turbulence in the scour hole in the present work the measurement of velocity and fluctuation are summarized in figs 22 25 as presented in fig 22 the scour around the pile kept almost unchanged at 30min and 1 h and experienced a sharp increase at t 2 h and 4 h the pile up in the wake is observed to be moved towards far downstream with a larger size both scour holes at the side corner a and c are deepened with the extensive erosion in the middle section of the front boundary ac the corresponding u velocity for the side corner a and c by adv1 and adv2 respectively is presented in fig 25 it should be noted that the corner c is the recording point for α 60 u velocity for the side corner a and c is normalized by the freestream velocity u 0 it can be seen from fig 25 that u for the side corner a and c are quite close at the first t 2 h with u a being slightly larger at t 2 h the discrepancy between a and c is dramatic and this leads to strong erosion at the corner a u a experiences an increase at t 3 h as shown in fig 25 a whilst the u c is still kept at the low value the fluctuated velocity u has very similar observations in fig 25 b u is defined by the root mean square value of the velocity can be defined u 1 n i 1 n u i u 2 strong turbulence is observed at the corner a after the secondary scour is observed at t 2 h by adv1 the weak corner c by adv2 is however less fluctuated the above discussion can also be supported by the measurements of w w 0 at certain instants by udv2 as shown in fig 24 it can be seen that at t 2 h w w 0 is less fluctuated and share the minor variations with the scour continuing this indicates that phase i is gradually achieved with the propagation of the scour w w 0 experiences an extraordinary increase at t 2 h which indicates that the horseshoe vortex becomes stronger at phase ii scour based on the discussion of sec 4 1 the cases with α 30 and 45 is expected to have the weaker local scour and smaller scour depth rather than an increase of the scour depth due to the secondary scour with reference to the surface piercing piles two inferences can now be made to understand the secondary scour phenomenon as shown in fig 21 firstly the increase of p 2d and p 3d will lead to a weakening of the local scour around the pile as shown in fig 15 the maximum reduction of the scour can be up to 70 as the horseshoe vortex in the front of the pile plays a key role in the development of the local scour around the surface piercing pile the increase of porosity results in a smaller adverse pressure gradient which would lead smaller bed area subjected to the flow concentration caused by the horseshoe vortex contractions of the streamlines and velocity amplifications therefore it leads to a smaller scour depth around the pile with an increase of the attack angle this mechanism is recorded through observations of phase i in fig 21 secondly as the scour hole in the upstream is further developed the sediment in the junction is being eroded and washed out to the downstream and leaves a deeper scour hole in front the pile as the buried part of the square pile model is solid p 0 the influence of horseshoe vortex governs the development of local scour again and this results in a secondary scour for both α 30 and 45 this is can be validated by the drastic increase of velocity u and fluctuation component u at the corner a and strengthened downflow as illustrated by w w 0 it is understandable that due to the velocity amplifications for the square pile the local shear stress is larger at the corner which is more closing to the upstream larger local flow rate which leads to strong sediment transport and the local scour at the weak corner would be weakened due to the decrease of local flow rate resulting in a reduction of scour depth it is validated by the cases with α 30 and 60 in which the corner of α 30 is the stronger side and the counterpart of α 60 is the weaker one and this explains why the case with α 60 always has the smallest scour depth fig 26 shows the non dimensional time scale t of scour with the different attack angles based on eq 3 by whitehouse 1998 it can be seen that the time scale of scour increases with the increase of the attack angle as discussed above the sediment transport rate for a large attack angle α 30 is smaller than the cases with a smaller attack angle and this observation is exaggerated for cases with p 26 33 the high values of t for α 30 and 45 correspond to the secondary scour described in fig 21 which leads to a longer time to reach the equilibrium state fig 27 shows the variations of non dimensional time scale t2 with the attack angle a as illustrated in eq 14 t 2 is corresponding to the local transport rate of the scour it can be seen that t 2 is almost independent of the influence of porosity at α 15 and with increasing of α t 2 increases dramatically at p 9 03 whilst t 2 for p 26 33 shows relatively slight increase 4 3 scour protection scour protections are typically placed around the monopile foundations to avoid the scour erosions the stone protection layer is one of the major scour protections for cylindrical structures as discussed in the literature however the stone protection layer itself would cause local scour influenced by the increase of the local velocity the local bed shear stress in turn increases in this section multiple layer stone protection is introduced and its effect is quantified on the porous square piles the sketch is shown in fig 28 the model pile was embedded vertically in the sediment bed extending to the base of the flume and was kept fixed similar with the experimental setup of the porous monopiles the water depth was kept at 1 0 m and the live bed condition was achieved with θ s θ cr 1 28 it should be noted that the applied model pile is the one for p 3d 26 33 test b4 and the results of test b4 without scour protections are set as the reference fig 30 shows the contours of bed level profiles for case p1 p3 to explore the influence of the diameter of the stone protection d p under the same size of stone d s 2 cm and same layer n 1 three local scour areas can be identified 1 edge scour alongside the perimeter of the scour protection layer from the upstream side to the transverse side 2 a two legged scour hole forms in the downstream originating from the transverse sides 3 a ridge forms between the two legs of the scour hole extending towards the downstream it can be seen from fig 30 that increase of d p can reduce the local scour around the porous square pile very efficiently the pile up in the wake reduces from s 8 8 cm 7 9 cm then to 6 2 cm as d p increases from 36cm to 48 cm then to 72 cm the size of scour hole around the square pile is also observed to be smaller with increase of d p it is believed that the existence of the stone protections could largely weaken the horseshoe vortex and reduce the local scour and it is interesting that as d p increases 100 from 36 cm to 72 cm the reductions of scour depth and size of the scour holes are very limited it is believed that the momentum transfers around the junction of the pile don t vary much though d p experiences a double increase which leads to less affected velocity profiles and the energy loss thus the effect of d p on the local scour is limited hjorth 1975 baker 1979 sumer et al 1997 and roulund et al 2015 reported that the amplification of the bed shear stress can be up to the values of 5 9 on the transverse side of the monopile understandably the increased local velocity will increase the bed shear stress around the side edge of the monopile with the scour protection layer and further increase the local scour as d p d increases the amplification of the bed shear stress decreases petersen sumer et al 2015 suggested that the effect gradually disappeared as d p d 2 5 3 as the scour stone protection can be regarded as the submerged pile located in the perimeter of the square pile the structure can induce the difference flow structures such as the horseshoe vortex and further lead to the variations of the bed shear stress similar with the velocity measurement in figs 18 and 31 shows the measurement of normalized velocity w w 0 in y direction along the pile axis by udv it can be seen clearly that velocity w shows dramatical decrease as the increase of the diameter of the stone protection the stone size as well as layers it is believed that the existence of the stone protection stops the downflow at the front surface and weakens the horseshoe vortex at the junction this leads to a reduction in the scour depth and in the dimensions of the sand deposit in the wake which correspond to the discussion by the bed contours baker 1985 reported that size and strength of the horseshoe vortex decreased dramatically with the decrease of the pile height which corresponded to the drop of the velocity gradient and the adverse pressure gradient in front of the stone protection chou and chao 2000 further showed that the horseshoe vortices evolved into a wavy structure in the cross flow direction and branched itself into smaller regular vortices which came with the drop of the velocity gradient and the adverse pressure gradient fig 31 presents the amplification of the bed shear stress over the centerline of upstream and downstream of the monopile in the proximity of the scour protection layer by petersen et al 2015 and roulund et al 2005 in the upstream the adverse pressure gradient induces a strong recirculation in the junction and generates the horseshoe vortex in front of the pile the mechanism further leads to strong negative shear stress as shown in fig 32 it can be seen that the horseshoe vortex is weaker as d s increases the reason is ascribed to low height of the scour protection layer zhao zhu et al 2012 and yao et al 2018 reported that the horseshoe vortex was no longer the main reason for the local scour around low height to width h d 1 structures whilst the stone protection layer in the present work has h d 0 42 on the other hand the stone protection layer is also a porous structure which could be able to weakened the horseshoe vortex as illustrated in sec 4 1 in the downstream the strong negative shear stress is induced by the opposed streamwise flow in the junction and the turbulent flow structures such as the counter rotating vortices in the wake the two legged scour hole is left as the footprint of the paring counter rotating vortices based on the observations on bed profiles as discussed in fig 30 the equilibrium scour depth s 0 of edge scour in the near field of the scour protection layer can be described by the flowing non dimensional relation of the governing parameters 19 s 0 d f θ d p d h s d p n in which θ is the shields parameter kept constant in the present tests d p d is the ratio of stone layer diameter to pile diameter h s d p is referred as the aspect ratio of the stone protection layer and n is the number of stone layers which is also regarded as h s d s by nielsen et al 2011 and petersen et al 2015 normalized by the equilibrium scour depth of the referenced case fig 33 presents the s 0 s 0 ref against d p d it can be seen that the highest scour is at d p d 1 i e no protection with increase of d p d the equilibrium scour depth decreases dramatically this is ascribed to that the increase of protection layer dimension the amplification of the bed shear stress at the perimeter decreases together with decrease of the local velocity petersen sumer et al 2015 suspected that the equilibrium scour depth is dependent on the number of stone protection layers n with minor evidence the data in the present work support petersen et al 2015 s indications as shown in fig 33 the equilibrium scour for n 2 is always smaller than their counterparts of n 1 as for the aspect ratio of the stone protection layer h s d p in fig 34 the normalized scour depth s 0 d p is observed to be increased with the increase of h s d p and the trend agrees well with yao et al 2018 s study on the low aspect ratio structures the normalized length of scour hole l s is plotted against d p d and the normalized height of the sand ridge h 0 in the wake is shown in fig 35 it should be noted that l s is the length measured from the center of the pile to the end of the scour hole fig 35 show the decreasing trend with increase of d p d which is similar to the results of fig 33 this effect corresponds to the downstream vortices as discussed above it was found that the sand ripples developed gradually around the stone protection layers and can be clearly observed after t 10min due to the live bed flow conditions applied in the present work the sand ripples would have very minor influence on the scour depth due to their small sizes it should be noted the dimensions of sand ripples on the dimensions of the scour hole is an order of magnitude larger than the counterparts in the practice and this influential parameter should be considered in the practical applications on the other hand the volume of sediments eroded around the stone protection layers is observed to be far larger than the sediments deposited in the wake i e ridges this indicates that the bed load and suspended load of sediment transport co exist during the tests the considered shields parameter in the present work is θ s 0 0336 combining with the considered range of shields parameter θ s 0 06 0 23 it is clearly that with further increase of the shields parameter the effect of the stone protection on the porous layer should be different 5 conclusion the local scour around a porous monopile in steady current has been investigated through the experimental apparatus the porous monopile is regarded as the model of a series of subsea structures by considering the influence of streamwise and transverse porosity along with the attack angle effect based on the measurement with the scour running the time history of the scour development equilibrium scour depth time scale and the scour hole profiles have been systematically studied a parametrical study on the scour protection layer for a porous monopile was also carried out the following conclusions can be drawn 1 with an increase of the porosity in the streamwise direction of the pile the scour depth is observed to decrease sharply the reduction of the equilibrium scour depth s 0 is up to 70 the increase of porosity also leads to a decrease of the local sediment transport rate the mechanism is ascribed to the weakening of the horseshoe vortex due to the presence of the porous holes and this can be validated by the weakening downflow in the velocity measurement however the porosity on the transverse direction of the pile has a limited influence on the development of the scour 2 the equilibrium scour depth varying with the porosity for the surface piercing pile fits well with the exponential equation and further supports that the porosity also weakens the velocity amplification at two side corners 3 an interesting phenomenon of the secondary scour is observed at porous plies with inclined attack angle α 30 and 45 the solid part buried in the sand bed is presented as the sediment in the junction is washed out towards the downstream which leads to a strong decrease of the porosity this observation leads to a largely increased velocity and strong turbulence in the strong side which in turn erodes more sediment for the occurrence of the secondary scour 4 for the stone protection layer for the porous pile the increase of the diameter of the stone layer is observed to significantly minimize the scour holes in the near field and the accumulated ridges in the wake the height to diameter ratio h s d p of the stone protection layer share a similar trend that the increase of h s d p comes with the increases of the equilibrium scour depth the stone layer n has a dramatic effect on the local scour larger n results in a smaller scour depth due to its strong porous feature the parameters tested in the present work are in the normal range of the practical
