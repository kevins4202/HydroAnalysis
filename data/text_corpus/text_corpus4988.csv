24940,climate and land use change constitute major threats to biodiversity beside pure habitat loss changing environmental conditions are likely to result in decreasing landscape permeability and increasing landscape fragmentation this compromises habitat connectivity and thereby increases threats to meta population persistence comprehensive theoretical knowledge and general understanding of key parameters affecting habitat connectivity are therefore mandatory to assess risks of environmental change however related studies are scarce for hemimetabolous freshwater insects which depend on both aquatic and terrestrial sites to complete their life cycle we developed a process based spatially explicit meta population model for a hemimetabolous freshwater insect parameterized based on the traits of a damselfly and analyzed the influence of varying landscape permeability on patch colonization for differently structured coextensive habitat networks the in total 675 000 networks were set up by varying 1 landscape scenarios representing different levels of permeability 2 stream networks and 3 derived habitat patch assemblages using least cost path analysis we found that habitat connectivity in general strongly determined the proportion of colonized habitat patches spearman s ρ 0 64 moreover a multi factorial anova of the parameters used for habitat network set up showed that the number of habitat patches had the largest effects on the colonization success 18 6 explained variance followed by varying proportions of three landscape types incurring increasing dispersal costs 13 1 and the spatial arrangement of habitat patches 7 1 the introduced model generated theoretical knowledge how changing environmental conditions e g landscape permeability can influence the habitat connectivity of hemimetabolous freshwater species and thus has the potential to support conservation through habitat management within changing landscapes its design facilitates future adaptation to real hemimetabolous species and real world habitats keywords dispersal environmental change habitat network landscape permeability meta population spatial ecology 1 introduction climate and land use change constitute major threats to biodiversity resulting in pure habitat loss and in decreasing landscape permeability lechner et al 2017 titeux et al 2016 vos et al 2006 and in turn in increasing landscape fragmentation hanski 2011 opdam and wascher 2004 wilson et al 2016 this situation jeopardizes the persistence of meta populations because these rely on the capability of individuals to disperse between subpopulations and to recolonize extincted patches bocedi et al 2014 moilanen and nieminen 2002 extinction risks of local subpopulations or whole meta populations therefore increase if subpopulations become unconnected and extirpated patches inaccessible chisholm et al 2011 heino et al 2017 wilson et al 2016 knowledge of spatial conditions affecting habitat connectivity didham et al 2012 purse et al 2003 saura et al 2014 consequently is fundamental for habitat management of species affected by environmental change laita et al 2011 wilson et al 2016 process based models building on theoretical understanding of ecological processes transformed into mathematical formulation can provide general insights into ecological responses to novel future environmental conditions cuddington et al 2013 evans et al 2012 petchey et al 2015 one advantage of such models as compared to statistical or rule based explanatory models based on past empirical data is the ability to forecast the effects of changing environments cuddington et al 2013 evans 2012 gustafson 2013 urban et al 2016 given that process based models rely on causal relations based on ecological theory rather than on correlations within past data sets they can facilitate general understanding of ecological processes especially under novel environmental conditions evans 2012 marquet et al 2014 accordingly process based spatially explicit meta population models are useful tools to study species dispersal hanski 1989 saura et al 2014 they can be used to quantify the theoretical importance of habitat parameters on the capacity of species to disperse between suitable habitat patches hanski 1989 urban 2005 and in turn to analyze potential risks to meta population persistence under changing environmental conditions the key habitat parameters in the context of connectivity have been identified as 1 landscape permeability 2 the spatial arrangement of habitat patches and 3 habitat patch number since those determine in combination with species specific dispersal traits the overall habitat connectivity fahrig and merriam 1994 luque et al 2012 nevertheless the relative importance of those parameters and their interactions on meta population persistence is uncertain and under discussion doerr et al 2011 hodgson et al 2011 villard and metzger 2014 over the last decades multiple meta population models have been developed however these are often site specific and largely restricted to fully terrestrial e g heino and hanski 2001 bocedi et al 2014 lakovic et al 2017 or fully freshwater species e g van den brink et al 2007 anderson and hayes 2018 i e species that complete their life cycle entirely in one ecosystem freshwater and terrestrial species differ strongly in terms of the factors that determine their dispersal and the spatial structure of their meta populations for instance the dispersal of freshwater species without terrestrial life stage is restricted to the stream network and influenced by its permeability tonkin et al 2018b the number of habitat patches and their arrangement is determined besides the general environmental suitability by the dendritic stream structure anderson and hayes 2018 eros and campbell grant 2015 tonkin et al 2018a by contrast the dispersal of most fully terrestrial species as well as the number and arrangement of their habitat patches is generally less restricted by specific spatial structures the dispersal depends mainly on the landscape permeability eros and campbell grant 2015 lechner et al 2015 2017 whereas the number and arrangement of habitat patches is mainly determined by the environmental suitability of a landscape hodgson et al 2011 purse et al 2003 insects are among the organisms that have suffered a strong decline in biomass in the last decades hallmann et al 2017 sánchez bayo and wyckhuys 2019 simmons et al 2019 however spatially explicit meta population models for hemimetabolous freshwater insects which constitute the largest group of aquatic insects are lacking this impedes our capacity to forecast how changing environmental conditions will impact these species which rely on suitable aquatic stream sites for larval development but primarily disperse and mate in the terrestrial system we developed a hypothetical process based spatially explicit meta population model for a hemimetabolous freshwater insect parameterized based on data of the european damselfly coenagrion mercuriale we simulated population dynamics and dispersal processes within multiple generic habitat networks starting with an initial configuration of fully colonized habitat patches the habitat networks were set up by varying the key habitat parameters determining habitat connectivity 1 levels of landscape permeability were simulated using artificial landscapes with different proportions and spatial configurations of four landscape types combined with 2 different arrangements and quantities of habitat patches along multiple stream network structures finally we used the habitat patch occupancy after a simulation run as an indicator of the colonization success consistent with meta population theory e g moilanen and nieminen 2002 hanski 1999 leibold et al 2004 we expected that the colonization success in our model would be strongly related to habitat connectivity furthermore we investigated the relative importance of the parameters 1 proportion and 2 configuration of landscape types determining landscape permeability as well as the 3 stream network structure the 4 habitat patch proportion and 5 arrangement on the colonization success of a hemimetabolous freshwater insect to our knowledge this is the first study combining a high number of landscape and habitat scenarios and examining their influence on population persistence in particular for hemimetabolous freshwater insects 2 material methods the core parts of the presented process based spatially explicit meta population model are the derivation of habitat networks see fig 1 a and the simulation of population dynamics and dispersal see fig 1 b 2 1 habitat networks we created multiple habitat scenarios that were set up by the following habitat parameters 1 landscape type proportions lt p and their 2 spatial configuration lt c determining landscape permeability 3 stream network structure sn s 4 proportion hp p and 5 spatial arrangement hp a of suitable aquatic habitat patches using least cost path analysis adriaensen et al 2003 these habitat scenarios were converted into habitat networks the habitat networks in total 675 000 served as input for the simulation of population dynamics and dispersal see section 2 2 see fig 1 b 2 1 1 landscape scenarios proportions and configurations of landscape types we used neutral landscape model nlm algorithms etherington et al 2015 to create multiple artificial landscapes with different levels of landscape permeability each of the produced landscape rasters had an extent of 50 km x 50 km and an initial resolution of 25 m x 25 m per pixel the artificial landscapes were set up with varying 1 proportions and 2 configurations of three initial landscape types lt incurring increasing dispersal costs lt 1 50 lt 2 75 lt 3 100 see section 2 4 1 lt 1 represents open agricultural land lt 2 forestry and lt 3 urban area to investigate the effect of increasing costs on dispersal we varied the proportion of each landscape type from 0 to 100 in steps of 25 the remaining proportion was accordingly distributed equally between the other two landscape types furthermore to determine the effect of the landscape configuration on dispersal the differing landscape type proportions were spatially distributed in three forms using the nlm algorithms random random element nearest neighbour and random cluster nearest neighbour the nlm algorithm random created landscape rasters without spatial auto correlation each pixel was independently assigned a landscape type see fig 2 the algorithm random cluster nearest neighbour created landscape rasters with unevenly sized and highly fragmented landscape type clusters etherington et al 2015 saura and martínez millán 2000 landscape rasters produced by the algorithm random element nearest neighbor consisted of irregularly shaped but evenly sized and highly aggregated landscape type clusters etherington et al 2015 to furthermore include a realistic stream network structure into the artificial landscapes we used a section of a stream network from south west germany geoportal rlp 2017 each raster pixel intersecting a stream segment was classified as lt 4 aquatic and assigned with the lowest dispersal cost value of 25 reflecting the tendency of many freshwater insects to disperse along the stream corridor hallmann et al 2017 masters et al 2007 milko et al 2012 tonkin et al 2018b however these interim artificial landscapes see fig 2 a c would be characterized by sharp edges and omit edge effects in the transition zone between different landscape types with potentially reciprocal influence of the types on each other e g modification of micro climate resource availability fahrig 2017 fischer and lindenmayer 2007 we conceptualized that adverse and beneficial edge effects resulting in in and decreased environmental stress to reduce and extend the capacity to disperse in affected areas respectively to account for edge effects in the model we resampled all rasters to a new pixel size of 100 m x 100 m see fig 2 d f using the resampling algorithm gdalwarp of the python package gdal 3 0 2 with the method average gdal ogr 2018 thereby each pixel of a resampled raster is assigned with the average cost of the 25 m x 25 m pixels of the underlying interim non resampled raster it covers finally we split each artificial landscape raster in 25 tiles of 10 km x 10 km to represent a wide range of stream network structures sn s in terms of stream segments with varying densities and configurations the resulting rasters are hereafter defined as landscape scenarios 2 1 2 habitat scenarios patch arrangement and initial source patches we assumed that only a fraction of the stream network provides suitable conditions for the modeled species suitable habitat patches within the landscape scenarios were selected based on a given proportion of 10 or 20 pixels of the landscape scenarios intersecting the corresponding sn s using three approaches random random around centers and contiguous around centers see fig 3 the approach random randomly assigned the relevant percentage of all eligible pixels as habitat patches the approach random around centers selected 5 of all eligible pixels as centers and then arranged the remaining pixels randomly within a radius of 500 m around each of these centers along the stream network the same principle was used for the approach contiguous around centers except that only 2 5 of all eligible pixels are selected as centers resulting in a more contiguous arrangement of the remaining habitat patches to provide comparable results among the different approaches we defined identical initial fully colonized source habitat patches for habitat scenarios based on equal landscape scenarios and patch shares fig 3 to decrease the variability and given our focus on landscape connectivity and related landscape variables we further assigned a constant habitat quality hq 0 625 to all habitat patches though habitat quality likely varies in heterogeneous landscapes brink et al 2013 ye et al 2013 and along streams 2 1 3 least cost path analysis dispersal of the hemimetabolous freshwater insect in our model is not restricted to the stream network it predominantly occurs overland by aerial movement tonkin et al 2018a to set up the final habitat networks for each habitat scenario we first determined all possible connections of a habitat patch x with all other patches y where x y that exhibit an euclidean distance less or equal to the maximum dispersal distance γdmax of 2500 m through open agricultural land see table 1 see section 2 4 1 second all possibly connected patches within a habitat scenario in combination with the corresponding landscape scenario served as input for the least cost path analysis galpern et al 2011 lechner et al 2017 the analysis identified the connection exhibiting the minimal dispersal cost between two connected habitat patches see fig 3 thereby the euclidean distance per connection is converted into a cost distance that also takes species specific dispersal costs per landscape scenario into account adriaensen et al 2003 lechner et al 2017 tonkin et al 2018a the resulting least cost paths indicate one likely dispersal route between two habitat patches avon and bergès 2016 and therefore were used for the dispersal simulation see section 2 2 2 to calculate the least cost paths we applied the algorithm route through array from the skimage graph package walt et al 2014 for python python core team 2018 only connections below the maximum connectivity cost threshold γcmax of 1250 cost units see table 1 were considered γcmax translates the maximum dispersal distance γdmax of 2500 m through open agricultural land to cost units 1 γ c m a x γ d m a x p w i d t c v where pwidth is the pixel width of the landscape scenarios see section 2 1 3 and cv corresponds to the dispersal costs for pixels assigned to lt 1 see section 2 1 1 2 2 simulation of population dynamics dispersal at the start of each simulation run the initially fully colonized habitat patches were sources for the colonization of non colonized connected habitat patches over the simulated timespan t see section 2 1 2 the colonization process is initiated by density dependent dispersal due to simulated population growth in colonized habitat patches corbet 1963 córdoba aguilar 2008 a mode of dispersal likely caused by strong intra specific competition murdoch and oaten 1975 we assumed that patches connected to a source with low dispersal costs are preferably colonized nouhuys et al 2002 and thus receive a higher proportion of individuals moreover we expected that the colonization success for habitat patches is directly related to the dispersal costs for a connection baguette and van dyck 2007 purse et al 2003 2 2 1 population growth for each simulated time step t the current population size nt is determined for all colonized habitat patches using a logistic growth function we use the classic verhulst model e g tsoularis and wallace 2002 to calculate nt x per habitat patch x for the present t 2 n t x n a d t 1 x k x n a d t 1 x k x n a d t 1 x e r 1 where r is the intrinsic growth rate nad t 1 x the population size adjusted by changes due to dispersal processes see section 2 2 3 at the previous time step t 1 and k x the carrying capacity of the habitat patches given that in general demography and population level fitness are strongly dependent on habitat quality hq sutherland and norris 2002 ye et al 2013 we defined the carrying capacity k x per patch according to its specific hq x 3 k x h q x a b m a x where abmax is the maximal abundance of individuals per habitat patch and hq corresponds to the hq value of habitat patch x 2 2 2 dispersal 2 2 2 1 emigration potential we assumed positive density dependent dispersal corbet 1963 córdoba aguilar 2008 which can be expected for insect species matthysen 2005 purse et al 2003 travis et al 1999 therefore the number of emigrating individuals per source habitat patch increases with abundance due e g to intra specific competition amarasekare 2004 bowler and benton 2005 heino 2013 the specific number of emigrating individuals nem t per habitat patch x is calculated as follows 4 n e m t x r d i s x n t x where nt x is the current population size and rdis x is the density dependent dispersal rate 5 r d i s x β n t x k x s 1 where s quantifies the propensity to disperse due to density and ß is the per capita emigration rate scaled by the intrinsic growth rate of the population amarasekare 2004 in case s 0 the simulated emigration rate increases with population density at an accelerating rate towards ß amarasekare 2004 2 2 2 2 dispersion of emigrants next the emigrating individuals nem t per habitat patch x disperse to all directly connected patches y that are currently not fully colonized i e nt y k y following nouhuys et al 2002 as well as purse et al 2003 habitat patches cost effective connected to a colonized patch x are more likely to be colonized hence those receive a higher fraction ft x y of nem t x per t for technical details see appendix a 1 2 2 2 3 dispersal mortality the colonization success between two habitat patches x and y is directly related to the dispersal costs c x y of the specific connection as mortality risks of dispersing individuals for damselflies e g caused by predation or traffic rouquette 2005 or energetic reserve exhaustion increase with dispersal costs baguette and van dyck 2007 córdoba aguilar 2008 rankin and burchsted 1992 hence the number of individuals nim t x y immigrating from x into y is calculated by reducing the fraction ft x y of the total number of emigrants nem t x depending on the ratio of the connectivity costs of the specific connection c x y and the maximum connectivity costs γcmax 6 n i m t x y 1 c x y γ c m a x 2 f t x y n e m t x 2 2 3 adjustment of the population size finally the population size for each habitat patch was adjusted for dispersal at the end of each time step the sum of immigrating individuals from all directly connected source habitat patches y in sinter was added to the population size nt x in the case of a source habitat patch the number of emigrated individuals nem t x was subtracted 7 n a d t x n t x y s i n t e r n i m t y x n e m t x furthermore colonized habitat patches become source habitat patches in the next time step as soon as their population exceeds a predefined threshold γshp 2 3 model application we created 10 artificial landscapes for each of the 15 landscape type proportions lt p and the three spatial compositions of the landscape types lt c to minimize bias from a specific realization in total 450 see section 2 1 1 moreover any artificial landscape was split in 25 even landscape scenarios in total 11 250 see section 2 1 1 which represent varying densities and configurations of stream network structures sn s we further used three approaches to create varying habitat patch arrangements hp a along the stream network within the landscape scenarios see section 2 1 2 again to minimize bias from individual realizations each arrangement was applied 10 times with two habitat patch proportions hp p of 10 or 20 of all aquatic pixels selected as habitat patches see section 2 1 2 overall this resulted in a total of 675 000 different habitat networks 10 x 15 lt p x 3 lt c x 25 sn s x 10 x 3 hp a 2 hp p population dynamics and dispersal were simulated for each habitat network over a timespan t of 100 reproductive periods based on varying configurations of initial fully colonized source habitat patches therefore 10 times per network a proportion of 10 of the patches was selected as initial source habitat patches see section 2 1 2 to provide comparable results among the different hp a approaches we defined identical initial source habitat patches for habitat scenarios based on equal landscape scenarios and patch proportions see fig 3 2 4 model parameterization although the presented model is in general hypothetical several model parameters were parameterized relative to traits of the european damselfly coenagrion mercuriale see table 1 2 4 1 parameterization habitat networks based on a literature review we identified a maximum dispersal distance and four main landscape types lt affecting the dispersal of coenagrion mercuriale consequently we assigned different relative levels of permeability to the landscape types aquatic open agricultural land forestry and urban area the type specific level was assessed based on previous studies and subsequently transformed to relative numeric dispersal cost values streams are identified as the most important dispersal corridors and dispersal along a watercourse is more likely than dispersal via terrestrial landscape types hence leading to a high connectivity of patches allocated along the same stream hepenstrick et al 2014 kastner et al 2015 keller et al 2013 therefore the landscape permeability for lt 4 aquatic was assumed highest and its dispersal cost was set to the lowest value of 25 frequent dispersal between populations of coenagrion mercuriale connected solely via continuous open agricultural land was found by several studies keller and holderegger 2013 keller et al 2012 hence we assumed the second highest permeability for the lt 1 open agricultural land and set its dispersal cost to 50 in contrast forest patches as well as urban areas have been identified as potential barriers and may impede dispersal of coenagrion mercuriale kastner et al 2015 keller et al 2012 watts et al 2004 in particular urban areas have been described as impermeable watts et al 2004 consequently we set the dispersal cost as 75 for lt 2 forestry and as 100 for lt 3 urban areas the maximum dispersal distance γdmax for coenagrion mercuriale implemented in the model refers specifically to dispersal through open agricultural land i e lt 1 keller et al 2012 and keller and holderegger 2013 found a good connectivity of meta populations within a radius of 1 5 2 km linked via continuous open agricultural land in addition they found evidence for overland dispersal over larger distances in rare cases accordingly we set γdmax to 2500 m to generalize the lt 1 specific maximum dispersal distance γdmax to a parameter valid for all four landscape types we converted it into the unspecific maximum connectivity cost threshold γcmax see section 2 1 3 2 4 2 parameterization simulation the maximum abundance per habitat patch abmax was set to 100 as empirical values for abundances of coenagrion mercuriale ranged from 68 3 hepenstrick et al 2012 to 211 5 individuals kastner et al 2015 per 100 m transect salcher and schiel 2015 reported abundances up to 100 individuals per 100 m transect in the region around tübingen germany the parameter intrinsic growth rate r was set to 2 as k j contze personal communication june 16 2017 stated it can be expected that habitat patches are fully colonized by european damselflies 2 3 years after an initial colonization in the absence of literature data we set the per capita emigration rate ß as well as the parameter governing density dependent dispersal s ß to 0 2 and s to a moderate positive value of 0 5 2 5 data analysis we used the final patch occupancy per habitat network as an indicator for the colonization success see fig 1 c to determine how habitat connectivity is related to the colonization success we compared the results to the ecological network connectivity measure integral index of connectivity iic although there is a big variety of graph theoretic connectivity measures laita et al 2011 we selected the iic as it is based on shortest paths and provides reliable information on the degree of connectivity between patches laita et al 2011 pascual hortal and saura 2006 it is a graph based index measuring habitat connectivity in terms of the probability that two randomly selected habitat patches x and y are directly or indirectly connected lechner et al 2017 the iic is calculated as follows 8 i i c x 1 n y 1 n a h p x a h p y 1 n l x y a l 2 where ahp is the area of each habitat patch here one raster pixel 0 01 km² and nlxy is the number of links per connection topological distance between connected patches x and y al is the total landscape area in the context of the present study we define al as the total area of sustainable aquatic habitat patches or rather raster pixels per landscape scenario intersecting a habitat patch see section 2 1 2 the iic ranges from 0 to 1 and increases with improved connectivity for details see pascual hortal and saura 2006 to investigate the relative importance of the habitat parameters 1 landscape type proportions lt p 2 landscape type configuration lt c 3 stream network structure sn s 4 habitat patch proportion hp p and 5 habitat patch arrangements hp a as well as their two way interactions we used eta squared η2 lakens 2013 as a measure of effect size derived from analysis of variance anova with f test the calculations of the anova and the η2 were done in r version 3 5 1 r core team 2018 using the package sjstats for η2 lüdecke 2018 3 results discussion 3 1 habitat connectivity our analysis based on the iic values indicated that colonization success of the modeled species is strongly influenced by habitat connectivity the percentage of colonized suitable habitat patches increased with decreasing iic values see fig 4 the positive relationship spearman s ρ 0 64 p 0 001 between the iic and the proportion of colonized habitat patches matches our expectation see fig 4 in addition the result is in agreement with ecological theory e g moilanen and nieminen 2002 baguette and van dyck 2007 chisholm et al 2011 matisziw and murray 2009 which states that habitat connectivity generally determines colonization probability the relatively high variability in the results see fig 4 may be explained by the high number of habitat networks produced resulting in different arrangements of habitat patches and source habitat patches for similar overall dispersal costs per habitat scenario the least cost path analysis was based on habitat networks with low iic values typically consisted of multiple non connected clusters of habitat patches in case each cluster contained an initial source habitat patch the colonization rate was likely high although no dispersal between these clusters occurred conversely the majority of habitat patches could be highly connected in one to very few clusters containing all initial source patches therefore the remaining patches were not connected to a source patch resulting in comparably low colonization rates furthermore the iic ignores the dispersal costs per connection laita et al 2011 thus a high connectivity of habitat patch clusters may not correspond to a high colonization rate over t due to high dispersal costs and related mortality in the case of an unsuitable distribution of source habitat patches this effect conforms to the known limitation of the iic due to the oversimplified binary representation of connections laita et al 2011 saura and pascual hortal 2007 3 2 importance of parameters the evaluation of individual effects and the two way interactions of the habitat parameters see table 2 showed that the proportion of habitat patches hp p had the strongest effect on the colonization success followed by landscape type proportions lt p habitat patch arrangement hp a and stream segment structure sn s the landscape type configuration lt c explained only a negligible proportion of the variance furthermore the explanatory power of the two way interaction effects was low 3 2 1 landscape permeability the results indicated that decreasing average dispersal costs per habitat scenario led to increasing colonization success see fig 5 the lt p one of two habitat parameters determining landscape permeability explained the second highest proportion 13 1 of the variance in the colonization success this suggests that the varying landscape permeability of the artificial landscape scenarios resulting from different proportions of the four landscape types see section 2 1 1 strongly affects the dispersal of hemimetabolous freshwater species the general relevance of landscape permeability for animal dispersal and population dynamics has been widely recognized in terrestrial ecology pinto and keitt 2009 zeller et al 2012 with decreasing landscape permeability mortality rates during dispersal between habitat patches increase strien et al 2016 in the worst case connections disappear baguette and van dyck 2007 king and with 2002 resulting in lower habitat connectivity and in turn lower colonization success comparable effects of landscape permeability on dispersal can be expected for aquatic species which primarily disperse overland smith et al 2009 tonkin et al 2018a however even though previous studies showed that species rather disperse through homogeneous areas with low costs than through heterogeneous areas with variable costs king and with 2002 ricketts 2001 the explanatory power of lt c the other parameter determining landscape permeability was low 0 2 although the graphical analysis see fig 5 showed minor differences between the three nlm algorithms used 3 2 2 stream network in our study the stream network structure sn s explained 6 1 of the variance the number of pixels per 10 km x 10 km landscape tile intersecting a sn s correlated positively with the percentage of colonized habitat patches see fig 5 higher habitat patch densities generally produced better connected habitat networks and we expect that the resultant enhanced connectivity of habitat networks explained a significant proportion of the variance explained by the sn s however the influence of the sn s on the connectivity certainly depends on further parameters such as the geometry of the network e g number and spatial arrangement of branches in general stream networks exhibit a dendritic spatial structure and the dispersal of hemimetabolous species is necessarily influenced by the individual network structure brown et al 2011 tonkin et al 2018a b furthermore the strength of the influence of the spatial network structure on the habitat connectivity depends on dispersal potential keitt et al 1997 tonkin et al 2018a where strong aerial dispersers are less influenced than poor dispersers tonkin et al 2018a future studies should therefore further examine the influence of the sn s to precisely analyze how e g dispersal traits and network structure but also habitat quality and potential variability of streams e g due to droughts influence the colonization particularly since spatial stream network structures but also the stability of stream habitats can vary widely in time and between different geological and climatic regions frissell et al 1986 3 2 3 habitat patches proportion arrangement the results further showed that doubling the hp p per stream network had the strongest effect on the colonization success accounting for 18 6 of the variance since we run only two levels 10 and 20 of hp p no conclusion regarding the general relationship between hp p and the habitat connectivity as well as the resulting colonization success can be drawn however generally an increase of patches within a habitat leading to higher patch density results in enhanced connectivity of habitat networks hanski 1999 villard and metzger 2014 due to generally shorter distances between patches first dense networks possess more pairwise direct connections per patch and thus more indirect connections between habitat patches via intermediate patches laita et al 2011 minor and urban 2008 second within dense networks the costs per connection are generally lower consequently decreasing landscape permeability less likely results in the loss of direct connections and moreover the loss of direct connections can be compensated over time by indirect connections the habitat patch arrangement hp a accounted for 7 1 of the variance the graphical analysis furthermore showed that the hp a approach random resulted in clearly higher colonization success compared to the two other approaches see fig 5 which both led to more clustered hp a the arrangement of patches generally determines under otherwise identical conditions the connectivity of habitats chisholm et al 2011 laita et al 2011 villard and metzger 2014 randomly or rather variously arranged habitat patches create more indirect connections within a network anderson and hayes 2018 baguette and van dyck 2007 whereas clustered habitat patch arrangements lead to more cost effective connections within the clusters but the clusters often remain unconnected anderson and hayes 2018 hodgson et al 2011 the presented results indicate that those generally positive effects of variously arranged patches on the colonization also apply to variously randomly arranged patches along streams although given the dendritic stream structure the patch arrangement is much more predetermined in any instance 3 2 4 two way interactions the explanatory power of all two way interaction effects was low equal or less than 3 5 table 2 the three strongest interaction effects all involved hp p hp p and lt p 3 5 hp p and sn s 1 9 hp p as well as hp a 0 9 the effect of decreasing landscape permeability primarily caused by the lt p on the colonization success was less pronounced for habitat networks with a high potential connectivity resulting from comparably dense networks with a high hp p we assume losses of direct connections because of exceeding the maximal connectivity costs can often be compensated by indirect connections accordingly the hp p and the sn s interacted comparably strongly as the patch number per habitat scenario was directly related to stream network density furthermore networks with a random hp a were less affected by decreasing landscape permeability compared to the other arrangements this can be explained by randomly arranged patches resulting in more indirect connections making networks less sensitive against the loss of direct connections colonization success was differently affected by the other arrangements random around centers and contiguous around centers depending on the respective sn s 3 2 5 unexplained variance the five habitat parameters including their two way interactions explained 53 4 of the variance in the colonization success the remaining variance can largely be explained by the stochastic variability of the habitat networks the random distribution of initial source habitat patches within the networks as well as the 10 random habitat networks set up for each patch arrangement approach and patch proportion per habitat scenario likely were responsible for a relevant proportion of the unexplained variance moreover higher level interactions may explain additional albeit likely a low proportion of the remaining variance 3 3 model parameters and omission of processes the development of process based spatially explicit meta population models is complicated by factors such as the degree of abstraction and the relatively complex analyses and interpretation required the necessity to control the complexity of the model structure and to approximate parameter values based on literature references lead to simulation results that are difficult to verify for specific real world species forbes et al 2008 hanski 1994 saura et al 2014 in this context several parameters used in setting up the habitat networks and the simulation represented estimates e g cost values of landscape types in the absence of precise values which affects the results see section 2 4 moreover we did not consider the potential effects of 1 isolation such as reduction of genetic variability hanski 1989 watts et al 2006 and 2 deferred costs of dispersal both of which can compromise meta population viability baguette and van dyck 2007 burgess et al 2012 we further omitted potential negative impacts of high connectivity on population viability such as the effects of diseases that may spread rapidly in highly connected habitats minor and urban 2008 however such aspects could relatively easily be incorporated into the current process based model and parameter estimates could be updated in the light of new knowledge or to reflect the traits of a different model species cuddington et al 2013 we conclude that the presented model has the potential to generate at a minimum theoretical knowledge and general understanding how changing environmental conditions influence the habitat connectivity of hemimetabolous freshwater species under varying scenarios 4 conclusion the results indicate that habitat connectivity for hemimetabolous freshwater species is strongly determined by similar parameters affecting terrestrial habitat connectivity comparable with terrestrial species the number and arrangement of habitat patches as well as the permeability of the surrounding landscape largely determine the colonization success hanski 1989 hodgson et al 2011 lechner et al 2017 here it is especially noteworthy that high potential network connectivity primarily resulting from a high number of patches had a relevant positive effect on the resilience of habitat networks to decreasing landscape permeability nevertheless the modeled colonization is considerably regulated by the spatial structuring of the stream network the persistence of species threatened by environmental change will strongly depend on the preservation of habitat connectivity and therefore on habitat management on landscape scales hanski 1989 hodgson et al 2011 lechner et al 2017 watts et al 2006 to preserve or improve habitat connectivity management for hemimetabolous freshwater species must in addition to the protection and improvement of the single patches focus on the habitat as a whole hassall and thompson 2012 sarremejane et al 2017 thereby management measures should particularly focus as presented above on patch density and landscape permeability process based models can generally improve effective habitat management cuddington et al 2013 evans 2012 jacoby and freeman 2016 petchey et al 2015 saura et al 2014 for example a simplified version of our model revealed information on the minimum time required to colonize habitat patches added to an existing network heer et al 2019 the presented model has the potential to be parameterized with species specific traits and in combination with real world landscapes streams and habitat patch assemblages may serve for instance to support future site specific habitat management planning moreover it can be adopted in future studies to simulate how singular and periodic e g resulting of

24940,climate and land use change constitute major threats to biodiversity beside pure habitat loss changing environmental conditions are likely to result in decreasing landscape permeability and increasing landscape fragmentation this compromises habitat connectivity and thereby increases threats to meta population persistence comprehensive theoretical knowledge and general understanding of key parameters affecting habitat connectivity are therefore mandatory to assess risks of environmental change however related studies are scarce for hemimetabolous freshwater insects which depend on both aquatic and terrestrial sites to complete their life cycle we developed a process based spatially explicit meta population model for a hemimetabolous freshwater insect parameterized based on the traits of a damselfly and analyzed the influence of varying landscape permeability on patch colonization for differently structured coextensive habitat networks the in total 675 000 networks were set up by varying 1 landscape scenarios representing different levels of permeability 2 stream networks and 3 derived habitat patch assemblages using least cost path analysis we found that habitat connectivity in general strongly determined the proportion of colonized habitat patches spearman s ρ 0 64 moreover a multi factorial anova of the parameters used for habitat network set up showed that the number of habitat patches had the largest effects on the colonization success 18 6 explained variance followed by varying proportions of three landscape types incurring increasing dispersal costs

change constitute major threats to biodiversity resulting in pure habitat loss and in decreasing landscape permeability lechner et al 2017 titeux et al 2016 vos et al 2006 and in turn in increasing landscape fragmentation hanski 2011 opdam and wascher 2004 wilson et al 2016 this situation jeopardizes the persistence of meta populations because these rely on the capability of individuals to disperse between subpopulations and to recolonize extincted patches bocedi et al 2014 moilanen and nieminen 2002 extinction risks of local subpopulations or whole meta populations therefore increase if subpopulations become unconnected and extirpated patches inaccessible chisholm et al 2011 heino et al 2017 wilson et al 2016 knowledge of spatial conditions affecting habitat connectivity didham et al 2012 purse et al 2003 saura et al 2014 consequently is fundamental for habitat management of species affected by environmental change laita et al 2011 wilson et al 2016 process based models building on theoretical understanding of ecological processes transformed into mathematical formulation can provide general insights into ecological responses to novel future environmental conditions cuddington et al 2013 evans et al 2012 petchey et al 2015 one advantage of such models as compared to statistical or rule based explanatory models based on past empirical data is the ability to forecast the effects of changing environments cuddington et al 2013 evans 2012 gustafson 2013 urban et al 2016 given that process based models rely on causal relations based on ecological theory rather than on correlations within past data sets they can facilitate general understanding of ecological processes especially under novel environmental conditions evans 2012 marquet et al 2014 accordingly process based spatially explicit meta population models are useful tools to study species dispersal hanski 1989 saura et al 2014 they can be used to quantify the theoretical importance of habitat parameters on the capacity of species to disperse between suitable habitat patches hanski 1989 urban 2005 and in turn to analyze potential risks to meta population persistence under changing environmental conditions the key habitat parameters in the context of connectivity have been identified as 1 landscape permeability 2 the spatial arrangement of habitat patches and 3 habitat patch number since those determine in combination with species specific dispersal traits the overall habitat connectivity fahrig and merriam 1994 luque et al 2012 nevertheless the relative importance of those parameters and their interactions on meta population persistence is uncertain and under discussion doerr et al 2011 hodgson et al 2011 villard and metzger 2014 over the last decades multiple meta population models have been developed however these are often site specific and largely restricted to fully terrestrial e g heino and hanski 2001 bocedi et al 2014 lakovic et al 2017 or fully freshwater species e g van den brink et al 2007 anderson and hayes 2018 i e species that complete their life cycle entirely in one ecosystem freshwater and terrestrial species differ strongly in terms of the factors that determine their dispersal and the spatial structure of their meta populations for instance the dispersal of freshwater species without terrestrial life stage is restricted to the stream network and influenced by its permeability tonkin et al 2018b the number of habitat patches and their arrangement is determined besides the general environmental suitability by the dendritic stream structure anderson and hayes 2018 eros and campbell grant 2015 tonkin et al 2018a by contrast the dispersal of most fully terrestrial species as well as the number and arrangement of their habitat patches is generally less restricted by specific spatial structures the dispersal depends mainly on the landscape permeability eros and campbell grant 2015 lechner et al 2015 2017 whereas the number and arrangement of habitat patches is mainly determined by the environmental suitability of a landscape hodgson et al 2011 purse et al 2003 insects are among the organisms that have suffered a strong decline in biomass in the last decades hallmann et al 2017 sánchez bayo and wyckhuys 2019 simmons et al 2019 however spatially explicit meta population models for hemimetabolous freshwater insects which constitute the largest group of aquatic insects are lacking this impedes our capacity to forecast how changing environmental conditions will impact these species which rely on suitable aquatic stream sites for larval development but primarily disperse and mate in the terrestrial system we developed a hypothetical process based spatially explicit meta population model for a hemimetabolous freshwater insect parameterized based on data of the european damselfly coenagrion mercuriale we simulated population dynamics and dispersal processes within multiple generic habitat networks starting with an initial configuration of fully colonized habitat patches the habitat networks were set up by varying the key habitat parameters determining habitat connectivity 1 levels of landscape permeability were simulated using artificial landscapes with different proportions and spatial configurations of four landscape types combined with 2 different arrangements and quantities of habitat patches along multiple stream network structures finally we used the habitat patch occupancy after a simulation run as an indicator of the colonization success consistent with meta population theory e g moilanen and nieminen 2002 hanski 1999 leibold et al 2004 we expected that the colonization success in our model would be strongly related to habitat connectivity furthermore we investigated the relative importance of the parameters 1 proportion and 2 configuration of landscape types determining landscape permeability as well as the 3 stream network structure the 4 habitat patch proportion and 5 arrangement on the colonization success of a hemimetabolous freshwater insect to our knowledge this is the first study combining a high number of landscape and habitat scenarios and examining their influence on population persistence in particular for hemimetabolous freshwater insects 2 material methods the core parts of the presented process based spatially explicit meta population model are the derivation of habitat networks see fig 1 a and the simulation of population dynamics and dispersal see fig 1 b 2 1 habitat networks we created multiple habitat scenarios that were set up by the following habitat parameters 1 landscape type proportions lt p and their 2 spatial configuration lt c determining landscape permeability 3 stream network structure sn s 4 proportion hp p and 5 spatial arrangement hp a of suitable aquatic habitat patches using least cost path analysis adriaensen et al 2003 these habitat scenarios were converted into habitat networks the habitat networks in total 675 000 served as input for the simulation of population dynamics and dispersal see section 2 2 see fig 1 b 2 1 1 landscape scenarios proportions and configurations of landscape types we used neutral landscape model nlm algorithms etherington et al 2015 to create multiple artificial landscapes with different levels of landscape permeability each of the produced landscape rasters had an extent of 50 km x 50 km and an initial resolution of 25 m x 25 m per pixel the artificial landscapes were set up with varying 1 proportions and 2 configurations of three initial landscape types lt incurring increasing dispersal costs lt 1 50 lt 2 75 lt 3 100 see section 2 4 1 lt 1 represents open agricultural land lt 2 forestry and lt 3 urban area to investigate the effect of increasing costs on dispersal we varied the proportion of each landscape type from 0 to 100 in steps of 25 the remaining proportion was accordingly distributed equally between the other two landscape types furthermore to determine the effect of the landscape configuration on dispersal the differing landscape type proportions were spatially distributed in three forms using the nlm algorithms random random element nearest neighbour and random cluster nearest neighbour the nlm algorithm random created landscape rasters without spatial auto correlation each pixel was independently assigned a landscape type see fig 2 the algorithm random cluster nearest neighbour created landscape rasters with unevenly sized and highly fragmented landscape type clusters etherington et al 2015 saura and martínez millán 2000 landscape rasters produced by the algorithm random element nearest neighbor consisted of irregularly shaped but evenly sized and highly aggregated landscape type clusters etherington et al 2015 to furthermore include a realistic stream network structure into the artificial landscapes we used a section of a stream network from south west germany geoportal rlp 2017 each raster pixel intersecting a stream segment was classified as lt 4 aquatic and assigned with the lowest dispersal cost value of 25 reflecting the tendency of many freshwater insects to disperse along the stream corridor hallmann et al 2017 masters et al 2007 milko et al 2012 tonkin et al 2018b however these interim artificial landscapes see fig 2 a c would be characterized by sharp edges and omit edge effects in the transition zone between different landscape types with potentially reciprocal influence of the types on each other e g modification of micro climate resource availability fahrig 2017 fischer and lindenmayer 2007 we conceptualized that adverse and beneficial edge effects resulting in in and decreased environmental stress to reduce and extend the capacity to disperse in affected areas respectively to account for edge effects in the model we resampled all rasters to a new pixel size of 100 m x 100 m see fig 2 d f using the resampling algorithm gdalwarp of the python package gdal 3 0 2 with the method average gdal ogr 2018 thereby each pixel of a resampled raster is assigned with the average cost of the 25 m x 25 m pixels of the underlying interim non resampled raster it covers finally we split each artificial landscape raster in 25 tiles of 10 km x 10 km to represent a wide range of stream network structures sn s in terms of stream segments with varying densities and configurations the resulting rasters are hereafter defined as landscape scenarios 2 1 2 habitat scenarios patch arrangement and initial source patches we assumed that only a fraction of the stream network provides suitable conditions for the modeled species suitable habitat patches within the landscape scenarios were selected based on a given proportion of 10 or 20 pixels of the landscape scenarios intersecting the corresponding sn s using three approaches random random around centers and contiguous around centers see fig 3 the approach random randomly assigned the relevant percentage of all eligible pixels as habitat patches the approach random around centers selected 5 of all eligible pixels as centers and then arranged the remaining pixels randomly within a radius of 500 m around each of these centers along the stream network the same principle was used for the approach contiguous around centers except that only 2 5 of all eligible pixels are selected as centers resulting in a more contiguous arrangement of the remaining habitat patches to provide comparable results among the different approaches we defined identical initial fully colonized source habitat patches for habitat scenarios based on equal landscape scenarios and patch shares fig 3 to decrease the variability and given our focus on landscape connectivity and related landscape variables we further assigned a constant habitat quality hq 0 625 to all habitat patches though habitat quality likely varies in heterogeneous landscapes brink et al 2013 ye et al 2013 and along streams 2 1 3 least cost path analysis dispersal of the hemimetabolous freshwater insect in our model is not restricted to the stream network it predominantly occurs overland by aerial movement tonkin et al 2018a to set up the final habitat networks for each habitat scenario we first determined all possible connections of a habitat patch x with all other patches y where x y that exhibit an euclidean distance less or equal to the maximum dispersal distance γdmax of 2500 m through open agricultural land see table 1 see section 2 4 1 second all possibly connected patches within a habitat scenario in combination with the corresponding landscape scenario served as input for the least cost path analysis galpern et al 2011 lechner et al 2017 the analysis identified the connection exhibiting the minimal dispersal cost between two connected habitat patches see fig 3 thereby the euclidean distance per connection is converted into a cost distance that also takes species specific dispersal costs per landscape scenario into account adriaensen et al 2003 lechner et al 2017 tonkin et al 2018a the resulting least cost paths indicate one likely dispersal route between two habitat patches avon and bergès 2016 and therefore were used for the dispersal simulation see section 2 2 2 to calculate the least cost paths we applied the algorithm route through array from the skimage graph package walt et al 2014 for python python core team 2018 only connections below the maximum connectivity cost threshold γcmax of 1250 cost units see table 1 were considered γcmax translates the maximum dispersal distance γdmax of 2500 m through open agricultural land to cost units 1 γ c m a x γ d m a x p w i d t c v where pwidth is the pixel width of the landscape scenarios see section 2 1 3 and cv corresponds to the dispersal costs for pixels assigned to lt 1 see section 2 1 1 2 2 simulation of population dynamics dispersal at the start of each simulation run the initially fully colonized habitat patches were sources for the colonization of non colonized connected habitat patches over the simulated timespan t see section 2 1 2 the colonization process is initiated by density dependent dispersal due to simulated population growth in colonized habitat patches corbet 1963 córdoba aguilar 2008 a mode of dispersal likely caused by strong intra specific competition murdoch and oaten 1975 we assumed that patches connected to a source with low dispersal costs are preferably colonized nouhuys et al 2002 and thus receive a higher proportion of individuals moreover we expected that the colonization success for habitat patches is directly related to the dispersal costs for a connection baguette and van dyck 2007 purse et al 2003 2 2 1 population growth for each simulated time step t the current population size nt is determined for all colonized habitat patches using a logistic growth function we use the classic verhulst model e g tsoularis and wallace 2002 to calculate nt x per habitat patch x for the present t 2 n t x n a d t 1 x k x n a d t 1 x k x n a d t 1 x e r 1 where r is the intrinsic growth rate nad t 1 x the population size adjusted by changes due to dispersal processes see section 2 2 3 at the previous time step t 1 and k x the carrying capacity of the habitat patches given that in general demography and population level fitness are strongly dependent on habitat quality hq sutherland and norris 2002 ye et al 2013 we defined the carrying capacity k x per patch according to its specific hq x 3 k x h q x a b m a x where abmax is the maximal abundance of individuals per habitat patch and hq corresponds to the hq value of habitat patch x 2 2 2 dispersal 2 2 2 1 emigration potential we assumed positive density dependent dispersal corbet 1963 córdoba aguilar 2008 which can be expected for insect species matthysen 2005 purse et al 2003 travis et al 1999 therefore the number of emigrating individuals per source habitat patch increases with abundance due e g to intra specific competition amarasekare 2004 bowler and benton 2005 heino 2013 the specific number of emigrating individuals nem t per habitat patch x is calculated as follows 4 n e m t x r d i s x n t x where nt x is the current population size and rdis x is the density dependent dispersal rate 5 r d i s x β n t x k x s 1 where s quantifies the propensity to disperse due to density and ß is the per capita emigration rate scaled by the intrinsic growth rate of the population amarasekare 2004 in case s 0 the simulated emigration rate increases with population density at an accelerating rate towards ß amarasekare 2004 2 2 2 2 dispersion of emigrants next the emigrating individuals nem t per habitat patch x disperse to all directly connected patches y that are currently not fully colonized i e nt y k y following nouhuys et al 2002 as well as purse et al 2003 habitat patches cost effective connected to a colonized patch x are more likely to be colonized hence those receive a higher fraction ft x y of nem t x per t for technical details see appendix a 1 2 2 2 3 dispersal mortality the colonization success between two habitat patches x and y is directly related to the dispersal costs c x y of the specific connection as mortality risks of dispersing individuals for damselflies e g caused by predation or traffic rouquette 2005 or energetic reserve exhaustion increase with dispersal costs baguette and van dyck 2007 córdoba aguilar 2008 rankin and burchsted 1992 hence the number of individuals nim t x y immigrating from x into y is calculated by reducing the fraction ft x y of the total number of emigrants nem t x depending on the ratio of the connectivity costs of the specific connection c x y and the maximum connectivity costs γcmax 6 n i m t x y 1 c x y γ c m a x 2 f t x y n e m t x 2 2 3 adjustment of the population size finally the population size for each habitat patch was adjusted for dispersal at the end of each time step the sum of immigrating individuals from all directly connected source habitat patches y in sinter was added to the population size nt x in the case of a source habitat patch the number of emigrated individuals nem t x was subtracted 7 n a d t x n t x y s i n t e r n i m t y x n e m t x furthermore colonized habitat patches become source habitat patches in the next time step as soon as their population exceeds a predefined threshold γshp 2 3 model application we created 10 artificial landscapes for each of the 15 landscape type proportions lt p and the three spatial compositions of the landscape types lt c to minimize bias from a specific realization in total 450 see section 2 1 1 moreover any artificial landscape was split in 25 even landscape scenarios in total 11 250 see section 2 1 1 which represent varying densities and configurations of stream network structures sn s we further used three approaches to create varying habitat patch arrangements hp a along the stream network within the landscape scenarios see section 2 1 2 again to minimize bias from individual realizations each arrangement was applied 10 times with two habitat patch proportions hp p of 10 or 20 of all aquatic pixels selected as habitat patches see section 2 1 2 overall this resulted in a total of 675 000 different habitat networks 10 x 15 lt p x 3 lt c x 25 sn s x 10 x 3 hp a 2 hp p population dynamics and dispersal were simulated for each habitat network over a timespan t of 100 reproductive periods based on varying configurations of initial fully colonized source habitat patches therefore 10 times per network a proportion of 10 of the patches was selected as initial source habitat patches see section 2 1 2 to provide comparable results among the different hp a approaches we defined identical initial source habitat patches for habitat scenarios based on equal landscape scenarios and patch proportions see fig 3 2 4 model parameterization although the presented model is in general hypothetical several model parameters were parameterized relative to traits of the european damselfly coenagrion mercuriale see table 1 2 4 1 parameterization habitat networks based on a literature review we identified a maximum dispersal distance and four main landscape types lt affecting the dispersal of coenagrion mercuriale consequently we assigned different relative levels of permeability to the landscape types aquatic open agricultural land forestry and urban area the type specific level was assessed based on previous studies and subsequently transformed to relative numeric dispersal cost values streams are identified as the most important dispersal corridors and dispersal along a watercourse is more likely than dispersal via terrestrial landscape types hence leading to a high connectivity of patches allocated along the same stream hepenstrick et al 2014 kastner et al 2015 keller et al 2013 therefore the landscape permeability for lt 4 aquatic was assumed highest and its dispersal cost was set to the lowest value of 25 frequent dispersal between populations of coenagrion mercuriale connected solely via continuous open agricultural land was found by several studies keller and holderegger 2013 keller et al 2012 hence we assumed the second highest permeability for the lt 1 open agricultural land and set its dispersal cost to 50 in contrast forest patches as well as urban areas have been identified as potential barriers and may impede dispersal of coenagrion mercuriale kastner et al 2015 keller et al 2012 watts et al 2004 in particular urban areas have been described as impermeable watts et al 2004 consequently we set the dispersal cost as 75 for lt 2 forestry and as 100 for lt 3 urban areas the maximum dispersal distance γdmax for coenagrion mercuriale implemented in the model refers specifically to dispersal through open agricultural land i e lt 1 keller et al 2012 and keller and holderegger 2013 found a good connectivity of meta populations within a radius of 1 5 2 km linked via continuous open agricultural land in addition they found evidence for overland dispersal over larger distances in rare cases accordingly we set γdmax to 2500 m to generalize the lt 1 specific maximum dispersal distance γdmax to a parameter valid for all four landscape types we converted it into the unspecific maximum connectivity cost threshold γcmax see section 2 1 3 2 4 2 parameterization simulation the maximum abundance per habitat patch abmax was set to 100 as empirical values for abundances of coenagrion mercuriale ranged from 68 3 hepenstrick et al 2012 to 211 5 individuals kastner et al 2015 per 100 m transect salcher and schiel 2015 reported abundances up to 100 individuals per 100 m transect in the region around tübingen germany the parameter intrinsic growth rate r was set to 2 as k j contze personal communication june 16 2017 stated it can be expected that habitat patches are fully colonized by european damselflies 2 3 years after an initial colonization in the absence of literature data we set the per capita emigration rate ß as well as the parameter governing density dependent dispersal s ß to 0 2 and s to a moderate positive value of 0 5 2 5 data analysis we used the final patch occupancy per habitat network as an indicator for the colonization success see fig 1 c to determine how habitat connectivity is related to the colonization success we compared the results to the ecological network connectivity measure integral index of connectivity iic although there is a big variety of graph theoretic connectivity measures laita et al 2011 we selected the iic as it is based on shortest paths and provides reliable information on the degree of connectivity between patches laita et al 2011 pascual hortal and saura 2006 it is a graph based index measuring habitat connectivity in terms of the probability that two randomly selected habitat patches x and y are directly or indirectly connected lechner et al 2017 the iic is calculated as follows 8 i i c x 1 n y 1 n a h p x a h p y 1 n l x y a l 2 where ahp is the area of each habitat patch here one raster pixel 0 01 km² and nlxy is the number of links per connection topological distance between connected patches x and y al is the total landscape area in the context of the present study we define al as the total area of sustainable aquatic habitat patches or rather raster pixels per landscape scenario intersecting a habitat patch see section 2 1 2 the iic ranges from 0 to 1 and increases with improved connectivity for details see pascual hortal and saura 2006 to investigate the relative importance of the habitat parameters 1 landscape type proportions lt p 2 landscape type configuration lt c 3 stream network structure sn s 4 habitat patch proportion hp p and 5 habitat patch arrangements hp a as well as their two way interactions we used eta squared η2 lakens 2013 as a measure of effect size derived from analysis of variance anova with f test the calculations of the anova and the η2 were done in r version 3 5 1 r core team 2018 using the package sjstats for η2 lüdecke 2018 3 results discussion 3 1 habitat connectivity our analysis based on the iic values indicated that colonization success of the modeled species is strongly influenced by habitat connectivity the percentage of colonized suitable habitat patches increased with decreasing iic values see fig 4 the positive relationship spearman s ρ 0 64 p 0 001 between the iic and the proportion of colonized habitat patches matches our expectation see fig 4 in addition the result is in agreement with ecological theory e g moilanen and nieminen 2002 baguette and van dyck 2007 chisholm et al 2011 matisziw and murray 2009 which states that habitat connectivity generally determines colonization probability the relatively high variability in the results see fig 4 may be explained by the high number of habitat networks produced resulting in different arrangements of habitat patches and source habitat patches for similar overall dispersal costs per habitat scenario the least cost path analysis was based on habitat networks with low iic values typically consisted of multiple non connected clusters of habitat patches in case each cluster contained an initial source habitat patch the colonization rate was likely high although no dispersal between these clusters occurred conversely the majority of habitat patches could be highly connected in one to very few clusters containing all initial source patches therefore the remaining patches were not connected to a source patch resulting in comparably low colonization rates furthermore the iic ignores the dispersal costs per connection laita et al 2011 thus a high connectivity of habitat patch clusters may not correspond to a high colonization rate over t due to high dispersal costs and related mortality in the case of an unsuitable distribution of source habitat patches this effect conforms to the known limitation of the iic due to the oversimplified binary representation of connections laita et al 2011 saura and pascual hortal 2007 3 2 importance of parameters the evaluation of individual effects and the two way interactions of the habitat parameters see table 2 showed that the proportion of habitat patches hp p had the strongest effect on the colonization success followed by landscape type proportions lt p habitat patch arrangement hp a and stream segment structure sn s the landscape type configuration lt c explained only a negligible proportion of the variance furthermore the explanatory power of the two way interaction effects was low 3 2 1 landscape permeability the results indicated that decreasing average dispersal costs per habitat scenario led to increasing colonization success see fig 5 the lt p one of two habitat parameters determining landscape permeability explained the second highest proportion 13 1 of the variance in the colonization success this suggests that the varying landscape permeability of the artificial landscape scenarios resulting from different proportions of the four landscape types see section 2 1 1 strongly affects the dispersal of hemimetabolous freshwater species the general relevance of landscape permeability for animal dispersal and population dynamics has been widely recognized in terrestrial ecology pinto and keitt 2009 zeller et al 2012 with decreasing landscape permeability mortality rates during dispersal between habitat patches increase strien et al 2016 in the worst case connections disappear baguette and van dyck 2007 king and with 2002 resulting in lower habitat connectivity and in turn lower colonization success comparable effects of landscape permeability on dispersal can be expected for aquatic species which primarily disperse overland smith et al 2009 tonkin et al 2018a however even though previous studies showed that species rather disperse through homogeneous areas with low costs than through heterogeneous areas with variable costs king and with 2002 ricketts 2001 the explanatory power of lt c the other parameter determining landscape permeability was low 0 2 although the graphical analysis see fig 5 showed minor differences between the three nlm algorithms used 3 2 2 stream network in our study the stream network structure sn s explained 6 1 of the variance the number of pixels per 10 km x 10 km landscape tile intersecting a sn s correlated positively with the percentage of colonized habitat patches see fig 5 higher habitat patch densities generally produced better connected habitat networks and we expect that the resultant enhanced connectivity of habitat networks explained a significant proportion of the variance explained by the sn s however the influence of the sn s on the connectivity certainly depends on further parameters such as the geometry of the network e g number and spatial arrangement of branches in general stream networks exhibit a dendritic spatial structure and the dispersal of hemimetabolous species is necessarily influenced by the individual network structure brown et al 2011 tonkin et al 2018a b furthermore the strength of the influence of the spatial network structure on the habitat connectivity depends on dispersal potential keitt et al 1997 tonkin et al 2018a where strong aerial dispersers are less influenced than poor dispersers tonkin et al 2018a future studies should therefore further examine the influence of the sn s to precisely analyze how e g dispersal traits and network structure but also habitat quality and potential variability of streams e g due to droughts influence the colonization particularly since spatial stream network structures but also the stability of stream habitats can vary widely in time and between different geological and climatic regions frissell et al 1986 3 2 3 habitat patches proportion arrangement the results further showed that doubling the hp p per stream network had the strongest effect on the colonization success accounting for 18 6 of the variance since we run only two levels 10 and 20 of hp p no conclusion regarding the general relationship between hp p and the habitat connectivity as well as the resulting colonization success can be drawn however generally an increase of patches within a habitat leading to higher patch density results in enhanced connectivity of habitat networks hanski 1999 villard and metzger 2014 due to generally shorter distances between patches first dense networks possess more pairwise direct connections per patch and thus more indirect connections between habitat patches via intermediate patches laita et al 2011 minor and urban 2008 second within dense networks the costs per connection are generally lower consequently decreasing landscape permeability less likely results in the loss of direct connections and moreover the loss of direct connections can be compensated over time by indirect connections the habitat patch arrangement hp a accounted for 7 1 of the variance the graphical analysis furthermore showed that the hp a approach random resulted in clearly higher colonization success compared to the two other approaches see fig 5 which both led to more clustered hp a the arrangement of patches generally determines under otherwise identical conditions the connectivity of habitats chisholm et al 2011 laita et al 2011 villard and metzger 2014 randomly or rather variously arranged habitat patches create more indirect connections within a network anderson and hayes 2018 baguette and van dyck 2007 whereas clustered habitat patch arrangements lead to more cost effective connections within the clusters but the clusters often remain unconnected anderson and hayes 2018 hodgson et al 2011 the presented results indicate that those generally positive effects of variously arranged patches on the colonization also apply to variously randomly arranged patches along streams although given the dendritic stream structure the patch arrangement is much more predetermined in any instance 3 2 4 two way interactions the explanatory power of all two way interaction effects was low equal or less than 3 5 table 2 the three strongest interaction effects all involved hp p hp p and lt p 3 5 hp p and sn s 1 9 hp p as well as hp a 0 9 the effect of decreasing landscape permeability primarily caused by the lt p on the colonization success was less pronounced for habitat networks with a high potential connectivity resulting from comparably dense networks with a high hp p we assume losses of direct connections because of exceeding the maximal connectivity costs can often be compensated by indirect connections accordingly the hp p and the sn s interacted comparably strongly as the patch number per habitat scenario was directly related to stream network density furthermore networks with a random hp a were less affected by decreasing landscape permeability compared to the other arrangements this can be explained by randomly arranged patches resulting in more indirect connections making networks less sensitive against the loss of direct connections colonization success was differently affected by the other arrangements random around centers and contiguous around centers depending on the respective sn s 3 2 5 unexplained variance the five habitat parameters including their two way interactions explained 53 4 of the variance in the colonization success the remaining variance can largely be explained by the stochastic variability of the habitat networks the random distribution of initial source habitat patches within the networks as well as the 10 random habitat networks set up for each patch arrangement approach and patch proportion per habitat scenario likely were responsible for a relevant proportion of the unexplained variance moreover higher level interactions may explain additional albeit likely a low proportion of the remaining variance 3 3 model parameters and omission of processes the development of process based spatially explicit meta population models is complicated by factors such as the degree of abstraction and the relatively complex analyses and interpretation required the necessity to control the complexity of the model structure and to approximate parameter values based on literature references lead to simulation results that are difficult to verify for specific real world species forbes et al 2008 hanski 1994 saura et al 2014 in this context several parameters used in setting up the habitat networks and the simulation represented estimates e g cost values of landscape types in the absence of precise values which affects the results see section 2 4 moreover we did not consider the potential effects of 1 isolation such as reduction of genetic variability hanski 1989 watts et al 2006 and 2 deferred costs of dispersal both of which can compromise meta population viability baguette and van dyck 2007 burgess et al 2012 we further omitted potential negative impacts of high connectivity on population viability such as the effects of diseases that may spread rapidly in highly connected habitats minor and urban 2008 however such aspects could relatively easily be incorporated into the current process based model and parameter estimates could be updated in the light of new knowledge or to reflect the traits of a different model species cuddington et al 2013 we conclude that the presented model has the potential to generate at a minimum theoretical knowledge and general understanding how changing environmental conditions influence the habitat connectivity of hemimetabolous freshwater species under varying scenarios 4 conclusion the results indicate that habitat connectivity for hemimetabolous freshwater species is strongly determined by similar parameters affecting terrestrial habitat connectivity comparable with terrestrial species the number and arrangement of habitat patches as well as the permeability of the surrounding landscape largely determine the colonization success hanski 1989 hodgson et al 2011 lechner et al 2017 here it is especially noteworthy that high potential network connectivity primarily resulting from a high number of patches had a relevant positive effect on the resilience of habitat networks to decreasing landscape permeability nevertheless the modeled colonization is considerably regulated by the spatial structuring of the stream network the persistence of species threatened by environmental change will strongly depend on the preservation of habitat connectivity and therefore on habitat management on landscape scales hanski 1989 hodgson et al 2011 lechner et al 2017 watts et al 2006 to preserve or improve habitat connectivity management for hemimetabolous freshwater species must in addition to the protection and improvement of the single patches focus on the habitat as a whole hassall and thompson 2012 sarremejane et al 2017 thereby management measures should particularly focus as presented above on patch density and landscape permeability process based models can generally improve effective habitat management cuddington et al 2013 evans 2012 jacoby and freeman 2016 petchey et al 2015 saura et al 2014 for example a simplified version of our model revealed information on the minimum time required to colonize habitat patches added to an existing network heer et al 2019 the presented model has the potential to be parameterized with species specific traits and in combination with real world landscapes streams and habitat patch assemblages may serve for instance to support future site specific habitat management planning moreover it can be adopted in future studies to simulate how singular and periodic e g resulting of an increased likelihood of drought events caused by climate change or permanent effects e g resulting from land use change on patch quality affects meta population persistence author contributions all

24941,an ecosystem is vulnerable to the scarcity of water resources and sparse vegetation cover in arid regions groundwater plays an important role in maintaining ecological environment and strongly impacts the ecosystem through influencing vegetation structure and species distribution it is therefore important to clearly understand the relationship between vegetation patterns and groundwater depth gwd in this paper tsallis entropy theory was applied to derive a functional relationship between gwd and vegetation distribution the theory was tested using observed data from arid regions in northwestern china results showed that higher vegetation coverage exist at places of shallow gwd the values of ndvi gradually increase with increasing gwd until reaching a maximum at the optimum depth after which they decrease with increasing groundwater depth when gwd is less than approximately 10 m beyond that depth a low level of vegetation coverage is maintained the correlation coefficients between measured and simulated values of ndvi were above 0 9 p 0 01 in the ejina qaidam and hailiutu basins the theory is applicable to different regions and vegetation types and may improve our ability to sustainably manage land and groundwater resources in arid regions especially where the vegetation is groundwater dependent keywords arid ecosystems tsallis entropy vegetation index groundwater depth 1 introduction vegetation is the main component of terrestrial ecosystems and plays an important role in global carbon water cycles and energy flow zhao et al 2018 the patterns of vegetation distribution are influenced by many factors such as temperature precipitation and groundwater zhang et al 2017 in arid regions annual precipitation is much less than annual potential evapotranspiration guswa et al 2004 newman et al 2006 in addition the water supply for vegetation from surface flows e g runoff rivers is generally very limited therefore groundwater becomes an important water source that greatly affects the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture which in turn affects the distribution of vegetation dai et al 2014 liu et al 2017 lowry et al 2011 naumburg et al 2005 zhu et al 2015 thus some ecosystems in these regions are characterized as groundwater dependent vegetation systems eamus et al 2006 it is generally recognized that the density of vegetation is highly influenced by groundwater depth gwd lv et al 2013 naumburg et al 2005 changes in groundwater depth can unfavorably influence vegetation a decline in vegetation index could be caused either by lowering or rising of the groundwater depth in addition groundwater as part of total water resources plays a dominant role in environmental protection wang et al 2011 zhu et al 2004 in arid regions natural vegetation is the major producer of organic matter as a major biological component the status of natural vegetation largely determines the desertification process and environmental conditions lammerts et al 2001 lv et al 2013 therefore understanding the response of vegetation dynamics to groundwater fluctuations is critical for the sustainable improvement of ecosystems in arid regions wang et al 2011 wu and hobbs 2002 at a regional scale patterns of vegetation distribution have been frequently investigated using satellite remote sensing rs information lv et al 2013 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi being most widely employed the ndvi is a normalized ratio of the nir and red bands ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red where ρ nir and ρ red are the surface bidirectional reflectance factors for their respective bands huete didan et al 2002 in a gridded region every grid possesses a ndvi value which varies from 0 to 1 δ ndvi represents the ndvi interval and f ndvi represents a probability density function pdf of ndvi distributed in the region allowing us to calculate f ndvi δ ndvi as a ratio of ndvi distributed in this interval djebou dagbegnon et al 2015 several studies have reported the empirical relationship between regional vegetation distribution and groundwater depth and developed linear or nonlinear functions to describe the relationship in arid regions gong et al 2004 also many studies have investigated the relationship between different vegetation types and groundwater depth hao et al 2008 ma et al 2013 ye et al 2013 zhao et al 2008 and have determined optimum groundwater depth however these studies only depicted the experimental relationship between vegetation patterns and groundwater depth without constructing general functional models to describe the relationship in different arid regions this paper attempted to construct a functional model to depict the relationship between vegetation distribution and groundwater depth using the entropy method entropy method has been used for exploring the relationship between vegetation and hydrometeorological factors for instance mishra et al 2012 employed the entropy theory to define the nonlinear relationship between precipitation and vegetation and further identified the downscaling method yielding higher mutual information mishra et al 2012 joint entropy was employed to explore the relationship between ndvi and climatic variables djebou et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 as a non extensive entropy tsallis entropy method has been employed successfully in many areas such as movement of moisture in unsaturated soils singh 2010 distribution of velocity in open channels luo and singh 2011 singh and luo 2011 and sediment concentration in debris flow singh and cui 2015 etc however the tsallis entropy method has not been employed yet for describing the relationship between vegetation indexes and groundwater depth tsallis entropy possesses more parameters than shannon entropy and has more different curve shapes using this same function we can depict the relationship between gwd and different vegetation indexes of different types in different regions through selecting appropriate parameters inspired by the research on soil moisture profile using tsallis entropy we attempted to construct a model relating ndvi distribution and gwd and explore the changes in ndvi with the variation of gwd under different scenarios vegetation have different responses with gwd at different regions where climatic and geologic situations are different given the lack of universal formula the objective of this study was to develop a uniform formula based on the tsallis entropy method for depicting the relationship between ndvi and gwd to test it using experimental observations from four different arid regions reported in the literature jin et al 2011 2015 lv et al 2013 and to analyze the suitable gwd required for vegetation growth with respect to different types of vegetation at different regions 2 methodology the status of vegetation depends on the groundwater which can feed soil moisture through capillarity action in the root system the shallower the groundwater depth the more soil moisture absorbed by vegetation is available and vice versa assuming that in a certain region groundwater depth ranges from a low value gwd 0 to a high value gwd u and that ndvi varies from a low value ndvi0 to a high value ndviu ndvi is considered as a random variable with a pdf f ndvi which is determined using the maximum entropy theory pome with given constraints a decline in vegetation can be caused either by rising in gwd disturbance of the plant water balance due to the reduction in water availability or by lowering in gwd due to the reduction in oxygen levels in soil pores required for root breathing hao et al 2010 thus an appropriate gwd is important for the survival of vegetation when gwd is below the optimum value the vegetation index will gradually increase until reaching its maximum with the increase in the gwd value then the vegetation index will decrease with the increase of gwd until the vegetation growth is no longer affected by gwd therefore the whole relationship between vegetation index and gwd was divided into two scenarios scenario 1 depicted the increase of vegetation index with the increase of gwd scenario 2 depicted the decrease of vegetation index with the increase of gwd the flow chart of the methodology is shown in fig 1 2 1 tsallis entropy tsallis entropy was first introduced by tsallis tsallis 1988 it is a non extensive entropy and satisfies the additivity property for independent systems singh 2010 it has been applied to describe the variability of thermodynamic systems with long range interactions or memory and with fractal or multifractal boundary conditions including turbulence fractality and nonextensivity scaling anomalous diffusion and complexity singh 2010 tsallis entropy can be expressed as eq 1 1 h ndvi 1 m 1 1 a b f ndvi m d ndvi 1 m 1 a b f ndvi 1 f ndvi m 1 d ndvi where m is the entropy index and a and b are lower and upper limits of ndvi h describes the uncertainty associated with f ndvi and ndvi greater uncertainty means more information will be needed to characterize ndvi the key in eq 1 is to derive the least biased pdf of ndvi 2 2 specification of constraints the information on ndvi can be acquired through the knowledge of vegetation distribution patterns obtained through remote sensing the ndvivalues corresponding to the same groundwater table were averaged and the averaged ndvi value represents the vegetation index at this depth if the values of ndvi are available then one can express the information on ndvi gwd in terms of constraints c r r 0 1 2 n defined by eqs 2 and 3 2 c 0 a b f ndvi d ndvi 1 3 c r a b g r ndvi f ndvi d ndvi g r ndvi r 1 2 n where g r ndvi represents some functions of ndvi a is the lower limit and b is the upper limit of ndvi if r 1 and g r ndvi ndvi eq 3 corresponds to the mean vegetation index ndvi likewise for r 2 and g r ndvi ndvi ndvi 2 eq 3 would denote the variance of ndvi 2 3 maximization of tsallis entropy in order to obtain the least biased pdf of ndvi the entropy is maximized using the method of lagrange multipliers applied to eq 3 the lagrange function l can be constructed as eq 4 4 l 1 m 1 a b f ndvi 1 f ndvi m 1 d ndvi λ 0 a b f ndvi d ndvi c 0 r 1 n λ r a b f ndvi g r ndvi d ndvi ndvi where λ0 λ r are lagrange multipliers in order to obtain the least biased f ndvi we differentiate l with respect to f ndvi and equate the derivative to zero obtaining 5 l f 0 1 m 1 1 f ndvi m 1 m 1 f ndvi m 1 λ 0 r 1 n λ r g r ndvi 0 2 4 probability distribution and entropy of ndvi eq 5 leads to the pdf of ndvi according to the given constraints 6 f ndvi m 1 m 1 m 1 λ 0 r 1 n λ r g r ndvi 1 m 1 then one can integrate eq 6 to obtain the cumulative distribution function of ndvi f ndvi 7 f ndvi a ndvi m 1 m 1 m 1 λ 0 r 1 n λ r g r ndvi 1 m 1 d ndvi substitution of eq 7 in eq 1 leads to the maximum tsallis entropy of f ndvi or ndvi 8 h 1 m 1 a b m 1 m 1 m 1 λ 0 r 1 n λ r g r ndvi 1 m 1 1 m 1 m 1 m 1 λ 0 r 1 n λ r g r ndvi d ndvi from eq 8 it can be seen that the entropy of f ndvi depends only on the constraints since the lagrange multipliers are determined by the specified constraints 3 derivation of the relationship of ndvi and groundwater depth in order to establish the relationship between ndvi and gwd a fundamental hypothesis was employed this hypothesis states that the cumulative probability density function cdf of ndvi is a linear function of gwd 3 1 scenario 1 increasing scenario this scenario depicts the situation where ndvi increases with the increase of gwd until ndvi reaches its maximum value it is hypothesized that the cdf of ndvi can be expressed as 9 f ndvi g w d g w d 0 g w d c g w d 0 where gwd 0 represents the minimum groundwater depth and gwd c represents the critical value of groundwater depth where ndvi reaches its maximum value derivation of 9 leads to pdf of ndvi being given as 10 f ndvi 1 g w d c g w d 0 d g w d d ndvi 3 1 1 specification of constraints in order to obtain the function of ndvi as regards gwd using the entropy theory two specific constraints are defined according to eqs 11 and 12 11 ndv i 0 ndv i c f ndvi d ndvi 1 12 ndv i 0 ndv i c ndvi f ndvi d ndvi ndv i 1 where ndvi0 and ndvic are the values of vegetation index at gwd gwd 0 and gwd gwd c respectively ndvi 1 is the average value of ndvi in scenario 1 and can be expressed as 13 ndvi 1 1 d g w d 0 g w d c ndvi g w d d g w d where d gwd c gwd 0 represents the range of variation of gwd in the increasing scenario 3 1 2 maximization of entropy using pome lagrangian functions l can be expressed as eq 14 14 l 1 m 1 ndv i 0 ndv i c f ndvi 1 f ndvi m 1 d ndvi λ 0 ndv i 0 ndv i c f ndvi d ndvi 1 λ 1 ndv i 0 ndv i c f ndvi ndvi d ndvi ndvi differentiating l respect to f ndvi and letting the derivative equals zero one gets 15 l f 0 1 m 1 1 f ndvi m 1 m 1 f ndvi m 1 λ 0 λ 1 ndvi 0 3 1 3 probability density function from eq 15 one can obtain the pdf of ndvi as 16 f ndvi m 1 m 1 m 1 λ 0 λ 1 ndvi 1 m 1 for the sake of simplicity we can write λ λ 0 1 m 1 then eq 16 becomes 17 f ndvi m 1 m λ λ 1 ndvi 1 m 1 3 1 4 ndvi as a function of gwd coupling eqs 17 and 10 leads to 18 m 1 m 1 m 1 λ 0 λ 1 ndvi 1 m 1 1 g w d c g w d 0 d g w d d ndvi integration of eq 18 from ndvi ndvi0 to ndvi and gwd gwd 0 to gwd yields 19 ndvi 1 λ 1 λ λ 1 ndv i c m m 1 g w d g w d c g w d 0 λ 1 m m 1 m m 1 m 1 m λ λ 1 eq 19 describes the relationship between the vegetation index and groundwater depth in scenario 1 where the vegetation index increases with increasing gwd 3 2 scenario 2 decreasing scenario this represents a deficit case where ndvi decreases with increasing gwd until the vegetation growth is no longer affected by groundwater depth variation as the process is similar to scenario 1 we simply describe it it is hypothesized that 20 f ndvi 1 g w d g w d c g w d u g w d c and 21 f ndvi 1 g w d c g w d u d g w d d ndvi where gwd u represents the maximum groundwater depth 3 2 1 specification of constraints the constraints for scenario 2 can be expressed as 22 ndv i c ndv i u f ndvi d ndvi 1 23 ndv i c ndv i u ndvi f ndvi d ndvi 1 3 2 2 maximization of entropy following the same approach as in scenario 1 the lagrangian function l is obtained as shown in eq 14 3 2 3 probability density function the pdf of scenario 2 is the same as in scenario 1 and is given by eqs 16 and 17 3 2 4 ndvi as a function of gwd coupling eqs 17 and eq 23 yields 24 m 1 m λ λ 1 ndvi 1 m 1 1 g w d c g w d u d g w d d ndvi integration of eq 24 from ndvi ndvic to ndvi and from gwd gwd c to gwd results in 25 ndvi 1 λ 1 λ λ 1 ndv i c m m 1 λ 1 g w d l m m 1 m m 1 m 1 m λ λ 1 eq 25 describes the vegetation index as a function of gwd in scenario 2 4 testing of the theory 4 1 variation of function curves with variation in parameters it is interesting to explore how the function curves in scenario 1 eq 19 and scenario 2 eq 25 vary with changes in parameters m λ and λ1 ndvi as a function of gwd was computed for three cases by varying one parameter at a time for the increasing scenario fig 2 a represents the ndvi variation with gwd for different values of parameter m fig 2 b for different values of λ1 and fig 2 c for different values of λ respectively it is seen that the curve of ndvi with gwd is very sensitive to these 3 parameters for m equal to 3 4 the curve is concave to the ndvi axis and for the other cases the curve becomes convex extensive testing showed that m equal to 3 4 was more realistic and yielded better results and hence the value of m was fixed at 3 4 when λ1 tended to 0 the curve became a straight a line as shown in fig 2 b and for the other cases the curve becomes concave for parameter λ the curve was always concave and with the increasing of λ the curve gradually closed to the gwd axis for the decreasing scenario fig 3 a c present the curves for different values of parameters m λ1 and λ respectively it is noted that the shape of the curve is opposite to that in the increasing scenario 4 2 observed data to verify the entropy based model we collected five datasets of ndvi and gwd from three published studies in arid regions of northwestern china jin et al 2011 2015 lv et al 2013 the measured groundwater depths and the vegetation spatial distribution data were used to correspond one by one and the data of the same pixel were extracted the vegetation index corresponding to the pixels with the same depth of groundwater was averaged to represent the groundwater depth 1 ejina basin jin et al 2015 studied the relationship between the vegetation distribution using ndvi that relates to vegetation cover patterns and groundwater depth in ejina oasis located downstream of the heiriver basin in northwestern china the main vegetation types in the ejina oasis are dominated by populuseuphratica elaeagnusangustifolia haloxylonammodendron and wetland willow due to scarce precipitation groundwater has an important influence on the growth and development of vegetation modis vegetation index products mod13 were used to generate ndvi and these are based on the modis surface reflectance product mod09 the modis ndvi data are based on 16 day composites mod13q1 product with a spatial resolution of 250 m 2 qaidam basin five years later jin et al 2015 also examined different dependencies of ndvion gwd using the same ndvi data source as jin et al 2011 for 3 different areas nomuhong wulan and wutumeiren in qaidam basin which is located in the northern part of tibet plateau china fig 4 the total basin area is around 276 233 km2 and the interior basin is 152 393 km2 the study area here includes both the interior basin and the surrounding mountains the interior basin is dominated by a desert covered with low vegetation coverage of xeric and halophytic plant species such as artemisia desertorum phragmitesaustralis and calligonummongolicum jin et al 2015 3 hailiutu basin lv et al 2013 investigated the relationship between ndvi and gwd at a regional scale in hailiutu basin the hailiutu river catchment is located in the ordos plateau in north china fig 4 and is dominated by sand dunes covered with xeric plants such as artemisia desertorum and salix psammophila in most of the study area groundwater depth is relatively shallow 10 m landsat 5 thematic mapper tm derived ndvi data on 10 july 2010 with 30 m resolution were applied to analyze the distribution patterns of vegetation the depth of the groundwater was the mean of groundwater depth in the same period from these reported data seven sets of data were extracted to determine parameters and test the entropy theory 4 3 parameter estimation in order to represent the relationship between ndvi and gwd the minimum maximum and average values of ndvi namely ndvi0 ndviu and ndvi need to be specified also the lower boundary or the depth of gwd needs to be specified these values were obtained from experimental datasets then lagrange multipliers were obtained by fitting equations to experimental data sets 4 4 relationship of ndvi and gwd in different areas 1 ejina basin the corresponding relationships between different vegetation types and groundwater depths may also be different in the literature jin et al 2011 the authors explored the relationship between ndvi and gwd in response to grassland trees and shrubs respectively therefore this paper also simulated these three vegetation types separately using eqs 19 and 25 the value of parameter m used in this simulation was taken as 3 4 as shown in fig 5 the simulation accuracy of ndvi distribution and groundwater depth for grasslands trees and shrubs in ejina region was high the correlation coefficients are all around 0 9 and root mean square error rmse are less than 0 04 for three different vegetation types the values of the fitted λ1and λ and the required ndvi0 and ndvic values for model fitting are shown in table 1 although the optimum groundwater depth range for different vegetation types differed they are all concentrated between 3 and 4 m which means that groundwater depth should be maintained at 3 4 meters for healthy growth of vegetation 2 qaidam basin the value of ndvi of the qaidam basin is the mean value of the growing season june september and the depth of the groundwater is the mean of the groundwater depth for the same period fig 6 a c compares observed ndvi and modeled ndvi using the entropy theory in qaidam basin the value of parameter m used for simulating was taken as 3 4 the values of fitted λ1 and λ and the required ndvi0 and ndvic values for model fitting are shown in table 2 all the correlation coefficients between measured and simulated ndvi values are above 0 9 p 0 01 and rmse are less than 0 05 in the 3 regions the wtmr area is mainly covered by shrubland and the ndvi is larger than in other areas the root zone of vegetation is shallow and as such it is highly dependent on groundwater depth ndvi declines with increasing gwd when it is greater than 1 m fig 6 a when the gwd is too shallow the growth of vegetation is restricted due to the high salt levels in the soil therefore ndvi increases with the increase of gwd when the gwd is less than 1 m for zone nmh ndvi decreases with increasing gwd when it is greater than 2 m fig 6 b below 2 m depth deep gwd hinders water flow to the roots and further to the canopy which results in lower ndvi in wl basin relatively larger ndvi values exist at a gwd between 2 5 m and 6 5 m due to the mixture of crops and shrubs fig 6 c therefore the relationship between ndvi and groundwater is significantly different in the qaidam basin 3 hailiutu basin fig 6 d compares observed ndvi and modeled ndvi values using the entropy theory in hailiutu basin the correlation coefficient between measured and simulated values was above 0 9 p 0 01 in this region the value of parameter m in simulation was taken as 3 4 the values of fitted λ1and λ and the ndvic value required for model fitting are shown in table 2 the ndvi is significantly dependent on groundwater when gwd is less than 10 m fig 6 d below that depth ndvi was independent of gwd maximal ndvi occurs at shallow gwd and decreases almost linearly with increasing gwd unlike in the ejina and qaidam basins there are no soil salinity problems in hailiutu basin and precipitation can maintain moisture in the shallow soil therefore bushes are abundant with shallow gwd and trees with deep roots can grow in areas with deep groundwater 5 discussion vegetation is an essential component of all ecosystems and is influenced by many factors many researchers have previously made efforts to depict the relationship between ecosystem vegetation and hydrometeorological factors lv et al 2013 naumburg et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 gong et al 2004 jin et al 2011 2015 however we still lack a universal formula that can be used to depict this relationship the identification of a specific formula that models vegetation index and response factors will facilitate the understanding of ecosystem development under changing environmental conditions we developed and verified a tsallis entropy based formula depicting the relationship between ndvi and groundwater depth in arid regions we have shown that this model can depict this relationship well in various situations tsallis entropy with three parameters is an extension of shannon entropy and allows for the development of specific formula to simulate the relationship between two variables in contrast shannon entropy can only express information regarding ecosystem vegetation and other influencing factors djebou et al 2015 and zhang et al 2017 used shannon joint entropy to explored the relationship between ndvi and influencing factors including precipitation temperature soil moisture and groundwater in a texas gulf watershed and the hei river basin however other linear and exponential formulas were needed in order to analytically depict the relationship between vegetation and these factors using a linear function to depict the relationship between vegetation and gwd is a common approach gong et al 2004 lv et al 2013 ye et al 2013 liner functions can model this relationship well where vegetation index values decrease steadily with increasing gwd as in the hailiutu basin however linear formulas are incapable of depicting this relationship in some regions where vegetation has a non monotonic and nonlinear relationship with gwd in the ejina region a suitable gwd interval of 3 4 m was found for the healthy growth of vegetation with peak ndvi values at a gwd of around 3 5 m the ejina region is subject to severe soil salinity and has limited precipitation resulting in sparse vegetation in the areas where gwd is too shallow the qaidam basin has a similar situation but a different suitable gwd relative to the ejina basin given that this model was developed for two scenarios with nonlinear relationships between these variables it enables better characterization of the relationship between different types of vegetation and gwd in different regions we verified this method using published data from three previous studies due to the absence of measured groundwater data in the future research we will collect additional observational datasets in different regions in order to evaluate this method 6 conclusions in this study we developed a tsallis entropy based method to depict the relationship between vegetation distribution and groundwater depth this model can simulate this nonlinear and non monotonic relationship via adjustment of model parameters the model was verified in three different regions in northwest china by collecting data from previously published papers the accuracy of this simulation achieved significance in these regions confirming the applicability and flexibility of this model as such it is capable of simulating various relationships between different types of vegetation in different regions however additional observational datasets are needed in order to validate the applicability of this model in more regions abbreviations list of variables parameters

depth gwd in this paper tsallis entropy theory was applied to derive a functional relationship between gwd and vegetation distribution the theory was tested using observed data from arid regions in northwestern china results showed that higher vegetation coverage exist at places of shallow gwd the values of ndvi gradually increase with increasing gwd until reaching a maximum at the optimum depth after which they decrease with increasing groundwater depth when gwd is less than approximately 10 m beyond that depth a low level of vegetation coverage is maintained the correlation coefficients between measured and simulated values of ndvi were above 0 9 p 0 01 in the ejina qaidam and hailiutu basins the theory is applicable to different regions and vegetation types and may improve our ability to sustainably manage land and groundwater resources in arid regions especially where the vegetation is groundwater dependent keywords arid ecosystems tsallis entropy vegetation index groundwater depth 1 introduction vegetation is the main component of terrestrial ecosystems and plays an important role in global carbon water cycles and energy flow zhao et al 2018 the patterns of vegetation distribution are influenced by many factors such as temperature precipitation and groundwater zhang et al 2017 in arid regions annual precipitation is much less than annual potential evapotranspiration guswa et al 2004 newman et al 2006 in addition the water supply for vegetation from surface flows e g runoff rivers is generally very limited therefore groundwater becomes an important water source that greatly affects the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture which in turn affects the distribution of vegetation dai et al 2014 liu et al 2017 lowry et al 2011 naumburg et al 2005 zhu et al 2015 thus some ecosystems in these regions are characterized as groundwater dependent vegetation systems eamus et al 2006 it is generally recognized that the density of vegetation is highly influenced by groundwater depth gwd lv et al 2013 naumburg et al 2005 changes in groundwater depth can unfavorably influence vegetation a decline in vegetation index could be caused either by lowering or rising of the groundwater depth in addition groundwater as part of total water resources plays a dominant role in environmental protection wang et al 2011 zhu et al 2004 in arid regions natural vegetation is the major producer of organic matter as a major biological component the status of natural vegetation largely determines the desertification process and environmental conditions lammerts et al 2001 lv et al 2013 therefore understanding the response of vegetation dynamics to groundwater fluctuations is critical for the sustainable improvement of ecosystems in arid regions wang et al 2011 wu and hobbs 2002 at a regional scale patterns of vegetation distribution have been frequently investigated using satellite remote sensing rs information lv et al 2013 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi being most widely employed the ndvi is a normalized ratio of the nir and red bands ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red where ρ nir and ρ red are the surface bidirectional reflectance factors for their respective bands huete didan et al 2002 in a gridded region every grid possesses a ndvi value which varies from 0 to 1 δ ndvi represents the ndvi interval and f ndvi represents a probability density function pdf of ndvi distributed in the region allowing us to calculate f ndvi δ ndvi as a ratio of ndvi distributed in this interval djebou dagbegnon et al 2015 several studies have reported the empirical relationship between regional vegetation distribution and groundwater depth and developed linear or nonlinear functions to describe the relationship in arid regions gong et al 2004 also many studies have investigated the relationship between different vegetation types and groundwater depth hao et al 2008 ma et al 2013 ye et al 2013 zhao et al 2008 and have determined optimum groundwater depth however these studies only depicted the experimental relationship between vegetation patterns and groundwater depth without constructing general functional models to describe the relationship in different arid regions this paper attempted to construct a functional model to depict the relationship between vegetation distribution and groundwater depth using the entropy method entropy method has been used for exploring the relationship between vegetation and hydrometeorological factors for instance mishra et al 2012 employed the entropy theory to define the nonlinear relationship between precipitation and vegetation and further identified the downscaling method yielding higher mutual information mishra et al 2012 joint entropy was employed to explore the relationship between ndvi and climatic variables djebou et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 as a non extensive entropy tsallis entropy method has been employed successfully in many areas such as movement of moisture in unsaturated soils singh 2010 distribution of velocity in open channels luo and singh 2011 singh and luo 2011 and sediment concentration in debris flow singh and cui 2015 etc however the tsallis entropy method has not been employed yet for describing the relationship between vegetation indexes and groundwater depth tsallis entropy possesses more parameters than shannon entropy and has more different curve shapes using this same function we can depict the relationship between gwd and different vegetation indexes of different types in different regions through selecting appropriate parameters inspired by the research on soil moisture profile using tsallis entropy we attempted to construct a model relating ndvi distribution and gwd and explore the changes in ndvi with the variation of gwd under different scenarios vegetation have different responses with gwd at different regions where climatic and geologic situations are different given the lack of universal formula the objective of this study was to develop a uniform formula based on the tsallis entropy method for depicting the relationship between ndvi and gwd to test it using experimental observations from four different arid regions reported in the literature jin et al 2011 2015 lv et al 2013 and to analyze the suitable gwd required for vegetation growth with respect to different types of vegetation at different regions 2 methodology the status of vegetation depends on the groundwater which can feed soil moisture through capillarity action in the root system the shallower the groundwater depth the more soil moisture absorbed by vegetation is available and vice versa assuming that in a certain region groundwater depth ranges from a low value gwd 0 to a high value gwd u and that ndvi varies from a low value ndvi0 to a high value ndviu ndvi is considered as a random variable with a pdf f ndvi which is determined using the maximum entropy theory pome with given constraints a decline in vegetation can be caused either by rising in gwd disturbance of the plant water balance due to the reduction in water availability or by lowering in gwd due to the reduction in oxygen levels in soil pores required for root breathing hao et al 2010 thus an appropriate gwd is important for the survival of vegetation when gwd is below the optimum value the vegetation index will gradually increase until reaching its maximum with the increase in the gwd value then the vegetation index will decrease with the increase of gwd until the vegetation growth is no longer affected by gwd therefore the whole relationship between vegetation index and gwd was divided into two scenarios scenario 1 depicted the increase of vegetation index with the increase of gwd scenario 2 depicted the decrease of vegetation index with the increase of gwd the flow chart of the methodology is shown in fig 1 2 1 tsallis entropy tsallis entropy was first introduced by tsallis tsallis 1988 it is a non extensive entropy and satisfies the additivity property for independent systems singh 2010 it has been applied to describe the variability of thermodynamic systems with long range interactions or memory and with fractal or multifractal boundary conditions including turbulence fractality and nonextensivity scaling anomalous diffusion and complexity singh 2010 tsallis entropy can be expressed as eq 1 1 h ndvi 1 m 1 1 a b f ndvi m d ndvi 1 m 1 a b f ndvi 1 f ndvi m 1 d ndvi where m is the entropy index and a and b are lower and upper limits of ndvi h describes the uncertainty associated with f ndvi and ndvi greater uncertainty means more information will be needed to characterize ndvi the key in eq 1 is to derive the least biased pdf of ndvi 2 2 specification of constraints the information on ndvi can be acquired through the knowledge of vegetation distribution patterns obtained through remote sensing the ndvivalues corresponding to the same groundwater table were averaged and the averaged ndvi value represents the vegetation index at this depth if the values of ndvi are available then one can express the information on ndvi gwd in terms of constraints c r r 0 1 2 n defined by eqs 2 and 3 2 c 0 a b f ndvi d ndvi 1 3 c r a b g r ndvi f ndvi d ndvi g r ndvi r 1 2 n where g r ndvi represents some functions of ndvi a is the lower limit and b is the upper limit of ndvi if r 1 and g r ndvi ndvi eq 3 corresponds to the mean vegetation index ndvi likewise for r 2 and g r ndvi ndvi ndvi 2 eq 3 would denote the variance of ndvi 2 3 maximization of tsallis entropy in order to obtain the least biased pdf of ndvi the entropy is maximized using the method of lagrange multipliers applied to eq 3 the lagrange function l can be constructed as eq 4 4 l 1 m 1 a b f ndvi 1 f ndvi m 1 d ndvi λ 0 a b f ndvi d ndvi c 0 r 1 n λ r a b f ndvi g r ndvi d ndvi ndvi where λ0 λ r are lagrange multipliers in order to obtain the least biased f ndvi we differentiate l with respect to f ndvi and equate the derivative to zero obtaining 5 l f 0 1 m 1 1 f ndvi m 1 m 1 f ndvi m 1 λ 0 r 1 n λ r g r ndvi 0 2 4 probability distribution and entropy of ndvi eq 5 leads to the pdf of ndvi according to the given constraints 6 f ndvi m 1 m 1 m 1 λ 0 r 1 n λ r g r ndvi 1 m 1 then one can integrate eq 6 to obtain the cumulative distribution function of ndvi f ndvi 7 f ndvi a ndvi m 1 m 1 m 1 λ 0 r 1 n λ r g r ndvi 1 m 1 d ndvi substitution of eq 7 in eq 1 leads to the maximum tsallis entropy of f ndvi or ndvi 8 h 1 m 1 a b m 1 m 1 m 1 λ 0 r 1 n λ r g r ndvi 1 m 1 1 m 1 m 1 m 1 λ 0 r 1 n λ r g r ndvi d ndvi from eq 8 it can be seen that the entropy of f ndvi depends only on the constraints since the lagrange multipliers are determined by the specified constraints 3 derivation of the relationship of ndvi and groundwater depth in order to establish the relationship between ndvi and gwd a fundamental hypothesis was employed this hypothesis states that the cumulative probability density function cdf of ndvi is a linear function of gwd 3 1 scenario 1 increasing scenario this scenario depicts the situation where ndvi increases with the increase of gwd until ndvi reaches its maximum value it is hypothesized that the cdf of ndvi can be expressed as 9 f ndvi g w d g w d 0 g w d c g w d 0 where gwd 0 represents the minimum groundwater depth and gwd c represents the critical value of groundwater depth where ndvi reaches its maximum value derivation of 9 leads to pdf of ndvi being given as 10 f ndvi 1 g w d c g w d 0 d g w d d ndvi 3 1 1 specification of constraints in order to obtain the function of ndvi as regards gwd using the entropy theory two specific constraints are defined according to eqs 11 and 12 11 ndv i 0 ndv i c f ndvi d ndvi 1 12 ndv i 0 ndv i c ndvi f ndvi d ndvi ndv i 1 where ndvi0 and ndvic are the values of vegetation index at gwd gwd 0 and gwd gwd c respectively ndvi 1 is the average value of ndvi in scenario 1 and can be expressed as 13 ndvi 1 1 d g w d 0 g w d c ndvi g w d d g w d where d gwd c gwd 0 represents the range of variation of gwd in the increasing scenario 3 1 2 maximization of entropy using pome lagrangian functions l can be expressed as eq 14 14 l 1 m 1 ndv i 0 ndv i c f ndvi 1 f ndvi m 1 d ndvi λ 0 ndv i 0 ndv i c f ndvi d ndvi 1 λ 1 ndv i 0 ndv i c f ndvi ndvi d ndvi ndvi differentiating l respect to f ndvi and letting the derivative equals zero one gets 15 l f 0 1 m 1 1 f ndvi m 1 m 1 f ndvi m 1 λ 0 λ 1 ndvi 0 3 1 3 probability density function from eq 15 one can obtain the pdf of ndvi as 16 f ndvi m 1 m 1 m 1 λ 0 λ 1 ndvi 1 m 1 for the sake of simplicity we can write λ λ 0 1 m 1 then eq 16 becomes 17 f ndvi m 1 m λ λ 1 ndvi 1 m 1 3 1 4 ndvi as a function of gwd coupling eqs 17 and 10 leads to 18 m 1 m 1 m 1 λ 0 λ 1 ndvi 1 m 1 1 g w d c g w d 0 d g w d d ndvi integration of eq 18 from ndvi ndvi0 to ndvi and gwd gwd 0 to gwd yields 19 ndvi 1 λ 1 λ λ 1 ndv i c m m 1 g w d g w d c g w d 0 λ 1 m m 1 m m 1 m 1 m λ λ 1 eq 19 describes the relationship between the vegetation index and groundwater depth in scenario 1 where the vegetation index increases with increasing gwd 3 2 scenario 2 decreasing scenario this represents a deficit case where ndvi decreases with increasing gwd until the vegetation growth is no longer affected by groundwater depth variation as the process is similar to scenario 1 we simply describe it it is hypothesized that 20 f ndvi 1 g w d g w d c g w d u g w d c and 21 f ndvi 1 g w d c g w d u d g w d d ndvi where gwd u represents the maximum groundwater depth 3 2 1 specification of constraints the constraints for scenario 2 can be expressed as 22 ndv i c ndv i u f ndvi d ndvi 1 23 ndv i c ndv i u ndvi f ndvi d ndvi 1 3 2 2 maximization of entropy following the same approach as in scenario 1 the lagrangian function l is obtained as shown in eq 14 3 2 3 probability density function the pdf of scenario 2 is the same as in scenario 1 and is given by eqs 16 and 17 3 2 4 ndvi as a function of gwd coupling eqs 17 and eq 23 yields 24 m 1 m λ λ 1 ndvi 1 m 1 1 g w d c g w d u d g w d d ndvi integration of eq 24 from ndvi ndvic to ndvi and from gwd gwd c to gwd results in 25 ndvi 1 λ 1 λ λ 1 ndv i c m m 1 λ 1 g w d l m m 1 m m 1 m 1 m λ λ 1 eq 25 describes the vegetation index as a function of gwd in scenario 2 4 testing of the theory 4 1 variation of function curves with variation in parameters it is interesting to explore how the function curves in scenario 1 eq 19 and scenario 2 eq 25 vary with changes in parameters m λ and λ1 ndvi as a function of gwd was computed for three cases by varying one parameter at a time for the increasing scenario fig 2 a represents the ndvi variation with gwd for different values of parameter m fig 2 b for different values of λ1 and fig 2 c for different values of λ respectively it is seen that the curve of ndvi with gwd is very sensitive to these 3 parameters for m equal to 3 4 the curve is concave to the ndvi axis and for the other cases the curve becomes convex extensive testing showed that m equal to 3 4 was more realistic and yielded better results and hence the value of m was fixed at 3 4 when λ1 tended to 0 the curve became a straight a line as shown in fig 2 b and for the other cases the curve becomes concave for parameter λ the curve was always concave and with the increasing of λ the curve gradually closed to the gwd axis for the decreasing scenario fig 3 a c present the curves for different values of parameters m λ1 and λ respectively it is noted that the shape of the curve is opposite to that in the increasing scenario 4 2 observed data to verify the entropy based model we collected five datasets of ndvi and gwd from three published studies in arid regions of northwestern china jin et al 2011 2015 lv et al 2013 the measured groundwater depths and the vegetation spatial distribution data were used to correspond one by one and the data of the same pixel were extracted the vegetation index corresponding to the pixels with the same depth of groundwater was averaged to represent the groundwater depth 1 ejina basin jin et al 2015 studied the relationship between the vegetation distribution using ndvi that relates to vegetation cover patterns and groundwater depth in ejina oasis located downstream of the heiriver basin in northwestern china the main vegetation types in the ejina oasis are dominated by populuseuphratica elaeagnusangustifolia haloxylonammodendron and wetland willow due to scarce precipitation groundwater has an important influence on the growth and development of vegetation modis vegetation index products mod13 were used to generate ndvi and these are based on the modis surface reflectance product mod09 the modis ndvi data are based on 16 day composites mod13q1 product with a spatial resolution of 250 m 2 qaidam basin five years later jin et al 2015 also examined different dependencies of ndvion gwd using the same ndvi data source as jin et al 2011 for 3 different areas nomuhong wulan and wutumeiren in qaidam basin which is located in the northern part of tibet plateau china fig 4 the total basin area is around 276 233 km2 and the interior basin is 152 393 km2 the study area here includes both the interior basin and the surrounding mountains the interior basin is dominated by a desert covered with low vegetation coverage of xeric and halophytic plant species such as artemisia desertorum phragmitesaustralis and calligonummongolicum jin et al 2015 3 hailiutu basin lv et al 2013 investigated the relationship between ndvi and gwd at a regional scale in hailiutu basin the hailiutu river catchment is located in the ordos plateau in north china fig 4 and is dominated by sand dunes covered with xeric plants such as artemisia desertorum and salix psammophila in most of the study area groundwater depth is relatively shallow 10 m landsat 5 thematic mapper tm derived ndvi data on 10 july 2010 with 30 m resolution were applied to analyze the distribution patterns of vegetation the depth of the groundwater was the mean of groundwater depth in the same period from these reported data seven sets of data were extracted to determine parameters and test the entropy theory 4 3 parameter estimation in order to represent the relationship between ndvi and gwd the minimum maximum and average values of ndvi namely ndvi0 ndviu and ndvi need to be specified also the lower boundary or the depth of gwd needs to be specified these values were obtained from experimental datasets then lagrange multipliers were obtained by fitting equations to experimental data sets 4 4 relationship of ndvi and gwd in different areas 1 ejina basin the corresponding relationships between different vegetation types and groundwater depths may also be different in the literature jin et al 2011 the authors explored the relationship between ndvi and gwd in response to grassland trees and shrubs respectively therefore this paper also simulated these three vegetation types separately using eqs 19 and 25 the value of parameter m used in this simulation was taken as 3 4 as shown in fig 5 the simulation accuracy of ndvi distribution and groundwater depth for grasslands trees and shrubs in ejina region was high the correlation coefficients are all around 0 9 and root mean square error rmse are less than 0 04 for three different vegetation types the values of the fitted λ1and λ and the required ndvi0 and ndvic values for model fitting are shown in table 1 although the optimum groundwater depth range for different vegetation types differed they are all concentrated between 3 and 4 m which means that groundwater depth should be maintained at 3 4 meters for healthy growth of vegetation 2 qaidam basin the value of ndvi of the qaidam basin is the mean value of the growing season june september and the depth of the groundwater is the mean of the groundwater depth for the same period fig 6 a c compares observed ndvi and modeled ndvi using the entropy theory in qaidam basin the value of parameter m used for simulating was taken as 3 4 the values of fitted λ1 and λ and the required ndvi0 and ndvic values for model fitting are shown in table 2 all the correlation coefficients between measured and simulated ndvi values are above 0 9 p 0 01 and rmse are less than 0 05 in the 3 regions the wtmr area is mainly covered by shrubland and the ndvi is larger than in other areas the root zone of vegetation is shallow and as such it is highly dependent on groundwater depth ndvi declines with increasing gwd when it is greater than 1 m fig 6 a when the gwd is too shallow the growth of vegetation is restricted due to the high salt levels in the soil therefore ndvi increases with the increase of gwd when the gwd is less than 1 m for zone nmh ndvi decreases with increasing gwd when it is greater than 2 m fig 6 b below 2 m depth deep gwd hinders water flow to the roots and further to the canopy which results in lower ndvi in wl basin relatively larger ndvi values exist at a gwd between 2 5 m and 6 5 m due to the mixture of crops and shrubs fig 6 c therefore the relationship between ndvi and groundwater is significantly different in the qaidam basin 3 hailiutu basin fig 6 d compares observed ndvi and modeled ndvi values using the entropy theory in hailiutu basin the correlation coefficient between measured and simulated values was above 0 9 p 0 01 in this region the value of parameter m in simulation was taken as 3 4 the values of fitted λ1and λ and the ndvic value required for model fitting are shown in table 2 the ndvi is significantly dependent on groundwater when gwd is less than 10 m fig 6 d below that depth ndvi was independent of gwd maximal ndvi occurs at shallow gwd and decreases almost linearly with increasing gwd unlike in the ejina and qaidam basins there are no soil salinity problems in hailiutu basin and precipitation can maintain moisture in the shallow soil therefore bushes are abundant with shallow gwd and trees with deep roots can grow in areas with deep groundwater 5 discussion vegetation is an essential component of all ecosystems and is influenced by many factors many researchers have previously made efforts to depict the relationship between ecosystem vegetation and hydrometeorological factors lv et al 2013 naumburg et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 gong et al 2004 jin et al 2011 2015 however we still lack a universal formula that can be used to depict this relationship the identification of a specific formula that models vegetation index and response factors will facilitate the understanding of ecosystem development under changing environmental conditions we developed and verified a tsallis entropy based formula depicting the relationship between ndvi and groundwater depth in arid regions we have shown that this model can depict this relationship well in various situations tsallis entropy with three parameters is an extension of shannon entropy and allows for the development of specific formula to simulate the relationship between two variables in contrast shannon entropy can only express information regarding ecosystem vegetation and other influencing factors djebou et al 2015 and zhang et al 2017 used shannon joint entropy to explored the relationship between ndvi and influencing factors including precipitation temperature soil moisture and groundwater in a texas gulf watershed and the hei river basin however other linear and exponential formulas were needed in order to analytically depict the relationship between vegetation and these factors using a linear function to depict the relationship between vegetation and gwd is a common approach gong et al 2004 lv et al 2013 ye et al 2013 liner functions can model this relationship well where vegetation index values decrease steadily with increasing gwd as in the hailiutu basin however linear formulas are incapable of depicting this relationship in some regions where vegetation has a non monotonic and nonlinear relationship with gwd in the ejina region a suitable gwd interval of 3 4 m was found for the healthy growth of vegetation with peak ndvi values at a gwd of around 3 5 m the ejina region is subject to severe soil salinity and has limited precipitation resulting in sparse vegetation in the areas where gwd is too shallow the qaidam basin has a similar situation but a different suitable gwd relative to the ejina basin given that this model was developed for two scenarios with nonlinear relationships between these variables it enables better characterization of the relationship between different types of vegetation and gwd in different regions we verified this method using published data from three previous studies due to the absence of measured groundwater data in the future research we will collect additional observational datasets in different regions in order to evaluate this method 6 conclusions in this study we developed a tsallis entropy based method to depict the relationship between vegetation distribution and groundwater depth this model can simulate this nonlinear and non monotonic relationship via adjustment of model parameters the model was verified in three different regions in northwest china by collecting data from previously published papers the accuracy of this simulation achieved significance in these regions confirming the applicability and flexibility of this model as such it is capable of simulating various relationships between different types of vegetation in different regions however additional observational datasets are needed in order to validate the applicability of this model in more regions abbreviations list of variables parameters

24942,invasive dreissenid mussels have successfully established dense population at nearshore and mid depth regions and significantly altered the ecosystem and food web dynamics in lake michigan in this work we used a high resolution hydrodynamic biogeochemical model to evaluate how these extensively colonized benthic mussels will affect the dynamics of phosphorus cycling in lake michigan model results demonstrated the important role of mussels in re engineering of phosphorus cycling with their filtering and excretion activities causing increasing lake wide ratio of dissolved dp and particulate pp phosphorus the diffusive flux at the bottom of mid depth site was significantly enhanced compared to the sedimentation due to the benthic mussels with an average effective flux 12 1 times greater than the passive setting which was consistent with the field observations nearshore offshore phosphorus transport displayed substantial spatial and temporal variabilities and the nearshore was identified as an overall source sink of pp dp to the offshore region the simulation results with mussels revealed that the mussel could effectively reduce the pp transport to the offshore region potentially risking the pelagic fish abundance this study provides key quantitative estimates for the impact of benthic mussels on vertical pp delivery and lake wide nearshore offshore phosphorus transport and could inform potential ecosystem management strategies of lake michigan and other dreissenid mussel invaded lakes keywords dreissenid mussels phosphorus cycling numerical modelling lake michigan ecosystem 1 introduction invasive dreissenid mussels have successfully established dense population since late 1980s in laurentian great lakes bunnell et al 2009 nalepa et al 2010 these benthic filter feeders have significantly altered the ecosystem of great lakes and nutrient and food web dynamics hecky et al 2004 vanderploeg et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 field observations during pre and post dreissenids periods revealed that the invasion of mussels in great lakes was correlated with decreased phytoplankton abundance and primary production in shallow area where mussel density was extremely high ackerman et al 2001 madenjian 1995 despite the increased water clarity due to filtering activities which favors the photosynthesis across the water column auer et al 2010 limburg et al 2010 following the colonization of zebra mussels in shallow waters quagga mussels have become the dominant dreissenids which successfully managed to maintain a massive density particularly at mid depth 30 70 m regions after 2005 in lake michigan nalepa et al 2009 according to observations at several offshore sites in lake michigan phytoplankton biomass at the deep chlorophyll layer has reduced significantly compared with measurements made before the colonization of mussels fahnenstiel et al 2010 pothoven and fahnenstiel 2013 a concurrent decline of fish stock in pelagic area of great lakes were noted vanderploeg et al 2002 strayer and hattala 2004 nalepa et al 2010 turschak et al 2014 possibly can be attributed to the bottom up control mechanism due to mussel grazing along with the reduction in primary production enhanced dissolved phosphorus dp for the bottom water was observed as a result of mussel excretion dayton et al 2014 the proliferation of benthic algae e g cladophora growth in shallow areas of great lakes was somehow encouraged because of sufficient nutrient supply due to mussel excretion and favorable rocky substrate for massive colonization higgins et al 2008 bootsma and liao 2013 bootsma 2009 impacts of dreissenid mussels were considered to expand beyond nearshore areas where early mussel colonization was found hecky et al 2004 hypothesized that sestons from tributaries or pelagic areas could be captured by benthic mussels and retained in the nearshore area which becomes a net sink for nutrient and energy this may explain the observed lower phosphorus concentration in offshore areas of great lakes in lake michigan these effects may have extended to the mid depth region away from the nearshore due to the more extensive expansions of quagga mussels vanderploeg et al 2010 physical mixing in large stratified lakes is a key process that affects the cycling of nutrient and energy turbulent mixing effectively sets the limits of material exchange rates to and from benthic mussels which serve as major sinks e g of phytoplankton or sources e g of dp of water column constituents earlier studies on the role of dreissenid mussels played in ecosystems of great lakes have focused almost exclusively on shallow 10 m systems ackerman et al 2001 hecky et al 2004 boegman et al 2008 conventional thought is that only in shallow systems that areal grazing rates are comparable to areal phytoplankton production rates as vertical mixing would be sufficient for bottom grazers to access the entire water column within relative short time scales officer et al 1982 koseff et al 1993 boegman et al 2008 this conventional reasoning may need to be re justified with the recent mussel expansion to mid depth offshore areas of lake michigan and other great lakes mixing is generally weak between the epilimnion and hypolimnion at offshore areas during summer stratification which could suppress food delivery to the bottom in a one dimensional system driven by vertical turbulent transport analyses of relative timescales between turbulent mixing and filtration can help to determine whether benthic feeders are limited by turbulent delivery koseff et al 1993 boegman et al 2008 shen et al 2018 long term field observations in great lakes revealed significant decline of phytoplankton during the spring bloom period due to strong turbulent mixing fahnenstiel et al 2010 however no significant biomass reduction was noted in the well mixed surface layer during summer periods pothoven and fahnenstiel 2013 simulation results in lake simcoe suggest stronger storm events could increase flux of particulate organic matters to benthic mussels schwalb et al 2015 highlighting the importance of water column mixing in altering the energy flow for mussel infested lakes while a good amount of field observations in great lakes have been documented for both pre and post dreissenids periods fahnenstiel et al 2010 pothoven and fahnenstiel 2013 it is still challenging to accurately quantify the impact of mussels on the ecosystem as field measurements are too sparse to account for the significant spatial and temporal variabilities of large lakes phosphorus loads and spring total phosphorus tp concentration have declined from 1980 to 2008 with efforts from the phosphorus abatement program in great lakes dolan and chapra 2012 the real impact of invasive mussels is therefore complicated with the in lake tp reduction as it becomes more difficult to disentangle the effects between these two factors at the ecosystem scale process based models that couple hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may effectively address interactions between benthic mussels and ecosystem dynamics in the water column a two dimensional longitudinal vertical hydrodynamic and water quality model ce qual w2 with module of dreissenid mussels included was firstly applied in lake erie and the model predicted 25 30 of algal biomass decrease due to filter feeding activities boegman et al 2008 this model also predicted that mussel excretion may have a greater impact on the ecosystem than the direct grazing of particulate phosphorus pp zhang et al 2008 bocaniov et al 2014 applied a three dimensional biophysical model in lake erie and the results suggest a higher phytoplankton decrease in nearshore area which was consistent with field observations model studies of lake michigan were fewer until very recently results from one dimensional water column models indicated that filtering activities of mussels reduce spring phytoplankton abundance at both east and west mid depth sites of lake michigan rowe et al 2015 shen et al 2018 more scenarios of varying filter feeding intensities could be performed by extending these models to three dimensional such models have implied strong spatial and temporal alternations in both productivity and zooplankton in lake michigan rowe and anderson 2017 pilcher et al 2017 while influence of benthic mussels was generally concluded more straightforwardly through comparisons of phosphorus primary production among model results of different scenarios how mussels affect the dynamics of phosphorus cycling through physical delivery and transport has yet to be quantitatively studied in this study a three dimensional coupled physical and biogeochemical model with benthic mussels included in lake michigan was developed and validated against a range of field observations lake wide dp pp ratio was discussed to evaluate how mussels alter the phosphorus conversion between different forms vertical flux of pp was compared for scenarios with and without mussels nearshore offshore phosphorus transport was calculated to assess the impacts of mussels at the whole lake scale the model results underscore the important role of invasive mussels on ecosystems in great lakes and could inform potential regional watershed management strategies and future studies in similar aquatic systems 2 materials and methods the model for hydrodynamic circulation and mixing was based upon the finite volume community ocean model fvcom fvcom is an unstructured grid finite volume sigma coordinated terrain following ocean model that provides the capability of representing accurately the geometrical complexities that characterize the usually highly irregular water land coastal boundaries such as inlets islands and peninsulas chen et al 2003 fvcom has been successfully implemented in several studies of great lakes and has shown success in reproducing the lake wide physical dynamics at variable time scales chen et al 2004 bai et al 2013 xue and schwab 2015 luo et al 2012 the horizontal unstructured mesh of our model had 10492 nodes and 19813 elements to fully explore the mussel effects to the ecosystem the nearshore shallow area was patched with unstructured mesh with relatively higher resolution 0 8 km length between two cells fig s1 than the offshore area 3 0 km the water column was divided into 30 layers in the vertical direction with higher resolution approaching the surface and bottom to better resolve mixing processes at the boundaries a quadratic stress model near bottom layers was adopted assuming the bottom boundary layer is logarithmic over a roughness height of 0 5 mm vertical mixing was modeled with the mellor yamada k kl turbulence closure scheme as the model focused on simulating state variables on scales of 0 8 3 0 km in the horizontal and 0 2 10 m in the vertical the turbulence mixing parameterizations based on the values of state variables at resolved scales could well represent the small scale mixing processes and advance toward a closed reynolds averaged navier stokes equations supplemental material the background diffusivity and viscosity was set at 1 10 6 m2 s 1 this study attempted to simulate the whole lake michigan since we considered the internal cycles only this model boundary was closed at the straits of mackinac which connects lake michigan and lake huron surrounding tributaries were not included and external phosphorus loads were ignored in this study bathymetry was interpolated onto the mesh with data obtained from the noaa national geophysical data center www ngdc noa a gov mgg greatlakes greatlake html and the minimum depth was set to be 5 0 m model simulation run was conducted for 2012 a typical warm year with little ice cover reported in lake michigan mode split technique was adopted in fvcom for better computing efficiency time step of the external mode was set to 10 s to avoid advective instability according to the courant friedrich levy cfl criterion and the split number was set to 10 which means a 100 s time step for the internal mode we coupled the fvcom with a new water column nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus grazer npzdg biogeochemical model supplemental material diagram 1 the model consists of two phytoplankton groups small size and large size phytoplankton one zooplankton group one nutrient group dp one detritus group and one benthic grazer the biogeochemical npzdg model was extended from the conventional npzd model chen et al 2002 ji and chen 2002 with the additional benthic grazer mussels included metrics for phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus were all configured in terms of the equivalent carbon mass c a fixed carbon phosphorus c p ratio of 200 was adopted according to that reported by bootsma et al 2012 and the raito of chl α c was set to 0 036 fahnenstiel et al 1989 the diagram for transport and transformation of important constituents among different groups as well as the governing equations were described in the supplemental material the biogeochemical model simulated the growth of two distinct phytoplankton groups large and small size with a set of kinetic parameters as listed in table 1 the model used a general monod 1949 growth equation and a michaelis menton type parameterization for phytoplankton growth

model parameters were taken from literature review and field measurements in lake michigan and they were listed in table 1 mussel effects including grazing excretion and egestion were limited to the most bottom layer in the model the grazing on phytoplankton was modeled as the product of the individual clearance rate the population density and the overlying concentration of pp phytoplankton and detritus phytoplankton loss through mussel grazing was modeled as 5 p h y t m p ρ m p h y d σ where m p is the clearance rate per unit mussel mass ml mgdw 1 hr 1 ρ m is the mussel density per unit

through interpolation of observations at 144 sites in 2010 which was used in our simulation for 2012 fig 1 assuming no significant variations of mussel colonization during the subsequent two years following 2010 mussel biomass was not treated as a state variable and was assumed to stay in an equilibrium state the individual clearance rate represented as the volume of water filtered per unit dry weight mussel was modeled by an empirical formula from tyner et al 2015 according to their laboratory experiments on mussels collected in lake michigan the formula is temperature dependent and does not take the mussel size into account 6 m p m 1 exp m 2 t m l m g d w 1 h r 1 in which m p is individual clearance rate t is temperature m 1 and m 2 are the fitted coefficients table 1 egested feces and pseudofeces were treated as additional inputs to the bottom detritus pool other processes such as sediment burial and resuspension were not considered in the present model field observations in nearshore area of lake michigan derived a ratio of 65 35 for mussel egestion and excretion after grazing bootsma et al 2012 hence it was assumed that 65 of the filtered food particles were egested and went into the bottom detritus pool in our model and the other portion was considered as the contribution to the dp pool through mussel excretion bottom roughness for scenario runs with and without benthic mussels was assumed to be constant to focus on the potential impacts of filter feeding to the phosphorus cycling in lake michigan the physical model was forced with air sea momentum and heat flux meteorological data were obtained from the north american regional reanalysis narr database which is a 32 km resolution and 3 hourly interval dataset derived from the ncep eta meteorological model with assimilation of observational data from surface upper atmosphere and remote sensing sources including great lakes buoy data and satellite derived surface temperature the variables included 10 m winds air temperature relative humidity and total cloud cover these data were interpolated to the mesh nodes and were used to calculate surface heat flux including shortwave longwave sensible and latent radiation following the methods described by beletsky and schwab 2001 specifically the upward longwave sensible and latent heat flux as the surface boundary forcing for temperature simulation were calculated prognostically with the instantaneous predicted water surface temperature from the model to well account for the high frequency of air sea interaction shortwave radiation was treated as a source term in the temperature transport equation which warms up the water column ratio of the longwave radiation in the yellow to infrared and shortwave radiation in green to ultraviolet components was set as 0 55 0 45 with their extinction coefficients as 2 85 and 0 28 m 1 respectively rucinski et al 2010 vertical and horizontal fluxes were calculated to explore how the mussels would affect the physical phosphorus transport in a quantitative way the total vertical fluxes of pp includes passive settling f s and the turbulent diffusive flux f d and they can be formulated as 7 f s w

advection flux of phosphorus between the nearshore and offshore could be parameterized as eq 8 8 f v n ˆ p a where f is the horizontal phosphorus flux v is the velocity at the boundary cell n ˆ is the perpendicular unit vector a is the cell area p is the phosphorus concentration the model was forced to run three seasons of 2011 when ice coverage was little with the initial conditions of dp large phytoplankton small phytoplankton zooplankton detritus set as 0 1 mmol p m 3 0 5 mmol c m 3 0 2 mmol c m 3 0 5 mmol c m 3 and 8 0 mmol c m 3 respectively rowe and anderson 2017 the output at the end of year 2011 was selected as the initial condition for year 2012 i e hot start we also calibrated the model by comparing simulations with observational data e g temperature surface and bottom chl a fig s2 in 2011 model results of hydrodynamics and biogeochemical state variables were further validated through a number of field measurements in 2012 field measurements at a mid depth site 55 m fig 1 of west lake michigan were conducted in 2012 including the deployment of thermistor chains and a bottom mounted acoustic doppler current profiler adcd 250 khz that measured temperature and current velocities respectively troy et al 2016 water samples were collected with the niskin bottles for water quality analysis mosley and bootsma 2015 additional observational data including water surface temperature and meteorological data were obtained from the national ocean and atmospheric administration noaa buoys 45 007 and 45 002 in south and north lake michigan www ndbc noaa gov fig 1 annual united states environmental protection agency us epa great lakes monitoring program provided vertical resolved water quality measurements at multiple offshore sites in lake michigan www epa gov greatlakes monitoring data proj fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical results simulated lake surface water temperature well reproduced observations made in year 2012 in lake michigan compared with observations from sub basin buoys south 45007 north 45002 and satellite image data the model presented reasonable skills in reproducing seasonal variations of surface water temperature featured with continuous increase since spring peaking in the summer and following decrease after september fig s3 the difference between simulation results and observations represented as root mean square error rmse is small with 1 23 1 34 and 1 02 c respectively for two buoys and lake average temperature notably the abrupt lake wide surface temperature decrease in august was accurately captured by the model while prediction results generally matched well with observations during year 2012 bias between model results and field observations exists particularly in spring when the water body began to warm up both model results and satellite images showed significant variations of surface water temperature given its tremendous surface area fig s4 water temperature started to warm up in southern lake michigan and northwest green bay area in may water surface temperature in september reached the maximum with less spatial variations the west coast in summer is characterized by strong and frequent upwelling events downwelling in the east under combined effects of dominant southern wind and earth rotation beletsky and schwab 2001 model results presented a lower surface temperature along the west coast than that from satellite measurements fig s4 possibly suggesting an overestimation of upwelling magnitude modeled vertical thermal structure at the 55 m site 42 9797 n 87 6658 w during summer was compared with field measurements between july and september 2012 fig s5 the model demonstrated its ability in reproducing the gradual stratification and the overturn convection in the vertical water column a thermocline at 15 m depth in the summer was noted both from field observations and model simulations model simulation and field observations both displayed a deepening thermocline in middle august due to a strong downwelling event which was reported by troy et al 2016 while field observations showed a rather sharp temperature gradient between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion the model predicted a much diffusive one which was regarded as a common problem in most three dimensional simulations in great lakes beletsky and schwab 2001 and may not be improved by increasing the vertical resolution or decreasing time steps a possible explanation was that some vertical mixing mechanisms such as the langmuir circulation are not well resolved and represented in general hydrodynamic circulation models beletsky et al 2006 model results displayed a stable cyclonic gyre in the lake wide depth averaged currents structure throughout the winter season fig s6 this feature was especially clear in the southern basin and its central sub basin which was consistent with the long term observations and previous model simulations in lake michigan beletsky et al 2006 beletsky and schwab 2001 luo and wang 2012 compared to the winter currents the circulation in summer was less organized as the density driven currents complicated the hydrodynamics of strong stratified water in summer beletsky and schwab 2001 the strong northern wind associated with the weak lake stratification in winter leaded to a greater depth averaged currents velocity i e 3 1 cm s 1 compared to 1 2 cm s 1 averaged in summer we also compared the modeled currents above the benthic mussels with the field observations at the 55 m site fig s7 and the simulations well reproduced the bottom currents and successfully captured the abrupt currents speed increase during the downwelling events in middle august meanwhile both simulated currents and field observations were dominated by oscillating currents at a near inertial period 18 h which has been reported by troy et al 2016 3 2 biogeochemical results model performance on biogeochemical simulations was examined by comparing the simulated results with mussels with field measurements from epa monitoring program in spring and summer of 2012 fig 2 the model showed fair skills rmse 0 35 μg l 1 correlation r 0 76 p 0 001 in capturing the chl a concentrations at the 10 epa offshore monitoring sites in lake michigan chl a was more uniform under spring isothermal conditions although surface chl a concentration was overall slightly higher both simulations and field observations presented a much greater chl a concentrations in the surface layer in august spatial variations of modeled chl a at these offshore sites however were not as significant as observed ones and model results overall underestimated the chl a concentrations while it is always difficult to validate a biogeochemical model on sites and date specific basis especially for large systems with great spatial heterogeneity as lake michigan it is likely that the fixed chl a c ratio adopted in the model may partially account for the biased predictions the model well simulated the vertical profiles of june pp at the mid depth site 55 m near the west coast fig 2 the summer vertical profile was featured with a relatively high pp concentration in the surface mixed layer with a peak value around the thermocline while the model was not able to reproduce a gradient as sharp as that measured one in the metalimnion 20 30 m depth where pp decreased dramatically the bottom low concentrations were accurately captured by the model generally modeled vertical pp profile showed that mussels filter feeding can create a 25 m thick bottom layer with reduced pp at this site as compared to the scenario where mussels were excluded from the model in the layer from the bottom to 5 m above pp was reduced by about 50 vertical variability of observed dp at the 55 m site was not as significant as pp with slight increase 23 in the bottom fig 2 while simulated dp were comparable to the observational data a larger dp gradient was predicted by the model characterized by relatively higher dp concentrations in the bottom possibly attributed to microbial remineralization of detritus the scenario with mussels included displayed even higher dp concentrations corresponding to the lower pp levels and suggesting that filtration and excretion activities of these benthic mussels can enhance the phosphorus transition from particulate forms to dissolved forms lake wide depth averaged phytoplankton biomass demonstrated significant spatial variations as simulated by the model much higher spring phytoplankton biomass was observed in the shallow nearshore area fig 3 where water column was first warmed up and photosynthesis process was further fueled with sufficient nutrient supply and increasing light intensity phytoplankton growth at offshore bottom was suppressed due to limited light leading to a significant low depth averaged biomass concentration phytoplankton biomass was in a relatively lower level for the entire lake in summer considering nutrient was mostly consumed in the surface after spring bloom and the replenishment from deep hypolimnion was suppressed by stratification the biomass in nearshore yet remained high with comparably strong vertical transport in shallow waters simulation results also revealed a higher biomass concentration in summer along the west coast than the east which could be a consequence of frequent upwelling events on the west side that carry nutrient rich water from hypolimnion and provide a cooler environment for phytoplankton growth optimal temperature is 16 20 c to evaluate impacts of mussels filter feeding differences in phytoplankton biomass between the scenarios with and without mussels normalized by that without mussels were presented in fig 3 i e the percentage of biomass reduction in spring when the water column was well mixed mussels were able to access the full water column and phytoplankton biomass reduction was significant at shallow and mid depth region where mussel density is high water column biomass reduction was over 50 at the shallow locations with the highest mussel colonization reduction at other shallow areas was approximately 25 little differences were noted at offshore deep areas model results showed an overall phytoplankton reduction in summer as well albeit not as significant as that during the spring period which suggested that stratification to a certain degree could limit their grazing on phytoplankton discrepancy of summer scenarios was less strictly proportional to the density of benthic mussels as that in spring and it seems resulted from other indirect effects of mussels like the grazing by different abundance of zooplankton photosynthesis with variable nutrient supply it should also be noted that model results with mussels indicated certain slight increases in phytoplankton biomass in the north lake michigan and green bay areas fig 3 while zooplankton concentration at these locations did not display much significant change dissolved nutrient concentrations were comparably higher likely due to mussel excretion and subsequent advective transport in other words phytoplankton growth fueled by excreted nutrient may exceed the negative grazing effect under certain conditions model results revealed a strong impacts of mussels on dp and phytoplankton biomass at mid depth areas fig 4 significant growth of phytoplankton was noted in late spring and early summer phytoplankton biomass in hypolimnion was in an extremely low level throughout the whole summer due to limited photosynthesis and vertical exchange summer dp distribution pattern was exactly opposite to the phytoplankton with much higher concentrations in the hypolimnion compared to the scenario without mussels phytoplankton reduction was vertically uniform in spring associated with great vertical mixing the reduction was found to be only limited in the hypolimnion during summer as delivery of phytoplankton from the euphotic zone to the hypolimnion was largely restricted phytoplankton biomass actually increased slightly in the epilimnion with mussels it is worth mentioning that our model predicted an average of 14 reduction of zooplankton in the 55 m site as a result of less phytoplankton available which was consistent with the negative effects of mussels on zooplankton from field observations dricoll et al 2015 dp concentrations were found to be higher with mussels over the entire water column even during the stratification overall model results indicated an increase ratio of dp and pp in the hypolimnion at the mid depth regions where mussels are abundant confirming the role of benthic mussels in altering the phosphorus conversion between the particulate and dissolved forms 3 3 particulate phosphorus delivery effective settling rate of pp eq 7 with and without mussels at the mid depth region was examined to discuss their grazing impact to pp delivery fig 5 model results demonstrated a decreasing settling flux from top 5 m to bottom 53 m across the water column as pp originated from the surface productive layers were generally mineralized to dissolved form in the bottom scenario results with benthic mussels displayed greater differences in top bottom passive settling flux ratios of vertical diffusion and sedimentation at 2 m above the bottom 53 m depth displayed significant variations over the seasons mid spring e g april and mid summer june and july were noted with relatively larger eddy diffusivity according to the model leading to overall higher diffusive fluxes at bottom scenario run without mussels was characterized by negative diffusive fluxes at bottom given that pp concentration at bottom was generally higher compared to that of overlying layers due to continuous sedimentation differently though pp at bottom with benthic mussels particularly in summer was in a low level resulting in relatively low passive settling fluxes the enhanced vertical diffusion associated with mussel filtration was clearly illustrated with a much sharper decrease of pp in the hypolimnion fig 2 the mean food delivery rate from june to september was estimated as 12 1 times greater than the passive settling with mussels included which was consistent with that derived indirectly from field observations 11 0 times at the same site with a sediment trap at about 2 m above the mussel bed mosley and bootsma 2015 the mean modeled diffusive flux at bottom was estimated as 80 4 μmol p m 2 d 1 and the passive settling flux was 7 2 μmol p m 2 d 1 somewhat lower compared to that derived from short term observational data 215 and 19 5 μmol p m 2 d 1 which could either due to underestimated mean phytoplankton biomass without external loads or sinking velocity eddy diffusivity or both generally the summer diffusion flux exceeded the passive sedimentation in the mid depth site particularly over the summer hypolimnion region reaching the thermocline the enhanced diffusive flux in hypolimnion suggested the benthic mussels could increase the pp delivery and reduce the pp residence time over the water column 3 4 nearshore offshore transport impact of mussels was nonetheless remarkable on phosphorus cycling dynamics in the nearshore area the remaining low phosphorus levels in offshore water were possibly due to the phosphorus retention and altered export pathways as a result of invasive mussels in the nearshore and mid depth area in this study we applied the 75 m isobaths fig 1 as the boundary between nearshore and offshore regions considering that the quagga mussels have successfully invaded the mid depth 30 70 m region vanderploeg et al 2010 the mean dp and pp concentrations for offshore and nearshore were compared under scenarios with and without mussels fig 6 model results presented similar patterns of phosphorus variations in the nearshore and offshore both characterized by relatively higher pp in spring associated with stimulated primary production and lower pp levels in fall with subsequent mineralization dp concentrations were exactly in the opposite patterns of pp compared to the scenario without mussels simulation results with mussels indicated a higher dp concentration but a lower pp levels for both nearshore and offshore regions suggesting an enhanced conversion from pp to dp in lake michigan influenced by benthic grazing and excretion the ratio of pp to tp has been reported with a continuous decrease from 56 5 in 1983 1987 to 36 2 in 2006 2010 in the southern basin of lake michigan and this portion was found as low as 22 5 on the 10 m water column above the bottom in stratified season barbiero et al 2012 the mean ratio during spring summer months without benthic mussels was determined as 22 2 and 9 3 for the nearshore and offshore respectively according to our model it further dropped to 20 2 2 0 and 8 4 0 9 with mussels considered the decline was particularly clear for the nearshore area in spring from 30 5 to 23 8 influence of mussels in offshore was not as significant as that in nearshore fig 6 phosphorus flux eq 8 between the nearshore and offshore was calculated over the year to evaluate the non local effects of mussels diffusion flux was ignored as it was much smaller compared to the advection flux our model results demonstrated that the nearshore was a pp source to the offshore but a dp sink to the offshore fig 7 a much higher pp transport to the offshore was featured in spring and summer pp transport in southern lake was comparably larger than that in northern basin during spring either due to the higher primary production associated with the first warmup fig 3 or robust interactions between the coastal waters and pelagic waters due to the cyclonic gyre in sub basin of southern lake fig s5 pp transport from nearshore to offshore was substantially boosted in summer in a possible consequence of the formation of stratification which favored the across shore transport in the surface layer where high pp level was observed the pp transport during fall and winter reduced largely along with the going down of primary production the patterns of dp flux generally corresponded to those of pp but in a different scale or direction the vertical decouple of primary production in epilimnion and mineralization in hyplimnion leaded to a high pp dp in the surface and bottom respectively which could contribute to the very opposite pattern between pp and dp as sink or source for nearshore region in summer differently these two fluxes were more consistent in winter given their much uniform vertical distribution in well mixed condition the annual pp transport to the offshore without mussels was estimated as 5700 metric tons year 1 accounting for roughly 19 2 of the total nearshore primary production if the c p was 200 while model results with mussel included yet indicated nearshore was a pp source to the offshore area the net transport was reduced by 1800 metric tons similarly the horizontal transport of dp from offshore to nearshore with benthic mussels was reduced almost by the same amount of the reduction of pp 1800 metric tons fig 8 the mean total phosphorus loads from 1994 to 2008 was around 3500 metric tons per year dolan and chapra 2012 while the cumulative pp reduction to offshore during 2012 from the model was impressive the total reduction of pp to the offshore since the first invasion at two decades ago could be remarkable considering the long term accumulations the altered phosphorus transport with the continuous expansion of these invasive mussels could intensify the vulnerability of the food chain and risk the whole ecosystems of great lakes model simulation results predicted a net pp conversion to dp by the end of year even in the absence of mussels and the offshore showed a much larger conversion rate with less pp concentration predicted this was possibly due to that external tp loads were not considered in our model to focus on the impact of benthic mussels recent studies showed that tributary nutrient loads supported higher chl a lake wide particularly in the nearshore region where tributary nutrient was delivered to rowe and anderson 2017 though their simulated chl a was biased high during the spring season it s conceivable that enhanced photosynthesis with additional nutrient input as well as direct external pp loads would potentially increase the pp transport to the offshore area meanwhile the enhanced primary production due to external loads could in some ways highlight the role of mussels in retaining more pp in the nearshore and mid depth region in both stratified and well mixed seasons with accelerated food delivery from the euphotic layer though mussel density was much more stable currently in lake michigan the phosphorus sink due to mussel biomass assimilation and feces pseudofeces burial could be tremendous the major phosphorus loss from lake michigan is through sediment sequestration chapra and dolan 2012 and the continuous decline in spring total phosphorus since 2000 might suggest an overall larger phosphorus sequestration compared to external loads due to the invasive mussels in all simulation results indicated a less pp transport to the offshore region with 1800 metric tons per year however the impact of nearshore and mid depth mussels on the offshore phosphorus dynamics was possibly underestimated with the assumptions made in our model with the ongoing progress in field experiments and monitoring coverage the process based model could better illustrate the phosphorus cycling and quantify the role of benthic mussels benthic algae e g cladophora was found in an extensive resurgence in great lakes associated with the invasion of mussesls bootsma et al 2012 the growth of benthic algae was stimulated with increased dp through mussel excretion serving as additional phosphorus sink to the whole lake and reducing the phosphorus exchange between nearshore and offshore the resurgence of benthic algae makes it more complex to disentangle the contributions of variable stressors in lake wide ecosystems and brings to a dilemma on lake wide phosphorus loads management when the lake is experiencing an increased nuisance benthic algae production and declined offshore primary production while the impacts of the benthic algae to the phosphorus cycles were little reported in a quantitative way further efforts in developing hydrodynamic biogeochemical model with the benthic algae module coupled was strongly encouraged 4 conclusions the impact of benthic mussels on phosphorus dynamics in lake michigan was investigated by a three dimensional physical biogeochemical model the biophysical model demonstrated the capability in simulating the hydrodynamic and biogeochemical variabilities in lake michigan the physical model was validated against a good range of observations and well reproduced the surface water temperature vertical thermal structure and lake wide circulation the biogeochemical npzdg model successfully reflected the spatial and temporal variations of dp and pp scenario results with and without mussels were compared to discuss their impacts on lake wide phosphorus cycling dynamics our model predicted a significant reduction of phytoplankton in the nearshore area where high colonization of mussels was noted while a higher concentration boundary layer for dp was observed instead an increased hypolimnion ratio of dp and pp was also observed particularly in summer model results suggested an increasing delivery rate of pp in hypolimnion with mussels included at mid depth region and the effective flux was much greater 12 1 times than the passive settling rate for the summer months the nearshore offshore phosphorus transport displayed substantial spatiotemporal variabilities however the nearshore was estimated as an overall source of pp to the offshore from the model simulation results indicated the mussel could effectively reduce the pp transport to the offshore regions potentially risking the pelagic fish abundance by reducing the food availability this

24942,invasive dreissenid mussels have successfully established dense population at nearshore and mid depth regions and significantly altered the ecosystem and food web dynamics in lake michigan in this work we used a high resolution hydrodynamic biogeochemical model to evaluate how these extensively colonized benthic mussels will affect the dynamics of phosphorus cycling in lake michigan model results demonstrated the important role of mussels in re engineering of phosphorus cycling with their filtering and excretion activities causing increasing lake wide ratio of dissolved dp and particulate pp phosphorus the diffusive flux at the bottom of mid depth site was significantly enhanced compared to the sedimentation due to the benthic mussels with an average effective flux 12 1 times greater than the passive setting which was consistent with the field observations nearshore offshore phosphorus transport displayed substantial spatial and temporal variabilities and the nearshore was identified as an overall source sink of pp dp to the offshore region the simulation results with mussels revealed that the mussel could effectively reduce the pp transport to the offshore region potentially risking the pelagic fish abundance this study provides key quantitative estimates for the impact of benthic mussels on vertical pp delivery and lake wide nearshore offshore phosphorus transport and could inform potential ecosystem management strategies of lake michigan and other dreissenid mussel invaded lakes keywords dreissenid mussels phosphorus cycling numerical modelling lake michigan ecosystem 1 introduction invasive dreissenid mussels have successfully established dense population since late 1980s in laurentian great lakes bunnell et al 2009 nalepa et al 2010 these benthic filter feeders have significantly altered the ecosystem of great lakes and nutrient and food web dynamics hecky et al 2004 vanderploeg et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 field observations during pre and post dreissenids periods revealed that the invasion of mussels in great lakes was correlated with decreased phytoplankton abundance and primary production in shallow area where mussel density was extremely high ackerman et al 2001 madenjian 1995 despite the increased water clarity due to filtering activities which favors the photosynthesis across the water column auer et al 2010 limburg et al 2010 following the colonization of zebra mussels in shallow waters quagga mussels have become the dominant dreissenids which successfully managed to maintain a massive density particularly at mid depth 30 70 m regions after 2005 in lake michigan nalepa et al 2009 according to observations at several offshore sites in lake michigan phytoplankton biomass at the deep chlorophyll layer has reduced significantly compared with measurements made before the colonization of mussels fahnenstiel et al 2010 pothoven and fahnenstiel 2013 a concurrent decline of fish stock in pelagic area of great lakes were noted vanderploeg et al 2002 strayer and hattala 2004 nalepa et al 2010 turschak et al 2014 possibly can be attributed to the bottom up control mechanism due to mussel grazing along with the reduction in primary production enhanced dissolved phosphorus dp for the bottom water was observed as a result of mussel excretion dayton et al 2014 the proliferation of benthic algae e g cladophora growth in shallow areas of great lakes was somehow encouraged because of sufficient nutrient supply due to mussel excretion and favorable rocky substrate for massive colonization higgins et al 2008 bootsma and liao 2013 bootsma 2009 impacts of dreissenid mussels were considered to expand beyond nearshore areas where early mussel colonization was found hecky et al 2004 hypothesized that sestons from tributaries or pelagic areas could be captured by benthic mussels and retained in the nearshore area which becomes a net sink for nutrient and energy this may explain the observed lower phosphorus concentration in offshore areas of great lakes in lake michigan these effects may have extended to the mid depth region away from the nearshore due to the more extensive expansions of quagga mussels vanderploeg et al 2010 physical mixing in large stratified lakes is a key process that affects the cycling of nutrient and energy turbulent mixing effectively sets the limits of material exchange rates to and from benthic mussels which serve as major sinks e g of phytoplankton or sources e g of dp of water column constituents earlier studies on the role of dreissenid mussels played in ecosystems of great lakes have focused almost exclusively on shallow 10 m systems ackerman et al 2001 hecky et al 2004 boegman et al 2008 conventional thought is that only in shallow systems that areal grazing rates are comparable to areal phytoplankton production rates as vertical mixing would be sufficient for bottom grazers to access the entire water column within relative short time scales officer et al 1982 koseff et al 1993 boegman et al 2008 this conventional reasoning may need to be re justified with the recent mussel expansion to mid depth offshore areas of lake michigan and other great lakes mixing is generally weak between the epilimnion and hypolimnion at offshore areas during summer stratification which could suppress food delivery to the bottom in a one dimensional system driven by vertical turbulent transport analyses of relative timescales between turbulent mixing and filtration can help to determine whether benthic feeders are limited by turbulent delivery koseff et al 1993 boegman et al 2008 shen et al 2018 long term field observations in great lakes revealed significant decline of phytoplankton during the spring bloom period due to strong turbulent mixing fahnenstiel et al 2010 however no significant biomass reduction was noted in the well mixed surface layer during summer periods pothoven and fahnenstiel 2013 simulation results in lake simcoe suggest stronger storm events could increase flux of particulate organic matters to benthic mussels schwalb et al 2015 highlighting the importance of water column mixing in altering the energy flow for mussel infested lakes while a good amount of field observations in great lakes have been documented for both pre and post dreissenids periods fahnenstiel et al 2010 pothoven and fahnenstiel 2013 it is still challenging to accurately quantify the impact of mussels on the ecosystem as field measurements are too sparse to account for the significant spatial and temporal variabilities of large lakes phosphorus loads and spring total phosphorus tp concentration have declined from 1980 to 2008 with efforts from the phosphorus abatement program in great lakes dolan and chapra 2012 the real impact of invasive mussels is therefore complicated with the in lake tp reduction as it becomes more difficult to disentangle the effects between these two factors at the ecosystem scale process based models that couple hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may effectively address interactions between benthic mussels and ecosystem dynamics in the water column a two dimensional longitudinal vertical hydrodynamic and water quality model ce qual w2 with module of dreissenid mussels included was firstly applied in lake erie and the model predicted 25 30 of algal biomass decrease due to filter feeding activities boegman et al 2008 this model also predicted that mussel excretion may have a greater impact on the ecosystem than the direct grazing of particulate phosphorus pp zhang et al 2008 bocaniov et al 2014 applied a three dimensional biophysical model in lake erie and the results suggest a higher phytoplankton decrease in nearshore area which was consistent with field observations model studies of lake michigan were fewer until very recently results from one dimensional water column models indicated that filtering activities of mussels reduce spring phytoplankton abundance at both east and west mid depth sites of lake michigan rowe et al 2015 shen et al 2018 more scenarios of varying filter feeding intensities could be performed by extending these models to three dimensional such models have implied strong spatial and temporal alternations in both productivity and zooplankton in lake michigan rowe and anderson 2017 pilcher et al 2017 while influence of benthic mussels was generally concluded more straightforwardly through comparisons of phosphorus primary production among model results of different scenarios how mussels affect the dynamics of phosphorus cycling through physical delivery and transport has yet to be quantitatively studied in this study a three dimensional coupled physical and biogeochemical model with benthic mussels included in lake michigan was developed and validated against a range of field observations lake wide dp pp ratio was discussed to evaluate how mussels alter the phosphorus conversion between different forms vertical flux of pp was compared for scenarios with and without mussels nearshore offshore phosphorus transport was calculated to assess the impacts of mussels at the whole lake scale the model results underscore the important role of invasive mussels on ecosystems in great lakes and could inform potential regional watershed management strategies and future studies in similar aquatic systems 2 materials and methods the model for hydrodynamic circulation and mixing was based upon the finite volume community ocean model fvcom fvcom is an unstructured grid finite volume sigma coordinated terrain following ocean model that provides the capability of representing accurately the geometrical complexities that characterize the usually highly irregular water land coastal boundaries such as inlets islands and peninsulas chen et al 2003 fvcom has been successfully implemented in several studies of great lakes and has shown success in reproducing the lake wide physical dynamics at variable time scales chen et al 2004 bai et al 2013 xue and schwab 2015 luo et al 2012 the horizontal unstructured mesh of our model had 10492 nodes and 19813 elements to fully explore the mussel effects to the ecosystem the nearshore shallow area was patched with unstructured mesh with relatively higher resolution 0 8 km length between two cells fig s1 than the offshore area 3 0 km the water column was divided into 30 layers in the vertical direction with higher resolution approaching the surface and bottom to better resolve mixing processes at the boundaries a quadratic stress model near bottom layers was adopted assuming the bottom boundary layer is logarithmic over a roughness height of 0 5 mm vertical mixing was modeled with the mellor yamada k kl turbulence closure scheme as the model focused on simulating state variables on scales of 0 8 3 0 km in the horizontal and 0 2 10 m in the vertical the turbulence mixing parameterizations based on the values of state variables at resolved scales could well represent the small scale mixing processes and advance toward a closed reynolds averaged navier stokes equations supplemental material the background diffusivity and viscosity was set at 1 10 6 m2 s 1 this study attempted to simulate the whole lake michigan since we considered the internal cycles only this model boundary was closed at the straits of mackinac which connects lake michigan and lake huron surrounding tributaries were not included and external phosphorus loads were ignored in this study bathymetry was interpolated onto the mesh with data obtained from the noaa national geophysical data center www ngdc noa a gov mgg greatlakes greatlake html and the minimum depth was set to be 5 0 m model simulation run was conducted for 2012 a typical warm year with little ice cover reported in lake michigan mode split technique was adopted in fvcom for better computing efficiency time step of the external mode was set to 10 s to avoid advective instability according to the courant friedrich levy cfl criterion and the split number was set to 10 which means a 100 s time step for the internal mode we coupled the fvcom with a new water column nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus grazer npzdg biogeochemical model supplemental material diagram 1 the model consists of two phytoplankton groups small size and large size phytoplankton one zooplankton group one nutrient group dp one detritus group and one benthic grazer the biogeochemical npzdg model was extended from the conventional npzd model chen et al 2002 ji and chen 2002 with the additional benthic grazer mussels included metrics for phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus were all configured in terms of the equivalent carbon mass c a fixed carbon phosphorus c p ratio of 200 was adopted according to that reported by bootsma et al 2012 and the raito of chl α c was set to 0 036 fahnenstiel et al 1989 the diagram for transport and transformation of important constituents among different groups as well as the governing equations were described in the supplemental material the biogeochemical model simulated the growth of two distinct phytoplankton groups large and small size with a set of kinetic parameters as listed in table 1 the model used a general monod 1949 growth equation and a michaelis menton type parameterization for phytoplankton growth

model parameters were taken from literature review and field measurements in lake michigan and they were listed in table 1 mussel effects including grazing excretion and egestion were limited to the most bottom layer in the model the grazing on phytoplankton was modeled as the product of the individual clearance rate the population density and the overlying concentration of pp phytoplankton and detritus phytoplankton loss through mussel grazing was modeled as 5 p h y t m p ρ m p h y d σ where m p is the clearance rate per unit mussel mass ml mgdw 1 hr 1 ρ m is the mussel density per unit

through interpolation of observations at 144 sites in 2010 which was used in our simulation for 2012 fig 1 assuming no significant variations of mussel colonization during the subsequent two years following 2010 mussel biomass was not treated as a state variable and was assumed to stay in an equilibrium state the individual clearance rate represented as the volume of water filtered per unit dry weight mussel was modeled by an empirical formula from tyner et al 2015 according to their laboratory experiments on mussels collected in lake michigan the formula is temperature dependent and does not take the mussel size into account 6 m p m 1 exp m 2 t m l m g d w 1 h r 1 in which m p is individual clearance rate t is temperature m 1 and m 2 are the fitted coefficients table 1 egested feces and pseudofeces were treated as additional inputs to the bottom detritus pool other processes such as sediment burial and resuspension were not considered in the present model field observations in nearshore area of lake michigan derived a ratio of 65 35 for mussel egestion and excretion after grazing bootsma et al 2012 hence it was assumed that 65 of the filtered food particles were egested and went into the bottom detritus pool in our model and the other portion was considered as the contribution to the dp pool through mussel excretion bottom roughness for scenario runs with and without benthic mussels was assumed to be constant to focus on the potential impacts of filter feeding to the phosphorus cycling in lake michigan the physical model was forced with air sea momentum and heat flux meteorological data were obtained from the north american regional reanalysis narr database which is a 32 km resolution and 3 hourly interval dataset derived from the ncep eta meteorological model with assimilation of observational data from surface upper atmosphere and remote sensing sources including great lakes buoy data and satellite derived surface temperature the variables included 10 m winds air temperature relative humidity and total cloud cover these data were interpolated to the mesh nodes and were used to calculate surface heat flux including shortwave longwave sensible and latent radiation following the methods described by beletsky and schwab 2001 specifically the upward longwave sensible and latent heat flux as the surface boundary forcing for temperature simulation were calculated prognostically with the instantaneous predicted water surface temperature from the model to well account for the high frequency of air sea interaction shortwave radiation was treated as a source term in the temperature transport equation which warms up the water column ratio of the longwave radiation in the yellow to infrared and shortwave radiation in green to ultraviolet components was set as 0 55 0 45 with their extinction coefficients as 2 85 and 0 28 m 1 respectively rucinski et al 2010 vertical and horizontal fluxes were calculated to explore how the mussels would affect the physical phosphorus transport in a quantitative way the total vertical fluxes of pp includes passive settling f s and the turbulent diffusive flux f d and they can be formulated as 7 f s w

advection flux of phosphorus between the nearshore and offshore could be parameterized as eq 8 8 f v n ˆ p a where f is the horizontal phosphorus flux v is the velocity at the boundary cell n ˆ is the perpendicular unit vector a is the cell area p is the phosphorus concentration the model was forced to run three seasons of 2011 when ice coverage was little with the initial conditions of dp large phytoplankton small phytoplankton zooplankton detritus set as 0 1 mmol p m 3 0 5 mmol c m 3 0 2 mmol c m 3 0 5 mmol c m 3 and 8 0 mmol c m 3 respectively rowe and anderson 2017 the output at the end of year 2011 was selected as the initial condition for year 2012 i e hot start we also calibrated the model by comparing simulations with observational data e g temperature surface and bottom chl a fig s2 in 2011 model results of hydrodynamics and biogeochemical state variables were further validated through a number of field measurements in 2012 field measurements at a mid depth site 55 m fig 1 of west lake michigan were conducted in 2012 including the deployment of thermistor chains and a bottom mounted acoustic doppler current profiler adcd 250 khz that measured temperature and current velocities respectively troy et al 2016 water samples were collected with the niskin bottles for water quality analysis mosley and bootsma 2015 additional observational data including water surface temperature and meteorological data were obtained from the national ocean and atmospheric administration noaa buoys 45 007 and 45 002 in south and north lake michigan www ndbc noaa gov fig 1 annual united states environmental protection agency us epa great lakes monitoring program provided vertical resolved water quality measurements at multiple offshore sites in lake michigan www epa gov greatlakes monitoring data proj fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical results simulated lake surface water temperature well reproduced observations made in year 2012 in lake michigan compared with observations from sub basin buoys south 45007 north 45002 and satellite image data the model presented reasonable skills in reproducing seasonal variations of surface water temperature featured with continuous increase since spring peaking in the summer and following decrease after september fig s3 the difference between simulation results and observations represented as root mean square error rmse is small with 1 23 1 34 and 1 02 c respectively for two buoys and lake average temperature notably the abrupt lake wide surface temperature decrease in august was accurately captured by the model while prediction results generally matched well with observations during year 2012 bias between model results and field observations exists particularly in spring when the water body began to warm up both model results and satellite images showed significant variations of surface water temperature given its tremendous surface area fig s4 water temperature started to warm up in southern lake michigan and northwest green bay area in may water surface temperature in september reached the maximum with less spatial variations the west coast in summer is characterized by strong and frequent upwelling events downwelling in the east under combined effects of dominant southern wind and earth rotation beletsky and schwab 2001 model results presented a lower surface temperature along the west coast than that from satellite measurements fig s4 possibly suggesting an overestimation of upwelling magnitude modeled vertical thermal structure at the 55 m site 42 9797 n 87 6658 w during summer was compared with field measurements between july and september 2012 fig s5 the model demonstrated its ability in reproducing the gradual stratification and the overturn convection in the vertical water column a thermocline at 15 m depth in the summer was noted both from field observations and model simulations model simulation and field observations both displayed a deepening thermocline in middle august due to a strong downwelling event which was reported by troy et al 2016 while field observations showed a rather sharp temperature gradient between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion the model predicted a much diffusive one which was regarded as a common problem in most three dimensional simulations in great lakes beletsky and schwab 2001 and may not be improved by increasing the vertical resolution or decreasing time steps a possible explanation was that some vertical mixing mechanisms such as the langmuir circulation are not well resolved and represented in general hydrodynamic circulation models beletsky et al 2006 model results displayed a stable cyclonic gyre in the lake wide depth averaged currents structure throughout the winter season fig s6 this feature was especially clear in the southern basin and its central sub basin which was consistent with the long term observations and previous model simulations in lake michigan beletsky et al 2006 beletsky and schwab 2001 luo and wang 2012 compared to the winter currents the circulation in summer was less organized as the density driven currents complicated the hydrodynamics of strong stratified water in summer beletsky and schwab 2001 the strong northern wind associated with the weak lake stratification in winter leaded to a greater depth averaged currents velocity i e 3 1 cm s 1 compared to 1 2 cm s 1 averaged in summer we also compared the modeled currents above the benthic mussels with the field observations at the 55 m site fig s7 and the simulations well reproduced the bottom currents and successfully captured the abrupt currents speed increase during the downwelling events in middle august meanwhile both simulated currents and field observations were dominated by oscillating currents at a near inertial period 18 h which has been reported by troy et al 2016 3 2 biogeochemical results model performance on biogeochemical simulations was examined by comparing the simulated results with mussels with field measurements from epa monitoring program in spring and summer of 2012 fig 2 the model showed fair skills rmse 0 35 μg l 1 correlation r 0 76 p 0 001 in capturing the chl a concentrations at the 10 epa offshore monitoring sites in lake michigan chl a was more uniform under spring isothermal conditions although surface chl a concentration was overall slightly higher both simulations and field observations presented a much greater chl a concentrations in the surface layer in august spatial variations of modeled chl a at these offshore sites however were not as significant as observed ones and model results overall underestimated the chl a concentrations while it is always difficult to validate a biogeochemical model on sites and date specific basis especially for large systems with great spatial heterogeneity as lake michigan it is likely that the fixed chl a c ratio adopted in the model may partially account for the biased predictions the model well simulated the vertical profiles of june pp at the mid depth site 55 m near the west coast fig 2 the summer vertical profile was featured with a relatively high pp concentration in the surface mixed layer with a peak value around the thermocline while the model was not able to reproduce a gradient as sharp as that measured one in the metalimnion 20 30 m depth where pp decreased dramatically the bottom low concentrations were accurately captured by the model generally modeled vertical pp profile showed that mussels filter feeding can create a 25 m thick bottom layer with reduced pp at this site as compared to the scenario where mussels were excluded from the model in the layer from the bottom to 5 m above pp was reduced by about 50 vertical variability of observed dp at the 55 m site was not as significant as pp with slight increase 23 in the bottom fig 2 while simulated dp were comparable to the observational data a larger dp gradient was predicted by the model characterized by relatively higher dp concentrations in the bottom possibly attributed to microbial remineralization of detritus the scenario with mussels included displayed even higher dp concentrations corresponding to the lower pp levels and suggesting that filtration and excretion activities of these benthic mussels can enhance the phosphorus transition from particulate forms to dissolved forms lake wide depth averaged phytoplankton biomass demonstrated significant spatial variations as simulated by the model much higher spring phytoplankton biomass was observed in the shallow nearshore area fig 3 where water column was first warmed up and photosynthesis process was further fueled with sufficient nutrient supply and increasing light intensity phytoplankton growth at offshore bottom was suppressed due to limited light leading to a significant low depth averaged biomass concentration phytoplankton biomass was in a relatively lower level for the entire lake in summer considering nutrient was mostly consumed in the surface after spring bloom and the replenishment from deep hypolimnion was suppressed by stratification the biomass in nearshore yet remained high with comparably strong vertical transport in shallow waters simulation results also revealed a higher biomass concentration in summer along the west coast than the east which could be a consequence of frequent upwelling events on the west side that carry nutrient rich water from hypolimnion and provide a cooler environment for phytoplankton growth optimal temperature is 16 20 c to evaluate impacts of mussels filter feeding differences in phytoplankton biomass between the scenarios with and without mussels normalized by that without mussels were presented in fig 3 i e the percentage of biomass reduction in spring when the water column was well mixed mussels were able to access the full water column and phytoplankton biomass reduction was significant at shallow and mid depth region where mussel density is high water column biomass reduction was over 50 at the shallow locations with the highest mussel colonization reduction at other shallow areas was approximately 25 little differences were noted at offshore deep areas model results showed an overall phytoplankton reduction in summer as well albeit not as significant as that during the spring period which suggested that stratification to a certain degree could limit their grazing on phytoplankton discrepancy of summer scenarios was less strictly proportional to the density of benthic mussels as that in spring and it seems resulted from other indirect effects of mussels like the grazing by different abundance of zooplankton photosynthesis with variable nutrient supply it should also be noted that model results with mussels indicated certain slight increases in phytoplankton biomass in the north lake michigan and green bay areas fig 3 while zooplankton concentration at these locations did not display much significant change dissolved nutrient concentrations were comparably higher likely due to mussel excretion and subsequent advective transport in other words phytoplankton growth fueled by excreted nutrient may exceed the negative grazing effect under certain conditions model results revealed a strong impacts of mussels on dp and phytoplankton biomass at mid depth areas fig 4 significant growth of phytoplankton was noted in late spring and early summer phytoplankton biomass in hypolimnion was in an extremely low level throughout the whole summer due to limited photosynthesis and vertical exchange summer dp distribution pattern was exactly opposite to the phytoplankton with much higher concentrations in the hypolimnion compared to the scenario without mussels phytoplankton reduction was vertically uniform in spring associated with great vertical mixing the reduction was found to be only limited in the hypolimnion during summer as delivery of phytoplankton from the euphotic zone to the hypolimnion was largely restricted phytoplankton biomass actually increased slightly in the epilimnion with mussels it is worth mentioning that our model predicted an average of 14 reduction of zooplankton in the 55 m site as a result of less phytoplankton available which was consistent with the negative effects of mussels on zooplankton from field observations dricoll et al 2015 dp concentrations were found to be higher with mussels over the entire water column even during the stratification overall model results indicated an increase ratio of dp and pp in the hypolimnion at the mid depth regions where mussels are abundant confirming the role of benthic mussels in altering the phosphorus conversion between the particulate and dissolved forms 3 3 particulate phosphorus delivery effective settling rate of pp eq 7 with and without mussels at the mid depth region was examined to discuss their grazing impact to pp delivery fig 5 model results demonstrated a decreasing settling flux from top 5 m to bottom 53 m across the water column as pp originated from the surface productive layers were generally mineralized to dissolved form in the bottom scenario results with benthic mussels displayed greater differences in top bottom passive settling flux ratios of vertical diffusion and sedimentation at 2 m above the bottom 53 m depth displayed significant variations over the seasons mid spring e g april and mid summer june and july were noted with relatively larger eddy diffusivity according to the model leading to overall higher diffusive fluxes at bottom scenario run without mussels was characterized by negative diffusive fluxes at bottom given that pp concentration at bottom was generally higher compared to that of overlying layers due to continuous sedimentation differently though pp at bottom with benthic mussels particularly in summer was in a low level resulting in relatively low passive settling fluxes the enhanced vertical diffusion associated with mussel filtration was clearly illustrated with a much sharper decrease of pp in the hypolimnion fig 2 the mean food delivery rate from june to september was estimated as 12 1 times greater than the passive settling with mussels included which was consistent with that derived indirectly from field observations 11 0 times at the same site with a sediment trap at about 2 m above the mussel bed mosley and bootsma 2015 the mean modeled diffusive flux at bottom was estimated as 80 4 μmol p m 2 d 1 and the passive settling flux was 7 2 μmol p m 2 d 1 somewhat lower compared to that derived from short term observational data 215 and 19 5 μmol p m 2 d 1 which could either due to underestimated mean phytoplankton biomass without external loads or sinking velocity eddy diffusivity or both generally the summer diffusion flux exceeded the passive sedimentation in the mid depth site particularly over the summer hypolimnion region reaching the thermocline the enhanced diffusive flux in hypolimnion suggested the benthic mussels could increase the pp delivery and reduce the pp residence time over the water column 3 4 nearshore offshore transport impact of mussels was nonetheless remarkable on phosphorus cycling dynamics in the nearshore area the remaining low phosphorus levels in offshore water were possibly due to the phosphorus retention and altered export pathways as a result of invasive mussels in the nearshore and mid depth area in this study we applied the 75 m isobaths fig 1 as the boundary between nearshore and offshore regions considering that the quagga mussels have successfully invaded the mid depth 30 70 m region vanderploeg et al 2010 the mean dp and pp concentrations for offshore and nearshore were compared under scenarios with and without mussels fig 6 model results presented similar patterns of phosphorus variations in the nearshore and offshore both characterized by relatively higher pp in spring associated with stimulated primary production and lower pp levels in fall with subsequent mineralization dp concentrations were exactly in the opposite patterns of pp compared to the scenario without mussels simulation results with mussels indicated a higher dp concentration but a lower pp levels for both nearshore and offshore regions suggesting an enhanced conversion from pp to dp in lake michigan influenced by benthic grazing and excretion the ratio of pp to tp has been reported with a continuous decrease from 56 5 in 1983 1987 to 36 2 in 2006 2010 in the southern basin of lake michigan and this portion was found as low as 22 5 on the 10 m water column above the bottom in stratified season barbiero et al 2012 the mean ratio during spring summer months without benthic mussels was determined as 22 2 and 9 3 for the nearshore and offshore respectively according to our model it further dropped to 20 2 2 0 and 8 4 0 9 with mussels considered the decline was particularly clear for the nearshore area in spring from 30 5 to 23 8 influence of mussels in offshore was not as significant as that in nearshore fig 6 phosphorus flux eq 8 between the nearshore and offshore was calculated over the year to evaluate the non local effects of mussels diffusion flux was ignored as it was much smaller compared to the advection flux our model results demonstrated that the nearshore was a pp source to the offshore but a dp sink to the offshore fig 7 a much higher pp transport to the offshore was featured in spring and summer pp transport in southern lake was comparably larger than that in northern basin during spring either due to the higher primary production associated with the first warmup fig 3 or robust interactions between the coastal waters and pelagic waters due to the cyclonic gyre in sub basin of southern lake fig s5 pp transport from nearshore to offshore was substantially boosted in summer in a possible consequence of the formation of stratification which favored the across shore transport in the surface layer where high pp level was observed the pp transport during fall and winter reduced largely along with the going down of primary production the patterns of dp flux generally corresponded to those of pp but in a different scale or direction the vertical decouple of primary production in epilimnion and mineralization in hyplimnion leaded to a high pp dp in the surface and bottom respectively which could contribute to the very opposite pattern between pp and dp as sink or source for nearshore region in summer differently these two fluxes were more consistent in winter given their much uniform vertical distribution in well mixed condition the annual pp transport to the offshore without mussels was estimated as 5700 metric tons year 1 accounting for roughly 19 2 of the total nearshore primary production if the c p was 200 while model results with mussel included yet indicated nearshore was a pp source to the offshore area the net transport was reduced by 1800 metric tons similarly the horizontal transport of dp from offshore to nearshore with benthic mussels was reduced almost by the same amount of the reduction of pp 1800 metric tons fig 8 the mean total phosphorus loads from 1994 to 2008 was around 3500 metric tons per year dolan and chapra 2012 while the cumulative pp reduction to offshore during 2012 from the model was impressive the total reduction of pp to the offshore since the first invasion at two decades ago could be remarkable considering the long term accumulations the altered phosphorus transport with the continuous expansion of these invasive mussels could intensify the vulnerability of the food chain and risk the whole ecosystems of great lakes model simulation results predicted a net pp conversion to dp by the end of year even in the absence of mussels and the offshore showed a much larger conversion rate with less pp concentration predicted this was possibly due to that external tp loads were not considered in our model to focus on the impact of benthic mussels recent studies showed that tributary nutrient loads supported higher chl a lake wide particularly in the nearshore region where tributary nutrient was delivered to rowe and anderson 2017 though their simulated chl a was biased high during the spring season it s conceivable that enhanced photosynthesis with additional nutrient input as well as direct external pp loads would potentially increase the pp transport to the offshore area meanwhile the enhanced primary production due to external loads could in some ways highlight the role of mussels in retaining more pp in the nearshore and mid depth region in both stratified and well mixed seasons with accelerated food delivery from the euphotic layer though mussel density was much more stable currently in lake michigan the phosphorus sink due to mussel biomass assimilation and feces pseudofeces burial could be tremendous the major phosphorus loss from lake michigan is through sediment sequestration chapra and dolan 2012 and the continuous decline in spring total phosphorus since 2000 might suggest an overall larger phosphorus sequestration compared to external loads due to the invasive mussels in all simulation results indicated a less pp transport to the offshore region with 1800 metric tons per year however the impact of nearshore and mid depth mussels on the offshore phosphorus dynamics was possibly underestimated with the assumptions made in our model with the ongoing progress in field experiments and monitoring coverage the process based model could better illustrate the phosphorus cycling and quantify the role of benthic mussels benthic algae e g cladophora was found in an extensive resurgence in great lakes associated with the invasion of mussesls bootsma et al 2012 the growth of benthic algae was stimulated with increased dp through mussel excretion serving as additional phosphorus sink to the whole lake and reducing the phosphorus exchange between nearshore and offshore the resurgence of benthic algae makes it more complex to disentangle the contributions of variable stressors in lake wide ecosystems and brings to a dilemma on lake wide phosphorus loads management when the lake is experiencing an increased nuisance benthic algae production and declined offshore primary production while the impacts of the benthic algae to the phosphorus cycles were little reported in a quantitative way further efforts in developing hydrodynamic biogeochemical model with the benthic algae module coupled was strongly encouraged 4 conclusions the impact of benthic mussels on phosphorus dynamics in lake michigan was investigated by a three dimensional physical biogeochemical model the biophysical model demonstrated the capability in simulating the hydrodynamic and biogeochemical variabilities in lake michigan the physical model was validated against a good range of observations and well reproduced the surface water temperature vertical thermal structure and lake wide circulation the biogeochemical npzdg model successfully reflected the spatial and temporal variations of dp and pp scenario results with and without mussels were compared to discuss their impacts on lake wide phosphorus cycling dynamics our model predicted a significant reduction of phytoplankton in the nearshore area where high colonization of mussels was noted while a higher concentration boundary layer for dp was observed instead an increased hypolimnion ratio of dp and pp was also observed particularly in summer model results suggested an increasing delivery rate of pp in hypolimnion with mussels included at mid depth region and the effective flux was much greater 12 1 times than the passive settling rate for the summer months the nearshore offshore phosphorus transport displayed substantial spatiotemporal variabilities however the nearshore was estimated as an overall source of pp to the offshore from the model simulation results indicated the mussel could effectively reduce the pp transport to the offshore regions potentially risking the pelagic fish abundance by reducing the food availability this

fitness of populations on different hosts this may be due to host to host dispersal and gene flow from one potentially diversifying population to another and to the different host plant based populations being at an early stage of the specialization and diversification process from the population viewpoint performance could be addressed by means of demographic parameters estimated in the framework of matrix population models caswell 2001 when an insect species uses more than one host variations may be expected in the reproductive output on each host which are projected into the population dynamics of individuals developing on such hosts these studies should be based on the assessment of biotic and abiotic environmental variables which characterize the hosts used and the estimation of the finite rate of increase λ an average proxy of fitness through modelling the demographic dynamics of the insect on such hosts charlesworth 1980 caswell 1983 2001 larsson et al 2000 awmack and leather 2002 treehoppers hemiptera membracidae are sap feeding insects that depend entirely on their host for feeding development mating and oviposition in various genera of treehoppers this dependence is reflected in host specialization leading to a synchrony between the insect s life cycle and host phenology wood and olmstead 1984 wood 1993b sattman and cocroft 2003 some treehopper species are solitary and immature individuals do not receive parental care while others display subsocial behaviors such as maternal care and feeding facilitation by the female godoy et al 2006 lin 2006 torrico bazoberry et al 2014 which play a key role in the survival of the offspring tallamy and schaefer 1997 hence variation in maternal care across hosts may be part of what determines differences in fitness or group performance alchisme grossa fairmaire membracidae shows a neotropical distribution and belongs to the tribe hoplophorionini whose members display maternal care and nymphal aggregation without mutualistic interactions with ants camacho et al 2014 torrico bazoberry et al 2014 in general the genus alchisme uses solanaceous plants as hosts a fact which has been linked to plant chemistry mckamey and deitz 1996 pinto et al 2016 in the cloud forests of the bolivian yungas a grossa utilizes two hosts occurring in sympatry brugmansia suaveolens humb and bonpl ex wild bercht and c presl and solanum ursinum rusby both solanaceae which represent phenotypically and probably ecologically different substrates for the development of the insects pinto 2015 pinto et al 2016 torrico bazoberry et al 2014 2016 females of a grossa ovipositing on these two hosts exhibit maternal care with egg and nymph guarding active antidepredatory defense and feeding facilitation cohorts on a given host show low dispersion and tend to move within their natal host as shown by mark recapture and female oviposition studies torrico bazoberry et al 2014 pinto 2015 we hypothesize that maternal care should be more important on hosts with higher predation risk for the offspring different intensities of maternal care may involve trade offs reflected in the performance of groups living on a given host these interactions might be illustrated by an mpm approach to evaluate whether each host represents a unique selective context where two populations of a grossa are potentially experiencing a differentiation process we documented biotic and abiotic microenvironmental variables on each host and characterized family performance behavioral traits related to subsociality and demographic parameters of cohorts estimated for the mpm 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection we collected data from a grossa on b suaveolens bs and s ursinum su during the rainy season at incachaca cochabamba bolivia 17 13 s 65 49 w 2450 m a s l within the yungas biogeographical region twenty two field trips were performed from december 12 2012 to april 24 2013 during the first field trip we chose recently oviposited cohorts and tagged families on each plant with a plant code and the petiole of leaves containing treehopper families with a leaf code the number of families on each plant varied from 1 to 10 we momentarily removed the adult female from each family to measure the length and width of her egg mass and to mark her on the right side of the pronotum with a permanent marker we measured egg masses with a gmc 190 goldtool digital caliper 0 1 mm precision and estimated the number of eggs in each mass based on its size following the model described by torrico bazoberry et al 2016 2 2 life cycle duration life cycle of a grossa involves seven stages egg 5 nymphal instars and adult to characterize life cycle parameters of a grossa we monitored all tagged families once every 5 days between 11 00 and 14 00 h following torrico bazoberry et al 2016 and recorded the number and development stage instar of nymphs we compared the total duration of immature stages i e duration in days after the egg mass was marked until offspring reached the adult stage of those families that successfully completed preimaginal development n 22 on bs n 18 on su between hosts using the student s t test we also compared the duration of each developmental stage between hosts using the mann whitney test 2 3 microenvironmental variables we evaluated the following microenvironmental biotic variables a number of parasite mites on mothers and nymphs b abundance and richness of predators and c herbivory using a herbivory index dirzo and domínguez 1995 with data obtained on a single day in february midway in the study period on 10 randomly chosen leaves of each marked plant the herbivory index hi was based on the categorization of the leaves by a single person in one of the following categories of herbivory foliar damage 0 no herbivory 1 1 5 leaf area removal 2 6 12 3 13 25 4 26 50 5 51 100 domínguez and dirzo 1995 hi was estimated as σ xi ni n where xi herbivory category ni number of leaves on the category x and n total number of leaves studied hi was considered as an indirect measure of competition between a grossa and other phytophagous insects i e folivores we compared the hi per plant between hosts using the student s t test we compared the abundance and diversity of predators per plant jointly expressed as the brillouin index and the mean number of parasitic mites per family i e on the female and on the nymphs observed during all the observation periods between hosts using the mann whitney test we evaluated microenvironmental abiotic variables luminosity temperature and relative humidity using a light meter lutron lx 101 and a thermocouple extech positioned 2 cm below the underside of tagged leaves to characterize the microenvironment around each insect family we performed two different measurements per leaf between 11 00 and 14 00 h throughout the study we characterized the abiotic microenvironment of each family by the mean values of temperature relative humidity and luminosity using this data we compared microenvironmental parameters between families on the two hosts using mann whitney tests all analyses were performed with sigmaplot 12 0 systat software inc 2012 2 4 insect performance we compared the performance of a grossa between hosts through the following parameters using each individual plant as the experimental unit a the proportion of families that completed development successful families i e the number of families whose nymphs completed development number of initial marked families b the total number of adult offspring per initial family i e the total number of adult offspring counted per plant initial number of reproductive females marked and c the total number of adult offspring per family that had completed development we performed the comparisons using mann whitney tests for the first two variables and a student s t test for the last one 2 5 demographic analysis since the first and second nymphal instars are not mobile and depend completely on maternal care for survival torrico bazoberry et al 2014 we combined them into a single stage for modelling population dynamics by means of mpms additionally we combined third fourth and fifth nymphal instars into a single stage since they are mobile stages which do not completely depend on maternal care for survival but complete their life cycle on the same individual plant where they were born torrico bazoberry et al 2014 thus we modelled the life cycle of a grossa as a 4 stage lefkovitch matrix egg e nymphs 1 n1 first and second nymphal instars nymphs 2 n2 third fourth and fifth nymphal instars and adult a caceres sanchez et al 2017 we only considered the female component of the population following caswell 2001 and multiplying the number of eggs nymphs 1 nymphs 2 and adults by the female proportion on each host 0 56 on bs and 0 54 on su pinto 2015 caceres sanchez et al 2017 we constructed 29 four stage demographic matrixes 13 for bs and 16 for su one for each individual plant with data from all marked families on that plant caswell 2001 caceres sanchez et al 2017 these matrixes included the following demographic parameters fecundity of adults fa the survival rates or probabilities of surviving and remaining at the same stage stasis for an egg nymphs 1 nymphs 2 and adult se sn1 sn2 and sa respectively and the growth rates or probabilities of surviving and reaching the next stage growth for an egg nymphs 1 and nymphs 2 ge gn1 and gn2 respectively we determined adult fecundity fa as the average number of eggs deposited by the females on each individual plant we estimated stasis and growth parameters following caswell 2001 and compared female fecundity between hosts using the student s t test we constructed an individual mpm for each plant we conducted an analysis using poptools hood 2010 to obtain λ a value calculated as the dominant eigenvalue λ1 of the population projection matrix caswell 2001 hood 2010 we calculated the mean λ values for a grossa ovipositing on bs and su using each plant as a replicate we then performed comparisons of λ values between hosts using the student s t test to evaluate if λ values could be explained by any of the abiotic microenvironmental i e temperature relative humidity and luminosity or biotic i e predator diversity brillouin s index parasitism number of parasitic mites per family or indirect competition herbivory index variables at the plant level we performed 12 general linear model analyses glm considering λ as the dependent variable and each of the environmental variables as the predictor variable for each host separately i e 12 glm arise from 6 variables in 2 hosts we performed glm analyses using statistica 10 0 statsoft inc 2001 2 6 sociality we estimated the duration of maternal care by each marked a grossa female as the total number of days that the female was observed next to her offspring then we performed spearman correlation tests on families of a grossa on each host to assess the relationship between the duration of maternal care as a proxy of subsociality and the number of nymphs at each stage hatched nymphs second instar nymphs and third instar nymphs as proxies of offspring survival also we compared the duration of maternal care between hosts using mann whitney tests considering a the total duration of maternal care as described above and b the duration of maternal care minus the duration of the egg stage thus considering only maternal care duration after the eggs hatched the latter comparison was performed because the total duration of maternal care could be biased by the development stage of the egg mass when the family was marked we repeated correlation analyses taking into consideration the absence of egg mass duration to evaluate if patterns were maintained 3 results 3 1 life cycle duration we marked 120 families 69 on bs and 51 on su total duration of immature stages of successful families differed between hosts t 3 08 d f 38 p 0 0038 and was longer on bs table 1 duration of the egg stage and first nymphal instar differed between hosts u 103 5 p 0 01 and u 124 5 p 0 043 respectively both being longer on bs 3 2 insect performance there was no significant difference between hosts in the proportion of successful families table 2 there was no significant difference between hosts in the total number of adult offspring per initial family i e total number of adult offspring initial number of marked females or in the total number of adult offspring per family i e total number of adult offspring number of families whose offspring survived to produce adult offspring adult fecundity number of eggs female number of eggs per female of successful families and number of hatched nymphs per female did not differ between hosts table 2 the number of eggs per female of successful families and the number of hatched nymphs per female did not differ significantly this indicates that the starting condition i e eggs laid or first instar nymphs did not differ between hosts thus excluding a possible bias in the other performance parameters 3 3 microenvironmental variables abiotic luminosity temperature and relative humidity and biotic abundance and diversity of predators per plant and herbivory index traits differed between hosts except for mean abundance of mites per family table 3 eight predator morphospecies were found on both hosts four species of spiders aranae and four insect species the assassin bug hemiptera reduviidae the lady beetle coleoptera coccinellidae the elaterid coleoptera elateridae semiotus sp and the wasp hymenoptera vespidae none of these species were exclusive to a given host however predator diversity and abundance were higher on bs table 3 none of the 12 glm analyses were statistically significant p 0 05 suggesting that none of these microenvironmental variables explained λ values 3 4 demographic analysis finite rates of increase λ were 1 013 0 031 mean sd on bs and 1 021 0 039 mean sd on su there was no statistical difference in λ between hosts t 0 56 d f 27 p 0 58 3 5 sociality significant correlations were observed between maternal care duration and the number of hatched nymphs bs r 0 79 p 0 01 n 69 su r 0 45 p 0 01 n 51 second instar nymphs bs r 0 78 p 0 01 n 69 su r 0 57 p 0 01 n 51 and third instar nymphs bs r 0 73 p 0 01 n 69 su r 0 49 p 0 01 n 51 similar statistical patterns were obtained after repeating the analyses using maternal care duration after egg hatching on both hosts the correlation coefficients r increased in all cases hatched nymphs bs r 0 79 p 0 01 n 69 su r 0 58 p 0 01 n 51 second instar nymphs bs r 0 87 p 0 01 n 69 su r 0 66 p 0 01 n 51 and third instar nymphs bs r 0 82 p 0 01 n 69 su r 0 60 p 0 01 n 51 there were no significant differences in the duration of maternal care between hosts considering either total duration u 1393 p 0 051 or only data after egg hatching u 1617 p 0 42 maternal care extended from the first to third nymphal stages in both hosts after this point nymphs formed mixed aggregations along the main stem of the plants several mothers practically abandoned the host plant after the third nymphal stage of their families 4 discussion the mean duration of the life cycle in cohorts of a grossa was higher on bs than on su this could be due to the differences observed in microenvironmental traits evaluated on both hosts or to the effect of host features e g chemical traits affecting insect fitness ecology and biology as has been demonstrated in several phytophagous insects futuyma and moreno 1988 jaenike 1990 wood 1993a microenvironmental temperatures were higher on su than on bs since the rate of development of ectothermic organisms increases with temperature at their breeding site the total time to reach maturity is reduced charnov and gillooly 2003 kingsolver and huey 2008 a faster development time would be expected for a grossa on su than on bs the biotic environment around each host also suggests that su is a better host than bs since diversity and abundance of a grossa predators differed between hosts and were around three and five times respectively lower on su than on bs a potential factor counteracting these costs for a grossa living on bs is the higher competition for resources on su which had a higher herbivory index the difference in life cycle duration could potentially affect the reproductive isolation of groups living on each host some treehoppers which use alternative hosts show differences in traits such as life cycle duration and signals involved in mate recognition which can interfere with a free interchange or breeding of individuals from such alternative hosts wood et al 1999 lin and wood 2002 cocroft et al 2008 2010 alchisme grossa living on alternative hosts have low vagility i e they show a tendency to stay on the same plant where they were born pinto 2015 and developmental asynchrony torrico bazoberry et al 2014 although this could be a consequence of reproductive isolation barriers it may also represent a phenotypically plastic behavior in the development of this treehopper species in this latter case the effects of assortative mating may easily break down when even just a small number of individuals move between hosts this was observed in mark recapture studies particularly with individuals which developed on bs pinto 2015 and is reinforced by the lack of genetic structure in insects using both hosts pinto 2015 the proxies of performance of a grossa evaluated in this study did not differ between hosts consistent with the absence of differences in demographic parameters since host quality affects diverse traits of phytophagous insects e g fecundity survivorship when an insect species uses more than one host variations may be expected in the reproductive output on each host such variations may in turn project into the population dynamics of individuals developing on such different hosts studies of these interactions under natural conditions are relatively scarce especially in the neotropical region thus this work becomes one of the few examples of population dynamics in phytophagous insects developing on different hosts larsson et al 2000 awmack and leather 2002 garcía robledo and horvitz 2011 species within the hoplophorionini have the highest degree of maternal investment among treehoppers mckamey and deitz 1996 maternal care has been shown to be crucial to offspring survival in the hoplophorionini species umbonia crassicornis amyot serville the absence of females led to a four fold increase in predator success cocroft 2002 in a grossa female removal led to 100 offspring mortality torrico bazoberry et al 2014 in the present study significant positive correlations were found between maternal care duration and the number of eggs and of two nymphal stages on both hosts thus reinforcing the idea that maternal protection may have evolved as a means of decreasing offspring mortality and enhancing female fitness tallamy and schaefer 1997 torrico bazoberry et al 2016 three different lines of arguments suggest that individuals of a grossa used in these studies constitute a single treehopper population that uses two different sympatric hosts i a grossa individuals accept both hosts and feed on any of them pinto 2015 ii evolutionary processes such as natural selection are operating in the same direction on both hosts torrico bazoberry et al 2016 and iii no genetic structure has been detected on insects living and developing on each host pinto 2015 nevertheless this single population of a grossa showed a difference in life cycle duration between hosts it is possible that colonization of one of these hosts probably b suaveolens pinto 2015 might be a recent event and evolutionary processes that promote ecological adaptation and hence demographic or performance differences have not yet become noticeable this situation contrasts with that in the enchenopa binotata complex in which population divergence has been shown wood et al 1999 and host

24943,the mechanisms which promote divergence in populations of phytophagous insects using alternative hosts depend on the characterization of hosts as different selective scenarios and the modeling of the demographic dynamics of the insect on those hosts in the bolivian yungas forests the treehopper alchisme grossa hemiptera membracidae utilizes two sympatric solanaceae hosts brugmansia

hosts and 4 demographic parameters of cohorts living under natural conditions on both hosts using matrix population modelling the life cycle was longer on b suaveolens than on s ursinum microenvironmental abiotic and biotic traits differed between hosts nevertheless performance did not differ between hosts and no differences between hosts were found in demographic parameters none of

into consideration the absence of egg mass duration to evaluate if patterns were maintained 3 results 3 1 life cycle duration we marked 120 families 69 on bs and 51 on su total duration of immature stages of successful families differed between hosts t 3 08 d f 38 p 0 0038 and was longer on bs table 1 duration of the egg stage and first nymphal instar differed between hosts u 103 5 p 0 01 and u

and number of hatched nymphs per female did not differ between hosts table 2 the number of eggs per female of successful families and the number of hatched nymphs per female did not differ significantly this indicates that the starting condition i e eggs laid or first instar nymphs did not differ between hosts thus excluding a possible bias in the other performance parameters 3 3 microenvironmental variables abiotic luminosity temperature and relative humidity and biotic abundance and diversity of predators per plant and herbivory index traits differed between hosts except for mean abundance of mites per family table 3 eight predator morphospecies were found on both hosts four species of spiders aranae and four insect species the assassin bug hemiptera reduviidae the lady beetle coleoptera coccinellidae the elaterid coleoptera elateridae semiotus sp and the wasp hymenoptera vespidae none of these species were exclusive to a given host however predator diversity and abundance were higher on bs table 3 none of the 12 glm analyses were statistically significant p 0 05 suggesting that none of these microenvironmental variables explained λ values 3 4 demographic

after egg hatching u 1617 p 0 42 maternal care extended from the first to third nymphal stages in both hosts after this point nymphs formed mixed aggregations along the main stem of the plants several mothers practically abandoned the host plant after the third nymphal stage of their families 4 discussion the mean duration of the life cycle in cohorts of a grossa was higher on bs than on su this could be due to the differences observed in microenvironmental traits evaluated on both hosts or to the effect of host features e g chemical traits affecting insect fitness ecology and biology as has been demonstrated in several phytophagous insects futuyma and moreno 1988 jaenike 1990 wood 1993a microenvironmental temperatures were higher on su than on bs since the rate of development of ectothermic organisms increases with temperature at their breeding site the total time to reach maturity is reduced charnov and gillooly 2003 kingsolver and huey 2008 a faster development time would be expected for a grossa on su than on bs the biotic environment around each host also suggests that su is a better host than bs since diversity and abundance of a grossa predators differed between hosts and were around three and five times respectively lower on su than on bs a potential factor counteracting these costs for a grossa living on bs is the higher competition for resources on su which had a higher herbivory index the difference in life cycle duration could potentially affect the reproductive isolation of groups living on each host some treehoppers which use alternative hosts show differences in traits such as life cycle duration and signals involved in mate recognition which can interfere with a free interchange or breeding of individuals from such alternative hosts wood et al 1999 lin and wood 2002 cocroft et al 2008 2010 alchisme grossa living on alternative hosts have low vagility i e they show a tendency to stay on the same plant where they were born pinto 2015 and developmental asynchrony torrico bazoberry et al 2014 although this could be a consequence of reproductive isolation barriers it may also represent a phenotypically plastic behavior in the development of this treehopper species in this latter case the effects of assortative mating may easily break down when even just a small number of individuals move between hosts this was observed in mark recapture studies particularly with individuals which developed on bs pinto 2015 and is reinforced by the lack of genetic structure in insects using both hosts pinto 2015 the proxies of performance of a grossa evaluated in this study did not differ between hosts consistent with the absence of differences in demographic parameters since host quality affects diverse traits of phytophagous insects e g fecundity survivorship when an insect species uses more than one host variations may be expected in the reproductive output on each host such variations may in turn project into the population dynamics of individuals developing on such different hosts studies of these interactions under natural conditions are relatively scarce especially in the neotropical region thus this work becomes one of the few examples of population dynamics in phytophagous insects developing on different hosts larsson et al 2000 awmack and leather 2002 garcía robledo and horvitz 2011 species within the hoplophorionini have the highest degree of maternal investment among treehoppers mckamey and deitz 1996 maternal care has been shown to be crucial to offspring survival in the hoplophorionini species umbonia crassicornis amyot serville the absence of females led to a four fold increase in predator success cocroft 2002 in a grossa female removal led to 100 offspring mortality torrico bazoberry et al 2014 in the present study significant positive correlations were found between maternal care duration and the number of eggs and of two nymphal stages on both hosts thus reinforcing the idea that maternal protection may have evolved as a means of decreasing offspring mortality and enhancing female fitness tallamy and schaefer 1997 torrico bazoberry et al 2016 three different lines of arguments suggest that individuals of a grossa used in these studies constitute a single treehopper population that uses two different sympatric hosts i a grossa individuals accept both hosts and feed on any of them pinto 2015 ii evolutionary processes such as natural selection are operating in the same direction on both hosts torrico bazoberry et al 2016 and iii no genetic structure has been detected on insects living and developing on each host pinto 2015 nevertheless this single population of a grossa showed a difference in life cycle duration between hosts it is possible that colonization of one of these hosts probably b suaveolens pinto 2015 might be a recent event and evolutionary processes that promote ecological adaptation and hence demographic or performance differences have not yet become noticeable this situation contrasts with that in the enchenopa binotata complex in which population divergence has been shown wood et al 1999 and host

24944,climate models predict increased drought conditions for the mediterranean region putting forests under increasing risk from direct or indirect effects of droughts on the other hand increasing co2 and longer growing seasons could compensate the negative impacts of more intense droughts on forest productivity and carbon sequestration furthermore large areas of mediterranean forests are relatively young and unmanaged and maturing usually tends to decrease carbon sequestration we conducted a simulation study to explore the interplay between climate co2 and maturing on forest net primary production npp and net ecosystem production nep over the 2000 2100 period we used the not only tree grass notg model which is individual based process oriented and spatially explicit we applied the model to the font blanche experimental site a typical mixed mediterranean forest dominated by aleppo pines and holm oaks simulations under three climate scenarios current moderate change severe change suggest that npp could be enhanced by climate change both due to higher co2 and longer growing seasons on the other hand nep would only be temporarily enhanced by climate change the largest effect however was a decrease of nep over time for all scenarios due to forest maturing with heterotrophic respiration progressively catching up with npp this implies that regardless of climate change the sink capacity of large unmanaged forest areas in southern europe could strongly diminish during the 21st century keywords carbon sequestration drought font blanche spatial heterogeneity net primary production water stress 1 introduction mediterranean regions are identified as hot spots of climate change cramer et al 2018 the mediterranean biome currently occupies less than 5 of the planet surface this surface could increase with climate change klausmeyer and shaw 2009 but represents 20 of the biodiversity of vascular plants cowling et al 1996 according to climate projections for that region precipitations are likely to decrease which combined with increasing temperatures will increase drought intensity giorgi and lionello 2008 this degradation of growing conditions is likely to have negative impacts on forest production and carbon sequestration as has already been observed in the eastern mediterranean sarris et al 2007 especially since mediterranean forests are for a large part only extensively managed or unmanaged and therefore adaptive capacity is limited lindner et al 2010 according to these authors the associated increase in fire risk makes mediterranean forests the most vulnerable in europe rainfall exclusion experiments provide some insights on the future impact of climate change they usually show an increase in water stress and a decrease of tree growth or productivity cinnirella et al 2002 ogaya and peñuelas 2007 misson et al 2010 these experiments however do not include the increase in co2 which can partially alleviate water stress by improving water use efficiency and could actually compensate to some extent the increase in drought ainsworth and long 2005 keenan et al 2013 the increase in temperature could also have a positive effect by lengthening the growth period fu et al 2014 although it has been shown to negatively impact net ecosystem production nep the difference between gross primary productivity and ecosystem co2 emission in the form of respiration in recent years fernández martínez et al 2019 while applying both drying and warming treatments to whole forest stands is unpractical models offer the possibility to investigate the forest response to various levels of climate change with the inclusion or not of the co2 effect older climate scenarios sometimes did not involve a decrease in rainfall leading to simulations predicting a positive effect of climate change sabaté et al 2002 further enhanced by higher co2 rathgeber et al 2003 more recent studies using scenarios that involved a decrease in precipitation and that included the effect of higher co2 davi et al 2006 simioni et al 2008 keenan et al 2011 2013 confirmed that higher co2 could alleviate drought effects including gea izquierdo et al 2017 which covered a comprehensive range of sites in southern europe all these studies focused on monospecific forests and have investigated the effects of climate change mainly on tree productivity climate change effects on heterogeneous forests have not been studied as much and in general little has been done in assessing the full forest carbon budget response in the mediterranean at the same time large forest areas in southern europe are relatively recent and result from tree recolonization after land abandonment as forest nep decreases as a forest reaches a mature state litvak et al 2003 bond lamberty et al 2004 peichl et al 2010 one could expect that these mediterranean forests composed of relatively young trees will display a decrease in their carbon sink capacity during the 21st century in this study we aimed at assessing the effects of climate change on a mixed mediterranean forest of pinus halepensis mill and quercus ilex l representative of large areas in southern europe recently recolonized following land abandonment we specifically addressed the following questions can the increase in co2 and in the growing season compensate the drying effects of changes in precipitation and temperature both on plant productivity and nep what are the relative influences of forest maturing and climate change on the future carbon sink capacity to achieve this we conducted a simulation study on the well documented experimental forest of font blanche in south east france because of the mixed and heterogeneous nature of that forest we applied the 3d individual based model notg simioni et al 2016 which also permitted to explore the importance of accounting for the spatial structure for predicting future forest carbon budget we focused on the ecosystem response to changes in climate and co2 evidently other factors such as fire or pest outbreaks could affect plant productivity and carbon sequestration 2 materials and methods 2 1 the notg model notg not only tree grass simioni et al 2016 is a spatially explicit individual based model designed to simulate the carbon and water budgets of spatially complex ecosystems explicitly accounting for ecosystem spatial structure and multispecific canopies it is especially suited to study the effects of the competition between individual plants for light and water the model can be parameterized in different ways to accommodate different plant types soils and climates notg has been described in detail in simioni et al 2016 thereafter is a summary the spatial scale is the ecosystem plot which size is user defined 25 25 m for typical simulations with current computers space is divided into pixels of typically 1 1 m also user defined and above and below ground strata strata number and depths can be set according to the studied ecosystem the combination of pixels and strata forms a three dimensional 3d grid comprising vegetation above ground and soil below ground voxels trees are assumed to have cylindrical foliage and root crowns which can occupy several above and below ground layers over several pixels tree leaves and roots are distributed in above and below ground voxels according to overlap coefficients between crown cylinders and voxels depending on plant dimensions and positions a voxel can contain leaves or roots of different individuals the time scale is one to a few years with a sub daily or daily timestep depending on the processes modelled entities at the finest level are the leaves in above ground voxels and roots and soil in below ground voxels at the plant level are individual plants and at the ecosystem level are the soil and species notg is a synthesis of a comprehensive set of processes the radiation transfer is based on the turbid medium analogy surface leaves or soil water transfer and temperature are computed through an energy budget both radiation and energy budgets were modelled after the ratp model sinoquet et al 2001 within the energy budget leaf stomatal conductance is governed by the jarvis equation jarvis 1976 that includes a water stress coefficient linked to soil available water photosynthesis is computed with the model of farquhar et al 1980 and is therefore influenced by air co2 absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and leaf temperature at the plant level partitioning of c between plant pools is constrained by allometric relationships between the biomass of each pool and stem diameter at breast height dbh and by phenology pool senescence is governed by phenology leaves or simple senescence coefficients other pools there is plasticity in c allocation between leaves and fine roots in relation to water stress plants can also be parameterized to take up water from deeper soil layers during periods of water stress interactions between individual plants are indirect in the form of symmetric e g plants have equal access to water in a soil voxel where their roots are present or asymmetric competition e g a taller tree shades a lower one notg requires forcing variables for climate air co2 and atmospheric pressure in the form of a climate file daily climate data include daily rainfall global radiation minimum and maximum air temperatures and minimum and maximum air relative humidities sub daily data are also required for wind speed air temperature and air relative humidity soil organic matter som decomposition is modelled independently in each pixel after the century model parton et al 1987 using the version of kirschbaum and paul 2002 which incorporates features to provide better predictions for forests including additional woody litter pools n immobilization in the resistant pool and n uptake through mycorrhizae the model tracks c and n in som pools with different decomposition rates mineralized n results from som decomposition and can be taken up by plants notg computes n partitioning within the different plant pools and n is returned to som with pool senescence in a previous study simioni et al 2016 notg outputs were thoroughly tested against observations available for the font blanche forest site these comparisons were made for individual tree growth and water potential gap fraction litterfall soil moisture and evapotranspiration they attested of the model realism and stressed the importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneity in such a mixed forest 2 2 the metamodel version notg requires a lot of computing power which makes it awkward to use for long term simulations marie and simioni 2014 proposed a method to produce a meta model more suitable to long term simulations for this study we used a new meta model of notg more appropriate than the one presented in marie and simioni 2014 this new meta model is better at handling dense canopies sun daily course and importantly the range of climate change conditions used in this study as opposed to marie and simioni 2014 when building this meta model we found better results with multiple regressions with interactions to the fourth degree than with neural networks we compared the outputs of simulations over 100 years from this new meta model against the previous one presented in marie and simioni 2014 and notg we used a virtual forest plot of 10 10 m populated by three pines and three oaks the small plot size facilitated the simulation with notg figure s1 supplementary materials shows that the new meta model mimics very precisely the output of notg this new metamodel still requires around 12 h for a 100 year simulation 2 3 study site and model parameterization the mixed heterogeneous forest of font blanche 43 14 27 n 5 40 45 e 420 m elevation 625 mm annual rainfall 16 1 w m 2 average daily global radiation and 13 7 c average temperature is a typical low altitude mediterranean ecosystem situated on thick limestone bedrock in south east france it is composed of a top stratum 13 m dominated by aleppo pines pinus halepensis mill an intermediate stratum 6 m dominated by holm oaks quercus ilex l and a shrub stratum measurements include meteorology eddy covariance sap fluxes soil moisture leaf water potential stem diameter increment soil respiration gap fraction a descriptor of leaf area index and litter fall site operation started in 2007 font blanche is part of the icos integrated carbon observation system and anaee france analysis and experimentation on ecosystems networks this forest is representative of areas recently recolonized by pinus halepensis following land abandonment after the second world war this forest type represent around 24 of the volume and 20 of the surface of french mediterranean forests inventaire forestier national 2010 apart from the exceptions described below most assumptions as well as parameter values for site soil and plants were the same as in simioni et al 2016 see table 2 for details on species parameters in particular the understorey was not simulated we assumed that its contribution to the water and carbon cycle was negligible compared to the dominating species and plant n concentrations were fixed meaning that we did not account for the n feedback between soil and plants soil organic matter decay rates were parameterized as in kirschbaum and paul 2002 however while in simioni et al 2016 plant dimensions were fixed in the present simulations height as well as foliage and root crown dimensions increased with growth we used the following allometric equations which were obtained from tree measurements made at font blanche unpublished data height h m was computed as h 6 02 1 698 ln dbh for pinus halepensis h 2 45 1 54 ln dbh for quercus ilex where dbh is diameter at breast height cm for coppice height is computed from the stem with the largest dbh foliage crown radius canrad m was computed as canrad 0 4532 e0 1445 h for p halepensis canrad 0 4563 e0 2634 h for q ilex height of the base of the foliage crown was computed as a ratio of total height 0 437 for pines and 0 27 for oaks 2 4 simulation plan we performed 24 simulations covering 3 climate scenarios 4 forest plots and accounting or not for vegetation spatial structure we considered three climate scenarios a baseline based on current climate without trend in temperature rainfall or co2 over time and one moderate and one severe climate change scenarios respectively b1 and a2 from the sres family the font blanche forest displays large spatial variations in pine oak ratio and basal area because of the difficulty of running the model over large forest plots we used four 24 24 m plots reconstructed from field data using stem coordinates and stem diameters at breast height in the field those four plots are not contiguous but were chosen to encompass the range of structures observed in the field either dominated by q ilex or by p halepensis or a balanced mixture with high or low basal area the simulation maps of those plots are presented in fig 1 for investigating the importance of the vegetation spatial structure for each plot and climate scenarios we ran one simulation that uses the 3d matrix of voxels 3d and one that lumps all trees in a single pixel only detailing the vertical layers 1d the latter is also named mean field as all trees have equal and complete access to light and water resources albeit for the effects of the vertical distribution of the foliage the 3d simulations on the opposite segregates tree canopies and root crowns in space each tree competing essentially with its nearest neighbors and therefore account for gaps between trees the 3d simulation was run with the meta model see above with a voxel size of 1 1 2 m the same that was used to compare notg to field data in simioni et al 2016 however the meta model is by nature designed to be run for a specific voxel size so the 1d simulations were done with notg with a pixel size of 24 24 m and vertical layers of 2 m note that in 1d mode notg is very fast 2 5 climate scenarios meteorological measurements at font blanche only started in 2007 for air temperature air humidity precipitation and wind speed we established regressions between data measured at font blanche since 2007 and those measured at the nearest weather stations registered at meteo france castellet la ciotat and cuges details on these regressions can be found in the supplementary materials using these regressions we reconstituted weather data for font blanche using measurements from those three stations as far back as they were available we thus obtained a series of 17 years of climate data from 1993 to 2009 in this series the average annual precipitation is 625 mm and the average minimum and maximum temperatures are 10 1 and 17 2 c respectively since a climate change trend is present in this series each year of the 100 year baseline climate was randomly chosen among the series of 17 the co2 was constant for this scenario at 369 5 ppm a value measured in 2000 the starting year of the simulations climate change trends provided by the ipcc 2007 for the area where the font blanche forest is located are given in table 1 because there are significant variations in elevation and climate within this area we did not use climate projections directly but instead climate change scenarios were constructed by superimposing to the baseline climate trends in temperature precipitation co2 and specific air humidity corresponding to sres scenarios b1 and a2 2 6 initialization of soil carbon pools to accurately predict heterotrophic respiration it is paramount to initialize properly the different soil organic matter pools before running the simulations soil carbon pools result from long term processes and thus are tightly dependent on past land use knowledge of past land use at font blanche is limited until the end of the second world war it most probably was used as a holm oak coppice regularly cut to provide fuel and where sheep herds were allowed to graze after the last clear cut it was mostly left unused until today allowing p halepensis to colonize the coppice in addition to accounting for past land use we faced the challenge of initializing soil carbon pools spatial variations as well first we ran notg in 1d mode for an oak coppice with a leaf area index of 0 85 using the baseline climate while keeping plant pools constant for a period long enough to reach an equilibrium between plant and soil carbon pools over 4000 years in our case it consisted in running the same simulation over and over keeping the plant pools constant but transferring the final soil organic matter pools from one simulation to the start of the next one equilibrium was assessed when those pools did not change between iterations this stage allowed to reach a balance between plant and soil carbon pools as it could have been around 1950 secondly we ran a 3d simulation with the meta model over 50 years still using the baseline climate but starting with the carbon pools obtained in the first stage this stage was repeated for each forest plot this allowed to have different carbon pools in the different soil pixels the final soil c pools thus obtained were then used as initial values for the 3d simulations for the 1d simulations soil c pools of each plot were summed to initialize the single soil pixel 2 7 output variables this study focuses on the carbon budget therefore we focused the analysis on predicted net primary production npp carbon emissions due to soil organic matter decomposition i e heterotrophic respiration rh and carbon sequestration as nep the difference between npp and rh as we wanted to assess the importance of extended growth period and drought intensity we defined the growth period as the number of days when foliage or other organs can grow each year to assess changes in drought level we defined the duration of intense drought each year as for each tree the number of days when the water stress index reached values of 0 1 or lower i e when water stress alone reduced stomatal conductance by 90 or more as the growth period and intense drought duration are likely to have antagonistic effects on plant productivity and are also likely to increase under climate change we defined the effective growth period as the growth period minus the intense drought duration 3 results from the 3d simulation under the baseline climate i e current climate predicted npp rh and nep displayed a strong interannual variability but also varied over the course of the century fig 2 npp increased during the first 20 years from 9 8 t c ha 1 year 1 the first 5 years and then remained at a similar level the rest of the century around 13 1 t c ha 1 year 1 rh initially well below npp increased progressively for about 60 years before stabilizing at values much closer to npp as a result nep the difference between npp and rh decreased from around 5 2 t c ha 1 year 1 the first 25 years down to around 1 3 t c ha 1 year 1 after 60 70 years during the second half of the century predicted nep was negative some years comparing the 3d simulation under climate change to the 3d simulation under the baseline climate we found that npp increased with climate change fig 2 the effect being stronger under scenario a2 there was also a positive effect of climate change on rh again stronger for the most severe scenario the increase in rh with climate change however was initially lower than that of npp and progressively became larger as a result nep increased temporarily under climate change before returning to the same average level as the baseline average change of 0 16 and 0 12 t c ha 1 year 1 under the b1 and a2 scenarios respectively for the last 20 years this transient positive effect of climate change on nep was initially larger and lasted longer under the b1 scenario under the a2 scenario the transient positive effect lasted around 50 years one effect of this scenario was an increase in interannual variability with alternating years with increasingly stronger positive and negative effects over the whole simulated period the number of years when the forest was a source of carbon negative nep was 4 under the baseline and b1 scenarios and 7 under the a2 scenario under the baseline climate trees experienced more days under intense water stress with time fig 3 and climate change increased further the number of days with intense water stress this increase was higher under the a2 scenario for q ilex on the driest years this increase was as high as two and a half months of additional intense drought and nearly two months for p halepensis 3d simulations also showed that under the baseline climate for both q ilex and p halepensis the effective growth period decreased over time accompanied by a higher inter annual variability fig 4 the effective growth period was longer for q ilex as this species experienced less intense drought days than p halepensis climate change tended to increase the effective growth period for q ilex except for strong decreases on very dry years for p halepensis the effect of climate change was positive on average but to a much lower extent than for q ilex for both species the effect was more important under the a2 scenario when combining all 3d simulations for both p halepensis and q ilex there was a clear positive relationship between npp and the effective growth period fig 5 for p halepensis npp was also positively related to atmospheric co2 a trend that was not predicted for q ilex for p halepensis npp during the first 20 years did not follow the same relationship displaying lower npp values comparing the 3d and 1d simulations it appeared that ignoring the spatial structure of the vegetation led to an overestimation of the total npp from around 1 1 t c ha 1 year 1 the first 10 years down to no or little effect after 30 years and with little difference between climate scenarios fig 6 heterotrophic respiration was little but positively affected by the spatial structure by an average of 0 3 t c ha 1 year 1 fig 6 the resulting figure for nep was an overestimation in the 1d simulations the first years 1 2 t c ha 1 year 1 the first 10 years down to 0 3 t c ha 1 year 1 the last 40 years these patterns were not affected by climate change npp at the species level was strongly impacted by the spatial structure the 1d simulations showing a positive bias for p halepensis and a negative bias for q ilex when compared to the 3d simulations fig 7 these biases in productivity increased over time and were stronger under climate change reaching values of 3 1 t c ha 1 year 1 for p halepensis and 3 1 t c ha 1 year 1 for q ilex over the last 20 years under the a2 scenario 4 discussion 4 1 accounting for the spatial structure matters in mixed species forests many studies have already highlighted the influence of the spatial organization of plants on ecosystem function e g pacala and deutschman 1997 simioni et al 2003 kobayashi et al 2012 yet when predicting forest carbon budget response to climate change modelling studies have mostly focused on monospecific forests using models that do not include spatial patterns and as a result knowledge about mixed species forests is lacking reyer 2015 simulating mixed species is complex as it requires a model able to render competition between species for resources and it often implies that the forest structure is heterogeneous this requires the use of spatially explicit process based models such as notg in fact previous studies on the font blanche forest showed that the composition and structure of the forest can influence the partitioning of light simioni et al 2013 and productivity simioni et al 2016 between species the later also showed that ignoring the vegetation spatial structure led to discrepancies in predictions of water stress at the individual and species levels these studies focused on current climate conditions in the present work we showed that not accounting for vegetation spatial structure had an effect on forest npp rh and nep over a century that diminished over time probably because as the forest matured its spatial heterogeneity was less pronounced trees occupied more space and tended to fill the gaps however the strongest effect of spatial structure was on each species npp therefore if predictions at the species level are important e g for assessing ecosystem services that are specific to some species e g biofuel for q ilex vs pulp for p halepensis then accounting for the spatial structure is all the more necessary the difference between 3d and 1d comes from the fact that in 1d the asymmetry of the competition for light is increased in 3d more light reaches the oak layer through gaps in the pine layer in 1d the gaps are ignored and pines intercept more light and less remains for the oaks underneath and this effect is amplified other time as light interception is converted to photosynthesis growth and new leaf area which will condition new light interception these results confirm those of simioni et al 2016 who found that for a shorter period simulations accounting for the spatial structure gave better predictions of growth water potential gap fraction and evapotranspiration than simulations ignoring it this raises concern about the accuracy of predictions issued from models which are not spatially explicit which are the most widely used when dealing with heterogeneous forests 4 2 the maturing of the forest has a stronger effect than climate change our simulations suggest that the font blanche forest is still in a transitory phase and could accumulate more carbon both in plants and soil than in its current state as it will mature npp will stabilize in a synthesis of recent trends in forest productivity charru 2012 did not find any significant trend in the productivity of p halepensis stands in south east france however the studied period only partially overlaps ours from 2000 to 2005 she also concluded that under climate change p halepensis forests could see their productivity increase or decrease depending on the interplay between temperature rise that species being limited under low temperatures and water constraints therefore her study does not contradict nor support our results rh would follow the same trend as npp as it is fueled by more litter but with a delay this means that while the predicted current i e early 21 st century nep is high it could strongly decrease other time from 5 2 down to 1 3 t c ha 1 year 1 as rh catches up with npp this decrease is much larger than the predicted positive effect of climate change on nep therefore according to those simulations the main driver of carbon storage for this type of forest would be its own dynamics rather than climate change a large part of forests in southern france have a similar history as that of font blanche that is areas relatively recently colonized by p halepensis following land abandonment if they remain unmanaged it is to be expected that as they mature during the 21st century their nep will decrease this maturation phase during the first 20 years was probably why those years did not follow the same relationship between pine npp and effective growth season length fig 5 as npp was then also limited by the developmental stage of the forest the increase in npp as the forest matured was essentially the result of pine growth data not shown which probably explains why the relationship between oak npp and effective growth period was not different during the first 20 years 4 3 productivity increases despite longer droughts a temperature change higher than 2 c could entail changes in mediterranean land ecosystems that are unmatched in the holocene a period which displayed strong rainfall deficits guiot and cramer 2017 hence it is critical to investigate any factor that could alleviate the negative effects of increasing droughts the fertilizing effect of co2 is well documented keenan et al 2014 from various approaches such as free air co2 experiments norby and zak 2011 or controlled condition experiments kimball et al 1993 however the extent and duration of this effect remains a debate as other limitations such as nutrient availability körner 2006 can occur the resulting response to climate change therefore depends on the interplay of different factors which can result in positive or negative outcomes still including or not co2 in simulations changes dramatically the nature of the predicted forest response to climate change reyer 2015 including for mediterranean forest productivity gea izquierdo et al 2017 another important aspect is the potential increase in the growth period as temperature increases e g fu et al 2014 and this could be particularly important for p halepensis which is sensitive to low temperatures and that is in south east france at the northern limit of its biogeographical distribution charru 2012 in our simulations both higher co2 and longer growth period contributed to the increase in npp under climate change the longer effective growth period was the main factor for q ilex higher co2 by stimulating photosynthesis also contributed to the higher npp of p halepensis under climate change therefore these simulations suggest that these two factors could over compensate the negative effects of increased water stress on npp they confirm the trends predicted in previous studies for forests under mediterranean climate davi et al 2006 simioni et al 2008 gea izquierdo et al 2017 the lack of effect of higher co2 on q ilex could mean that photosynthesis was more limited by light for that species which occupies the lower stratum actually the predicted amount of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the oaks per unit of leaf surface was on average 45 of that of pines data not shown as the model does not incorporate mortality explicitly especially damages caused by xylem embolism martin st paul et al 2017 it remains to be tested whether these trends would be similar if such processes were accounted for so far no xylem embolism has been observed at font blanche despite the recent extreme droughts of 2016 and 2017 data not shown nonetheless in light of our results it is likely that future extreme events will be worse and investigating how hydraulic limitations would impact npp and nep under climate change should be a high priority another aspect that we did not account for is plant allometric plasticity q ilex trees have been observed to respond to a repeated decrease in rainfall by reducing their leaf area thus reducing water loss and maintain productivity limousin et al 2009 martin st paul et al 2013 including such plasticity would likely lead to lower water stress while progressive nutrient limitation is often mentioned as a counteracting factor against co2 fertilization the mechanisms involved in nutrient cycling are complex e g higher temperatures can also accelerate n mineralization kirschbaum 2004 and this potential limitation remains a matter of debate johnson 2006 although we plan to include n cycling in future studies we assumed that n was not likely to be limiting in the font blanche forest where n deposition is likely to increase in the future probst et al 2017 4 4 climate change is only temporarily beneficial to carbon sequestration the predicted positive effect of climate change on npp was progressively offset over time by the positive effect of climate change on rh this effect was caused by both increased respiration rates and higher litter transfer to soil organic matter as npp increased the resulting effect on carbon sequestration was only temporarily positive before switching to neutral and this switch occurred earlier for the most severe scenario 5 conclusion our most important results were that 1 the main change in the future carbon budget of the font blanche forest could be a decrease in carbon sequestration as the forest matures 2 climate change by lengthening the growing season and in addition with co2 fertilization could have a positive effect on net primary productivity a modest transitory positive effect on carbon storage but at the same time will tremendously increase the duration of intense droughts which could threaten tree hydraulic integrity and 3 not accounting for the vegetation spatial structure could lead to exaggerated water stress

24944,climate models predict increased drought conditions for the mediterranean region putting forests under increasing risk from direct or indirect effects of droughts on the other hand increasing co2 and longer growing seasons could compensate the negative impacts of more intense droughts on forest productivity and carbon sequestration furthermore large areas of mediterranean forests are relatively young and unmanaged and maturing usually tends to decrease carbon sequestration we conducted a simulation study to explore the interplay between climate co2 and maturing on forest net primary production npp and net ecosystem production nep over the 2000 2100 period we used the not only tree grass notg model which is individual based process oriented and spatially explicit we applied the model to the font blanche experimental site a typical mixed mediterranean forest dominated by aleppo pines and holm oaks simulations under three climate scenarios current moderate change severe change suggest that npp could be enhanced by climate change both due to higher co2 and longer growing seasons on the other hand nep would only be temporarily enhanced by climate change the largest effect however was a decrease of nep over time for all scenarios due to forest maturing with heterotrophic respiration progressively catching up with npp this implies that regardless of climate change the sink capacity of large unmanaged forest areas in southern europe could strongly diminish during the 21st century keywords carbon sequestration drought font blanche spatial heterogeneity net primary production water stress 1 introduction mediterranean regions are identified as hot spots of climate change cramer et al 2018 the mediterranean biome currently occupies less than 5 of the planet surface this surface could increase with climate change klausmeyer and shaw 2009 but represents 20 of the biodiversity of vascular plants cowling et al 1996 according to climate projections for that region precipitations are likely to decrease which combined with increasing temperatures will increase drought intensity giorgi and lionello 2008 this degradation of growing conditions is likely to have negative impacts on forest production and carbon sequestration as has already been observed in the eastern mediterranean sarris et al 2007 especially since mediterranean forests are for a large part only extensively managed or unmanaged and therefore adaptive capacity is limited lindner et al 2010 according to these authors the associated increase in fire risk makes mediterranean forests the most vulnerable in europe rainfall exclusion experiments provide some insights on the future impact of climate change they usually show an increase in water stress and a decrease of tree growth or productivity cinnirella et al 2002 ogaya and peñuelas 2007 misson et al 2010 these experiments however do not include the increase in co2 which can partially alleviate water stress by improving water use efficiency and could actually compensate to some extent the increase in drought ainsworth and long 2005 keenan et al 2013 the increase in temperature could also have a positive effect by lengthening the growth period fu et al 2014 although it has been shown to negatively impact net ecosystem production nep the difference between gross primary productivity and ecosystem co2 emission in the form of respiration in recent years fernández martínez et al 2019 while applying both drying and warming treatments to whole forest stands is unpractical models offer the possibility to investigate the forest response to various levels of climate change with the inclusion or not of the co2 effect older climate scenarios sometimes did not involve a decrease in rainfall leading to simulations predicting a positive effect of climate change sabaté et al 2002 further enhanced by higher co2 rathgeber et al 2003 more recent studies using scenarios that involved a decrease in precipitation and that included the effect of higher co2 davi et al 2006 simioni et al 2008 keenan et al 2011 2013 confirmed that higher co2 could alleviate drought effects including gea izquierdo et al 2017 which covered a comprehensive range of sites in southern europe all these studies focused on monospecific forests and have investigated the effects of climate change mainly on tree productivity climate change effects on heterogeneous forests have not been studied as much and in general little has been done in assessing the full forest carbon budget response in the mediterranean at the same time large forest areas in southern europe are relatively recent and result from tree recolonization after land abandonment as forest nep decreases as a forest reaches a mature state litvak et al 2003 bond lamberty et al 2004 peichl et al 2010 one could expect that these mediterranean forests composed of relatively young trees will display a decrease in their carbon sink capacity during the 21st century in this study we aimed at assessing the effects of climate change on a mixed mediterranean forest of pinus halepensis mill and quercus ilex l representative of large areas in southern europe recently recolonized following land abandonment we specifically addressed the following questions can the increase in co2 and in the growing season compensate the drying effects of changes in precipitation and temperature both on plant productivity and nep what are the relative influences of forest maturing and climate change on the future carbon sink capacity to achieve this we conducted a simulation study on the well documented experimental forest of font blanche in south east france because of the mixed and heterogeneous nature of that forest we applied the 3d individual based model notg simioni et al 2016 which also permitted to explore the importance of accounting for the spatial structure for predicting future forest carbon budget we focused on the ecosystem response to changes in climate and co2 evidently other factors such as fire or pest outbreaks could affect plant productivity and carbon sequestration 2 materials and methods 2 1 the notg model notg not only tree grass simioni et al 2016 is a spatially explicit individual based model designed to simulate the carbon and water budgets of spatially complex ecosystems explicitly accounting for ecosystem spatial structure and multispecific canopies it is especially suited to study the effects of the competition between individual plants for light and water the model can be parameterized in different ways to accommodate different plant types soils and climates notg has been described in detail in simioni et al 2016 thereafter is a summary the spatial scale is the ecosystem plot which size is user defined 25 25 m for typical simulations with current computers space is divided into pixels of typically 1 1 m also user defined and above and below ground strata strata number and depths can be set according to the studied ecosystem the combination of pixels and strata forms a three dimensional 3d grid comprising vegetation above ground and soil below ground voxels trees are assumed to have cylindrical foliage and root crowns which can occupy several above and below ground layers over several pixels tree leaves and roots are distributed in above and below ground voxels according to overlap coefficients between crown cylinders and voxels depending on plant dimensions and positions a voxel can contain leaves or roots of different individuals the time scale is one to a few years with a sub daily or daily timestep depending on the processes modelled entities at the finest level are the leaves in above ground voxels and roots and soil in below ground voxels at the plant level are individual plants and at the ecosystem level are the soil and species notg is a synthesis of a comprehensive set of processes the radiation transfer is based on the turbid medium analogy surface leaves or soil water transfer and temperature are computed through an energy budget both radiation and energy budgets were modelled after the ratp model sinoquet et al 2001 within the energy budget leaf stomatal conductance is governed by the jarvis equation jarvis 1976 that includes a water stress coefficient linked to soil available water photosynthesis is computed with the model of farquhar et al 1980 and is therefore influenced by air co2 absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and leaf temperature at the plant level partitioning of c between plant pools is constrained by allometric relationships between the biomass of each pool and stem diameter at breast height dbh and by phenology pool senescence is governed by phenology leaves or simple senescence coefficients other pools there is plasticity in c allocation between leaves and fine roots in relation to water stress plants can also be parameterized to take up water from deeper soil layers during periods of water stress interactions between individual plants are indirect in the form of symmetric e g plants have equal access to water in a soil voxel where their roots are present or asymmetric competition e g a taller tree shades a lower one notg requires forcing variables for climate air co2 and atmospheric pressure in the form of a climate file daily climate data include daily rainfall global radiation minimum and maximum air temperatures and minimum and maximum air relative humidities sub daily data are also required for wind speed air temperature and air relative humidity soil organic matter som decomposition is modelled independently in each pixel after the century model parton et al 1987 using the version of kirschbaum and paul 2002 which incorporates features to provide better predictions for forests including additional woody litter pools n immobilization in the resistant pool and n uptake through mycorrhizae the model tracks c and n in som pools with different decomposition rates mineralized n results from som decomposition and can be taken up by plants notg computes n partitioning within the different plant pools and n is returned to som with pool senescence in a previous study simioni et al 2016 notg outputs were thoroughly tested against observations available for the font blanche forest site these comparisons were made for individual tree growth and water potential gap fraction litterfall soil moisture and evapotranspiration they attested of the model realism and stressed the importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneity in such a mixed forest 2 2 the metamodel version notg requires a lot of computing power which makes it awkward to use for long term simulations marie and simioni 2014 proposed a method to produce a meta model more suitable to long term simulations for this study we used a new meta model of notg more appropriate than the one presented in marie and simioni 2014 this new meta model is better at handling dense canopies sun daily course and importantly the range of climate change conditions used in this study as opposed to marie and simioni 2014 when building this meta model we found better results with multiple regressions with interactions to the fourth degree than with neural networks we compared the outputs of simulations over 100 years from this new meta model against the previous one presented in marie and simioni 2014 and notg we used a virtual forest plot of 10 10 m populated by three pines and three oaks the small plot size facilitated the simulation with notg figure s1 supplementary materials shows that the new meta model mimics very precisely the output of notg this new metamodel still requires around 12 h for a 100 year simulation 2 3 study site and model parameterization the mixed heterogeneous forest of font blanche 43 14 27 n 5 40 45 e 420 m elevation 625 mm annual rainfall 16 1 w m 2 average daily global radiation and 13 7 c average temperature is a typical low altitude mediterranean ecosystem situated on thick limestone bedrock in south east france it is composed of a top stratum 13 m dominated by aleppo pines pinus halepensis mill an intermediate stratum 6 m dominated by holm oaks quercus ilex l and a shrub stratum measurements include meteorology eddy covariance sap fluxes soil moisture leaf water potential stem diameter increment soil respiration gap fraction a descriptor of leaf area index and litter fall site operation started in 2007 font blanche is part of the icos integrated carbon observation system and anaee france analysis and experimentation on ecosystems networks this forest is representative of areas recently recolonized by pinus halepensis following land abandonment after the second world war this forest type represent around 24 of the volume and 20 of the surface of french mediterranean forests inventaire forestier national 2010 apart from the exceptions described below most assumptions as well as parameter values for site soil and plants were the same as in simioni et al 2016 see table 2 for details on species parameters in particular the understorey was not simulated we assumed that its contribution to the water and carbon cycle was negligible compared to the dominating species and plant n concentrations were fixed meaning that we did not account for the n feedback between soil and plants soil organic matter decay rates were parameterized as in kirschbaum and paul 2002 however while in simioni et al 2016 plant dimensions were fixed in the present simulations height as well as foliage and root crown dimensions increased with growth we used the following allometric equations which were obtained from tree measurements made at font blanche unpublished data height h m was computed as h 6 02 1 698 ln dbh for pinus halepensis h 2 45 1 54 ln dbh for quercus ilex where dbh is diameter at breast height cm for coppice height is computed from the stem with the largest dbh foliage crown radius canrad m was computed as canrad 0 4532 e0 1445 h for p halepensis canrad 0 4563 e0 2634 h for q ilex height of the base of the foliage crown was computed as a ratio of total height 0 437 for pines and 0 27 for oaks 2 4 simulation plan we performed 24 simulations covering 3 climate scenarios 4 forest plots and accounting or not for vegetation spatial structure we considered three climate scenarios a baseline based on current climate without trend in temperature rainfall or co2 over time and one moderate and one severe climate change scenarios respectively b1 and a2 from the sres family the font blanche forest displays large spatial variations in pine oak ratio and basal area because of the difficulty of running the model over large forest plots we used four 24 24 m plots reconstructed from field data using stem coordinates and stem diameters at breast height in the field those four plots are not contiguous but were chosen to encompass the range of structures observed in the field either dominated by q ilex or by p halepensis or a balanced mixture with high or low basal area the simulation maps of those plots are presented in fig 1 for investigating the importance of the vegetation spatial structure for each plot and climate scenarios we ran one simulation that uses the 3d matrix of voxels 3d and one that lumps all trees in a single pixel only detailing the vertical layers 1d the latter is also named mean field as all trees have equal and complete access to light and water resources albeit for the effects of the vertical distribution of the foliage the 3d simulations on the opposite segregates tree canopies and root crowns in space each tree competing essentially with its nearest neighbors and therefore account for gaps between trees the 3d simulation was run with the meta model see above with a voxel size of 1 1 2 m the same that was used to compare notg to field data in simioni et al 2016 however the meta model is by nature designed to be run for a specific voxel size so the 1d simulations were done with notg with a pixel size of 24 24 m and vertical layers of 2 m note that in 1d mode notg is very fast 2 5 climate scenarios meteorological measurements at font blanche only started in 2007 for air temperature air humidity precipitation and wind speed we established regressions between data measured at font blanche since 2007 and those measured at the nearest weather stations registered at meteo france castellet la ciotat and cuges details on these regressions can be found in the supplementary materials using these regressions we reconstituted weather data for font blanche using measurements from those three stations as far back as they were available we thus obtained a series of 17 years of climate data from 1993 to 2009 in this series the average annual precipitation is 625 mm and the average minimum and maximum temperatures are 10 1 and 17 2 c respectively since a climate change trend is present in this series each year of the 100 year baseline climate was randomly chosen among the series of 17 the co2 was constant for this scenario at 369 5 ppm a value measured in 2000 the starting year of the simulations climate change trends provided by the ipcc 2007 for the area where the font blanche forest is located are given in table 1 because there are significant variations in elevation and climate within this area we did not use climate projections directly but instead climate change scenarios were constructed by superimposing to the baseline climate trends in temperature precipitation co2 and specific air humidity corresponding to sres scenarios b1 and a2 2 6 initialization of soil carbon pools to accurately predict heterotrophic respiration it is paramount to initialize properly the different soil organic matter pools before running the simulations soil carbon pools result from long term processes and thus are tightly dependent on past land use knowledge of past land use at font blanche is limited until the end of the second world war it most probably was used as a holm oak coppice regularly cut to provide fuel and where sheep herds were allowed to graze after the last clear cut it was mostly left unused until today allowing p halepensis to colonize the coppice in addition to accounting for past land use we faced the challenge of initializing soil carbon pools spatial variations as well first we ran notg in 1d mode for an oak coppice with a leaf area index of 0 85 using the baseline climate while keeping plant pools constant for a period long enough to reach an equilibrium between plant and soil carbon pools over 4000 years in our case it consisted in running the same simulation over and over keeping the plant pools constant but transferring the final soil organic matter pools from one simulation to the start of the next one equilibrium was assessed when those pools did not change between iterations this stage allowed to reach a balance between plant and soil carbon pools as it could have been around 1950 secondly we ran a 3d simulation with the meta model over 50 years still using the baseline climate but starting with the carbon pools obtained in the first stage this stage was repeated for each forest plot this allowed to have different carbon pools in the different soil pixels the final soil c pools thus obtained were then used as initial values for the 3d simulations for the 1d simulations soil c pools of each plot were summed to initialize the single soil pixel 2 7 output variables this study focuses on the carbon budget therefore we focused the analysis on predicted net primary production npp carbon emissions due to soil organic matter decomposition i e heterotrophic respiration rh and carbon sequestration as nep the difference between npp and rh as we wanted to assess the importance of extended growth period and drought intensity we defined the growth period as the number of days when foliage or other organs can grow each year to assess changes in drought level we defined the duration of intense drought each year as for each tree the number of days when the water stress index reached values of 0 1 or lower i e when water stress alone reduced stomatal conductance by 90 or more as the growth period and intense drought duration are likely to have antagonistic effects on plant productivity and are also likely to increase under climate change we defined the effective growth period as the growth period minus the intense drought duration 3 results from the 3d simulation under the baseline climate i e current climate predicted npp rh and nep displayed a strong interannual variability but also varied over the course of the century fig 2 npp increased during the first 20 years from 9 8 t c ha 1 year 1 the first 5 years and then remained at a similar level the rest of the century around 13 1 t c ha 1 year 1 rh initially well below npp increased progressively for about 60 years before stabilizing at values much closer to npp as a result nep the difference between npp and rh decreased from around 5 2 t c ha 1 year 1 the first 25 years down to around 1 3 t c ha 1 year 1 after 60 70 years during the second half of the century predicted nep was negative some years comparing the 3d simulation under climate change to the 3d simulation under the baseline climate we found that npp increased with climate change fig 2 the effect being stronger under scenario a2 there was also a positive effect of climate change on rh again stronger for the most severe scenario the increase in rh with climate change however was initially lower than that of npp and progressively became larger as a result nep increased temporarily under climate change before returning to the same average level as the baseline average change of 0 16 and 0 12 t c ha 1 year 1 under the b1 and a2 scenarios respectively for the last 20 years this transient positive effect of climate change on nep was initially larger and lasted longer under the b1 scenario under the a2 scenario the transient positive effect lasted around 50 years one effect of this scenario was an increase in interannual variability with alternating years with increasingly stronger positive and negative effects over the whole simulated period the number of years when the forest was a source of carbon negative nep was 4 under the baseline and b1 scenarios and 7 under the a2 scenario under the baseline climate trees experienced more days under intense water stress with time fig 3 and climate change increased further the number of days with intense water stress this increase was higher under the a2 scenario for q ilex on the driest years this increase was as high as two and a half months of additional intense drought and nearly two months for p halepensis 3d simulations also showed that under the baseline climate for both q ilex and p halepensis the effective growth period decreased over time accompanied by a higher inter annual variability fig 4 the effective growth period was longer for q ilex as this species experienced less intense drought days than p halepensis climate change tended to increase the effective growth period for q ilex except for strong decreases on very dry years for p halepensis the effect of climate change was positive on average but to a much lower extent than for q ilex for both species the effect was more important under the a2 scenario when combining all 3d simulations for both p halepensis and q ilex there was a clear positive relationship between npp and the effective growth period fig 5 for p halepensis npp was also positively related to atmospheric co2 a trend that was not predicted for q ilex for p halepensis npp during the first 20 years did not follow the same relationship displaying lower npp values comparing the 3d and 1d simulations it appeared that ignoring the spatial structure of the vegetation led to an overestimation of the total npp from around 1 1 t c ha 1 year 1 the first 10 years down to no or little effect after 30 years and with little difference between climate scenarios fig 6 heterotrophic respiration was little but positively affected by the spatial structure by an average of 0 3 t c ha 1 year 1 fig 6 the resulting figure for nep was an overestimation in the 1d simulations the first years 1 2 t c ha 1 year 1 the first 10 years down to 0 3 t c ha 1 year 1 the last 40 years these patterns were not affected by climate change npp at the species level was strongly impacted by the spatial structure the 1d simulations showing a positive bias for p halepensis and a negative bias for q ilex when compared to the 3d simulations fig 7 these biases in productivity increased over time and were stronger under climate change reaching values of 3 1 t c ha 1 year 1 for p halepensis and 3 1 t c ha 1 year 1 for q ilex over the last 20 years under the a2 scenario 4 discussion 4 1 accounting for the spatial structure matters in mixed species forests many studies have already highlighted the influence of the spatial organization of plants on ecosystem function e g pacala and deutschman 1997 simioni et al 2003 kobayashi et al 2012 yet when predicting forest carbon budget response to climate change modelling studies have mostly focused on monospecific forests using models that do not include spatial patterns and as a result knowledge about mixed species forests is lacking reyer 2015 simulating mixed species is complex as it requires a model able to render competition between species for resources and it often implies that the forest structure is heterogeneous this requires the use of spatially explicit process based models such as notg in fact previous studies on the font blanche forest showed that the composition and structure of the forest can influence the partitioning of light simioni et al 2013 and productivity simioni et al 2016 between species the later also showed that ignoring the vegetation spatial structure led to discrepancies in predictions of water stress at the individual and species levels these studies focused on current climate conditions in the present work we showed that not accounting for vegetation spatial structure had an effect on forest npp rh and nep over a century that diminished over time probably because as the forest matured its spatial heterogeneity was less pronounced trees occupied more space and tended to fill the gaps however the strongest effect of spatial structure was on each species npp therefore if predictions at the species level are important e g for assessing ecosystem services that are specific to some species e g biofuel for q ilex vs pulp for p halepensis then accounting for the spatial structure is all the more necessary the difference between 3d and 1d comes from the fact that in 1d the asymmetry of the competition for light is increased in 3d more light reaches the oak layer through gaps in the pine layer in 1d the gaps are ignored and pines intercept more light and less remains for the oaks underneath and this effect is amplified other time as light interception is converted to photosynthesis growth and new leaf area which will condition new light interception these results confirm those of simioni et al 2016 who found that for a shorter period simulations accounting for the spatial structure gave better predictions of growth water potential gap fraction and evapotranspiration than simulations ignoring it this raises concern about the accuracy of predictions issued from models which are not spatially explicit which are the most widely used when dealing with heterogeneous forests 4 2 the maturing of the forest has a stronger effect than climate change our simulations suggest that the font blanche forest is still in a transitory phase and could accumulate more carbon both in plants and soil than in its current state as it will mature npp will stabilize in a synthesis of recent trends in forest productivity charru 2012 did not find any significant trend in the productivity of p halepensis stands in south east france however the studied period only partially overlaps ours from 2000 to 2005 she also concluded that under climate change p halepensis forests could see their productivity increase or decrease depending on the interplay between temperature rise that species being limited under low temperatures and water constraints therefore her study does not contradict nor support our results rh would follow the same trend as npp as it is fueled by more litter but with a delay this means that while the predicted current i e early 21 st century nep is high it could strongly decrease other time from 5 2 down to 1 3 t c ha 1 year 1 as rh catches up with npp this decrease is much larger than the predicted positive effect of climate change on nep therefore according to those simulations the main driver of carbon storage for this type of forest would be its own dynamics rather than climate change a large part of forests in southern france have a similar history as that of font blanche that is areas relatively recently colonized by p halepensis following land abandonment if they remain unmanaged it is to be expected that as they mature during the 21st century their nep will decrease this maturation phase during the first 20 years was probably why those years did not follow the same relationship between pine npp and effective growth season length fig 5 as npp was then also limited by the developmental stage of the forest the increase in npp as the forest matured was essentially the result of pine growth data not shown which probably explains why the relationship between oak npp and effective growth period was not different during the first 20 years 4 3 productivity increases despite longer droughts a temperature change higher than 2 c could entail changes in mediterranean land ecosystems that are unmatched in the holocene a period which displayed strong rainfall deficits guiot and cramer 2017 hence it is critical to investigate any factor that could alleviate the negative effects of increasing droughts the fertilizing effect of co2 is well documented keenan et al 2014 from various approaches such as free air co2 experiments norby and zak 2011 or controlled condition experiments kimball et al 1993 however the extent and duration of this effect remains a debate as other limitations such as nutrient availability körner 2006 can occur the resulting response to climate change therefore depends on the interplay of different factors which can result in positive or negative outcomes still including or not co2 in simulations changes dramatically the nature of the predicted forest response to climate change reyer 2015 including for mediterranean forest productivity gea izquierdo et al 2017 another important aspect is the potential increase in the growth period as temperature increases e g fu et al 2014 and this could be particularly important for p halepensis which is sensitive to low temperatures and that is in south east france at the northern limit of its biogeographical distribution charru 2012 in our simulations both higher co2 and longer growth period contributed to the increase in npp under climate change the longer effective growth period was the main factor for q ilex higher co2 by stimulating photosynthesis also contributed to the higher npp of p halepensis under climate change therefore these simulations suggest that these two factors could over compensate the negative effects of increased water stress on npp they confirm the trends predicted in previous studies for forests under mediterranean climate davi et al 2006 simioni et al 2008 gea izquierdo et al 2017 the lack of effect of higher co2 on q ilex could mean that photosynthesis was more limited by light for that species which occupies the lower stratum actually the predicted amount of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the oaks per unit of leaf surface was on average 45 of that of pines data not shown as the model does not incorporate mortality explicitly especially damages caused by xylem embolism martin st paul et al 2017 it remains to be tested whether these trends would be similar if such processes were accounted for so far no xylem embolism has been observed at font blanche despite the recent extreme droughts of 2016 and 2017 data not shown nonetheless in light of our results it is likely that future extreme events will be worse and investigating how hydraulic limitations would impact npp and nep under climate change should be a high priority another aspect that we did not account for is plant allometric plasticity q ilex trees have been observed to respond to a repeated decrease in rainfall by reducing their leaf area thus reducing water loss and maintain productivity limousin et al 2009 martin st paul et al 2013 including such plasticity would likely lead to lower water stress while progressive nutrient limitation is often mentioned as a counteracting factor against co2 fertilization the mechanisms involved in nutrient cycling are complex e g higher temperatures can also accelerate n mineralization kirschbaum 2004 and this potential limitation remains a matter of debate johnson 2006 although we plan to include n cycling in future studies we assumed that n was not likely to be limiting in the font blanche forest where n deposition is likely to increase in the future probst et al 2017 4 4 climate change is only temporarily beneficial to carbon sequestration the predicted positive effect of climate change on npp was progressively offset over time by the positive effect of climate change on rh this effect was caused by both increased respiration rates and higher litter transfer to soil organic matter as npp increased the resulting effect on carbon sequestration was only temporarily positive before switching to neutral and this switch occurred earlier for the most severe scenario 5 conclusion our most important results were that 1 the main change in the future carbon budget of the font blanche forest could be a decrease in carbon sequestration as the forest matures 2 climate change by lengthening the growing season and in addition with co2 fertilization could have a positive effect on net primary productivity a modest transitory positive effect on carbon storage but at the same time will tremendously increase the duration of intense droughts which could threaten tree hydraulic integrity and 3 not accounting for the vegetation spatial structure could lead to exaggerated water stress and strong bias in predicted productivity at the species level credit authorship contribution statement guillaume simioni conceptualization data curation methodology formal analysis writing original
