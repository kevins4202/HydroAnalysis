22715,in this paper a three dimensional dijkstra s optimization algorithm is proposed to allow a ship to plan her waypoints and sailing speeds along each waypoint it is expected to generate global optimum solutions for ship routes its capability of fuel saving as objectives is demonstrated by comparing its results with those obtained from other conventional voyage optimization algorithms and the actual fuel consumption of a container ship with full scale measurements the proposed three dimensional dijkstra s algorithm can generate global optimum ship routing encountering less harsh sea environment leading to at least 5 reduction of fuel consumption within the analysed cases furthermore it can perform multi objective voyage optimization such as minimum fuel minimum damage accumulation lowest crack propagation etc with accurate eta in the planning process keywords voyage optimization algorithm dijkstra s algorithm 3d graph fuel consumption expected time of arrival eta 1 introduction in the maritime transportation ship safety and energy efficiency are two of the most important topics to make a ship s operation more competitive and sustainable a sail plan system which combines the concepts of weather routing and voyage optimization is recognized as an efficient measure by the shipping industry to ensure a ship s safety gain more economic benefit and reduce negative effects on our environment dnvgl 2015 for ocean crossing ships encountering harsh weather environment and ocean currents can significantly influence a ship s sailing speeds a weather routing service is commonly used by captains often from short term perspectives during a voyage planning process to avoid potential dangerous and harsh weather conditions minimize the risk of ship cargo damage and human injures and estimate the expected time of arrival etc a voyage optimization system implements optimization algorithms in computers to plan a ship s sailing course and schedule in an optimum manner from long term perspectives for the entire voyage based on current weather forecasts and ship performance models in a conventional voyage optimization system a grid of waypoints along a ship s sailing area are first generated followed by setting up all possible candidate sailing routes and finally a path searching method is implemented to find the optimal route from those candidates with respect to specific objectives defined by end users such as expected time of arrival eta or minimum fuel cost etc therefore the main purpose of a sail plan system is to propose a ship s sailing course schedule from a departure port to a destination port with certain pre defined objectives e g the expected time of arrival with minimum fuel consumption and air emissions etc bowditch 2002 the core element of such a sail plan system is a proper voyage optimization algorithm which generates optimal ship routing based on the ocean weather forecast around a ship s sailing areas ship characteristics and ship operational capabilities as well as some constraints for a particular voyage simonsen et al 2015 wang 2018 a ship s operational capabilities are often described by various performance models that estimate a ship s operational performance at sea such as speed power relationship mao et al 2016 fuel consumption rate tillig et al 2018 fatigue damage accumulation mao et al 2012 etc in the current shipping community there are many voyage optimization algorithms available to solve a ship s voyage planning problems traditionally these algorithms simplify a ship s voyage optimization process into a two dimensional sub path searching problem where a ship s navigation inputs are often assumed as either a fixed speed or a fixed engine power revolution these methods limit the voyage optimization to find 2 dimensional ship route paths composed of a series of waypoints between departure and destination e g the modified isochrone method hagiwara 1989 the isopone method klompstra et al 1992 dynamic programming method bijlsma 1975 2002 de wit 1990 and dijkstra s algorithm dijkstra 1959 padhy et al 2008 as well as some evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithms hinnenthal 2008 wang et al 2018 to demonstrate the overall concept of how voyage optimization systems can benefit a ship s operations conventional 2 dimensional dijkstra s algorithm seeking for optimal sailing paths have been implemented to use fixed speed engine power böttner 2007 eskild 2014 or fixed engine rpm takashima et al 2009 in böttner 2007 this dijkstra method is combined with a genetic algorithm to allow for small variations around optimal paths found by the 2d algorithm to assist a ship s navigation in degraded sea conditions in addition the conventional 2 dimensitonal dijkstra s algorithm dijkstra 1959 is also used to develop voyage optimization systems which consider a ship s sailing constraints as maximum allowed motions accelerations and minimum fuel consumption vettor and guedes soares 2016 study the impact of metoc ensemble forecasts on optimal voyage planning chu et al 2014 and maximize the auxiliary resistance provided by wind propulsions walther 2015 however for ocean crossing ships especially for long voyages a ship s sailing speed and engine setting can vary significantly during a voyage the simplification of voyage optimization into a 2d path searching problem by these algorithms may lead to a local optimal solution for the routing problem wang et al 2017a to model a ship s 3d sailing scenario in voyage optimization some 3 dimensional algorithms have also been developed for example hinnenthal 2008 marie and courteille 2009 and maki et al 2011 presented evolutionary genetic algorithms for weather routing to consider a ship s safety issues i e stability in harsh sea conditions and minimum fuel consumption it should be noted that genetic algorithms may have the potential to provide global multi objective route planning but due to the large sample size in the planning process especially when the searching space and discretized time steps increase the limitation of searching sample size will lead to very local optimization results alternative research direction is to introduce the time variation into the current 2d isochrone method dynamic programming cui et al 2016 and dijkstra s algorithm such as the modified 3d isochrone method lin et al 2013 3d dynamic programming methods presented in shao and zhou 2012 skoglund et al 2012 2015 zaccone and figari 2017 zaccone et al 2018 in those 3d optimization methods the searching space in the time dimension is dynamically generated when a ship is sailing forward only a small part of sub paths toward the node represented by longitude and latitude of next stage with best results e g minimum fuel consumption for those sub paths with local optimized solutions can survive during the optimization process for each stage while other sub paths toward the node are neglected eliminated to reduce the computation effort otherwise the number of sub paths will increase exponential as a ship moving toward her destination each time step by step however during the process those eliminated nodes may be associated with a route of a global optimal solution for a certain eta moreover these 3d methods that dynamically generate searching space in time are not able to predict the eta before the whole optimization process is completely finished it means that for a voyage optimization with certain rpm power speed as inputs it will be very hard to adjust the input parameters to reach the destination at exactly the same expected time of arrival eta in this paper a 3d weighted graph including all possible sub paths based on a ship s sailing capability i e each waypoint is associated with all possible passing times is first generated to improve the current 3d voyage optimization methods and then dijkstra s algorithm is implemented to search the lowest cost path with a certain eta by dividing the graph generation and path searching algorithm into two separated procedures the proposed method can mitigate the possibility of neglecting global optimal solutions the proposed method is described in detailed in the following section 2 to make the completeness of the paper the performance model of a case study ship and other relevant information needed to demonstrate the proposed algorithm are given in section 3 the results of comparison between the proposed algorithm and other conventional methods are presented in section 4 as well as further discussions of other capabilities of the proposed algorithms the paper is concluded with conclusions and some key references 2 description of the 3d dijkstra s algorithm for ship routing a ship s sailing route is defined by a series of waypoints p forming a ship s trajectory and their associated passing time the waypoints and the associated time can be used to calculate the series of the ship s operational conditions u p i e sailing speed and heading along the route in this study for simple description of our optimization algorithm the variables used to define a ship s sailing route are denoted as follows ship state variable 1 p x y t t where x y t represent longitude latitude and time respectively ship control variable 2 u p v θ t where v is ship velocity and θ is heading angle they are formed as operational conditions of a ship state p weather conditions 3 w p h s t p c v w u v w v t which represent ocean wave h s t p s w h s t p current c and wind parameters v w u v w v etc at a ship state p ship sailing constraints c p u p w p which includes ship sailing constraints such as geometric constraint control constraint land crossing constraint engine power constraint etc and harsh weather constraint it returns boolean value that indicates the feasibility of the sailing conditions i e p and u p for different ship operation strategy used in worldwide shipping companies such as the fixed speed or engine power rpm rotation per minute operation the above ship control variables may differ significantly in routing optimization algorithms under the constraint c p u p w p the cost function c can be denoted by 4 c t 0 t n f u p w p d t where f u p w p is the instantaneous cost function ship performance models for a series of ship state p under control u p t 0 t n are the departure time and arrival time respectively here the cost function of a route can be of different forms e g fuel consumption maximum ship motions estimated time of arrival eta fatigue damage accumulation or crack propagation in a ship s structure wang et al 2017b etc depending on optimization methods the total cost function in eq 4 can be derived into various discrete stages the instantaneous cost function f is computed to get e g the fuel consumption expected time of arrival fatigue damage accumulation etc in the optimization algorithms finally the overall objective is to find suitable waypoints p and operational control sets u p which will lead to the minimum maximum value of c by following the optimum route encountering sea conditions w p at those waypoints the 3d dijkstra s algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problems to minimize the cost function in eq 4 while the workflow of this method is shown as fig 1 it can be divided into 3 steps 2 1 initialization of waypoints in sailing area the first step is to generate a grid of waypoints around a ship s sailing region such as in fig 2 the grid is often generated on the basis of the great circle reference route between the departure and the destination of a voyage firstly the reference route is discretized into several stages of equal distance each stage is represented by a waypoint represented by geographical longitude and latitude the distance of each stage between two adjacent waypoints along the reference route δ d g c is defined as 5 δ d g c v δ t where v is a ship s service speed and the choice of δt depends on the temporal resolution of weather forecast information here chosen as 3 h secondly for all the generated waypoints along the reference route a series of waypoints perpendicular to the reference route will be generated as in fig 2 the grid of waypoints should cover the entire possible region a ship may sail into then a time dimension is added to each waypoint to represent a series of feasible arrival times which are set to be the same as for all waypoints within the same stage the details are presented in the following subsection 2 2 3d graph generation for a computer aided voyage optimization a voyage should be discretized into various stages to form a graph g p a where p is a set of pre defined waypoints and a is a set of sailing sub paths edges composed of waypoint pairs every sailing sub path edge is assigned with a weight let a i denote the sub path edge connecting waypoints of two adjacent stages p i 1 and p i and the required sailing time is denoted by δ t i according to eq 4 the weight of each edge becomes 6 c p i f u p i 1 w p i 1 δ t i a simple example of the 3d graph is shown in fig 3 for a voyage denoted by g p a its 3d graph can be generated by the following six steps 1 generate geographical waypoints nodes in the spatial region shown in fig 2 the sub paths edges to connect waypoints between two adjacent stages are shown as the upper plot of fig 3 the trajectory of the voyage is divided into n stages along the reference course which is taken here as the great circle between the departure p 0 and the destination p n for the i th stage waypoints generated perpendicular to the reference course as in fig 2 are denoted by p i j j 1 2 m where j represents the index of the waypoint in the i th stage and p i j represents the candidate sailing waypoints in the i th stage 2 generate initial time set a ship s speed is set to vary in the range 0 5v 1 2v where v is the service speed in the temporal region the expected arrival time set for all waypoints in the i th stage is denoted by 7 ϑ i t i 1 t i 2 t i k δ t i 1 2 δ t i 1 2 δ t δ t i 1 2 2 δ t 2 δ t i where δt is defined as the time interval of a sub path for the i th stage and it is initialized based on the spatial resolution of the waypoints and the ship s input speed in this study the value of δt ranges 12 min 30 min for various stages then all ship geographical states at the i th stage p i j j 1 2 m are assigned with the same passing arrival time set t i k k 1 2 k to form an irregular multi dimensional array ϑ i j k shown as the red dots in vertical direction of fig 3 lower plot 3 since the number of potential arrival time at each stage i e k increases monotonically instead of exponentially as the stage advances a feasible arrival time set for the i th stage can be generated the feasible time set is then assigned to each node p i j in the i th stage then the geographical waypoints p i j can be transformed into a ship state p i j k shown as eq 8 where k represents the index referring to the feasible arrival time set ϑ in fig 3 lower plot the red dots are the accessible time set ϑ for different stages and the black dots are eliminated from the initial time set 0 δt 2δt 2 δ t i p i j k p i j t i k x i j y i j ϑ i j k 8 i 1 2 n j 1 2 m and k 1 2 k that varies as stages 4 generate edges set a for the graph the edge generation of the nodes ship states from adjacent stages is under three basic constraints in this study to mitigate the computation effort first large course changing between adjacent stages is not allowed second the ship speed should be in the range 0 5v 1 2v where v is the service speed third land crossing and sailing in limited water depth between the nodes is not allowed finally some safety related factors such as the harshest sea conditions that a ship is not allowed to sail as introduced in imo 2007 is considered as constraints in the method 5 calculate the cost fuel consumption for each individual edge the edges contain the information of geographical locations and passing arrival times of both nodes the distance between the nodes and the ship speed and heading weather condition w p can be extracted based on the locations and times of nodes in this study the weather condition is chosen as encountered by the first node of an edge and u p is the ship speed and heading the cost as well as other output such as shaft power effective power for the ship sailing in this edge can be calculated from eq 6 in addition other objectives that can be accumulated during the voyage such as structure damage crack propagation can be also added 6 add the calculated data and extracted weather data as attributes to the edges in this step more constraints are considered i e maximum engine constraint allowed maximum encountering wave environment in this study ship motion constraints are not considered but they could be easily implemented if the constrain conditions for the target ship are known if the data doesn t fulfil the constraints the edges are not added to the graph if the 3d weighted graph generated by the proposed method is in high enough resolution it can enumerate all circumstances that ship could encounter during her sailing voyage the graph generation does require large computational effort including generating a grid of waypoints assigning time and extracting metocean environments to the waypoints as well as estimating the weight objective function to all the edges sub paths however since all the information required by the graph generation is statically stored as matrix parallel computation and matrix manipulation can be and are adopted in this method to allow fast simulations 2 3 dijkstra s algorithm implemented to the 3d graph system dijkstra s algorithm works in a grid graph system by visiting sub paths edges starting from the departure node waypoint it follows two basic principles dijkstra 1959 firstly a sub route of a shortest route is itself a shortest route and secondly with a given shortest distance x between points a and c a path going from point a to c through a third point b will always be of a distance greater than or equal to x for a practical ship voyage optimization problem as shown in fig 2 let g be a grid of waypoints as the graph system from departure point p 0 via waypoints p 1 j 1 p 2 j 2 p n 1 j n 1 to the destination p n where j n is the index of optimum passing waypoint in the n th stage of the planned route let c p i j denote the total cost e g fuel consumption damage accumulation or time etc that a ship sails until the waypoint p i j from all waypoints of the preceded stages let m denote the number of waypoints at each stage δ c k denote the instantaneous cost sailing from the j th waypoint at the preceding stage p i 1 j to the current waypoint p i j and the required sailing time is denoted by δ t k the cost δ c k can be calculated as 9 δ c k f u p i 1 k w p i 1 k δ t k the costs of sailing along different sub paths to the current waypoint p i j can be written as 10 c p i j c p i 1 1 δ c 1 c p i 1 2 δ c 2 c p i 1 m δ c m where c p i 1 k is the total cost for a ship sailing until the waypoint p i 1 k the minimum of these n costs in eq 9 is chosen as the optimal preceded sub path reach to the waypoint p i j following the same approach the optimal sub path of minimum cost for all other waypoints in the same i th stage as p i j can be found subsequently the minimum cost sub path from departure to the i th stage is memorized repeating this procedure until reaching to the destination point the minimum cost optimal ship route in the grid system can be generated in this study the dijkstra s algorithm is implemented as a shortest path finding method to find the shortest path in the 3d graph for this example let assume that the generated 3d graph contains k time states to the destination corresponding to k optimum routes associated with k etas for the k th optimum route let the p i j i k denote the geographical location in the i th stage of the optimum route associated with the k th eta and the arrival time to this location is denoted by t i k finally the k final candidate optimum routes geographical locations and arrival times are denoted by 11 p d a p 1 p 2 p k p 0 p 1 j 1 1 t 1 1 p n 1 j n 1 1 t n 1 1 p n t n 1 p 0 p 1 j 1 2 t 1 2 p n 1 j n 1 2 t n 1 2 p n t n 2 p 0 p 1 j 1 k t 1 k p n 1 j n 1 k t n 1 k p n t n k theoretically if provided with a very fine resolution of 3d graph dijkstra algorithm is able to obtain a global optimum ship route for a given voyage the computational effort for constructing the graph system is time consuming in the current north atlantic sailing voyages each graph constructed with very high resolution contains about 50000 nodes and 1 million edges generation of each graph using the parallel computation technique costs approximately 3 4 min by a normal desktop with intel core i5 8400 while the implementation of dijkstra s algorithm for searching optimal solutions is within seconds 3 details of case studies for voyage optimization in order to demonstrate the capability of the proposed 3d dijkstra s algorithm for ship routing optimization problems a 2800teu container ship sailing in the north atlantic is taken as a case study ship mao 2014 the main particulars of the ship are listed in table 1 for this case study ship the full scale measurements of the ship s performance at sailing in the north atlantic during the year 2008 are available to this study the measurement campaign includes both eastbound and westbound voyages for both winter and spring navigations it should be noted that the ship was also installed an old fashion 2d voyage optimization system onboard the actual sailing and fuel cost were a combination of voyage planning service and captains experiences on navigation in that area this information will be taken to investigate the potential benefits that can be realized by the proposed 3d dijkstra s algorithm this study focuses on demonstrating the capability of the proposed optimization algorithm for the minimum fuel route as the objective and keeping the same eta as the measure voyages for the demonstration the voyage optimization also needs performance models to estimate the ship s speed and fuel cost relationships in terms of the surrounding weather environments in the following subsections the procedures to get the ship s speed power performance model access to surrounding sea environment and the investigated cases for comparison are briefly described 3 1 ship speed power performance model in this study a ship s speed is taken as input for the voyage optimization for the optimization the ship s engine power needed to push the ship forward at the input speed should be estimated as the cost based on encountered sea conditions the ship s characteristics and operational profiles etc the workflow for the ship speed power performance modelling is presented in fig 4 the conventional way is to separate a ship s sailing resistance into calm water resistance and added resistances due to wind and waves when sailing in open sea the summation of the calm water resistance and added resistance is called the total resistance which needs to be compensated by the thrust force provided by the engine and propellers dependent on the engine type and propeller properties used on a specific ship their work efficiency is often provided by the manufactures and can be used to calculate the final fuel consumption needed for marine engines to push the ship forward in a ship s energy performance model the key parameter is the ship speed through water v according to the simple approximation formula from iso15016 2015 the speed through water is approximated by subtracting the current speed v c from a ship s speed over ground v g also known as the gps speed viz 12 v v g v c the above consideration of current in the speed power performance model may contain some uncertainties due to side forces and drifting effects caused by the current in particular for regions with very high current velocities in the present study the target case study ship was continuously sailing in the north atlantic area with very little current impact for the estimation of wind resistance the method from iso15016 2015 is implemented 13 r a a 0 5 ρ a c a a ψ w r r e f a x v v w r r e f 2 0 5 ρ a c a a 0 a x v v g 2 where r aa is the resistance increase due to relative wind c aa is the wind resistance coefficient ρ a is the mass density of air a xv is the transverse projected area above the waterline including superstructures ψ wrref is the relative wind direction v wrref is the relative wind velocity at the reference height v g is the measured ship s speed over ground in the following the speed through water v from eq 12 is used to estimate other resistant components then the calm water resistance r t is calculated by the holtrop and mennen 1984 method dividing r t into the following components 14 r t 1 k r f r a p p r w r b r t r r a where r f r app r w r b r tr and r a denote a ship s frictional resistance resistance of appendages wave making and wave breaking resistance additional pressure resistance of bulbous bow and immersed transom stern and model ship correction resistance while k represents the correction factor to the viscous resistance the formula to get all the calm water resistance components are obtained from holtrop and mennen 1984 and ittc 2015 the semi empirical formula was regressed from large number of test results it can give rather good results in average for some standard ship types however some errors should be expected from the method as well such as formulas to get wetted surface viscous pressure and wave pattern resistance as investigated by tillig et al 2018 the added resistance in waves can significantly affect a ship s total fuel consumption for an ocean crossing voyage to estimate such resistance in actual sea state firstly added resistance due to regular waves of a unit wave amplitude and a series of wave frequencies ω at an operational profile v θ is often divided into two components 15 r a w ω v θ r a w r ω v r a w m ω v f θ where r awr and r awm denote wave reflection and ship motion induced resistances v and θ represent a ship s speed and heading angle different empirical formulas and hydrodynamic theory based numerical methods are available to get the added resistances due to waves in this study the semi theoretical formulas proposed by liu and papanikolaou 2016 are used to estimate the response amplitude operators raos of r awr and r awm but only for head sea operations inspired by the ideas from alexandersson 2009 a gaussian function f θ is used to model the impact of heading angles for added resistance in waves then the mean added resistance due to an actual sea state of irregular waves represented by a significant wave height h s and mean wave period t z described by an ittc wave spectrum s h s t z can be computed by 16 r a w h s t z v θ 0 s h s t z r a w ω v θ d ω the approximation of added wave resistance as in eqs 15 16 could contain large uncertainties therefore the full scale measurements will be used to calibrate the model by some statistical regression methods as in the next subsection in addition other added resistances due to effect of shallow water water temperature are simply estimated by the method proposed in iso15016 2015 then the total resistance r tot is estimated as the summation of all the calm water resistance added resistances due to wind wave current and shallow water finally for a ship s sailing at the waypoint p i associated with operational profile u p i and encountering sea state w p i a ship s fuel consumption can be estimated by 17 c f u e l p b s f o c t i 1 t i p b r t o t v η 0 η h η s where sfoc g kwh is the specific fuel oil consumption t i 1 t i is the sailing time from the i th stage to the next stage and it varies depending on individual nodes waypoints η h η o η s are the hull efficiency propeller open water efficiency and engine shaft efficiency estimated by methods proposed in holtrop and mennen 1984 in this study a stationary sea state represented by h s t p s w h s t p is assumed to last for 3 h which is equal to the time resolution as the weather downloaded from ecmwf the ship s performance model may contain a lot of uncertainties for the speed power estimation tillig et al 2018 such as hull and propeller fouling statistical wave description various propulsion coefficients etc it is impossible to accurately describe a ship s speed power relationship using any semi empirical or theoretical models however to demonstrate the benefit of optimization algorithms for voyage planning it is enough if the performance model can properly describe a ship s performance characteristics at sea skoglund et al 2015 such as the trend of speed loss at different sea and operation conditions can be properly modelled furthermore some statistical methods as in mao et al 2016 are used to calibrate the total fuel consumption model to match the ship s measured speed power performance to minimize the power prediction errors between the above theoretical and semi empirical methods and the measured power 3 2 case study ship and measured voyages the case study ship of full scale measurement when sailing at the north atlantic during 2008 is used to demonstrate and compare the capabilities of proposed voyage optimization with conventional sailing methods the case study voyages are chosen to cover both eastbound and westbound voyage in both winter and spring seasons fig 5 presents the trajectories of the three eastbound voyages of which two represent winter voyages and one represents a spring voyage fig 6 shows the trajectories of the four westbound voyages where three for winter seasons and one for spring seasons it is shown that the trajectories for all eastbound voyages are quite similar while there are large scatters for the trajectories of the westbound voyages this is because storms in north atlantic always move from the east to the west traditionally it is rather important for captains to carefully plan ship routes for westbound voyages to ensure ship cargo safety and save fuel in particular sailing during the winter while eastbound voyages usually involve less aids from modern voyage optimization systems this study also aims at investigating the potential of fuel saving by using the propose optimization method even for eastbound voyages furthermore for the demonstration of voyage optimization sea condition information along the sailing area i e the meteorological and oceanographic metocean data such as wind wave current water depth and wave temperature are needed to estimate the cost as described in the above subsection for the demonstration of our proposed 3d dijkstra s algorithm the metocean conditions for the case study ship voyages are assumed to be fully available for the route planning optimization for example all ship performance related parameters are extracted from either ecmwf era interim hindcast dataset dee et al 2014 such as wind wind speeds and directions or wave information wave height and period and the current data is accessed from the server by oscar 2019 finally the implemented ship performance models in particular the semi theoretical model for added resistance in waves weather impact model have to be calibrated and validated to the ship s actual performance before they can be used to investigate the benefits of the proposed optimization algorithm for ship voyage planning for this case study ship the full scale measurements contain some basic information regarding the ship s sailing such as times locations speeds and heading associated with all passing waypoints recorded every 30 min as well as the marine engine rotational speed rpm unfortunately the shaft power was not recorded in the following the ship s rpm is used to roughly calibrate the implemented ship speed power performance model in order to describe the basic trend of weather impact speed loss from the actual measurements firstly from the one year s full scale measurements of the 2800teu containership under a certain range of the ship s engine rpm all the ship s sailing speeds are extracted secondly from the selected dataset let choose waypoints associated with very calm sea states hs 1 0 m and collect all the ship speeds at these waypoints then the average speed in the calm sea under the specific engine rpm is calculated as 18 5 knots finally let select all sailing waypoints sea states with sea environments of beaufort number 6 bn6 and categorized them into various heading angles for each heading angle under bn6 the ship s mean speed is computed from the collected data the results of the collected data are presented in fig 7 as the red curve for the comparison the speed reduction under the same above conditions are estimated by the ship speed power performance models implemented from the subsection 3 1 the results are plotted as the blue line in fig 7 it is shown that these models overestimate a bit of the weather impacts in particular of head waves a simple regression method is used to calibrate the original speed power model and the corrected results are shown good agreement with the measured weather impact in addition the trend of estimated weather impact from the calibrated model also agrees well with the computed by the advanced computational fluid dynamic analysis in kim et al 2017 furthermore as indicated by skoglund et al 2015 for the purpose of comparing the benefits of a voyage optimization algorithm it should be enough to use a ship performance model that can properly describe the trend characteristics of the ship s weather impact at various operation conditions therefore this model should be accurate enough for the following analysis to investigate the potential fuel saving benefits by using our proposed method in particular the fuel consumptions for all the routes obtained by various voyage planning methods in the next section are computed by the same calibrated ship performance model 3 3 various voyage optimization methods for comparison in order to verify the benefit of the proposed voyage optimization algorithm four voyage planning methods are used for the comparison i e the great circle routes the measured route combining the captain s experiences and an unknown voyage optimization system conventional 2d dijkstra s algorithm 2dda and the currently proposed 3d dijkstra s algorithm 3dda in the verification study the ship s speed is considered to be the main control input variable for the planning of great circle routes and the routes generated by 2dda and 3dda the etas of these voyages are assumed to be approximately the same with the measured sailing time for the great circle routes and 2dda routes the ship s speed is set to be fixed as 18 v f d g c t a where d gc is the great circle distance and t a is the measured sailing time for each investigated voyage due to the involuntary speed loss when sailing at harsh sea environments the ship cannot be guaranteed to reach her destination at the same time as the measured time t a if she is sailing in the estimated speed v f therefore the input speed v f has to adjusted to make the sailing time as close to the measured t a as possible it should be noted that if the engine power needed to push the ship at a given speed exceeds the maximum shaft power of the ship engine the input ship speed will be reduced due to such constraints the ship may take longer time to sail along the great circle routes than her measured sailing routes when harsh sea conditions are expected when using the 2dda for voyage optimization the input speed is set to be a bit higher than v f in order to have approximately the same eta with the measured routes this is because the 2dda may suggest the routes with longer distance than the great circle routes the speed inputs of the proposed 3dda is regarded as a variable and the speed variable v 3 d d a at each stage v i can be chosen as 19 v 3 d d a v 1 v 2 v n where v i 0 5 v f 1 2 v f i 1 n the speed variation in the 3dda method can overcome the limitation of 2dda and allow for flexible voyage optimization with proper speed configuration along the voyage 4 results and benefits of using voyage optimization the proposed 3d dijkstra s algorithm can generate optimal routes corresponding to different feasible etas of a given voyage it can allow end users to select the route of minimum fuel consumption with the most suitable eta according to their company s business schedule in order to study the potential fuel saving benefits of using the proposed 3dda method only the optimal routes with the same etas as the measured etas are selected the fuel consumptions and sailing distances of the planned routes obtained by the four voyage planning methods i e actual sailing routes from the full scale measurements great circle routes shortest distance sailing 2 dimensional dijkstra 2dda method and the proposed 3 dimensional dijkstra 3dda method are compared the fuel consumption for all the four route planning methods is calculated by the theoretical model described above the results for those typical eastbound and westbound voyages are presented in the following subsections 4 1 eastbound voyages optimization normally shipping companies may not seriously consider voyage optimization for eastbound voyages as in fig 5 since storms in the north atlantic always move from the west to the east however the results listed in table 2 indicate significant fuel saving by using the 3dda method in comparison with actual sailing from the measurements in particular for winter voyages table 2 compares the fuel consumption and sailing distance of the routes generated by the four planning methods it shows that the 3dda method has a great potential of saving fuel up to about 12 in comparison with the ship s actual sailing routes the routes generated by the 2dda optimization method can help to reduce in average about 6 fuel consumption than the actual routes the higher fuel costs along the actual routes may be partly caused by the long sailing distances while the conventional optimization algorithm i e the 2dda method generates longer sailing routes than the great circle routes with a bit higher fuel consumption it may be caused by the lack of consideration of speed variation in the conventional 2d optimization process which may lead to local optimal voyage planning by the 2dda method it also motivates the need to develop 3 dimensional voyage optimization methods in order to further investigate the difference of fuel consumption and distance in those routes the optimized courses sailing speeds and encountered sea conditions along two winter voyages are presented in figs 8 9 for the routing optimization one of the important tasks is to choose route with less harsh sea conditions while the sea conditions are represented by the significant wave height h s in meters in these figures where the left plots present sailing courses generated by the four optimization methods since the sea environments along the spring voyage are quite calm with less than 3 m for all generated routes the fuel consumptions and sailing distances by all the methods are quite close to each other it is not investigated in the following analysis for the first winter voyages 20080117 fig 8 shows that all four suggested courses differ from each other especially at the beginning of the voyages the sailing course generated by the 2dda method goes toward the northernmost and the actual sailing was simply following the rhumb line there is almost no involuntary speed reduction when the great circle sailing and the 2dda method are used the initial speed setting for the 2dda method is a bit higher than the great circle sailing and the 2dda route is also associated with longer sailing distance but the fuel consumptions by these two methods do not differ too much this is partly because the encountered wave conditions along the routes by 2dda are in average lower than the great circle routes because the 3dda can adjust the ship s speed voluntary speed reduction based on the weather and sea conditions it can generate a route with least fuel consumption but still keep the same eta as the measured one for the second winter voyage 20081224 shown in fig 9 due to relatively harsh sea conditions encountered during the voyage with maximum h s around 6 m there are large differences in both sailing distance and fuel consumption among the routes planned by different methods the 2dda method can generate route with longer sailing distance than the great circle route but encountered moderate sea environment the optimal route generated by the 3dda method is consistent with the great circle route but the fuel consumption is a bit lower than the simple great circle sailing this is because the 3dda method can adjust a ship s speed according to encountered sea environments as shown in the right plot of fig 9 the encountered h s by the 3dda method is always smaller than the great circle sailing because the small weather impact for the following sea operations in the eastbound voyages the fuel consumptions of routes optimized by the 2dda and the 3dda methods do not differ too much from the great circle sailing however the fuel consumptions of the actual routes are significantly higher than other routes this can be the consequence of lack of careful planning for those eastbound voyages the actual routes follow the rhumb line rather than the great circle route with longer sailing distance for these eastbound voyages when captains planned their routes focusing more on the ship safety and sailing eta the fuel consumption may be not seriously considered even by voyage optimization systems in 2008 in this study the fuel consumption is the main objective for the voyage optimization by the 2dda and 3dda methods as shown in the results using voyage optimization with respect to minimum fuel consumption 8 of fuel sailing can be easily achieved in particular for winter voyages 4 2 westbound voyages optimization for the westbound sailing it is extremely important to plan a ship s routes carefully it is true not just for the objective of reducing fuel consumption even for old conventional voyage optimization systems that more care about the safety and eta as sailing objectives or constrains four measured voyages are conducted to validate the fuel saving benefits by using the proposed 3dda method table 3 lists the eta fuel consumption and sailing distances for those four generated ship routes for a given eta the proposed 3dda method can always provide a route with better results for fuel saving as the optimization objective i e in average about 12 of the fuel saving in comparison with the actual sailing in comparison with a conventional 2dda method the 3dda method can help to reduce fuel consumption by about 4 since the westbound voyages in general consume more fuel than the eastbound voyages the 3dda can lead to large fuel saving the sailing distances of routes optimized by the 2dda method can sometimes be 10 longer than the great circle routes but the fuel consumption are quite similar between routes by the 2dda and the great circle routes because the 2dda method can plan a route encountering less harsh sea environments while the 2dda is still a local optimal solution for an actual voyage planning the 3dda method is capable to configure the ship s speed and course from the entire voyage perspectives providing a global optimal solution this also leads to the fact that the 3dda method gives the lowest fuel costs among all routes furthermore the details of three westbound voyages are investigated in figs 10 12 for two winter voyages and one spring voyage in 2008 for the first winter voyage 20080129 it is obviously shown that the actual route as in fig 10 was seriously planned since it differs from both the rhumb line and great circle route the course of the actual route is quite close to that optimized by the 2dda method as shown in the left plot of fig 10 i e the voyage optimization system used by the case study ship may be similar as the 2dda method since the voluntary speed reduction in the 3dda method can optimize both geographical locations and passing time along a voyage even though the encountered sea conditions along the 3dda generated route are relatively higher than the actual route and the 2dda generated routes as shown in the right plot of fig 10 the 3dda method can save about 7 of fuel consumption because of better speed planning it also implies that the 3dda method can adjust the ship s speed well to meet more moderate sea conditions the ship speeds optimized by 3dda is the lowest in the middle of the voyage where is near the storm for this voyage the simple great circle sailing will encounter the harshest sea conditions i e maximum significant wave height more than 8 m from safety perspectives the great circle route with shortest distance is not followed by the actual and optimized sailing the similar results for the spring voyage are presented in fig 11 where the left plot shows that the route optimized by the 3dda method coincides with the great circle route the measured route did a large course change on the waypoint with longitude close to 45 before a simple rhumb line navigation the actual route differs significantly from all the other routes the sailing distance of the measured route is about 3 longer than the great circle route but its fuel consumption is more than 20 higher because the ship was always operated in head sea conditions along the rhumb line route with relative higher sailing speeds it is also a strong evidence that large fuel saving potential can be realized even for a spring voyage encountering low h s if the route can be carefully optimized by the 3dda method for the other winter westbound voyage 20081214 the actual route is quite close to the great circle route however since the sailing speeds at the beginning of the voyage are significantly higher a normal navigation strategy to sail fast at the beginning to ensure a ship s eta than other methods as well as the involuntary voluntary speed reduction in the location with longitude close to 40 the fuel consumption of the actual route is about 10 higher than the great circle sailing on the other side even though the encountered sea environments along the route optimized by the 3dda method are quite similar as the 2dda method and the great circle sailing the 3dda method gives the lowest fuel consumption i e about 6 lower than the 2dda method and 15 lower than the actual route it again confirms the capability of proper speed setting by the 3dda method for global voyage optimization 4 3 other capabilities of the proposed 3dda for ship route planning 4 3 1 demonstration of multi objective optimization the above case study voyages have validated the benefits of fuel saving by the proposed 3dda method in addition the present 3dda method can perform multi objective optimization for ship voyage planning for example conventional voyage planning methods often deal with single objective optimization problem such as minimizing arrival time to the destination lowest fuel consumption those methods often treat a ship s operation conditions safety air emissions etc as constraints e g a ship cannot be operated in sea conditions of significant wave height larger than 10 m in the following another objective i e minimum fatigue damage accumulation is selected as a case example to show the potential of this 3dda method for multi objective voyage optimization it should be noted that the objective of minimum fatigue damage accumulation along upcoming voyages is also of great interest especially for old ships with many cracks onboard to consider fatigue damage in the voyage optimization process the fatigue model another cost function developed by mao et al 2010 based on the conventional s n curve is implemented to estimate a ship s damage accumulation this model can estimate a ship s damage accumulation in a sailing sub path edge between the i th stage and the next one in such a sailing sub path the fatigue damage accumulated at the sea state of significant wave height h s under ship speed v and heading angle θ is simply approximated by eq 20 as 20 d 0 47 t i 1 t i ψ v θ α h s 2 5 3 75 2 π v c o s θ h s 2 3 75 2 9 81 where most of the parameters are the same as in eq 17 whle ψ is derived from the transfer function of a ship s structural stresses under various operational conditions v θ and α is the intercept parameter of a s n parameter that can be obtained from any ship design guidelines here α is chosen as 1012 16 as in dnvgl 2014 theoretically the graph generated by the 3dda method can create innumerable possible sample routes and pareto frontiers of various optimization objectives could be easily formulated from those routes the westbound voyage 20080129 is taken as an example to demonstrate the application of multi objective voyage optimization by the proposed 3dda method the multi objective optimization results with respect to minimum fatigue damage accumulation and lowest fuel consumption against various etas are presented in fig 13 the left plot shows the 3 dimensional relationship among the fuel consumption damage accumulation and etas extracted from the optimization results where the pareto points of fuel versus damage are marked as red dots for each predefined eta for the measured eta of 106 h the right plot presents the optimization results of fuel versus damage the relationship between a ship s fuel consumption and fatigue damage accumulation is different from that between the fuel consumption and eta for example harsh sea environments can cause higher fatigue damage as explained by the fatigue damage model in eq 20 similar as the fuel consumption however for calm sea operations there is no fatigue damage accumulation but large fuel consumption is also required this complex relationship leads to the pareto frontier as well as the sample routes located in the right hand side of the pareto frontier shown in fig 13 right plot for those sample routes their fuel consumption and damage accumulation increase at the same time the pareto frontier gives ship operators information regarding how to make trade off decisions on optimal route between proper damage accumulation and fuel consumption for example for some old ships with serious fatigue problems wang et al 2017b minimum damage accumulation should be treated more important to determine the final ship route in comparison with the actual fatigue damage accumulated in this voyage mao et al 2010 the optimal routes in the pareto frontier can easily reduce the damage accumulation by 50 furthermore if a ship s fuel consumption is of major concerns optimal voyages associated with lowest fuel consumption at different etas form as another pareto frontier as the red line presented in fig 14 left plot in this study the interval of etas is set as 30 min in the graph of the 3dda method leading to discrete sample routes in the plot the courses of the optimum voyages generated by the 3dda method for etas ranging from 94 to 118 h with 0 5 h interval are also presented in fig 14 right plot it shows large deviations of sailing courses if different eta is selected 4 3 2 efficient course regeneration and weather data update captains often need to adjust update a ship s course on a daily basis to either keep the ship on track or mitigate risks if harsh sea environments are expected from updated weather forecasts the deviation is not only related to course change but it also affects arrival passing times of all the nodes waypoints in the graph grid system constructed for voyage optimization the deviation may cause the ship no longer sailing along her optimum route in other 3d voyage optimization methods since the ship s speeds or engine power and rpms are taken as changing variables along a voyage an update of metocean data for all the nodes associated with many passing times is needed for every stage that a voyage advances toward her destination in particular the passing times for each node of a specific stage are not known before the speed power analysis is carried out for all the nodes before that stage for a long distance voyage optimization problem using conventional 3d optimization methods most of the computational time would be spent on the iteration in the optimization process the iteration contains many steps of data processing classically one step of iteration contains 1 extracting and interpolating metocean data wind wave current temperature etc for current nodes 2 calculating the location and arrival time or speed for the forward or backward adjacent nodes 3 calculating the objective function for current nodes 4 most importantly making decision in each iteration to decide which nodes will be kept in the memory for next iteration techniques which can decrease the computational time such as parallel computing can t be applied if the decision made in previous iteration affect the result of current iteration in our proposed approach the schema is totally different from other 3d voyage optimization methods firstly a 3d weighted graph is built the node in the graph which can also be described as ship state contains the information of location and time the edge in the graph contains the basic information such as ship speed heading and distance the information can be stored in the matrix and used to extract the metocean data and calculate the objective function during this procedure iterations and decision making are not involved thus computational techniques can be applied for fast calculation when an updated voyage optimization process is needed in the middle of a voyage at certain node waypoint due to captains interest to check a ship s eta status or updated weather forecast available all the succeeding waypoints sub path edges and corresponding costs can be instantly retrieved and updated based on the provided weather information while the optimal sub route sailing from the current node to the destination can be also obtained by implementing a dijkstra s algorithm the updating of the optimization process by the proposed 3dda method could be simply repeated during any stage of a voyage and will be extremely beneficial for actual route planning and monitoring the same westbound voyage 20080129 is selected as an example to demonstrate the capability the red triangle in fig 15 left plot represents the waypoint that the ship should pass after 47 h of sailing from departure but due to the course deviation it arrived at the black triangle after 48 5 h to ensure the ship to arrive on time as well as minimizing the fuel consumption another optimum sub route is generated from the deviated course with the same predefined eta the new optimized sub route using the same graph as the initial optimization by the 3dda method is presented in fig 15 right plot table 4 shows the corresponding fuel consumption for this example by using the 3dda method the updating of the voyage optimization can generate optimal sub routes with lowest fuel consumption for different etas as shown in left plot of fig 16 the right plot of fig 16 presents the pareto frontier of minimal fuel consumption for different etas from the regenerated optimal sub routes the computation time of updating the voyage optimization process in the middle of a voyage is within a minute with intel core i5 8400 5 conclusions this paper proposed a modified three dimensional dijkstra s algorithm 3dda method to provide a ship s global optimal voyage planning with multi objective capabilities a case study container ship sailing in the north atlantic with full scale measurements during the year 2008 is used to demonstrate and validate the capabilities of the proposed 3dda method through the comparison with other conventional route planning methods it shows that the 3dda method has a big potential to lower the ship s fuel consumption and plan the sailing schedule with more accurate expected time of arrival for the case study vessel it is shown that even for the eastbound voyages in spring seasons a careful voyage planning by the 3dda method can significantly reduce the ship s fuel consumption in comparison with the ship s actual sailing routes the 3dda method can help to reduce in average about 10 fuel consumption considering all the investigated voyages while still keep the same etas as the measured this method can also take additional objectives such as time engine power fatigue damage etc into optimization process to allow multi objective optimization e g accurate eta minimum fuel consumption in this study the minimum fatigue damage accumulation is taken as another objective to illustrate the capability of the 3dda method for multi objective optimization adding one additional objective for the multi objective optimization is always accompanied by exponential increase of computational effort for the sake of computational efficiency parallel computing can be easily applied by this 3dda and all the metocean and cost data associated with all the waypoints in the grid graph system are kept in the memory thus the third advantage is that recalculation can be done during the voyage without establishing new waypoints grid system if there are deviations over either locations or arrival times furthermore the 3dda method can provide better voluntary speed reduction or speed increase for route planning for energy efficient shipping the example shows that during severe sea conditions by properly reducing the speed the fuel consumption decreases exponentially however the conventional route planning method taking fixed speed setting in e g conventional 2dda or great circle sailing methods may significantly increase fuel consumption in comparison with sailing based on captains experiences during heavy sea condition moreover the 3dda method can automatically increase a ship s speeds with running maximum engine capability in the calm area to catch up eta or reduce fuel consumption from the entire voyage perspective acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the funding support from stint

22715,in this paper a three dimensional dijkstra s optimization algorithm is proposed to allow a ship to plan her waypoints and sailing speeds along each waypoint it is expected to generate global optimum solutions for ship routes its capability of fuel saving as objectives is demonstrated by comparing its results with those obtained from other conventional voyage optimization algorithms and the actual fuel consumption of a container ship with full scale measurements the proposed three dimensional dijkstra s algorithm can generate global optimum ship routing encountering less harsh sea environment leading to at least 5 reduction of fuel consumption within the analysed cases furthermore it can perform multi objective voyage optimization such as minimum fuel minimum damage accumulation lowest crack propagation etc with accurate eta in the planning process keywords voyage optimization algorithm dijkstra s algorithm 3d graph fuel consumption expected time of arrival eta 1 introduction in the maritime transportation ship safety and energy efficiency are two of the most important topics to make a ship s operation more competitive and sustainable a sail plan system which combines the concepts of weather routing and voyage optimization is recognized as an efficient measure by the shipping industry to ensure a ship s safety gain more economic benefit and reduce negative effects on our environment dnvgl 2015 for ocean crossing ships encountering harsh weather environment and ocean currents can significantly influence a ship s sailing speeds a weather routing service is commonly used by captains often from short term perspectives during a voyage planning process to avoid potential dangerous and harsh weather conditions minimize the risk of ship cargo damage and human injures and estimate the expected time of arrival etc a voyage optimization system implements optimization algorithms in computers to plan a ship s sailing course and schedule in an optimum manner from long term perspectives for the entire voyage based on current weather forecasts and ship performance models in a conventional voyage optimization system a grid of waypoints along a ship s sailing area are first generated followed by setting up all possible candidate sailing routes and finally a path searching method is implemented to find the optimal route from those candidates with respect to specific objectives defined by end users such as expected time of arrival eta or minimum fuel cost etc therefore the main purpose of a sail plan system is to propose a ship s sailing course schedule from a departure port to a destination port with certain pre defined objectives e g the expected time of arrival with minimum fuel consumption and air emissions etc bowditch 2002 the core element of such a sail plan system is a proper voyage optimization algorithm which generates optimal ship routing based on the ocean weather forecast around a ship s sailing areas ship characteristics and ship operational capabilities as well as some constraints for a particular voyage simonsen et al 2015 wang 2018 a ship s operational capabilities are often described by various performance models that estimate a ship s operational performance at sea such as speed power relationship mao et al 2016 fuel consumption rate tillig et al 2018 fatigue damage accumulation mao et al 2012 etc in the current shipping community there are many voyage optimization algorithms available to solve a ship s voyage planning problems traditionally these algorithms simplify a ship s voyage optimization process into a two dimensional sub path searching problem where a ship s navigation inputs are often assumed as either a fixed speed or a fixed engine power revolution these methods limit the voyage optimization to find 2 dimensional ship route paths composed of a series of waypoints between departure and destination e g the modified isochrone method hagiwara 1989 the isopone method klompstra et al 1992 dynamic programming method bijlsma 1975 2002 de wit 1990 and dijkstra s algorithm dijkstra 1959 padhy et al 2008 as well as some evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithms hinnenthal 2008 wang et al 2018 to demonstrate the overall concept of how voyage optimization systems can benefit a ship s operations conventional 2 dimensional dijkstra s algorithm seeking for optimal sailing paths have been implemented to use fixed speed engine power böttner 2007 eskild 2014 or fixed engine rpm takashima et al 2009 in böttner 2007 this dijkstra method is combined with a genetic algorithm to allow for small variations around optimal paths found by the 2d algorithm to assist a ship s navigation in degraded sea conditions in addition the conventional 2 dimensitonal dijkstra s algorithm dijkstra 1959 is also used to develop voyage optimization systems which consider a ship s sailing constraints as maximum allowed motions accelerations and minimum fuel consumption vettor and guedes soares 2016 study the impact of metoc ensemble forecasts on optimal voyage planning chu et al 2014 and maximize the auxiliary resistance provided by wind propulsions walther 2015 however for ocean crossing ships especially for long voyages a ship s sailing speed and engine setting can vary significantly during a voyage the simplification of voyage optimization into a 2d path searching problem by these algorithms may lead to a local optimal solution for the routing problem wang et al 2017a to model a ship s 3d sailing scenario in voyage optimization some 3 dimensional algorithms have also been developed for example hinnenthal 2008 marie and courteille 2009 and maki et al 2011 presented evolutionary genetic algorithms for weather routing to consider a ship s safety issues i e stability in harsh sea conditions and minimum fuel consumption it should be noted that genetic algorithms may have the potential to provide global multi objective route planning but due to the large sample size in the planning process especially when the searching space and discretized time steps increase the limitation of searching sample size will lead to very local optimization results alternative research direction is to introduce the time variation into the current 2d isochrone method dynamic programming cui et al 2016 and dijkstra s algorithm such as the modified 3d isochrone method lin et al 2013 3d dynamic programming methods presented in shao and zhou 2012 skoglund et al 2012 2015 zaccone and figari 2017 zaccone et al 2018 in those 3d optimization methods the searching space in the time dimension is dynamically generated when a ship is sailing forward only a small part of sub paths toward the node represented by longitude and latitude of next stage with best results e g minimum fuel consumption for those sub paths with local optimized solutions can survive during the optimization process for each stage while other sub paths toward the node are neglected eliminated to reduce the computation effort otherwise the number of sub paths will increase exponential as a ship moving toward her destination each time step by step however during the process those eliminated nodes may be associated with a route of a global optimal solution for a certain eta moreover these 3d methods that dynamically generate searching space in time are not able to predict the eta before the whole optimization process is completely finished it means that for a voyage optimization with certain rpm power speed as inputs it will be very hard to adjust the input parameters to reach the destination at exactly the same expected time of arrival eta in this paper a 3d weighted graph including all possible sub paths based on a ship s sailing capability i e each waypoint is associated with all possible passing times is first generated to improve the current 3d voyage optimization methods and then dijkstra s algorithm is implemented to search the lowest cost path with a certain eta by dividing the graph generation and path searching algorithm into two separated procedures the proposed method can mitigate the possibility of neglecting global optimal solutions the proposed method is described in detailed in the following section 2 to make the completeness of the paper the performance model of a case study ship and other relevant information needed to demonstrate the proposed algorithm are given in section 3 the results of comparison between the proposed algorithm and other conventional methods are presented in section 4 as well as further discussions of other capabilities of the proposed algorithms the paper is concluded with conclusions and some key references 2 description of the 3d dijkstra s algorithm for ship routing a ship s sailing route is defined by a series of waypoints p forming a ship s trajectory and their associated passing time the waypoints and the associated time can be used to calculate the series of the ship s operational conditions u p i e sailing speed and heading along the route in this study for simple description of our optimization algorithm the variables used to define a ship s sailing route are denoted as follows ship state variable 1 p x y t t where x y t represent longitude latitude and time respectively ship control variable 2 u p v θ t where v is ship velocity and θ is heading angle they are formed as operational conditions of a ship state p weather conditions 3 w p h s t p c v w u v w v t which represent ocean wave h s t p s w h s t p current c and wind parameters v w u v w v etc at a ship state p ship sailing constraints c p u p w p which includes ship sailing constraints such as geometric constraint control constraint land crossing constraint engine power constraint etc and harsh weather constraint it returns boolean value that indicates the feasibility of the sailing conditions i e p and u p for different ship operation strategy used in worldwide shipping companies such as the fixed speed or engine power rpm rotation per minute operation the above ship control variables may differ significantly in routing optimization algorithms under the constraint c p u p w p the cost function c can be denoted by 4 c t 0 t n f u p w p d t where f u p w p is the instantaneous cost function ship performance models for a series of ship state p under control u p t 0 t n are the departure time and arrival time respectively here the cost function of a route can be of different forms e g fuel consumption maximum ship motions estimated time of arrival eta fatigue damage accumulation or crack propagation in a ship s structure wang et al 2017b etc depending on optimization methods the total cost function in eq 4 can be derived into various discrete stages the instantaneous cost function f is computed to get e g the fuel consumption expected time of arrival fatigue damage accumulation etc in the optimization algorithms finally the overall objective is to find suitable waypoints p and operational control sets u p which will lead to the minimum maximum value of c by following the optimum route encountering sea conditions w p at those waypoints the 3d dijkstra s algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problems to minimize the cost function in eq 4 while the workflow of this method is shown as fig 1 it can be divided into 3 steps 2 1 initialization of waypoints in sailing area the first step is to generate a grid of waypoints around a ship s sailing region such as in fig 2 the grid is often generated on the basis of the great circle reference route between the departure and the destination of a voyage firstly the reference route is discretized into several stages of equal distance each stage is represented by a waypoint represented by geographical longitude and latitude the distance of each stage between two adjacent waypoints along the reference route δ d g c is defined as 5 δ d g c v δ t where v is a ship s service speed and the choice of δt depends on the temporal resolution of weather forecast information here chosen as 3 h secondly for all the generated waypoints along the reference route a series of waypoints perpendicular to the reference route will be generated as in fig 2 the grid of waypoints should cover the entire possible region a ship may sail into then a time dimension is added to each waypoint to represent a series of feasible arrival times which are set to be the same as for all waypoints within the same stage the details are presented in the following subsection 2 2 3d graph generation for a computer aided voyage optimization a voyage should be discretized into various stages to form a graph g p a where p is a set of pre defined waypoints and a is a set of sailing sub paths edges composed of waypoint pairs every sailing sub path edge is assigned with a weight let a i denote the sub path edge connecting waypoints of two adjacent stages p i 1 and p i and the required sailing time is denoted by δ t i according to eq 4 the weight of each edge becomes 6 c p i f u p i 1 w p i 1 δ t i a simple example of the 3d graph is shown in fig 3 for a voyage denoted by g p a its 3d graph can be generated by the following six steps 1 generate geographical waypoints nodes in the spatial region shown in fig 2 the sub paths edges to connect waypoints between two adjacent stages are shown as the upper plot of fig 3 the trajectory of the voyage is divided into n stages along the reference course which is taken here as the great circle between the departure p 0 and the destination p n for the i th stage waypoints generated perpendicular to the reference course as in fig 2 are denoted by p i j j 1 2 m where j represents the index of the waypoint in the i th stage and p i j represents the candidate sailing waypoints in the i th stage 2 generate initial time set a ship s speed is set to vary in the range 0 5v 1 2v where v is the service speed in the temporal region the expected arrival time set for all waypoints in the i th stage is denoted by 7 ϑ i t i 1 t i 2 t i k δ t i 1 2 δ t i 1 2 δ t δ t i 1 2 2 δ t 2 δ t i where δt is defined as the time interval of a sub path for the i th stage and it is initialized based on the spatial resolution of the waypoints and the ship s input speed in this study the value of δt ranges 12 min 30 min for various stages then all ship geographical states at the i th stage p i j j 1 2 m are assigned with the same passing arrival time set t i k k 1 2 k to form an irregular multi dimensional array ϑ i j k shown as the red dots in vertical direction of fig 3 lower plot 3 since the number of potential arrival time at each stage i e k increases monotonically instead of exponentially as the stage advances a feasible arrival time set for the i th stage can be generated the feasible time set is then assigned to each node p i j in the i th stage then the geographical waypoints p i j can be transformed into a ship state p i j k shown as eq 8 where k represents the index referring to the feasible arrival time set ϑ in fig 3 lower plot the red dots are the accessible time set ϑ for different stages and the black dots are eliminated from the initial time set 0 δt 2δt 2 δ t i p i j k p i j t i k x i j y i j ϑ i j k 8 i 1 2 n j 1 2 m and k 1 2 k that varies as stages 4 generate edges set a for the graph the edge generation of the nodes ship states from adjacent stages is under three basic constraints in this study to mitigate the computation effort first large course changing between adjacent stages is not allowed second the ship speed should be in the range 0 5v 1 2v where v is the service speed third land crossing and sailing in limited water depth between the nodes is not allowed finally some safety related factors such as the harshest sea conditions that a ship is not allowed to sail as introduced in imo 2007 is considered as constraints in the method 5 calculate the cost fuel consumption for each individual edge the edges contain the information of geographical locations and passing arrival times of both nodes the distance between the nodes and the ship speed and heading weather condition w p can be extracted based on the locations and times of nodes in this study the weather condition is chosen as encountered by the first node of an edge and u p is the ship speed and heading the cost as well as other output such as shaft power effective power for the ship sailing in this edge can be calculated from eq 6 in addition other objectives that can be accumulated during the voyage such as structure damage crack propagation can be also added 6 add the calculated data and extracted weather data as attributes to the edges in this step more constraints are considered i e maximum engine constraint allowed maximum encountering wave environment in this study ship motion constraints are not considered but they could be easily implemented if the constrain conditions for the target ship are known if the data doesn t fulfil the constraints the edges are not added to the graph if the 3d weighted graph generated by the proposed method is in high enough resolution it can enumerate all circumstances that ship could encounter during her sailing voyage the graph generation does require large computational effort including generating a grid of waypoints assigning time and extracting metocean environments to the waypoints as well as estimating the weight objective function to all the edges sub paths however since all the information required by the graph generation is statically stored as matrix parallel computation and matrix manipulation can be and are adopted in this method to allow fast simulations 2 3 dijkstra s algorithm implemented to the 3d graph system dijkstra s algorithm works in a grid graph system by visiting sub paths edges starting from the departure node waypoint it follows two basic principles dijkstra 1959 firstly a sub route of a shortest route is itself a shortest route and secondly with a given shortest distance x between points a and c a path going from point a to c through a third point b will always be of a distance greater than or equal to x for a practical ship voyage optimization problem as shown in fig 2 let g be a grid of waypoints as the graph system from departure point p 0 via waypoints p 1 j 1 p 2 j 2 p n 1 j n 1 to the destination p n where j n is the index of optimum passing waypoint in the n th stage of the planned route let c p i j denote the total cost e g fuel consumption damage accumulation or time etc that a ship sails until the waypoint p i j from all waypoints of the preceded stages let m denote the number of waypoints at each stage δ c k denote the instantaneous cost sailing from the j th waypoint at the preceding stage p i 1 j to the current waypoint p i j and the required sailing time is denoted by δ t k the cost δ c k can be calculated as 9 δ c k f u p i 1 k w p i 1 k δ t k the costs of sailing along different sub paths to the current waypoint p i j can be written as 10 c p i j c p i 1 1 δ c 1 c p i 1 2 δ c 2 c p i 1 m δ c m where c p i 1 k is the total cost for a ship sailing until the waypoint p i 1 k the minimum of these n costs in eq 9 is chosen as the optimal preceded sub path reach to the waypoint p i j following the same approach the optimal sub path of minimum cost for all other waypoints in the same i th stage as p i j can be found subsequently the minimum cost sub path from departure to the i th stage is memorized repeating this procedure until reaching to the destination point the minimum cost optimal ship route in the grid system can be generated in this study the dijkstra s algorithm is implemented as a shortest path finding method to find the shortest path in the 3d graph for this example let assume that the generated 3d graph contains k time states to the destination corresponding to k optimum routes associated with k etas for the k th optimum route let the p i j i k denote the geographical location in the i th stage of the optimum route associated with the k th eta and the arrival time to this location is denoted by t i k finally the k final candidate optimum routes geographical locations and arrival times are denoted by 11 p d a p 1 p 2 p k p 0 p 1 j 1 1 t 1 1 p n 1 j n 1 1 t n 1 1 p n t n 1 p 0 p 1 j 1 2 t 1 2 p n 1 j n 1 2 t n 1 2 p n t n 2 p 0 p 1 j 1 k t 1 k

effort for constructing the graph system is time consuming in the current north atlantic sailing voyages each graph constructed with very high resolution contains about 50000 nodes and 1 million edges generation of each graph using the parallel computation technique costs approximately 3 4 min by a normal desktop with intel core i5 8400 while the implementation of dijkstra s algorithm for searching optimal solutions is within seconds 3 details of case studies for voyage optimization in order to demonstrate the capability of the proposed 3d dijkstra s algorithm for ship routing optimization problems a 2800teu container ship sailing in the north atlantic is taken as a case study ship mao 2014 the main particulars of the ship are listed in table 1 for this case study ship the full scale measurements of the ship s performance at sailing in the north atlantic during the year 2008 are available to this study the measurement campaign includes both eastbound and westbound voyages for both winter and spring navigations it should be noted that the ship was also installed an old fashion 2d voyage optimization system onboard the actual sailing and fuel cost were a combination of voyage planning service and captains experiences on navigation in that area this information will be taken to investigate the potential benefits that can be realized by the proposed 3d dijkstra s algorithm this study focuses on demonstrating the capability of the proposed optimization algorithm for the minimum fuel route as the objective and keeping the same eta as the measure voyages for the demonstration the voyage optimization also needs performance models to estimate the ship s speed and fuel cost relationships in terms of the surrounding weather environments in the following subsections the procedures to get the ship s speed power performance model access to surrounding sea environment and the investigated cases for comparison are briefly described 3 1 ship speed power performance model in this study a ship s speed is taken as input for the voyage optimization for the optimization the ship s engine power needed to push the ship forward at the input speed should be estimated as the cost based on encountered sea conditions the ship s characteristics and operational profiles etc the workflow for the ship speed power performance modelling is presented in fig 4 the conventional way is to separate a ship s sailing resistance into calm water resistance and added resistances due to wind and waves when sailing in open sea the summation of the calm water resistance and added resistance is called the total resistance which needs to be compensated by the thrust force provided by the engine and propellers dependent on the engine type and propeller properties used on a specific ship their work efficiency is often provided by the manufactures and can be used to calculate the final fuel consumption needed for marine engines to push the ship forward in a ship s energy performance model the key parameter is the ship speed through water v according to the simple approximation formula from iso15016 2015 the speed through water is approximated by subtracting the current speed v c from a ship s speed over ground v g also known as the gps speed viz 12 v v g v c the above consideration of current in the speed power performance model may contain some uncertainties due to side forces and drifting effects caused by the current in particular for regions with very high current velocities in the present study the target case study ship was continuously sailing in the north atlantic area with very little current impact for the estimation of wind resistance the method from iso15016 2015 is implemented 13 r a a 0 5 ρ a c a a ψ w r r e f a x v v w r r e f 2 0 5 ρ a c a a 0 a x v v g 2 where r aa is the resistance increase due to relative wind c aa is the wind resistance coefficient ρ a is the mass density of air a xv is the transverse projected area above the waterline including superstructures ψ wrref is the relative wind direction v wrref is the relative wind velocity at the reference height v g is the measured ship s speed over ground in the following the speed through water v from eq 12 is used to estimate other resistant components then the calm water resistance r t is calculated by the holtrop and mennen 1984 method dividing r t into the following components 14 r t 1 k r f r a p p r w r b r t r r a where r f r app r w r b r tr and r a denote a ship s frictional resistance resistance of appendages wave making and wave breaking resistance additional pressure resistance of bulbous bow and immersed transom stern and model ship correction resistance while k represents the correction factor to the viscous resistance the formula to get all the calm water resistance components are obtained from holtrop and mennen 1984 and ittc 2015 the semi empirical formula was regressed from large number of test results it can give rather good results in average for some standard ship types however some errors should be expected from the method as well such as formulas to get wetted surface viscous pressure and wave pattern resistance as investigated by tillig et al 2018 the added resistance in waves can significantly affect a ship s total fuel consumption for an ocean crossing voyage to estimate such resistance in actual sea state firstly added resistance due to regular waves of a unit wave amplitude and a series of wave frequencies ω at an operational profile v θ is often divided into two components 15 r a w ω v θ r a w r ω v r a w m ω v f θ where r awr and r awm denote wave reflection and ship motion induced resistances v and θ represent a ship s speed and heading angle different empirical formulas and hydrodynamic theory based numerical methods are available to get the added resistances due to waves in this study the semi theoretical formulas proposed by liu and papanikolaou 2016 are used to estimate the response amplitude operators raos of r awr and r awm but only for head sea operations inspired by the ideas from alexandersson 2009 a gaussian function f θ is used to model the impact of heading angles for added resistance in waves then the mean added resistance due to an actual sea state of irregular waves represented by a significant wave height h s and mean wave period t z described by an ittc wave spectrum s h s t z can be computed by 16 r a w h s t z v θ 0 s h s t z r a w ω v θ d ω the approximation of added wave resistance as in eqs 15 16 could contain large uncertainties therefore the full scale measurements will be used to calibrate the model by some statistical regression methods as in the next subsection in addition other added resistances due to effect of shallow water water temperature are simply estimated by the method proposed in iso15016 2015 then the total resistance r tot is estimated as the summation of all the calm water resistance added resistances due to wind wave current and shallow water finally for a ship s sailing at the waypoint p i associated with operational profile u p i and encountering sea state w p i a ship s fuel consumption can be estimated by 17 c f u e l p b s f o c t i 1 t i p b r t o t v η 0 η h η s where sfoc g kwh is the specific fuel oil consumption t i 1 t i is the sailing time from the i th stage to the next stage and it varies depending on individual nodes waypoints η h η o η s are the hull efficiency propeller open water efficiency and engine shaft efficiency estimated by methods proposed in holtrop and mennen 1984 in this study a stationary sea state represented by h s t p s w h s t p is assumed to last for 3 h which is equal to the time resolution as the weather downloaded from ecmwf the ship s performance model may contain a lot of uncertainties for the speed power estimation tillig et al 2018 such as hull and propeller fouling statistical wave description various propulsion coefficients etc it is impossible to accurately describe a ship s speed power relationship using any semi empirical or theoretical models however to demonstrate the benefit of optimization algorithms for voyage planning it is enough if the performance model can properly describe a ship s performance characteristics at sea skoglund et al 2015 such as the trend of speed loss at different sea and operation conditions can be properly modelled furthermore some statistical methods as in mao et al 2016 are used to calibrate the total fuel consumption model to match the ship s measured speed power performance to minimize the power prediction errors between the above theoretical and semi empirical methods and the measured power 3 2 case study ship and measured voyages the case study ship of full scale measurement when sailing at the north atlantic during 2008 is used to demonstrate and compare the capabilities of proposed voyage optimization with conventional sailing methods the case study voyages are chosen to cover both eastbound and westbound voyage in both winter and spring seasons fig 5 presents the trajectories of the three eastbound voyages of which two represent winter voyages and one represents a spring voyage fig 6 shows the trajectories of the four westbound voyages where three for winter seasons and one for spring seasons it is shown that the trajectories for all eastbound voyages are quite similar while there are large scatters for the trajectories of the westbound voyages this is because storms in north atlantic always move from the east to the west traditionally it is rather important for captains to carefully plan ship routes for westbound voyages to ensure ship cargo safety and save fuel in particular sailing during the winter while eastbound voyages usually involve less aids from modern voyage optimization systems this study also aims at investigating the potential of fuel saving by using the propose optimization method even for eastbound voyages furthermore for the demonstration of voyage optimization sea condition information along the sailing area i e the meteorological and oceanographic metocean data such as wind wave current water depth and wave temperature are needed to estimate the cost as described in the above subsection for the demonstration of our proposed 3d dijkstra s algorithm the metocean conditions for the case study ship voyages are assumed to be fully available for the route planning optimization for example all ship performance related parameters are extracted from either ecmwf era interim hindcast dataset dee et al 2014 such as wind wind speeds and directions or wave information wave height and period and the current data is accessed from the server by oscar 2019 finally the implemented ship performance models in particular the semi theoretical model for added resistance in waves weather impact model have to be calibrated and validated to the ship s actual performance before they can be used to investigate the benefits of the proposed optimization algorithm for ship voyage planning for this case study ship the full scale measurements contain some basic information regarding the ship s sailing such as times locations speeds and heading associated with all passing waypoints recorded every 30 min as well as the marine engine rotational speed rpm unfortunately the shaft power was not recorded in the following the ship s rpm is used to roughly calibrate the implemented ship speed power performance model in order to describe the basic trend of weather impact speed loss from the actual measurements firstly from the one year s full scale measurements of the 2800teu containership under a certain range of the ship s engine rpm all the ship s sailing speeds are extracted secondly from the selected dataset let choose waypoints associated with very calm sea states hs 1 0 m and collect all the ship speeds at these waypoints then the average speed in the calm sea under the specific engine rpm is calculated as 18 5 knots finally let select all sailing waypoints sea states with sea environments of beaufort number 6 bn6 and categorized them into various heading angles for each heading angle under bn6 the ship s mean speed is computed from the collected data the results of the collected data are presented in fig 7 as the red curve for the comparison the speed reduction under the same above conditions are estimated by the ship speed power performance models implemented from the subsection 3 1 the results are plotted as the blue line in fig 7 it is shown that these models overestimate a bit of the weather impacts in particular of head waves a simple regression method is used to calibrate the original speed power model and the corrected results are shown good agreement with the measured weather impact in addition the trend of estimated weather impact from the calibrated model also agrees well with the computed by the advanced computational fluid dynamic analysis in kim et al 2017 furthermore as indicated by skoglund et al 2015 for the purpose of comparing the benefits of a voyage optimization algorithm it should be enough to use a ship performance model that can properly describe the trend characteristics of the ship s weather impact at various operation conditions therefore this model should be accurate enough for the following analysis to investigate the potential fuel saving benefits by using our proposed method in particular the fuel consumptions for all the routes obtained by various voyage planning methods in the next section are computed by the same calibrated ship performance model 3 3 various voyage optimization methods for comparison in order to verify the benefit of the proposed voyage optimization algorithm four voyage planning methods are used for the comparison i e the great circle routes the measured route combining the captain s experiences and an unknown voyage optimization system conventional 2d dijkstra s algorithm 2dda and the currently proposed 3d dijkstra s algorithm 3dda in the verification study the ship s speed is considered to be the main control input variable for the planning of great circle routes and the routes generated by 2dda and 3dda the etas of these voyages are assumed to be approximately the same with the measured sailing time for the great circle routes and 2dda routes the ship s speed is set to be fixed as 18 v f d g c t a where d gc is the great circle distance and t a is the measured sailing time for each investigated voyage due to the involuntary speed loss when sailing at harsh sea environments the ship cannot be guaranteed to reach her destination at the same time as the measured time t a if she is sailing in the estimated speed v f therefore the input speed v f has to adjusted to make the sailing time as close to the measured t a as possible it should be noted that if the engine power needed to push the ship at a given speed exceeds the maximum shaft power of the ship engine the input ship speed will be reduced due to such constraints the ship may take longer time to sail along the great circle routes than her measured sailing routes when harsh sea conditions are expected when using the 2dda for voyage optimization the input speed is set to be a bit higher than v f in order to have approximately the same eta with the measured routes this is because the 2dda may suggest the routes with longer distance than the great circle routes the speed inputs of the proposed 3dda is regarded as a variable and the speed variable v 3 d d a at each stage v i can be chosen as 19 v 3 d d a v 1 v 2 v n where v i 0 5 v f 1 2 v f i 1 n the speed variation in the 3dda method can overcome the limitation of 2dda and allow for flexible voyage optimization with proper speed configuration along the voyage 4 results and benefits of using voyage optimization the proposed 3d dijkstra s algorithm can generate optimal routes corresponding to different feasible etas of a given voyage it can allow end users to select the route of minimum fuel consumption with the most suitable eta according to their company s business schedule in order to study the potential fuel saving benefits of using the proposed 3dda method only the optimal routes with the same etas as the measured etas are selected the fuel consumptions and sailing distances of the planned routes obtained by the four voyage planning methods i e actual sailing routes from the full scale measurements great circle routes shortest distance sailing 2 dimensional dijkstra 2dda method and the proposed 3 dimensional dijkstra 3dda method are compared the fuel consumption for all the four route planning methods is calculated by the theoretical model described above the results for those typical eastbound and westbound voyages are presented in the following subsections 4 1 eastbound voyages optimization normally shipping companies may not seriously consider voyage optimization for eastbound voyages as in fig 5 since storms in the north atlantic always move from the west to the east however the results listed in table 2 indicate significant fuel saving by using the 3dda method in comparison with actual sailing from the measurements in particular for winter voyages table 2 compares the fuel consumption and sailing distance of the routes generated by the four planning methods it shows that the 3dda method has a great potential of saving fuel up to about 12 in comparison with the ship s actual sailing routes the routes generated by the 2dda optimization method can help to reduce in average about 6 fuel consumption than the actual routes the higher fuel costs along the actual routes may be partly caused by the long sailing distances while the conventional optimization algorithm i e the 2dda method generates longer sailing routes than the great circle routes with a bit higher fuel consumption it may be caused by the lack of consideration of speed variation in the conventional 2d optimization process which may lead to local optimal voyage planning by the 2dda method it also motivates the need to develop 3 dimensional voyage optimization methods in order to further investigate the difference of fuel consumption and distance in those routes the optimized courses sailing speeds and encountered sea conditions along two winter voyages are presented in figs 8 9 for the routing optimization one of the important tasks is to choose route with less harsh sea conditions while the sea conditions are represented by the significant wave height h s in meters in these figures where the left plots present sailing courses generated by the four optimization methods since the sea environments along the spring voyage are quite calm with less than 3 m for all generated routes the fuel consumptions and sailing distances by all the methods are quite close to each other it is not investigated in the following analysis for the first winter voyages 20080117 fig 8 shows that all four suggested courses differ from each other especially at the beginning of the voyages the sailing course generated by the 2dda method goes toward the northernmost and the actual sailing was simply following the rhumb line there is almost no involuntary speed reduction when the great circle sailing and the 2dda method are used the initial speed setting for the 2dda method is a bit higher than the great circle sailing and the 2dda route is also associated with longer sailing distance but the fuel consumptions by these two methods do not differ too much this is partly because the encountered wave conditions along the routes by 2dda are in average lower than the great circle routes because the 3dda can adjust the ship s speed voluntary speed reduction based on the weather and sea conditions it can generate a route with least fuel consumption but still keep the same eta as the measured one for the second winter voyage 20081224 shown in fig 9 due to relatively harsh sea conditions encountered during the voyage with maximum h s around 6 m there are large differences in both sailing distance and fuel consumption among the routes planned by different methods the 2dda method can generate route with longer sailing distance than the great circle route but encountered moderate sea environment the optimal route generated by the 3dda method is consistent with the great circle route but the fuel consumption is a bit lower than the simple great circle sailing this is because the 3dda method can adjust a ship s speed according to encountered sea environments as shown in the right plot of fig 9 the encountered h s by the 3dda method is always smaller than the great circle sailing because the small weather impact for the following sea operations in the eastbound voyages the fuel consumptions of routes optimized by the 2dda and the 3dda methods do not differ too much from the great circle sailing however the fuel consumptions of the actual routes are significantly higher than other routes this can be the consequence of lack of careful planning for those eastbound voyages the actual routes follow the rhumb line rather than the great circle route with longer sailing distance for these eastbound voyages when captains planned their routes focusing more on the ship safety and sailing eta the fuel consumption may be not seriously considered even by voyage optimization systems in 2008 in this study the fuel consumption is the main objective for the voyage optimization by the 2dda and 3dda methods as shown in the results using voyage optimization with respect to minimum fuel consumption 8 of fuel sailing can be easily achieved in particular for winter voyages 4 2 westbound voyages optimization for the westbound sailing it is extremely important to plan a ship s routes carefully it is true not just for the objective of reducing fuel consumption even for old conventional voyage optimization systems that more care about the safety and eta as sailing objectives or constrains four measured voyages are conducted to validate the fuel saving benefits by using the proposed 3dda method table 3 lists the eta fuel consumption and sailing distances for those four generated ship routes for a given eta the proposed 3dda method can always provide a route with better results for fuel saving as the optimization objective i e in average about 12 of the fuel saving in comparison with the actual sailing in comparison with a conventional 2dda method the 3dda method can help to reduce fuel consumption by about 4 since the westbound voyages in general consume more fuel than the eastbound voyages the 3dda can lead to large fuel saving the sailing distances of routes optimized by the 2dda method can sometimes be 10 longer than the great circle routes but the fuel consumption are quite similar between routes by the 2dda and the great circle routes because the 2dda method can plan a route encountering less harsh sea environments while the 2dda is still a local optimal solution for an actual voyage planning the 3dda method is capable to configure the ship s speed and course from the entire voyage perspectives providing a global optimal solution this also leads to the fact that the 3dda method gives the lowest fuel costs among all routes furthermore the details of three westbound voyages are investigated in figs 10 12 for two winter voyages and one spring voyage in 2008 for the first winter voyage 20080129 it is obviously shown that the actual route as in fig 10 was seriously planned since it differs from both the rhumb line and great circle route the course of the actual route is quite close to that optimized by the 2dda method as shown in the left plot of fig 10 i e the voyage optimization system used by the case study ship may be similar as the 2dda method since the voluntary speed reduction in the 3dda method can optimize both geographical locations and passing time along a voyage even though the encountered sea conditions along the 3dda generated route are relatively higher than the actual route and the 2dda generated routes as shown in the right plot of fig 10 the 3dda method can save about 7 of fuel consumption because of better speed planning it also implies that the 3dda method can adjust the ship s speed well to meet more moderate sea conditions the ship speeds optimized by 3dda is the lowest in the middle of the voyage where is near the storm for this voyage the simple great circle sailing will encounter the harshest sea conditions i e maximum significant wave height more than 8 m from safety perspectives the great circle route with shortest distance is not followed by the actual and optimized sailing the similar results for the spring voyage are presented in fig 11 where the left plot shows that the route optimized by the 3dda method coincides with the great circle route the measured route did a large course change on the waypoint with longitude close to 45 before a simple rhumb line navigation the actual route differs significantly from all the other routes the sailing distance of the measured route is about 3 longer than the great circle route but its fuel consumption is more than 20 higher because the ship was always operated in head sea conditions along the rhumb line route with relative higher sailing speeds it is also a strong evidence that large fuel saving potential can be realized even for a spring voyage encountering low h s if the route can be carefully optimized by the 3dda method for the other winter westbound voyage 20081214 the actual route is quite close to the great circle route however since the sailing speeds at the beginning of the voyage are significantly higher a normal navigation strategy to sail fast at the beginning to ensure a ship s eta than other methods as well as the involuntary voluntary speed reduction in the location with longitude close to 40 the fuel consumption of the actual route is about 10 higher than the great circle sailing on the other side even though the encountered sea environments along the route optimized by the 3dda method are quite similar as the 2dda method and the great circle sailing the 3dda method gives the lowest fuel consumption i e about 6 lower than the 2dda method and 15 lower than the actual route it again confirms the capability of proper speed setting by the 3dda method for global voyage optimization 4 3 other capabilities of the proposed 3dda for ship route planning 4 3 1 demonstration of multi objective optimization the above case study voyages have validated the benefits of fuel saving by the proposed 3dda method in addition the present 3dda method can perform multi objective optimization for ship voyage planning for example conventional voyage planning methods often deal with single objective optimization problem such as minimizing arrival time to the destination lowest fuel consumption those methods often treat a ship s operation conditions safety air emissions etc as constraints e g a ship cannot be operated in sea conditions of significant wave height larger than 10 m in the following another objective i e minimum fatigue damage accumulation is selected as a case example to show the potential of this 3dda method for multi objective voyage optimization it should be noted that the objective of minimum fatigue damage accumulation along upcoming voyages is also of great interest especially for old ships with many cracks onboard to consider fatigue damage in the voyage optimization process the fatigue model another cost function developed by mao et al 2010 based on the conventional s n curve is implemented to estimate a ship s damage accumulation this model can estimate a ship s damage accumulation in a sailing sub path edge between the i th stage and the next one in such a sailing sub path the fatigue damage accumulated at the sea state of significant wave height h s under ship speed v and heading angle θ is simply approximated by eq 20 as 20 d 0 47 t i 1 t i ψ v θ α h s 2 5 3 75 2 π v c o s θ h s 2 3 75 2 9 81 where most of the parameters are the same as in eq 17 whle ψ is derived from the transfer function of a ship s structural stresses under various operational conditions v θ and α is the intercept parameter of a s n parameter that can be obtained from any ship design guidelines here α is chosen as 1012 16 as in dnvgl 2014 theoretically the graph generated by the 3dda method can create innumerable possible sample routes and pareto frontiers of various optimization objectives could be easily formulated from those routes the westbound voyage 20080129 is taken as an example to demonstrate the application of multi objective voyage optimization by the proposed 3dda method the multi objective optimization results with respect to minimum fatigue damage accumulation and lowest fuel consumption against various etas are presented in fig 13 the left plot shows the 3 dimensional relationship among the fuel consumption damage accumulation and etas extracted from the optimization results where the pareto points of fuel versus damage are marked as red dots for each predefined eta for the measured eta of 106 h the right plot presents the optimization results of fuel versus damage the relationship between a ship s fuel consumption and fatigue damage accumulation is different from that between the fuel consumption and eta for example harsh sea environments can cause higher fatigue damage as explained by the fatigue damage model in eq 20 similar as the fuel consumption however for calm sea operations there is no fatigue damage accumulation but large fuel consumption is also required this complex relationship leads to the pareto frontier as well as the sample routes located in the right hand side of the pareto frontier shown in fig 13 right plot for those sample routes their fuel consumption and damage accumulation increase at the same time the pareto frontier gives ship operators information regarding how to make trade off decisions on optimal route between proper damage accumulation and fuel consumption for example for some old ships with serious fatigue problems wang et al 2017b minimum damage accumulation should be treated more important to determine the final ship route in comparison with the actual fatigue damage accumulated in this voyage mao et al 2010 the optimal routes in the pareto frontier can easily reduce the damage accumulation by 50 furthermore if a ship s fuel consumption is of major concerns optimal voyages associated with lowest fuel consumption at different etas form as another pareto frontier as the red line presented in fig 14 left plot in this study the interval of etas is set as 30 min in the graph of the 3dda method leading to discrete sample routes in the plot the courses of the optimum voyages generated by the 3dda method for etas ranging from 94 to 118 h with 0 5 h interval are also presented in fig 14 right plot it shows large deviations of sailing courses if different eta is selected 4 3 2 efficient course regeneration and weather data update captains often need to adjust update a ship s course on a daily basis to either keep the ship on track or mitigate risks if harsh sea environments are expected from updated weather forecasts the deviation is not only related to course change but it also affects arrival passing times of all the nodes waypoints in the graph grid system constructed for voyage optimization the deviation may cause the ship no longer sailing along her optimum route in other 3d voyage optimization methods since the ship s speeds or engine power and rpms are taken as changing variables along a voyage an update of metocean data for all the nodes associated with many passing times is needed for every stage that a voyage advances toward her destination in particular the passing times for each node of a specific stage are not known before the speed power analysis is carried out for all the nodes before that stage for a long distance voyage optimization problem using conventional 3d optimization methods most of the computational time would be spent on the iteration in the optimization process the iteration contains many steps of data processing classically one step of iteration contains 1 extracting and interpolating metocean data wind wave current temperature etc for current nodes 2 calculating the location and arrival time or speed for the forward or backward adjacent nodes 3 calculating the objective function for current nodes 4 most importantly making decision in each iteration to decide which nodes will be kept in the memory for next iteration techniques which can decrease the computational time such as parallel computing can t be applied if the decision made in previous iteration affect the result of current iteration in our proposed approach the schema is totally different from other 3d voyage optimization methods firstly a 3d weighted graph is built the node in the graph which can also be described as ship state contains the information of location and time the edge in the graph contains the basic information such as ship speed heading and distance the information can be stored in the matrix and used to extract the metocean data and calculate the objective function during this procedure iterations and decision making are not involved thus computational techniques can be applied for fast calculation when an updated voyage optimization process is needed in the middle of a voyage at certain node waypoint due to captains interest to check a ship s eta status or updated weather forecast available all the succeeding waypoints sub path edges and corresponding costs can be instantly retrieved and updated based on the provided weather information while the optimal sub route sailing from the current node to the destination can be also obtained by implementing a dijkstra s algorithm the updating of the optimization process by the proposed 3dda method could be simply repeated during any stage of a voyage and will be extremely beneficial for actual route planning and monitoring the same westbound voyage 20080129 is selected as an example to demonstrate the capability the red triangle in fig 15 left plot represents the waypoint that the ship should pass after 47 h of sailing from departure but due to the course deviation it arrived at the black triangle after 48 5 h to ensure the ship to arrive on time as well as minimizing the fuel consumption another optimum sub route is generated from the deviated course with the same predefined eta the new optimized sub route using the same graph as the initial optimization by the 3dda method is presented in fig 15 right plot table 4 shows the corresponding fuel consumption for this example by using the 3dda method the updating of the voyage optimization can generate optimal sub routes with lowest fuel consumption for different etas as shown in left plot of fig 16 the right plot of fig 16 presents the pareto frontier of minimal fuel consumption for different etas from the regenerated optimal sub routes the computation time of updating the voyage optimization process in the middle of a voyage is within a minute with intel core i5 8400 5 conclusions this paper proposed a modified three dimensional dijkstra s algorithm 3dda method to provide a ship s global optimal voyage planning with multi objective capabilities a case study container ship sailing in the north atlantic with full scale measurements during the year 2008 is used to demonstrate and validate the capabilities of the proposed 3dda method through the comparison with other conventional route planning methods it shows that the 3dda method has a big potential to lower the ship s fuel consumption and plan the sailing schedule with more accurate expected time of arrival for the case study vessel it is shown that even for the eastbound voyages in spring seasons a careful voyage planning by the 3dda method can significantly reduce the ship s fuel consumption in comparison with the ship s actual sailing routes the 3dda method can help to reduce in average about 10 fuel consumption considering all the investigated voyages while still keep the same etas as the measured this method can also take additional objectives such as time engine power fatigue damage etc into optimization process to allow multi objective optimization e g accurate eta minimum fuel consumption in this study the minimum fatigue damage accumulation is taken as another objective to illustrate the capability of the 3dda method for multi objective optimization adding one additional objective for the multi objective optimization is always accompanied by exponential increase of computational effort for the sake of computational efficiency parallel computing can be easily applied by this 3dda and all the metocean and cost data associated with all the waypoints in the grid graph system are kept in the memory thus the third advantage is that recalculation can be done during the voyage without establishing new waypoints grid system if there are deviations over either locations or arrival times furthermore the 3dda method can provide better voluntary speed reduction or speed increase for route planning for energy efficient shipping the example shows that during severe sea conditions by properly reducing the speed the fuel consumption decreases exponentially however the conventional route planning method taking fixed speed setting in e g conventional 2dda or great circle sailing methods may significantly increase fuel consumption in comparison with sailing based on captains experiences during heavy sea condition moreover the 3dda method can automatically increase a ship s speeds with running maximum engine capability in the calm area to catch up eta or reduce fuel consumption from the entire voyage perspective acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the funding support from stint

22716,this paper presents a numerical study on the interaction between the forward and aft propellers of hybrid crp pod propulsion systems crp pod in open water with a focus on both global quantities that is thrust and torque and flow details such as vortical structure slipstream evolution and lateral load on the pod unit improved delayed detached eddy simulation iddes method is adopted and combined with the γ r e θ transition model the open water characteristics of crp pod obtained by cfd are in satisfactory agreement with model test data two sets of crp pods with different propeller geometries are considered it is found independently of propeller geometry that i in terms of thrust and torque the forward propeller is slightly affected by the aft propeller while it has a large effect on the aft propeller ii the wake of the forward propeller is accelerated in the axial direction and weakened in the tangential direction by the aft propeller and iii the time averaged lateral force on the pod unit is reduced remarkably by the propeller propeller interaction however the vortex interaction between the forward and aft propellers depends significantly on the propeller geometry in the case when the tip vortices shed by the forward and aft propellers can directly collide with each other the vortical structure in the wake becomes unstable and rapidly breaks down keywords hybrid crp pod propulsion system crp pod interaction between forward and aft propellers improved delayed detached eddy simulation iddes vortical structure energy saving device esd 1 introduction a hybrid crp pod propulsion system crp pod consists of a forward conventional shaft propeller and an aft podded propulsor the two propellers are driven by independent power supplies and are contra rotating thus rotational energy generated by the forward propeller can be partially recovered by the aft propeller in this regard crp pod is considered an active energy saving device esd compared with a single screw a higher propulsive efficiency can be obtained by a crp pod by reducing the diameter and rotational speed of each propeller as the total thrust is distributed between propellers kim et al 2002 conducted a comparative investigation on a single screw twin screws and crp pod for an ultra large container ship their results show that the crp pod is the most efficient with about 9 and 5 power saving compared with the twin screw and single screw respectively ueda et al 2004 reported the first application of crp pod in a fast ferry which showed an energy saving of more than 13 compared with a conventional twin shaft system crp pod also has other benefits such as low level noise a flexible general arrangement and good redundancy it is for these reasons that crp pod has been an attractive technology in marine propulsion in recent years however it is a challenge to design a crp pod with good hydrodynamic performance and feasibility for a given ship many design parameters must be considered including the diameter and rotational speed of each propeller power distribution and axial distance between propellers the correlation between these design parameters and hydrodynamic performance is not completely known due to the complicated interaction between forward and aft propellers therefore analysis of this interaction is important for predicting and optimizing the hydrodynamic performance of a crp pod system there has been some research work on this topic a model test conducted by go et al 2005 showed that the thrust and torque of the forward propeller are not fixed when the rotational speed of the aft propeller changes due to their interaction and there is a unique value of the rotational speed ratio corresponding to a predetermined power ratio between the forward and aft propellers chang and go 2011 confirmed the unique relationship between revolution and the power ratio and an experiment showed that this relationship changes linearly with the ship s speed their results also revealed that the forward propeller has a larger effect on the aft propeller than vice versa xiong et al 2016 analyzed the effect of axial distance between propellers on the open water performance of each propeller based on cfd simulation and model tests and concluded that axial distance has little effect on the forward propeller but a large effect on the aft propeller this was numerically confirmed by he and wan 2017 based on cfd wang et al 2016 numerically studied the scale effect of crp pod in open water condition it was found that the thrust and torque of propellers are independent of the reynolds number but depend linearly on the rotational speed ratio however most literature on crp pod has focused on global quantities that is the thrust and torque of each propeller little work has been devoted to the analysis of flow details such as evolution of the vortex and velocity in the wake which are important not only for analyzing the propulsive efficiency noise emission and structural vibration of crp pod but also for revealing the flow mechanism of the interaction between the forward and aft propellers this work aims to carry out numerical investigation on the propeller propeller interaction of crp pod in open water condition with a focus on not only global quantities but also on flow details such as the vortical structure and velocity in the slipstream to this end an unsteady sst k ω based detached eddy simulation des method is adopted combined with a sliding mesh to handle the propeller rotation a correlation based γ r e θ transition method is used to take into account the effect of turbulence transition model tests in open water are carried out to provide validation data for cfd two sets of crp pods designed for the same ship but with different blade geometries are considered in contrast with contra rotating propellers crp the effect of a pod unit cannot be ignored in the analysis of propeller propeller interaction of a crp pod even in open water therefore the unsteady lateral hydrodynamic force exerted on the pod unit during impacting with vortices and the slipstream wake of propellers are discussed in the context of propeller propeller interaction 2 geometry of crp pod two sets of crp pods called crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 are considered these are designed for a bulk carrier of 38 000 dead weight tonnage dwt designed by the shanghai merchant ship design and research institute sdari fig 1 shows the geometries of the crp pods in practice the forward propeller is driven by a diesel machine like a conventional shaft propeller while the aft propeller is driven by an electric motor inside the pod unlike a conventional crp pod these adopt a novel configuration a rudder pod where the pod cannot be rotated around its vertical axis and ship steering is achieved by flapping the rudder fig 2 shows the maneuvering operation of the rudder pod a similar configuration was used in an eu project tripod sánchez caja et al 2013 quereda et al 2017 which adopted a large container vessel as the objective ship compared with the conventional azimuthing pod configuration a rudder pod has the advantage of a compact configuration and low manufacturing cost due to its mechanical simplicity this makes it suitable for a large carrier vessel or bulk carrier for which maneuvering performance is less demanding with respect to ferry it should be pointed out that the fixed and movable parts of the rudder are considered as a unit in both the model test and cfd computation since no maneuvering behavior is involved in this study the principle dimensions of the two crp pods are summarized in table 1 discrepancies between crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 are evident blades of the two propellers in crp pod 1 have larger diameters and smaller expanded area ratios compared to crp pod 2 in addition the aft propeller in crp pod 1 has fewer blades than crp pod 2 note that in both crp pods the forward and aft propellers have different blade numbers to avoid possible resonance it is known that power distribution between forward and aft propellers is one of the important design parameters for crp min et al 2009 and crp pod sasaki et al 2009 in contrast with crp the power ratio in a crp pod can be varied by changing the rotational speed ratio as the propellers have independent power supplies however in practical design the power distribution between propellers of a crp pod is mostly determined according to the specification of the electric motor of the pod unit though a balanced power ratio of 1 1 is better from the viewpoint of energy recovery in the present study the aft propeller in both crp pods is designed to absorb 30 of the total power the axial spacing distance between forward and aft propellers is 0 99 m in full scale for both crp pods much less than that in a conventional crp pod according to xiong et al 2016 the open water efficiency of a crp pod decreases with increasing axial spacing distance the rudder pod configuration allows the present crp pods to adopt relatively smaller axial spacing compared to an azimuthing pod unit where axial spacing should be large enough to ensure the pod unit rotates smoothly regarding energy recovery it should be better to reduce the axial spacing of propellers in a crp pod as much as possible however the interaction between propellers will become stronger as the axial spacing decreases therefore special attention should be paid to the propeller propeller interaction for a crp pod with a rudder pod as its axial spacing distance between propellers is small 3 computational details 3 1 numerical methods this study used a commercial cfd solver star ccm which has been commonly applied to flows related to marine propulsors such as open water bhattacharyya et al 2016 moran guerrero et al 2018 krasilnikov et al 2015 cavitation gaggero et al 2014 vaz et al 2015 usta and korkut 2018 hull propeller interaction krasilnikov 2013 ponkratov and zegos 2015 lee et al 2017 and vortex evolution asnaghi et al 2017 gong et al 2018 fluid flow is modeled in star ccm by a finite volume method fvm based on which the integral formulation of the governing equations is discretized to accurately capture the vortical structure in the wake of a crp pod a detached eddy simulation des method is adopted this hybrid modeling approach combines the features of rans in the near wall region and large eddy simulation les in other regions although des was initially implemented based on the one equation turbulent model the spalart allmaras model spalart and allmaras 1992 it can be combined with other turbulence models in this study a two equation turbulence model sst k ω menter 1994 is adopted a brief introduction of des follows for incompressible flows the momentum equations in the des model can be written in tensor form and cartesian coordinates as 1 t ρ v ˆ ρ v ˆ v ˆ p ˆ i t t t f b where ρ v ˆ p ˆ are the velocity density and pressure of fluid respectively i is the identity tensor t is the viscous stress tensor t t is the reynold stress tensor which is modeled by means of sst or les and f b is the body force the variables in eq 1 are functions of a time and length scale in the rans solution and are functions of the filter width or length scale in the les model the switch from rans to les is accomplished by a length scale l defined as 2 l m i n l k ω c d e s δ where l k ω is a rans length scale c d e s is a constant typically set to 0 65 for homogeneous turbulence and δ m a x δ x δ y δ z corresponds to the maximum cell size in three dimensions when the cell length c d e s δ is less than the rans length scale l k ω les is triggered and conversely rans is applied the boundary between les and rans depends greatly on the mesh density and geometry in the region of a rans model the reynolds stress tensor t t is a function of a time and length scale and is defined as 3 t t r a n s f δ v k ε while in an les region t t is described by a velocity defined by the filter width or length scale 4 t t l e s f δ v δ equations 3 and 4 can be rewritten in a combined equation 5 t t f δ δ l k t t r a n s where δ is the local measure of the grid size l k is the turbulent length scale and f δ is a damping function that depends on the des or its variants as original des suffers from grid induced separation a delayed detached eddy simulation ddes method was developed spalart et al 2006 however a numerical problem log layer mismatch llm is observed in the ddes result and is also seen in des simulation spalart et al 2006 this led to a new variant improved ddes iddes proposed by shur et al 2008 in this study the iddes formula is used to avoid possible numerical issues observed in des and ddes transition effects are taken into account by using a γ r e θ transition model which is available in star ccm the γ r e θ method is a correlation based transition model menter et al 2006 which has been proved to improve the prediction accuracy of open water efficiency as well as the streamline pattern on the blade surface bhattacharyya et al 2015 details about the γ r e θ model can be found in the user guide of star ccm cd adapco 2014 or the work of malan et al 2009 3 2 boundary condition and grid system the schematic of the computational domain is shown in fig 3 the inlet and outlet boundaries are located 3 df upstream and 12 d f downstream from the forward propeller where d f is the diameter of the forward propeller the top boundary is 0 5 m from the propeller shaft the bottom and side boundaries are 6 d f from the propeller shaft rotations of the two propellers in crp pod are handled by means of sliding grids hence two rotating subdomains are generated which enclose the forward and aft propellers the surfaces of the blade hub and rudder pod are set as no slip walls grids are generated based on the so called trimmed cell method available in star ccm fig 4 shows the cross section of the grid system different refinement levels are adopted around the two propellers and rudder pod to achieve a reasonable mesh arrangement the finest meshes are distributed around the leading and trailing edges of the blades fig 5 shows the detail of the refining zones for the leading edge two levels of refinements are set based on two spiral tubes with different diameters along the leading edge there are about 9 5 million cells in the computational domain of which 2 8 million and 2 2 million are generated for the subdomains of the forward and aft propellers respectively note that the grid numbers of crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 are close although their diameters and numbers of blade are not the same sixteen layers of prism mesh are distributed around the wall surface of the blades to better capture the boundary flow the thickness of first layer cells is restricted to satisfy the criterion of y 1 on the whole blade surface a second order convection scheme is used for the momentum equations and the pressure velocity coupling uses the simplec algorithm the transport equations of the sst k ω turbulence model and γ r e θ transition model are computed using a second order upwind scheme a second order implicit scheme is used for temporal discretization and five inner iterations per time step are used the time step size is δ t 400 n f n a 1 where n f and n a are the rotational speeds of the forward and aft propellers respectively according to the numerical test conducted by wang and xiong 2013 the sensitivity of thrust and torque on the time step size is lower for crp with different blade numbers compared with the same blade number which requires a smaller time step to capture the strong fluctuation of the hydrodynamic load on the blades as for the inflow turbulence quantities we use 1 and 200 for the turbulence intensity tu and turbulent viscosity ratio μ τ μ respectively μ τ μ is an indication of how strong the influence of the turbulent viscosity μ τ is compared with the laminar viscosity μ the adopted turbulent viscosity ratio is higher than the standard one μ τ μ 10 in order to prevent tu from decaying quickly fig 6 gives typically a distribution of tu on the horizontal plane at propeller center in the case of crp pod 1 at j 0 6 a moderate decay of tu is observed along the streamwise direction mainly due to the high viscosity ratio used an alternative method to counter the decay of tu is adding an additional source term into the transport equation of the turbulent kinetic energy which allows using a lower viscosity ratio it is not known how the two methods differ in affecting the transition simulation the source term method can be used combined with a high viscosity ratio baltazara et al 2018 shows a combination of a high viscosity ratio of 500 and the source term method gave a good agreement with painting test in terms of the streamlines on the blade surface nevertheless the global hydrodynamic forces of propeller are not as sensitive to the turbulence quantities of the inflow as the transition simulation the thrusts and torques are quite similar between tu 0 5 and 5 for advance ratio j 1 according to yao and zhang 2018 numerical test by baltazara et al 2018 shows that the thrust and torque have a sensitivity of less than 5 and 3 respectively when tu varies from 1 to 5 hence sensitivity study on the turbulence quantities is not carried out in this work since here we mainly focus on the propeller propeller interaction rather than the flow regime on the blade surface 4 validation and verification 4 1 comparison between model test and cfd simulation a model test was conducted at the depressurized towing tank of the maritime research institute netherlands marin to validate the cfd computation the tank is 240 m long by 18 m wide by 8 m deep the test setup is shown in fig 7 the scale ratios of the two crp pod models were 1 20 the two propellers in the crp pod were driven by their own electric motors the motor to drive the forward propeller was located upstream and fixed by a hull shaped gear housing and a v strut the motor for the aft propeller was placed inside the pod housing the thrust and torque of the two propellers were recorded separately the propellers were aluminum while the rudder pod was wood variation of the advance ratio was achieved by changing the speed of the towing carrier as the rotational speed of the forward propeller was kept constant at n f 15 revolutions per second rps the rotational speed of the aft propeller was determined according to the target revolution ratio listed in table 1 comparisons between numerical results and experimental data for the two sets of crp pods are shown in fig 8 where the thrust and torque are non dimensionalized based on their own diameter and rotational speed the advance ratio j thrust coefficient k t and torque coefficient k q are defined as follows j u 0 n f d f k t f t f ρ n f 2 d f 4 k q f q f ρ n f 2 d f 5 η f t f u 0 2 π n f q f 6 k t a t a ρ n a 2 d a 4 k q a q a ρ n a 2 d a 5 η a t a u 0 2 π n a q a where the subscripts f and a denote the forward and aft propellers respectively and u 0 is the speed of the towing carrier calculated according to predefined j and n f it should be pointed out that the experimental data in fig 8 has taken into account of the effect of the wake from the upstream gear housing and v strut by correcting j the design speed of the object ship was 14 0 kn the corresponding advance ratio at this operating condition is about j 0 65 for crp pod 1 and about j 0 55 for crp pod 2 hence five advance ratios are considered in cfd computation that is j 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 7 with the aim to cover the normal operating condition and the possible off design condition of a low advance ratio when a ship sails in a heavy sea corresponding reynolds numbers on propellers and rudder are summarized in table 2 where reynolds number for propeller is defined as 7 r e c 0 7 r u 0 2 0 7 π n d 2 ν where c 0 7 r is the propeller blade chord length at 0 7 of the propeller radius r n is the propeller rotational speed ν is the kinematic viscosity of water reynolds number for rudder is defined as 8 r e r u d d e r u 0 l r u d d e r ν where l r u d d e r is the length of rudder at propeller axis l r u d d e r 0 2375 m in model scale as seen in table 2 reynolds numbers are larger in crp pod 1 than in crp pod 2 since crp pod 1 uses larger propeller compared with crp pod 2 note that the practical reynolds numbers of the aft propeller and rudder are expected to be larger than the nominal ones since their inflows are accelerated by the upstream propeller it can be seen from fig 8 that the open water characteristics obtained by cfd simulation are well consistent with experimental data for the forward propeller discrepancies on thrust and torque coefficients between cfd and experiment are below 3 5 for both crp pods showing satisfactory agreement however cfd underestimates the thrust and torque of the aft propeller at a high advance ratio with a maximum discrepancy of approximately 5 6 this may be because the inflow of the aft propeller is complicated by the wake of the forward propeller thus it is difficult to evaluate it accurately in both the axial and tangential directions nevertheless the efficiencies of the forward and aft propellers are well predicted over the whole range of advance ratios with a maximum discrepancy below 3 0 compared to experimental data a typical residual convergence pattern is plotted in fig 9 where four representative variables turbulence kinematic energy k turbulence dissipation rate ω intermittency γ and r e θ t are shown in successive twenty time steps it is seen that these residuals are stable though they fluctuate with large amplitudes due to the unsteady computation for transition model implementation the intermittency γ is usually difficult to converge to a low level here the intermittency γ has the maximum residual with the order of 10 1 the residual of r e θ t fluctuates from order of 10 3 to order of 10 5 showing the maximum amplitude a description of transition phenomena on the blades is shown in fig 10 based on the instantaneous fields of the intermittency and turbulent viscosity ratio for crp pod 1 at j 0 6 at a cylinder section of 0 7 propeller diameter theoretically the γ and μ τ μ are lower in laminar flow than in turbulent flow it is clear in fig 10 that the transition location is close to the trailing edges for both forward and aft propellers the difference between the two propellers is observed on the pressure side near the trailing edges the pressure side is wholly dominated by laminar flow for the forward propeller while covered by turbulent flow near the trailing edge of the aft propeller note that for such unsteady flow the flow regime on the blades of the two propellers change with the phase angles therefore it is quite challenging to analyze the flow regime on the blade surfaces for a crp pod or crp to our best knowledge there is no public literature on this by now fig 11 illustrates the power ratio of forward to aft propellers in cfd simulation as a function of the advance ratio which is also compared with the model test results the agreement between cfd and the experiment is good it is seen that the power ratio is not fixed with the change of the advance ratio for both crp pods implying that the rotational speed ratio of forward to aft propellers should be adjusted according to the ship speed to keep the power distribution fixed an experiment conducted by chang and go 2011 showed that the relationship between the power ratio and advance ratio is nearly linear however for the considered two crp pods the linearity is not as noticeable as they observed and the slope of the power ratio curve is dependent on the propeller geometry 4 2 grid sensitivity analysis grid sensitivity analysis typically requires at least three grid systems with a refinement ratio of 2 this will cause the total grid number increase with a ratio of 2 2 for three dimensional problems however it is impractical for this study to adopt three refinement levels since coarsening the mesh would lead to 3 35 million cells which is insufficient to resolve flow features while refining the mesh twice would generate 76 million cells which requires too much computation following dubbioso et al 2013 muscari et al 2013 and gong et al 2018 the two grid assessment procedure proposed by roache 1997 is adopted here where the error of the fine grid is estimated as 9 e f 2 f 1 1 r p where f 1 and f 2 are the fine and medium grid solutions respectively r is the mesh refinement ratio and p is the formal order of accuracy of the algorithm we use p 2 the uncertainty is calculated as 10 u n f s e where f s is the safety factor whose value depends on the number of meshes used in sensitivity analysis f s is typically 1 25 when three or more meshes are used while a conservative value of 3 is used when only two meshes are involved according to roache 1997 it should be pointed out that u n in eq 10 is not the error estimator of numerical simulation but the rough error band in a statistical sense to perform the two grid assessment a refined mesh is generated with a refinement ratio of approximately r 2 the total number of cells is 24 2 million among which 7 0 million and 5 7 million are for the forward and aft subdomains respectively for the fine mesh the time step is adjusted to keep the same courant friedrichs lewy cfl number as for the medium mesh tables 3 and 4 summarize the results of grid sensitivity tests for crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 respectively two advance ratios j 0 4 and 0 6 are considered the discrepancies on the thrust and torque between the fine and medium mesh are less than 1 5 therefore the medium mesh is adopted in the following analysis to reduce the computational cost note that this study uses trimmed cells in both the rotating subdomains and the static domain another commonly used mesh strategy is to generate a polyhedral mesh in the subdomain instead of a trimmed mesh the combination of polyhedral and trimmed meshes may lead to different grid sensitivity behavior this is outside the scope of the present work 5 results and discussion 5 1 interaction of thrust and torque between forward and aft propellers to analyze the mutual interaction between forward and aft propellers propeller alone conditions that is forward propeller alone and aft propeller alone are simulated fig 12 shows the configuration of propeller alone conditions note that the rudder pod remains in the case of forward propeller alone in order to take into account the vortex rudder interaction in fact the rudder pod has a little effect on the thrust and torque of the forward propeller but it is significant for the evolution of the vortical structure in the wake the computational setup in the propeller alone condition such as mesh density dimensions of the computational domain and rotating subdomain towing carriage speed and rotational speed of propellers is consistent with that in the crp pod configuration except for the total grid number which is reduced because fewer propellers are computed comparisons of open water characteristics between crp pod and propeller alone configurations are shown in fig 13 for both crp pods the changes in thrust and torque confirm that the forward propeller has a larger effect on the aft propeller than vice versa independent of propeller geometry the discrepancies of k t and k q between the crp pod and propeller alone configurations are not noticeable for the forward propeller but are remarkable for the aft propeller the presence of the aft propeller causes a slight decrease in the thrust of the forward propeller mainly due to its suction effect on the inflow of the forward propeller however the thrust and torque of the aft propeller are remarkably reduced by the forward propeller especially at low advance ratios this is mainly because the forward propeller greatly accelerates the inflow of the aft propeller 5 2 interaction of vortex and velocity between forward and aft propellers to visualize vortices in the wake of crp pod the q criterion proposed by jeong and hussain 1995 is used q is the second invariant of the rate of strain tensor commonly used to identify the vortex and defined as 11 q 1 2 u x 2 v y 2 w z 2 u y v x u z w x v z w y figs 14 and 15 visualize the instantaneous vortical structure by iso surfaces of q at the advance ratios j 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 for crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 respectively for visual clarity the q values of iso surfaces are adjusted according to the advance ratio specifically q is set to 10 000 5 000 and 3000 for j 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 respectively the iso surfaces of q are colored according to the non dimensional axial velocity phase angles for the forward and aft propellers follow each rotational direction as illustrated in fig 16 typically the vortical structure in the wake of a rotating propeller consists of the tip vortex blade trailing edge vortex sheet and hub vortex for the crp pod configuration however the hub vortex is weak due to the interference of the pod which plays a role as a rudder bulb while the tip vortex and blade trailing edge vortex are clearly observed in figs 14 and 15 for crp pod 1 it is seen that the tip vortices shed by the forward and aft propellers collide as the blade tips of the aft propeller are close to the boundary of the contracted slipstream tube of the forward propeller this causes the trajectories of tip vortices shed by the two propellers to deform remarkably such that they roll up around each other which immediately triggers the instability of the tip vortex structure and leads to the breakdown of tip vortices see fig 14 a1 b1 such unstable behavior of the tip vortex is more evident at a low advance ratio since a higher loading condition leads to a stronger slipstream contraction thus a larger overlapping region between slipstreams of the forward and aft propellers in contrast in propeller alone configurations of crp pod 1 the tip vortex has a stable coherent helical structure until it impacts the rudder after it is split by the rudder the two parts of the tip vortex maintain a regular helical trajectory without breakdown behavior in the near wake in this regard the interaction of the tip vortex between the forward and aft propellers in crp pod 1 is strong as for crp pod 2 the tip vortex has a stable coherent structure in the near wake even in the crp pod configuration the tip vortex interaction between forward and aft propellers is not as strong as in crp pod 1 mainly because the diameter of the aft propeller in crp pod 2 is so small that the tip vortices shed by the forward and aft propellers cannot collide nevertheless the propeller propeller interaction in crp pod 2 has an evident effect on the tip vortex strength we can see that with respect to the propeller alone condition the survival distance of tip vortices is remarkably reduced for the aft propeller and slightly reduced for the forward propeller this is consistent with the observation on the change of propeller loading in section 5 1 considering the correlation between the propeller loading and vortex strength the difference in tip vortex structures between crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 suggests that the tip vortex interaction between the forward and aft propellers is significantly dependent on propeller geometry other interesting phenomena related to the evolution of the tip vortices observed in figs 14 and 15 are the vortex rudder interaction and vortex pairing as colliding with the leading edges of the rudder the tip vortex remarkably deforms and wraps around the rudder since its downstream movement is delayed by the boundary layer of the rudder see fig 17 for a closer view consequently the tip vortices are split by the rudder into two linking branches with opposite spanwise displacements on the rudder surface for the forward propeller the spanwise displacement is upward at the port side and downward at the starboard side see fig 18 this reverses for the aft propeller due to its counter rotation the displacement behavior of tip vortices eventually results in a spanwise misalignment in the vicinity of the trailing edge of the rudder especially at the propeller alone condition with a heavy loading vortex pairing is the combination of two neighboring tip vortices into a stronger vortex first reported by felli et al 2011 in this study the vortex pairing phenomena are observed in crp pod 1 fig 14 a2 and crp pod 2 fig 15 a1 a3 in fact it is more likely to occur under a heavy loading condition where tip vortices are strong and the spiral to spiral distance between neighboring tip vortices is small to further analyze the vortex dynamics the instantaneous axial vorticity distribution on the horizontal plane on the propeller axis is shown in figs 19 and 20 where the axial vorticities generated by the forward and aft propellers are of opposite sign the dashed lines in figs 19 and 20 denote the radial position equal to the diameter of the propellers again the tip vortex instability caused by the interaction between propellers is clearly observed in the case of the crp pod configuration in fig 19 where the tip vortices shed by forward and aft propellers are mixed in the vicinity of the slipstream boundary showing a disordered distribution of the vortex core in contrast with crp pod 1 the tip vortex cores of the forward propeller in crp pod 2 are slightly affected by the aft propeller in terms of trajectory and strength whereas the strength of tip vortices shed by the aft propeller in crp pod 2 is noticeably weakened by the forward propeller especially at a low advance ratio this is consistent with the above observation on the surviving distance of q iso surfaces in crp pod 2 the vortex sheet shed by the blade s trailing edge is also observed in figs 19 and 20 it becomes weak as it evolves downstream due to viscous dissipation independent of the propeller geometry and loading condition the sign of a trailing edge vortex in propeller alone configurations shows regular intervals related to propeller rotation in the near wake however instability occurs downstream of the rudder s trailing edge at low advance ratios like the tip vortex the occurrence of instability of the trailing edge vortex sheet shows clear dependence on the propeller geometry and loading condition in fact the underlying mechanism causing propeller wake instability is quite complicated even for a conventional propeller in open water conditions without rudder interference felli et al 2011 attributed this to mutual inductance between adjacent tip vortices however kumar and mahesh 2017 pointed out that it depends on the propeller geometry as the interaction between the blade wake and adjacent tip vortices becomes the dominant reason for a propeller with strong trailing edge vortices in the crp pod configuration the presence of a rudder pod may trigger instability to occur earlier than in the case of a single screw in open water this requires more specific investigation which is not included in this paper it is also seen in figs 19 and 20 that the trailing edge vortex is not regular due to the mixing behavior of the trailing edge vortices shed by the forward and aft propellers nevertheless the trailing edge vortex shed by the forward propeller seems to be dominated mainly because more power is absorbed by the forward propeller figs 21 and 22 show the instantaneous non dimensional axial velocity fields at different advance ratios for crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 respectively it is confirmed for both crp pods that the aft propeller can further accelerate the axial velocity leading to a rapid contraction of the slipstream in the very near wake the slipstream boundary in the crp pod configuration of fig 21 noticeably fluctuates in the radial direction at low advance ratios this is consistent with the instability phenomenon observed in the tip vortex compared with crp pod 1 the region of higher axial velocity accelerated by the aft propeller is much narrower in crp pod 2 due to its reduced aft propeller diameter it is also seen in figs 21 and 22 that the velocity inside the slipstream tube of the forward propeller is much larger than the velocity far upstream implying that the aft propeller operates in a higher advance ratio than the nominal one for simplicity the deviation between the practical advance ratio and the nominal one is denoted as δj to analyze δj quantitatively a thrust identity criterion is used where the thrust coefficient k t in the crp pod configuration is used to determine the j value at the aft propeller alone condition see fig 23 for the schematic of δj estimation table 5 summarizes the computed δj of the two crp pods at various advance ratios it should be pointed out that the value of δj at j 0 7 is obtained by extrapolating the k t curve of the aft propeller alone case since the practical advance ratio is larger than the maximum j considered to reveal the mechanism of δj an analysis is performed based on momentum theory where the propeller is simplified to an actuator disk producing thrust by simply accelerating flow in the axial direction without rotation the axial flow in the far downstream in momentum theory can be described as a function of a thrust loading coefficient as follows 12 u f u 0 1 c t where u f is the velocity in the far downstream u 0 is the velocity of inflow and c t is the thrust loading coefficient therefore the velocity acceleration u a can be determined by u a u f u 0 u 0 1 c t 1 the relation between δj and u a can be described as 13 δ j u a n d table 5 compares δj and u a between cfd and momentum theory similar tendencies are seen for the two methods where δj decays as j increases however the value of δj obtained by momentum theory is much larger than that of cfd with respect to u a the cfd results are smaller than those of momentum theory interestingly momentum theory is consistent with cfd of the forward propeller alone cases in figs 21 and 22 in terms of the u a value this suggests that it is not sufficient to estimate δj based only on u a because the rotational flow in the wake of the forward propeller also plays an important role in the shift in the j value the rotational flow generated by the forward propeller can increase the load of the aft propeller due to its converse tangential direction with respect to the aft propeller rotation the deviation in the δj value between cfd and momentum theory is mainly due to the lack of rotational flow in the momentum theory therefore the design of the aft propeller must take into account the forward propeller wake in both the axial and tangential directions figs 24 and 25 show the tangential velocity field on the transverse plane at the rudder axis 0 16 m downstream of the aft propeller for the two crp pods it is clear that the tangential velocity in the crp pod configuration is considerably weaker than in propeller alone configurations independent of propeller geometry and loading condition this can explain the energy saving mechanism of crp pod i e that the aft propeller plays the role of recovering the rotational energy induced by the forward propeller although the results in figs 24 and 25 are not time averaged as expected the reduction of rotational flow in crp pod 2 concentrates in a smaller region related to the diameter of the aft propeller compared with crp pod 1 this implies that the rotational energy outside the aft propeller slipstream cannot be recovered in crp pod 2 therefore the optimal diameter of the aft propeller should be as close as possible to the diameter of the contracted slipstream of the forward propeller from the viewpoint of energy recovery 5 3 interaction of lateral hydrodynamic force on rudder pod between forward and aft propellers in this section the lateral hydrodynamic force on the rudder pod is analyzed in the context of propeller propeller interaction of the crp pod we know felli and falchi 2011 that the rotating flow of the propeller slipstream generates opposing lateral loads on the upper and lower parts of the rudder with respect to the shaft center which cancel each other for a horn type rudder the total lateral load is nonzero due to the asymmetrical profile additionally as it operates in the unsteady wake of the propeller the rudder is subject to the periodic impact of propeller vortices this causes the lateral load exerting on the rudder to periodically fluctuate which is related to structural vibration and noise emission and affects the course keeping of the ship fig 26 shows the time histories of the lateral force on the rudder pod in five revolutions of the forward propeller at advance ratios of j 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 in which the propeller alone configuration is compared with the crp pod configuration note that the data of fig 26 are recorded after the simulation has converged it is seen that the forward and aft propellers yield opposing lateral forces on the rudder pod due to their contra rotating behaviors the total lateral force of the crp pod is the result of the two opposite components generated by the forward and aft propellers thus it fluctuates between portside and starboard especially at low advance ratios the averages of lateral forces are summarized in table 6 which shows that the lateral force is remarkably reduced in the crp pod configuration over all the considered advance ratios for both crp pods it should be pointed out that the lateral force in the single screw scenario is supposed to be larger than in the present propeller alone condition since in that case the single propeller will absorb all the power it is also clear from fig 26 that the amplitude and frequency of the lateral force fluctuation are dependent on the propeller geometry compared to crp pod 2 the lateral force in the crp pod and aft propeller alone configurations of crp pod 1 fluctuates with a lower frequency and larger amplitude mainly because crp pod 1 has fewer blades on the aft propeller note that the frequency of lateral force fluctuation is approximately the blade frequency which is much higher than the propeller shaft frequency theoretically the fluctuation amplitude of the lateral force should decrease as the number of blades increases this was confirmed by mascio et al 2015 in their numerical analysis of propeller rudder interaction where the spanwise lateral forces on the rudder were compared between one and four blade propellers it should be pointed out that validation is not carried out on the hydrodynamic load of the rudder pod due to the lack of available experimental data nevertheless the trends of the lateral force shown in fig 26 should be qualitatively reliable considering the satisfactory agreement of the propeller force between cfd and model test in the following a further analysis is carried out on the flow details around the rudder pod to reveal the correlation between the unsteadiness of the lateral force of the rudder pod and the vortex evolution instantaneous vortical structures at four typical phase angles marked in fig 26 are represented in fig 27 note that parts of the starboard iso surface of q are not visualized for the sake of clarity it is seen that in phase a the tip vortex shed by the forward propeller is impacting the leading edge of the rudder while phase b corresponds to the onset of the collision between the tip vortex shed by the aft propeller and the leading edge of the rudder a similar phenomenon can be seen in phases c and d to describe the distribution of hydrodynamic load on the rudder surface the skin friction coefficient c f and pressure coefficient c p are defined as 14 c f τ w 1 2 ρ u 0 2 c p p p 0 1 2 ρ u 0 2 where τ w is the local wall shear stress defined as τ w t s s t is the stress tensor and s is the area vector p 0 is the static pressure far upstream figs 28 and 29 show the contours of the skin friction and pressure coefficients on the rudder surface for crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 respectively higher skin friction is clearly observed on the rudder surface inside the propeller slipstream in contrast to the skin friction coefficient the pressure distribution is smooth at the boundary of propeller slipstream higher pressure is observed near the leading edge of the rudder it is caused by the collision of the propeller slipstream and rudder to show the flow regime near the rudder fig 30 gives an instantaneous distribution of the turbulent viscosity ratio at two horizontal plans which are at 0 6 d f with respect to the propeller center the turbulent viscosity ratio is expected to be low in the laminar flow or viscous sub layer and high in the turbulent flow it can be seen that the rudder is covered by turbulent flow from its maximum thickness to trailing edge 6 conclusions in this study the interaction between the forward and aft propellers of crp pod in open water was numerically investigated the analysis was focused on global quantities including the thrust and torque of each propeller and flow details such as structures of the vortex and velocity in the wake and lateral hydrodynamic force on the rudder pod an unsteady sst k ω based iddes model was used the flow transition effect was taken into account by means of the γ r e θ transition model two sets of crp pods with different propeller geometries designed for a 38000 dwt bulk carrier were considered a model test was carried out to validate the cfd computation satisfactory agreement was obtained on the open water characteristic between the experiment and cfd simulations were also carried out for the configurations of forward propeller alone and aft propeller alone in order to analyze their mutual interaction the following are observed i thrust and torque the forward propeller was slightly affected by the aft propeller while the thrust and torque of the aft propeller were remarkably reduced by the forward propeller especially at a low advance ratio this was independent of propeller geometry additionally it was confirmed that the power ratio between the forward and aft propellers varies with the advance ratio ii structures of vortex and velocity the vortical structure is strongly dependent on the propeller geometry in the case of crp pod 1 with aft propeller diameter close to the diameter of the contracted slipstream of the forward propeller the contra rotating tip vortices shed by the forward and aft propellers rolled up around each other triggering the instability of the vortical structure and causing it to break down in the near wake using a diameter reduced aft propeller crp pod 2 had stable tip vortices with a regular helical structure the velocity field inside the slipstream tube suggested that the aft propeller plays the role of further accelerating axial flow while weakening the rotational flow generated by the forward propeller independent of the propeller geometry and loading condition this explains the energy recovery mechanism of crp pod iii lateral hydrodynamic force on the rudder pod the forward and aft propellers yielded opposing time averaged lateral force on the rudder pod which were remarkably decreased in the crp pod configuration due to the propeller propeller interaction independent of the propeller geometry and loading condition moreover the fluctuation of lateral force on the rudder pod in crp pod 1 had larger amplitude and lower frequency compared to crp pod 2 mainly because the aft propeller of crp pod 1 had fewer blades showing strong dependence on propeller geometry acknowledgements the work presented here is financially supported by the research project high technology ship

22716,this paper presents a numerical study on the interaction between the forward and aft propellers of hybrid crp pod propulsion systems crp pod in open water with a focus on both global quantities that is thrust and torque and flow details such as vortical structure slipstream evolution and lateral load on the pod unit improved delayed detached eddy simulation iddes method is adopted and combined with the γ r e θ transition model the open water characteristics of crp pod obtained by cfd are in satisfactory agreement with model test data two sets of crp pods with different propeller geometries are considered it is found independently of propeller geometry that i in terms of thrust and torque the forward propeller is slightly affected by the aft propeller while it has a large effect on the aft propeller ii the wake of the forward propeller is accelerated in the axial direction and weakened in the tangential direction by the aft propeller and iii the time averaged lateral force on the pod unit is reduced remarkably by the propeller propeller interaction however the vortex interaction between the forward and aft propellers depends significantly on the propeller geometry in the case when the tip vortices shed by the forward and aft propellers can directly collide with each other the vortical structure in the wake becomes unstable and rapidly breaks down keywords hybrid crp pod propulsion system crp pod interaction between forward and aft propellers improved delayed detached eddy simulation iddes vortical structure energy saving device esd 1 introduction a hybrid crp pod propulsion system crp pod consists of a forward conventional shaft propeller and an aft podded propulsor the two propellers are driven by independent power supplies and are contra rotating thus rotational energy generated by the forward propeller can be partially recovered by the aft propeller in this regard crp pod is considered an active energy saving device esd compared with a single screw a higher propulsive efficiency can be obtained by a crp pod by reducing the diameter and rotational speed of each propeller as the total thrust is distributed between propellers kim et al 2002 conducted a comparative investigation on a single screw twin screws and crp pod for an ultra large container ship their results show that the crp pod is the most efficient with about 9 and 5 power saving compared with the twin screw and single screw respectively ueda et al 2004 reported the first application of crp pod in a fast ferry which showed an energy saving of more than 13 compared with a conventional twin shaft system crp pod also has other benefits such as low level noise a flexible general arrangement and good redundancy it is for these reasons that crp pod has been an attractive technology in marine propulsion in recent years however it is a challenge to design a crp pod with good hydrodynamic performance and feasibility for a given ship many design parameters must be considered including the diameter and rotational speed of each propeller power distribution and axial distance between propellers the correlation between these design parameters and hydrodynamic performance is not completely known due to the complicated interaction between forward and aft propellers therefore analysis of this interaction is important for predicting and optimizing the hydrodynamic performance of a crp pod system there has been some research work on this topic a model test conducted by go et al 2005 showed that the thrust and torque of the forward propeller are not fixed when the rotational speed of the aft propeller changes due to their interaction and there is a unique value of the rotational speed ratio corresponding to a predetermined power ratio between the forward and aft propellers chang and go 2011 confirmed the unique relationship between revolution and the power ratio and an experiment showed that this relationship changes linearly with the ship s speed their results also revealed that the forward propeller has a larger effect on the aft propeller than vice versa xiong et al 2016 analyzed the effect of axial distance between propellers on the open water performance of each propeller based on cfd simulation and model tests and concluded that axial distance has little effect on the forward propeller but a large effect on the aft propeller this was numerically confirmed by he and wan 2017 based on cfd wang et al 2016 numerically studied the scale effect of crp pod in open water condition it was found that the thrust and torque of propellers are independent of the reynolds number but depend linearly on the rotational speed ratio however most literature on crp pod has focused on global quantities that is the thrust and torque of each propeller little work has been devoted to the analysis of flow details such as evolution of the vortex and velocity in the wake which are important not only for analyzing the propulsive efficiency noise emission and structural vibration of crp pod but also for revealing the flow mechanism of the interaction between the forward and aft propellers this work aims to carry out numerical investigation on the propeller propeller interaction of crp pod in open water condition with a focus on not only global quantities but also on flow details such as the vortical structure and velocity in the slipstream to this end an unsteady sst k ω based detached eddy simulation des method is adopted combined with a sliding mesh to handle the propeller rotation a correlation based γ r e θ transition method is used to take into account the effect of turbulence transition model tests in open water are carried out to provide validation data for cfd two sets of crp pods designed for the same ship but with different blade geometries are considered in contrast with contra rotating propellers crp the effect of a pod unit cannot be ignored in the analysis of propeller propeller interaction of a crp pod even in open water therefore the unsteady lateral hydrodynamic force exerted on the pod unit during impacting with vortices and the slipstream wake of propellers are discussed in the context of propeller propeller interaction 2 geometry of crp pod two sets of crp pods called crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 are considered these are designed for a bulk carrier of 38 000 dead weight tonnage dwt designed by the shanghai merchant ship design and research institute sdari fig 1 shows the geometries of the crp pods in practice the forward propeller is driven by a diesel machine like a conventional shaft propeller while the aft propeller is driven by an electric motor inside the pod unlike a conventional crp pod these adopt a novel configuration a rudder pod where the pod cannot be rotated around its vertical axis and ship steering is achieved by flapping the rudder fig 2 shows the maneuvering operation of the rudder pod a similar configuration was used in an eu project tripod sánchez caja et al 2013 quereda et al 2017 which adopted a large container vessel as the objective ship compared with the conventional azimuthing pod configuration a rudder pod has the advantage of a compact configuration and low manufacturing cost due to its mechanical simplicity this makes it suitable for a large carrier vessel or bulk carrier for which maneuvering performance is less demanding with respect to ferry it should be pointed out that the fixed and movable parts of the rudder are considered as a unit in both the model test and cfd computation since no maneuvering behavior is involved in this study the principle dimensions of the two crp pods are summarized in table 1 discrepancies between crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 are evident blades of the two propellers in crp pod 1 have larger diameters and smaller expanded area ratios compared to crp pod 2 in addition the aft propeller in crp pod 1 has fewer blades than crp pod 2 note that in both crp pods the forward and aft propellers have different blade numbers to avoid possible resonance it is known that power distribution between forward and aft propellers is one of the important design parameters for crp min et al 2009 and crp pod sasaki et al 2009 in contrast with crp the power ratio in a crp pod can be varied by changing the rotational speed ratio as the propellers have independent power supplies however in practical design the power distribution between propellers of a crp pod is mostly determined according to the specification of the electric motor of the pod unit though a balanced power ratio of 1 1 is better from the viewpoint of energy recovery in the present study the aft propeller in both crp pods is designed to absorb 30 of the total power the axial spacing distance between forward and aft propellers is 0 99 m in full scale for both crp pods much less than that in a conventional crp pod according to xiong et al 2016 the open water efficiency of a crp pod decreases with increasing axial spacing distance the rudder pod configuration allows the present crp pods to adopt relatively smaller axial spacing compared to an azimuthing pod unit where axial spacing should be large enough to ensure the pod unit rotates smoothly regarding energy recovery it should be better to reduce the axial spacing of propellers in a crp pod as much as possible however the interaction between propellers will become stronger as the axial spacing decreases therefore special attention should be paid to the propeller propeller interaction for a crp pod with a rudder pod as its axial spacing distance between propellers is small 3 computational details 3 1 numerical methods this study used a commercial cfd solver star ccm which has been commonly applied to flows related to marine propulsors such as open water bhattacharyya et al 2016 moran guerrero et al 2018 krasilnikov et al 2015 cavitation gaggero et al 2014 vaz et al 2015 usta and korkut 2018 hull propeller interaction krasilnikov 2013 ponkratov and zegos 2015 lee et al 2017 and vortex evolution asnaghi et al 2017 gong et al 2018 fluid flow is modeled in star ccm by a finite volume method fvm based on which the integral formulation of the governing equations is discretized to accurately capture the vortical structure in the wake of a crp pod a detached eddy simulation des method is adopted this hybrid modeling approach combines the features of rans in the near wall region and large eddy simulation les in other regions although des was initially implemented based on the one equation turbulent model the spalart allmaras model spalart and allmaras 1992 it can be combined with other turbulence models in this study a two equation turbulence model sst k ω menter 1994 is adopted a brief introduction of des follows for incompressible flows the momentum equations in the des model can be written in tensor form and cartesian coordinates as 1 t ρ v ˆ ρ v ˆ v ˆ p ˆ i t t t f b where ρ v ˆ p ˆ are the velocity density and pressure of fluid respectively i is the identity tensor t is the viscous stress tensor t t is the reynold stress tensor which is modeled by means of sst or les and f b is the body force the variables in eq 1 are functions of a time and length scale in the rans solution and are functions of the filter width or length scale in the les model the switch from rans to les is accomplished by a length scale l defined as 2 l m i n l k ω c d e s δ where l k ω is a rans length scale c d e s is a constant typically set to 0 65 for homogeneous turbulence and δ m a x δ x δ y δ z corresponds to the maximum cell size in three dimensions when the cell length c d e s δ is less than the rans length scale l k ω les is triggered and conversely rans is applied the boundary between les and rans depends greatly on the mesh density and geometry in the region of a rans model the reynolds stress tensor t t is a function of a time and length scale and is defined as 3 t t r a n s f δ v k ε while in an les region t t is described by a velocity defined by the filter width or length scale 4 t t l e s f δ v δ equations 3 and 4 can be rewritten in a combined equation 5 t t f δ δ l k t t r a n s where δ is the local measure of the grid size l k is the turbulent length scale and f δ is a damping function that depends on the des or its variants as original des suffers from grid induced separation a delayed detached eddy simulation ddes method was developed spalart et al 2006 however a numerical problem log layer mismatch llm is observed in the ddes result and is also seen in des simulation spalart et al 2006 this led to a new variant improved ddes iddes proposed by shur et al 2008 in this study the iddes formula is used to avoid possible numerical issues observed in des and ddes transition effects are taken into account by using a γ r e θ transition model which is available in star ccm the γ r e θ method is a correlation based transition model menter et al 2006 which has been proved to improve the prediction accuracy of open water efficiency as well as the streamline pattern on the blade surface bhattacharyya et al 2015 details about the γ r e θ model can be found in the user guide of star ccm cd adapco 2014 or the work of malan et al 2009 3 2 boundary condition and grid system the schematic of the computational domain is shown in fig 3 the inlet and outlet boundaries are located 3 df upstream and 12 d f downstream from the forward propeller where d f is the diameter of the forward propeller the top boundary is 0 5 m from the propeller shaft the bottom and side boundaries are 6 d f from the propeller shaft rotations of the two propellers in crp pod are handled by means of sliding grids hence two rotating subdomains are generated which enclose the forward and aft propellers the surfaces of the blade hub and rudder pod are set as no slip walls grids are generated based on the so called trimmed cell method available in star ccm fig 4 shows the cross section of the grid system different refinement levels are adopted around the two propellers and rudder pod to achieve a reasonable mesh arrangement the finest meshes are distributed around the leading and trailing edges of the blades fig 5 shows the detail of the refining zones for the leading edge two levels of refinements are set based on two spiral tubes with different diameters along the leading edge there are about 9 5 million cells in the computational domain of which 2 8 million and 2 2 million are generated for the subdomains of the forward and aft propellers respectively note that the grid numbers of crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 are close although their diameters and numbers of blade are not the same sixteen layers of prism mesh are distributed around the wall surface of the blades to better capture the boundary flow the thickness of first layer cells is restricted to satisfy the criterion of y 1 on the whole blade surface a second order convection scheme is used for the momentum equations and the pressure velocity coupling uses the simplec algorithm the transport equations of the sst k ω turbulence model and γ r e θ transition model are computed using a second order upwind scheme a second order implicit scheme is used for temporal discretization and five inner iterations per time step are used the time step size is δ t 400 n f n a 1 where n f and n a are the rotational speeds of the forward and aft propellers respectively according to the numerical test conducted by wang and xiong 2013 the sensitivity of thrust and torque on the time step size is lower for crp with different blade numbers compared with the same blade number which requires a smaller time step to capture the strong fluctuation of the hydrodynamic load on the blades as for the inflow turbulence quantities we use 1 and 200 for the turbulence intensity tu and turbulent viscosity ratio μ τ μ respectively μ τ μ is an indication of how strong the influence of the turbulent viscosity μ τ is compared with the laminar viscosity μ the adopted turbulent viscosity ratio is higher than the standard one μ τ μ 10 in order to prevent tu from decaying quickly fig 6 gives typically a distribution of tu on the horizontal plane at propeller center in the case of crp pod 1 at j 0 6 a moderate decay of tu is observed along the streamwise direction mainly due to the high viscosity ratio used an alternative method to counter the decay of tu is adding an additional source term into the transport equation of the turbulent kinetic energy which allows using a lower viscosity ratio it is not known how the two methods differ in affecting the transition simulation the source term method can be used combined with a high viscosity ratio baltazara et al 2018 shows a combination of a high viscosity ratio of 500 and the source term method gave a good agreement with painting test in terms of the streamlines on the blade surface nevertheless the global hydrodynamic forces of propeller are not as sensitive to the turbulence quantities of the inflow as the transition simulation the thrusts and torques are quite similar between tu 0 5 and 5 for advance ratio j 1 according to yao and zhang 2018 numerical test by baltazara et al 2018 shows that the thrust and torque have a sensitivity of less than 5 and 3 respectively when tu varies from 1 to 5 hence sensitivity study on the turbulence quantities is not carried out in this work since here we mainly focus on the propeller propeller interaction rather than the flow regime on the blade surface 4 validation and verification 4 1 comparison between model test and cfd simulation a model test was conducted at the depressurized towing tank of the maritime research institute netherlands marin to validate the cfd computation the tank is 240 m long by 18 m wide by 8 m deep the test setup is shown in fig 7 the scale ratios of the two crp pod models were 1 20 the two propellers in the crp pod were driven by their own electric motors the motor to drive the forward propeller was located upstream and fixed by a hull shaped gear housing and a v strut the motor for the aft propeller was placed inside the pod housing the thrust and torque of the two propellers were recorded separately the propellers were aluminum while the rudder pod was wood variation of the advance ratio was achieved by changing the speed of the towing carrier as the rotational speed of the forward propeller was kept constant at n f 15 revolutions per second rps the rotational speed of the aft propeller was determined according to the target revolution ratio listed in table 1 comparisons between numerical results and experimental data for the two sets of crp pods are shown in fig 8 where the thrust and torque are non dimensionalized based on their own diameter and rotational speed the advance ratio j thrust coefficient k t and torque coefficient k q are defined as follows j u 0 n f d f k t f t f ρ n f 2 d f 4 k q f q f ρ n f 2 d f 5 η f t f u 0 2 π n f q f 6 k t a t a ρ n a 2 d a 4 k q a q a ρ n a 2 d a 5 η a t a u 0 2 π n a q a where the subscripts f and a denote the forward and aft propellers respectively and u 0 is the speed of the towing carrier calculated according to predefined j and n f it should be pointed out that the experimental data in fig 8 has taken into account of the effect of the wake from the upstream gear housing and v strut by correcting j the design speed of the object ship was 14 0 kn the corresponding advance ratio at this operating condition is about j 0 65 for crp pod 1 and about j 0 55 for crp pod 2 hence five advance ratios are considered in cfd computation that is j 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 7 with the aim to cover the normal operating condition and the possible off design condition of a low advance ratio when a ship sails in a heavy sea corresponding reynolds numbers on propellers and rudder are summarized in table 2 where reynolds number for propeller is defined as 7 r e c 0 7 r u 0 2 0 7 π n d 2 ν where c 0 7 r is the propeller blade chord length at 0 7 of the propeller radius r n is the propeller rotational speed ν is the kinematic viscosity of water reynolds number for rudder is defined as 8 r e r u d d e r u 0 l r u d d e r ν where l r u d d e r is the length of rudder at propeller axis l r u d d e r 0 2375 m in model scale as seen in table 2 reynolds numbers are larger in crp pod 1 than in crp pod 2 since crp pod 1 uses larger propeller compared with crp pod 2 note that the practical reynolds numbers of the aft propeller and rudder are expected to be larger than the nominal ones since their inflows are accelerated by the upstream propeller it can be seen from fig 8 that the open water characteristics obtained by cfd simulation are well consistent with experimental data for the forward propeller discrepancies on thrust and torque coefficients between cfd and experiment are below 3 5 for both crp pods showing satisfactory agreement however cfd underestimates the thrust and torque of the aft propeller at a high advance ratio with a maximum discrepancy of approximately 5 6 this may be because the inflow of the aft propeller is complicated by the wake of the forward propeller thus it is difficult to evaluate it accurately in both the axial and tangential directions nevertheless the efficiencies of the forward and aft propellers are well predicted over the whole range of advance ratios with a maximum discrepancy below 3 0 compared to experimental data a typical residual convergence pattern is plotted in fig 9 where four representative variables turbulence kinematic energy k turbulence dissipation rate ω intermittency γ and r e θ t are shown in successive twenty time steps it is seen that these residuals are stable though they fluctuate with large amplitudes due to the unsteady computation for transition model implementation the intermittency γ is usually difficult to converge to a low level here the intermittency γ has the maximum residual with the order of 10 1 the residual of r e θ t fluctuates from order of 10 3 to order of 10 5 showing the maximum amplitude a description of transition phenomena on the blades is shown in fig 10 based on the instantaneous fields of the intermittency and turbulent viscosity ratio for crp pod 1 at j 0 6 at a cylinder section of 0 7 propeller diameter theoretically the γ and μ τ μ are lower in laminar flow than in turbulent flow it is clear in fig 10 that the transition location is close to the trailing edges for both forward and aft propellers the difference between the two propellers is observed on the pressure side near the trailing edges the pressure side is wholly dominated by laminar flow for the forward propeller while covered by turbulent flow near the trailing edge of the aft propeller note that for such unsteady flow the flow regime on the blades of the two propellers change with the phase angles therefore it is quite challenging to analyze the flow regime on the blade surfaces for a crp pod or crp to our best knowledge there is no public literature on this by now fig 11 illustrates the power ratio of forward to aft propellers in cfd simulation as a function of the advance ratio which is also compared with the model test results the agreement between cfd and the experiment is good it is seen that the power ratio is not fixed with the change of the advance ratio for both crp pods implying that the rotational speed ratio of forward to aft propellers should be adjusted according to the ship speed to keep the power distribution fixed an experiment conducted by chang and go 2011 showed that the relationship between the power ratio and advance ratio is nearly linear however for the considered two crp pods the linearity is not as noticeable as they observed and the slope of the power ratio curve is dependent on the propeller geometry 4 2 grid sensitivity analysis grid sensitivity analysis typically requires at least three grid systems with a refinement ratio of 2 this will cause the total grid number increase with a ratio of 2 2 for three dimensional problems however it is impractical for this study to adopt three refinement levels since coarsening the mesh would lead to 3 35 million cells which is insufficient to resolve flow features while refining the mesh twice would generate 76 million cells which requires too much computation following dubbioso et al 2013 muscari et al 2013 and gong et al 2018 the two grid assessment procedure proposed by roache 1997 is adopted here where the error of the fine grid is estimated as 9 e f 2 f 1 1 r p where f 1 and f 2 are the fine and medium grid solutions respectively r is the mesh refinement ratio and p is the formal order of accuracy of the algorithm we use p 2 the uncertainty is calculated as 10 u n f s e where f s is the safety factor whose value depends on the number of meshes used in sensitivity analysis f s is typically 1 25 when three or more meshes are used while a conservative value of 3 is used when only two meshes are involved according to roache 1997 it should be pointed out that u n in eq 10 is not the error estimator of numerical simulation but the rough error band in a statistical sense to perform the two grid assessment a refined mesh is generated with a refinement ratio of approximately r 2 the total number of cells is 24 2 million among which 7 0 million and 5 7 million are for the forward and aft subdomains respectively for the fine mesh the time step is adjusted to keep the same courant friedrichs lewy cfl number as for the medium mesh tables 3 and 4 summarize the results of grid sensitivity tests for crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 respectively two advance ratios j 0 4 and 0 6 are considered the discrepancies on the thrust and torque between the fine and medium mesh are less than 1 5 therefore the medium mesh is adopted in the following analysis to reduce the computational cost note that this study uses trimmed cells in both the rotating subdomains and the static domain another commonly used mesh strategy is to generate a polyhedral mesh in the subdomain instead of a trimmed mesh the combination of polyhedral and trimmed meshes may lead to different grid sensitivity behavior this is outside the scope of the present work 5 results and discussion 5 1 interaction of thrust and torque between forward and aft propellers to analyze the mutual interaction between forward and aft propellers propeller alone conditions that is forward propeller alone and aft propeller alone are simulated fig 12 shows the configuration of propeller alone conditions note that the rudder pod remains in the case of forward propeller alone in order to take into account the vortex rudder interaction in fact the rudder pod has a little effect on the thrust and torque of the forward propeller but it is significant for the evolution of the vortical structure in the wake the computational setup in the propeller alone condition such as mesh density dimensions of the computational domain and rotating subdomain towing carriage speed and rotational speed of propellers is consistent with that in the crp pod configuration except for the total grid number which is reduced because fewer propellers are computed comparisons of open water characteristics between crp pod and propeller alone configurations are shown in fig 13 for both crp pods the changes in thrust and torque confirm that the forward propeller has a larger effect on the aft propeller than vice versa independent of propeller geometry the discrepancies of k t and k q between the crp pod and propeller alone configurations are not noticeable for the forward propeller but are remarkable for the aft propeller the presence of the aft propeller causes a slight decrease in the thrust of the forward propeller mainly due to its suction effect on the inflow of the forward propeller however the thrust and torque of the aft propeller are remarkably reduced by the forward propeller especially at low advance ratios this is mainly because the forward propeller greatly accelerates the inflow of the aft propeller 5 2 interaction of vortex and velocity between forward and aft propellers to visualize vortices in the wake of crp pod the q criterion proposed by jeong and hussain 1995 is used q is the second invariant of the rate of strain tensor commonly used to identify the vortex and defined as 11 q 1 2 u x 2 v y 2 w z 2 u y v x u z w x v z w y figs 14 and 15 visualize the instantaneous vortical structure by iso surfaces of q at the advance ratios j 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 for crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 respectively for visual clarity the q values of iso surfaces are adjusted according to the advance ratio specifically q is set to 10 000 5 000 and 3000 for j 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 respectively the iso surfaces of q are colored according to the non dimensional axial velocity phase angles for the forward and aft propellers follow each rotational direction as illustrated in fig 16 typically the vortical structure in the wake of a rotating propeller consists of the tip vortex blade trailing edge vortex sheet and hub vortex for the crp pod configuration however the hub vortex is weak due to the interference of the pod which plays a role as a rudder bulb while the tip vortex and blade trailing edge vortex are clearly observed in figs 14 and 15 for crp pod 1 it is seen that the tip vortices shed by the forward and aft propellers collide as the blade tips of the aft propeller are close to the boundary of the contracted slipstream tube of the forward propeller this causes the trajectories of tip vortices shed by the two propellers to deform remarkably such that they roll up around each other which immediately triggers the instability of the tip vortex structure and leads to the breakdown of tip vortices see fig 14 a1 b1 such unstable behavior of the tip vortex is more evident at a low advance ratio since a higher loading condition leads to a stronger slipstream contraction thus a larger overlapping region between slipstreams of the forward and aft propellers in contrast in propeller alone configurations of crp pod 1 the tip vortex has a stable coherent helical structure until it impacts the rudder after it is split by the rudder the two parts of the tip vortex maintain a regular helical trajectory without breakdown behavior in the near wake in this regard the interaction of the tip vortex between the forward and aft propellers in crp pod 1 is strong as for crp pod 2 the tip vortex has a stable coherent structure in the near wake even in the crp pod configuration the tip vortex interaction between forward and aft propellers is not as strong as in crp pod 1 mainly because the diameter of the aft propeller in crp pod 2 is so small that the tip vortices shed by the forward and aft propellers cannot collide nevertheless the propeller propeller interaction in crp pod 2 has an evident effect on the tip vortex strength we can see that with respect to the propeller alone condition the survival distance of tip vortices is remarkably reduced for the aft propeller and slightly reduced for the forward propeller this is consistent with the observation on the change of propeller loading in section 5 1 considering the correlation between the propeller loading and vortex strength the difference in tip vortex structures between crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 suggests that the tip vortex interaction between the forward and aft propellers is significantly dependent on propeller geometry other interesting phenomena related to the evolution of the tip vortices observed in figs 14 and 15 are the vortex rudder interaction and vortex pairing as colliding with the leading edges of the rudder the tip vortex remarkably deforms and wraps around the rudder since its downstream movement is delayed by the boundary layer of the rudder see fig 17 for a closer view consequently the tip vortices are split by the rudder into two linking branches with opposite spanwise displacements on the rudder surface for the forward propeller the spanwise displacement is upward at the port side and downward at the starboard side see fig 18 this reverses for the aft propeller due to its counter rotation the displacement behavior of tip vortices eventually results in a spanwise misalignment in the vicinity of the trailing edge of the rudder especially at the propeller alone condition with a heavy loading vortex pairing is the combination of two neighboring tip vortices into a stronger vortex first reported by felli et al 2011 in this study the vortex pairing phenomena are observed in crp pod 1 fig 14 a2 and crp pod 2 fig 15 a1 a3 in fact it is more likely to occur under a heavy loading condition where tip vortices are strong and the spiral to spiral distance between neighboring tip vortices is small to further analyze the vortex dynamics the instantaneous axial vorticity distribution on the horizontal plane on the propeller axis is shown in figs 19 and 20 where the axial vorticities generated by the forward and aft propellers are of opposite sign the dashed lines in figs 19 and 20 denote the radial position equal to the diameter of the propellers again the tip vortex instability caused by the interaction between propellers is clearly observed in the case of the crp pod configuration in fig 19 where the tip vortices shed by forward and aft propellers are mixed in the vicinity of the slipstream boundary showing a disordered distribution of the vortex core in contrast with crp pod 1 the tip vortex cores of the forward propeller in crp pod 2 are slightly affected by the aft propeller in terms of trajectory and strength whereas the strength of tip vortices shed by the aft propeller in crp pod 2 is noticeably weakened by the forward propeller especially at a low advance ratio this is consistent with the above observation on the surviving distance of q iso surfaces in crp pod 2 the vortex sheet shed by the blade s trailing edge is also observed in figs 19 and 20 it becomes weak as it evolves downstream due to viscous dissipation independent of the propeller geometry and loading condition the sign of a trailing edge vortex in propeller alone configurations shows regular intervals related to propeller rotation in the near wake however instability occurs downstream of the rudder s trailing edge at low advance ratios like the tip vortex the occurrence of instability of the trailing edge vortex sheet shows clear dependence on the propeller geometry and loading condition in fact the underlying mechanism causing propeller wake instability is quite complicated even for a conventional propeller in open water conditions without rudder interference felli et al 2011 attributed this to mutual inductance between adjacent tip vortices however kumar and mahesh 2017 pointed out that it depends on the propeller geometry as the interaction between the blade wake and adjacent tip vortices becomes the dominant reason for a propeller with strong trailing edge vortices in the crp pod configuration the presence of a rudder pod may trigger instability to occur earlier than in the case of a single screw in open water this requires more specific investigation which is not included in this paper it is also seen in figs 19 and 20 that the trailing edge vortex is not regular due to the mixing behavior of the trailing edge vortices shed by the forward and aft propellers nevertheless the trailing edge vortex shed by the forward propeller seems to be dominated mainly because more power is absorbed by the forward propeller figs 21 and 22 show the instantaneous non dimensional axial velocity fields at different advance ratios for crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 respectively it is confirmed for both crp pods that the aft propeller can further accelerate the axial velocity leading to a rapid contraction of the slipstream in the very near wake the slipstream boundary in the crp pod configuration of fig 21 noticeably fluctuates in the radial direction at low advance ratios this is consistent with the instability phenomenon observed in the tip vortex compared with crp pod 1 the region of higher axial velocity accelerated by the aft propeller is much narrower in crp pod 2 due to its reduced aft propeller diameter it is also seen in figs 21 and 22 that the velocity inside the slipstream tube of the forward propeller is much larger than the velocity far upstream implying that the aft propeller operates in a higher advance ratio than the nominal one for simplicity the deviation between the practical advance ratio and the nominal one is denoted as δj to analyze δj quantitatively a thrust identity criterion is used where the thrust coefficient k t in the crp pod configuration is used to determine the j value at the aft propeller alone condition see fig 23 for the schematic of δj estimation table 5 summarizes the computed δj of the two crp pods at various advance ratios it should be pointed out that the value of δj at j 0 7 is obtained by extrapolating the k t curve of the aft propeller alone case since the practical advance ratio is larger than the maximum j considered to reveal the mechanism of δj an analysis is performed based on momentum theory where the propeller is simplified to an actuator disk producing thrust by simply accelerating flow in the axial direction without rotation the axial flow in the far downstream in momentum theory can be described as a function of a thrust loading coefficient as follows 12 u f u 0 1 c t where u f is the velocity in the far downstream u 0 is the velocity of inflow and c t is the thrust loading coefficient therefore the velocity acceleration u a can be determined by u a u f u 0 u 0 1 c t 1 the relation between δj and u a can be described as 13 δ j u a n d table 5 compares δj and u a between cfd and momentum theory similar tendencies are seen for the two methods where δj decays as j increases however the value of δj obtained by momentum theory is much larger than that of cfd with respect to u a the cfd results are smaller than those of momentum theory interestingly momentum theory is consistent with cfd of the forward propeller alone cases in figs 21 and 22 in terms of the u a value this suggests that it is not sufficient to estimate δj based only on u a because the rotational flow in the wake of the forward propeller also plays an important role in the shift in the j value the rotational flow generated by the forward propeller can increase the load of the aft propeller due to its converse tangential direction with respect to the aft propeller rotation the deviation in the δj value between cfd and momentum theory is mainly due to the lack of rotational flow in the momentum theory therefore the design of the aft propeller must take into account the forward propeller wake in both the axial and tangential directions figs 24 and 25 show the tangential velocity field on the transverse plane at the rudder axis 0 16 m downstream of the aft propeller for the two crp pods it is clear that the tangential velocity in the crp pod configuration is considerably weaker than in propeller alone configurations independent of propeller geometry and loading condition this can explain the energy saving mechanism of crp pod i e that the aft propeller plays the role of recovering the rotational energy induced by the forward propeller although the results in figs 24 and 25 are not time averaged as expected the reduction of rotational flow in crp pod 2 concentrates in a smaller region related to the diameter of the aft propeller compared with crp pod 1 this implies that the rotational energy outside the aft propeller slipstream cannot be recovered in crp pod 2 therefore the optimal diameter of the aft propeller should be as close as possible to the diameter of the contracted slipstream of the forward propeller from the viewpoint of energy recovery 5 3 interaction of lateral hydrodynamic force on rudder pod between forward and aft propellers in this section the lateral hydrodynamic force on the rudder pod is analyzed in the context of propeller propeller interaction of the crp pod we know felli and falchi 2011 that the rotating flow of the propeller slipstream generates opposing lateral loads on the upper and lower parts of the rudder with respect to the shaft center which cancel each other for a horn type rudder the total lateral load is nonzero due to the asymmetrical profile additionally as it operates in the unsteady wake of the propeller the rudder is subject to the periodic impact of propeller vortices this causes the lateral load exerting on the rudder to periodically fluctuate which is related to structural vibration and noise emission and affects the course keeping of the ship fig 26 shows the time histories of the lateral force on the rudder pod in five revolutions of the forward propeller at advance ratios of j 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 in which the propeller alone configuration is compared with the crp pod configuration note that the data of fig 26 are recorded after the simulation has converged it is seen that the forward and aft propellers yield opposing lateral forces on the rudder pod due to their contra rotating behaviors the total lateral force of the crp pod is the result of the two opposite components generated by the forward and aft propellers thus it fluctuates between portside and starboard especially at low advance ratios the averages of lateral forces are summarized in table 6 which shows that the lateral force is remarkably reduced in the crp pod configuration over all the considered advance ratios for both crp pods it should be pointed out that the lateral force in the single screw scenario is supposed to be larger than in the present propeller alone condition since in that case the single propeller will absorb all the power it is also clear from fig 26 that the amplitude and frequency of the lateral force fluctuation are dependent on the propeller geometry compared to crp pod 2 the lateral force in the crp pod and aft propeller alone configurations of crp pod 1 fluctuates with a lower frequency and larger amplitude mainly because crp pod 1 has fewer blades on the aft propeller note that the frequency of lateral force fluctuation is approximately the blade frequency which is much higher than the propeller shaft frequency theoretically the fluctuation amplitude of the lateral force should decrease as the number of blades increases this was confirmed by mascio et al 2015 in their numerical analysis of propeller rudder interaction where the spanwise lateral forces on the rudder were compared between one and four blade propellers it should be pointed out that validation is not carried out on the hydrodynamic load of the rudder pod due to the lack of available experimental data nevertheless the trends of the lateral force shown in fig 26 should be qualitatively reliable considering the satisfactory agreement of the propeller force between cfd and model test in the following a further analysis is carried out on the flow details around the rudder pod to reveal the correlation between the unsteadiness of the lateral force of the rudder pod and the vortex evolution instantaneous vortical structures at four typical phase angles marked in fig 26 are represented in fig 27 note that parts of the starboard iso surface of q are not visualized for the sake of clarity it is seen that in phase a the tip vortex shed by the forward propeller is impacting the leading edge of the rudder while phase b corresponds to the onset of the collision between the tip vortex shed by the aft propeller and the leading edge of the rudder a similar phenomenon can be seen in phases c and d to describe the distribution of hydrodynamic load on the rudder surface the skin friction coefficient c f and pressure coefficient c p are defined as 14 c f τ w 1 2 ρ u 0 2 c p p p 0 1 2 ρ u 0 2 where τ w is the local wall shear stress defined as τ w t s s t is the stress tensor and s is the area vector p 0 is the static pressure far upstream figs 28 and 29 show the contours of the skin friction and pressure coefficients on the rudder surface for crp pod 1 and crp pod 2 respectively higher skin friction is clearly observed on the rudder surface inside the propeller slipstream in contrast to the skin friction coefficient the pressure distribution is smooth at the boundary of propeller slipstream higher pressure is observed near the leading edge of the rudder it is caused by the collision of the propeller slipstream and rudder to show the flow regime near the rudder fig 30 gives an instantaneous distribution of the turbulent viscosity ratio at two horizontal plans which are at 0 6 d f with respect to the propeller center the turbulent viscosity ratio is expected to be low in the laminar flow or viscous sub layer and high in the turbulent flow it can be seen that the rudder is covered by turbulent flow from its maximum thickness to trailing edge 6 conclusions in this study the interaction between the forward and aft propellers of crp pod in open water was numerically investigated the analysis was focused on global quantities including the thrust and torque of each propeller and flow details such as structures of the vortex and velocity in the wake and lateral hydrodynamic force on the rudder pod an unsteady sst k ω based iddes model was used the flow transition effect was taken into account by means of the γ r e θ transition model two sets of crp pods with different propeller geometries designed for a 38000 dwt bulk carrier were considered a model test was carried out to validate the cfd computation satisfactory agreement was obtained on the open water characteristic between the experiment and cfd simulations were also carried out for the configurations of forward propeller alone and aft propeller alone in order to analyze their mutual interaction the following are observed i thrust and torque the forward propeller was slightly affected by the aft propeller while the thrust and torque of the aft propeller were remarkably reduced by the forward propeller especially at a low advance ratio this was independent of propeller geometry additionally it was confirmed that the power ratio between the forward and aft propellers varies with the advance ratio ii structures of vortex and velocity the vortical structure is strongly dependent on the propeller geometry in the case of crp pod 1 with aft propeller diameter close to the diameter of the contracted slipstream of the forward propeller the contra rotating tip vortices shed by the forward and aft propellers rolled up around each other triggering the instability of the vortical structure and causing it to break down in the near wake using a diameter reduced aft propeller crp pod 2 had stable tip vortices with a regular helical structure the velocity field inside the slipstream tube suggested that the aft propeller plays the role of further accelerating axial flow while weakening the rotational flow generated by the forward propeller independent of the propeller geometry and loading condition this explains the energy recovery mechanism of crp pod iii lateral hydrodynamic force on the rudder pod the forward and aft propellers yielded opposing time averaged lateral force on the rudder pod which were remarkably decreased in the crp pod configuration due to the propeller propeller interaction independent of the propeller geometry and loading condition moreover the fluctuation of lateral force on the rudder pod in crp pod 1 had larger amplitude and lower frequency compared to crp pod 2 mainly because the aft propeller of crp pod 1 had fewer blades showing strong dependence on propeller geometry acknowledgements the work presented here is financially supported by the research project high technology ship

technology is an effective way to reduce ship friction some basic concepts of air layer drag reduction were proposed in the 19th century by latorre 1997 subsequently researchers conducted numerous experimental studies in the laboratory in most air layer drag reduction experiments the air is injected through continuous slots which are either open or filled with porous material to ensure a uniform air layer under the test surface kodama et al 2000 slyozkin 2011 ceccio 2010 presented different applications and a detailed explanation of the distribution of air under a ship s hull during air injection air layer drag reduction by means of a bottom cavity has been proven to be an effective method of ship drag reduction lay et al 2010 and mäkiharju et al 2012 2013 conducted an experimental investigation about the drag reduction effects of a ventilated partial cavity at high reynolds numbers for a large plate in the w b morgan large cavitation channel and established the basic energy economic calculation results for a hypothetical air lubricated ship the stability of the air layer in the bottom cavity and the coverage area of air layer are the key factors that affect the effect of the air layer drag reduction for a ship to obtain a uniform air layer under the bottom hull zverkhovskyi 2014 designed a device called a cavitator to impede the flow of water on the underside of the vessel with a small slotted opening behind the cavitator delivering the air supply this method was found to be particularly successful because it significantly reduces the air flow rate required to create the air layer the effect of air layer thickness on drag reduction was verified experimentally by shuji et al 2010 the result shows that the energy consumed by the blower depends on the thickness of the bottom air layer following the fundamental experimental study on a flat plate with a cavity conducted in the emerson cavitation tunnel of newcastle university by slyozkin et al 2014 butterworth et al 2015 proposed an experimental test on an existing container ship model with a cavity of 0 0387 m2 at the bottom of the ship model the model experiment results show that the effect of air layer drag reduction can reach 4 16 the effect of air layer drag reduction and the air escape from the bottom hull were affected by the characteristics of the bottom cavity according to conclusion of slyozkin and butterworth the design of the bottom cavity plays an important role in the evaluation of the air layer drag reduction mäkiharju et al 2010 conducted a series of tests with a flat plate with a device called a bfs which helps the air layer to form easily while reducing the air supply and pressure experimental test on a flat plate and a ship model with air lubrication system were successively conducted by jang et al 2014 from the tests if there is no significant deterioration in the real sea condition it is considered that the air lubrication at the bottom of the ship has great potential for energy saving according to the experimental results many scholars have carried out a mass of numerical research matveev 2003 2007 solved an important problem with a simplified model which is the interaction between the waves and the cavity the result shows the main parameters that affect air layer in the ship bottom cavity is the shape of cavity and speed the same author has developed a platform to test different types of air cavity ships acs using the necessary instrumentation to improve and optimize this technique matveev 2015 the interaction between the cavity and the boundary of ship was analyzed by amromin 2016 choi et al 2005 2007 2010 utilized an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes unrans equation solver to study the viscous effects around the hull with an air plenum the results of parametric studies over a range of hull form parameters are presented and the effects of air plenum parameters on the ship startup stability are investigated the developed numerical method is used to establish trends of the total resistance and its dependence on the froude number kim and moin 2010 performs direct numerical simulations in order to confirm the experimental results and examine the stability and mechanism of air layer drag reduction for different air injection rates besides he also investigates the stability of air layer theoretically to find the stabilizing parameters and stability conditions for air layer drag reduction an assessment of the streamlines and air distribution for a planing air cavity ship is proposed by cucinotta et al 2017 2018 and an evaluation of the wetted and ventilated areas is conducted in order to understand the relation between the flow rate the speed of the ship and the air distribution the results can be used for modifying the ship hull geometry in order to better accommodate the air layer in this study a method with the combination of rans equations and vof model is proposed for the viscous flow calculation of a large flat bottom ship with bottom cavity in section 2 of the paper describes the materials and methods which includes the model the validation test and the cfd method in section 3 presents the validation of numerical method section 4 and section 5 show the effect of ship heeling and trim on the shape of air layer and drag reduction finally section 6 presents the conclusions obtained from the study 2 materials and methods 2 1 the model a low flat large ship was selected as a test hull form and a model ship was manufactured with a scale ratio of 38 0 to perform the tests the bottom of the ship has a broad flat structure and a long parallel section of the body which is very suitable for the application of air layer drag reduction technology fig 1 shows the geometry model of the ship the principal particulars of the ship are shown in table 1 the flat bottom area where reduction in the frictional resistance can be expected to occur is about 40 of the total wetted surface area in the condition of design displacement fig 2 shows the test model with bottom cavity the ship model has a large flat structure which is very suitable for setup of cavity as the bottom of the ship is an arc shaped flat structure an arc shaped cavity is used under the bottom of ship and a slope structure is set at the tail of the cavity the length and width of the cavity is 4 32 0 82 m and the depth of the cavity is 25 mm the area of the cavity is approximately 84 of the large flat structure the principal particulars of the bottom cavity are shown in table 2 l c b c and h is the length width and depth of the ship bottom cavity s c presents the area of the bottom cavity the cavity starts from the head of the flat bottom of the ship model the head of the cavity is arc shape and the tail is slope shape 2 2 the cfd methods 2 2 1 governing equations viscous flow in this study the resistance of the ship model was simulated by the rans codes of a commercial soft rans equation is the governing equation for the kinematical and hydrodynamic problem of viscous flow which is mainly inclusive of the continuity equation and momentum equation the specific formulas of the two equations can be written as following 1 t ρ m ρ m v m 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j ρ u i u j ρ f i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 μ u l x l δ i j i where ρ is the fluid density μ is the fluid viscosity p is the static pressure f i is the mass force at unit δ i j is the unit tensors u i is the pulse of u i and u i is the velocity component of x direction respectively using the vof model can effectively simulate the air liquid stratified flow formed at the bottom cavity of the ship model and the free surface the vof model description assumes that all immiscible fluid phases present in a control volume share velocity pressure and temperature fields the vof model relies on the fact that the two fluids air and liquid do not interpenetrate each other in each control cell the sum of the volume fractions of air and liquid is one at this point as long as the volume fraction of different components in the local cell is known the parameter values of the flow field in the cell can be obtained specific related parameters can refer to user guide for star ccm 2015 2 2 2 turbulence model based on previous research by wu et al 2016a 2016b in present paper the

mesh quality it is very important to choose a suitable size of domain firstly which affects the solution accuracy and calculation cost too large domain will increase the computational time and cost on the other hand a small domain would adversely influence the solution figs 3 and 4 show the regional division numerical mesh and the boundary conditions for the ship model with air cavity based on the two phase flow theory the boundary conditions of present problem are set as follows the inlet is 0 8 times plate length which is corresponding to the velocity inlet boundary condition the distance is 2 0 times ship length from the model s aft to the outlet which is set as the outflow boundary condition the top bottom and side surface of the computational domain are all free slip wall boundary condition the primary function for the grid is to capture the main features of the flow different block refinements are applied in the region fig 5 shows the details of the mesh the grids in bottom cavity of the ship model are refined to obtain the characteristics of air layer the grid has been refined for the kelvin wake solution near the free surface fig 6 shows the grid of the ship hull surface fig 7 shows the wall y of the ship hull 2 3 the model tests the experiments were conducted in the towing tank of the chinese special vehicle research institute which is the longest towing tank in china the towing tank is 550 m long 6 5 m wide 5 0 m deep and equipped with a drive carriage facilitating shipped of 0 15 m s for test the model ship for the tests in the towing tank is shown in fig 8 an observation system has been installed at the bottom of the towing tank to obtain the shape of air layer in the bottom cavity to avoid the interference between the pipe and the ship model the air injection pipes is made of plastic hose and keep prevention contact between pipes and the ship model air was injected through array of holes on the base plate of each air injection devices according to the air supply chain compressed air by the air compressor was stored in the air cylinder on the tank trailer and the flow rate of air supplied to the air injection devices were adjusted by a personal computer and measure by several air flow meters the air flow rate plays a key role in the formation of the air layer in the bottom cavity the saturated air flow was selected as the research object of this paper and the specific selection method and the value of the saturated air flow is provided by wu 2017 definition of non dimensional air flow rate coefficient cq as following 5 c q q v b δ where q is the air flow rate v is the inflow velocity b is the transverse width of air inject entrance δ is the thickness of boundary layer of the air inject entrance at no air injection which is given by eq 6 6 δ 5 2 r e 0 5 x here re is the reynolds number of the air inject entrance which is given by eq 7 7 r e v x ν where x is the distance between the air injection and the bow of the ship model ν is the water viscosity coefficient and ν 1 003 10 6 at normal temperature 3 validation of numerical method in order to evaluate the numerical results a comparison with the results of experiment is carried out in this paper the shape of air layer and the resistance of ship model are verified the absolute drag reduction of the resistance for the model ship is defined as follows 8 η a r w i t h o u t c a v i t y r c a v i t y air r w i t h o u t c a v i t y where r c a v i t y is the resistance of ship model with cavity but without air r c a v i t y air is the resistance of ship model with cavity and air r w i t h o u t c a v i t y is the resistance of ship model without cavity and air 3 1 verification of air layer shape fig 9 shows the calculated results and experiment results of the air layer at the bottom ship when fr 0 155 and cq 0 112 it can be seen that the shape of air layer was simulated effectively by the method of combining the rans and vof model a continuous air layer was form at the bottom of ship when the ship model floating on even keel and the air bubble is evenly spilt from both sides of the stern the coverage area of the air layer in the cavity decreases when the ship model heeling angle is two degree the air layer moves to the heel side and most of it overflows on this side however when the ship model trim angle is one degree the coverage of the air layer is greatly reduced and easily broken it can only cover the area near the air injection and then overflows outwards in the calculation of the heel state the shape of the air layer is difficult to simulate by numerical method because the shape of the air layer is relatively random when the air is difficult to cover the entire bottom cavity 3 2 verification of ship resistance table 3 shows the comparison of calculation results and experiment results for the absolute drag reduction of the ship model under different air flow at fr 0 155when ship model is floating on even keel it can be seen that the total resistance error between the experimental value and the calculated value is within 3 0 fig 10 shows the calculation results and test results of the absolute drag reduction of the ship model for an fr range from 0 107 to 0 182 and cq 0 056 in different navigational states it can be seen that the total resistance error between the experimental value and the calculated value is also meet the requirement under different navigation state all error values are within 3 5 the result shows that the viscous flow field of the ship model with air layer by the combination of rans and vof model can accurately forecast the absolute drag reduction besides the drag reduction is better when the ship model floating on even keel the absolute drag reduction can reach more than 25 at the design speed from the above analysis it can find that the method with the combination of rans equations and vof model is suitable for the numerical simulation air layer drag reduction and the effect of ship attitude on perform of ship with bottom cavity 4 effect of heel 4 1 effect on shape of air layer fig 11 shows the shape of the air layer under different heeling for fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 it can be seen that the heeling has little effect on the coverage area of the bottom cavity when the heeling angle increase 0 1 2 however the ship heeling affected the overflow of air from the tail of the bottom cavity the air mainly overflows from the side of the heeling when the heeling angle is more than one degree fig 12 shows the image of the air layer on the cross section of the ship model at different heel angles for fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 it is clearly shown that the thickness of the air layer changes along the width of the ship when the heeling angle increases in order to show the thickness of the air layer along the width of the ship fig 13 shows the variation of the boundary of the air layer with the heeling angle on the cross section of the middle of the ship model in fig 13 the abscissa indicates the width of the ship the direction is parallel to the bottom of the ship the shaded part indicates the cavity β represents the angle of heeling θ represents the average angle of the air layer which is the angle between the line connecting the two ends of the cross section of the air layer and the bottom plane of ship it is shown that the average angle of the air layer increases with the heel angle increases table 4 shows the average angle of the air layer on the transverse section of the stern in different heeling angles when fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 from table 4 it can be seen that the average angle of the air layer increases with the increase of the heeling angle and is almost equal to the value of the heel angle there is a critical angle arctan h b c 1 93 fig 14 shows the shape of air layer for fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 when the heeling is more than arctan h b c 1 93 it can be seen that the air layer begins to break when the heeling angle is greater than the critical value and the effective coverage area by air layer decreases 4 2 effect on ship resistance fig 15 shows the variation of drag reduction with the heeling angle of ship model when fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 it is obvious that the drag reduction is more than 20 when the heeling angle of ship model is less than 1 5 the drag reduction decreases significantly when the heeling angle is more the critical angle arctan h b c 1 93 5 effect of trim 5 1 effect on shape of air layer fig 16 shows the shape of the air layer under different trim for fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 it can be seen that the air layer is relatively stable when the trim is small however the air layer starts to break when the trim angle is more than 0 5 the air overflows from the head of the bottom cavity in addition the air layer at the end of the bottom cavity was disturbed by the trim angle seriously fig 17 shows air layer image when the trim of ship model is 0 7 for fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 it can be seen that large tail angle has an adverse effect on the stability of the air layer and the air layer was broken in a larger area and the air overflow from the head of bottom cavity is very serious 5 2 effect on ship resistance fig 18 shows the variation of drag reduction with the trim angle of ship model when fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 it can be seen that the drag reduction decreases with the trim angle increases moreover the drag reduction is negative when the trim angle is greater than one degree 6 discussion and conclusion numerical simulations were conducted about the air layer on the lower surface of the flat ship model it can be confirmed from the simulations that the air layer generated by air injection at the bottom of the hull can be used as an effective means to reduce the frictional resistance of the ship model accordingly the following conclusions can be drawn from the numerical analysis 1 air layer in the bottom cavity can be reasonably simulated based on the rans equations and vof two phase flow model and the absolute drag reduction of the ship model can be reasonably predicted the coverage of the bottom air layer is closely related to the drag reduction of ship model the absolute drag reduction rate can reach more than 25 for a bulk carrier model with bottom cavity in this study 2 the attitude of the ship model has an important influence on the distribution of the bottom air layer for a ship model with a bottom cavity a stable air layer can be formed when the heeling is less than the critical value arctan h b c the air layer broke when the heeling is greater than the critical value arctan h b c the separation of air layer is intensified with the increase of heeling angle 3 the trim angle of the ship is unfavorable to the stability of the air layer and it should be avoided as much as possible in the course of navigation the numerical method for air layer drag reduction in the bottom cavity is shown in the above results and some related conclusions are listed the conclusions show that the scheme of the bottom cavity in this paper is effective for the large vessels sailing in the calm water unfortunately it also indicates that air cavity is inefficient for seagoing vessels in realistic operating conditions especially in areas with poor sea conditions in order to make the air cavity ship to adapt to different sea conditions the following discussion is given 4 for different sea conditions different depths of bottom cavity can be applied small bottom cavity can be used on the inland ships in the large sea area the depth of bottom cavity can be appropriately increased to improve the thickness of air layer and make the air layer in the bottom cavity more stable which will improve the effect of drag reduction 5 it is thought that set vertical partitions in the bottom cavity may be a good idea to improve the coverage of air layer when ship heeling in addition the coverage of air layer would be better by setting multiple air injection holes in the bottom cavity and injection simultaneously when ship trim 6 in the future research it is necessary to study the air layer shape in the bottom cavity and the drag

experimental investigation about the drag reduction effects of a ventilated partial cavity at high reynolds numbers for a large plate in the w b morgan large cavitation channel and established the basic energy economic calculation results for a hypothetical air lubricated ship the stability of the air layer in the bottom cavity and the coverage area of air layer are the key factors that affect the effect of the air layer drag reduction for a ship to obtain a uniform air layer under the bottom hull zverkhovskyi 2014 designed a device called a cavitator to impede the flow of water on the underside of the vessel with a small slotted opening behind the cavitator delivering the air supply this method was found to be particularly successful because it significantly reduces the air flow rate required to create the air layer the effect of air layer thickness on drag reduction was verified experimentally by shuji et al 2010 the result shows that the energy consumed by the blower depends on the thickness of the bottom air layer following the fundamental experimental study on a flat plate with a cavity conducted in the emerson cavitation tunnel of newcastle university by

show that the effect of air layer drag reduction can reach 4 16 the effect of air layer drag reduction and the air escape from the bottom hull were affected by the characteristics of the bottom cavity according to conclusion of slyozkin and butterworth the design of the bottom cavity plays an important role in the evaluation of the air layer drag reduction mäkiharju et al 2010 conducted a series of tests with a flat plate with a device called a bfs which helps the air layer to form easily while reducing the air supply and pressure experimental test on a flat plate and a ship model with air lubrication system were successively conducted by jang et al 2014 from the tests if there is no significant deterioration in the real sea condition it is considered that the air lubrication at the bottom of the ship has great potential for energy saving according to the experimental results many scholars have carried out a mass of numerical research matveev 2003 2007 solved an important problem

theoretically to find the stabilizing parameters and stability conditions for air layer drag reduction an assessment of the streamlines and air distribution for a planing air cavity ship is proposed by cucinotta et al 2017 2018 and an evaluation of the wetted and ventilated areas is conducted in order to understand the relation between the flow rate the speed of the ship and the air distribution the results can be used for modifying the ship hull geometry in order to better accommodate the air layer in this study a method with the combination of rans equations and vof model is proposed for

method in section 3 presents the validation of numerical method section 4 and section 5 show the effect of ship heeling and trim on the shape of air layer and drag reduction finally section 6 presents the conclusions obtained from the study 2 materials and methods 2 1 the model a low flat large ship was selected as a test hull form and a model ship was manufactured with a scale ratio of 38 0 to perform the tests the bottom of the ship has a broad flat structure and a long parallel section of the body which is very suitable for the application of air layer drag reduction technology fig 1 shows the geometry model of the ship the principal particulars of the ship are shown in table 1 the flat bottom area where reduction in the frictional resistance can be expected to occur is about 40 of the total wetted surface area in the condition of design displacement fig 2 shows the test model with bottom cavity the ship model has a large flat structure which is very suitable for setup of cavity as the bottom of the ship is an arc shaped flat structure an arc shaped cavity is used under the bottom of ship and a slope structure is set at the tail of the cavity the length and width of

commercial soft rans equation is the governing equation for the kinematical and hydrodynamic problem of viscous flow which is mainly inclusive of the continuity equation and momentum equation the specific formulas of the two equations can be written as following 1 t ρ m ρ m v m 0 2 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j ρ u i u j ρ f i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 μ u l x l δ i j i where ρ is the fluid

using the vof model can effectively simulate the air liquid stratified flow formed at the bottom cavity of the ship model and the free surface the vof model description assumes that all immiscible fluid phases present in a control volume share velocity pressure and temperature fields the vof model relies on the fact that the two fluids air and liquid do not interpenetrate each other in each control cell the sum of the volume fractions of air and liquid is one at this point as long as the volume fraction of different components in the local cell is known the parameter values of the flow

mesh quality it is very important to choose a suitable size of domain firstly which affects the solution accuracy and calculation cost too large domain will increase the computational time and cost on the other hand a small domain would adversely influence the solution figs 3 and 4 show the regional division numerical mesh and the boundary conditions for the ship model with air cavity based on the two phase flow theory the boundary conditions of present problem are set as follows the inlet is 0 8 times plate length which is corresponding to the velocity inlet boundary condition the distance is

cavity of the ship model are refined to obtain the characteristics of air layer the grid has been refined for the kelvin wake solution near the free surface fig 6 shows the grid of the ship hull surface fig 7 shows the wall y of the ship hull 2 3 the model tests the experiments were conducted in the towing tank of the chinese special vehicle research institute which is the longest towing tank in china the towing tank is 550 m long 6 5 m wide 5 0 m deep and equipped with a drive carriage facilitating shipped of 0 15 m s for test the model ship for the tests in the towing tank is shown in fig 8 an observation system has been installed at the bottom of the towing tank to obtain the shape of air layer in the bottom cavity to avoid the interference between the pipe and the ship model the air injection pipes is made of plastic hose and keep prevention contact between pipes and the ship model air was injected through array of holes on the base plate of each air injection devices according to the air supply chain compressed air by the air compressor was stored in the air cylinder on the tank trailer and the flow rate of air supplied to the air injection devices were adjusted by a personal computer and measure by several air flow meters the air flow rate plays a key role in the formation of the air layer in the bottom cavity the saturated air flow was selected as the research object of this paper and the specific selection method and the value of the saturated air flow is provided by wu 2017 definition of non dimensional air flow rate coefficient cq as following 5 c q q v b δ where q is the air flow rate v is the inflow velocity b is the transverse width of air inject entrance δ is the thickness of boundary layer of the air inject entrance at no air injection which is given by eq 6 6 δ 5 2 r e 0 5 x here re is the reynolds number of the air inject entrance which is given by eq 7 7 r e v x ν where x is the distance between the air injection and the bow of the ship model ν is the water viscosity coefficient and ν 1 003 10 6 at normal temperature 3 validation of numerical method in order to evaluate the numerical results a comparison with the results of experiment is carried out in this paper the shape of air layer and the resistance of ship model are verified the absolute drag reduction of the resistance for the model ship is defined as follows 8 η a r w i t h o u t c a v i t y r c a v i t y air r w i t h o u t c a v i t y where r c a v i t y is the resistance of ship model with cavity but without air r c a v i t y air is the resistance of ship model with cavity and air r w i t h o u t c a v i t y is the resistance of ship model without cavity and air 3 1 verification of air layer shape fig 9 shows the calculated results and experiment results of the air layer at the bottom ship when fr 0 155 and cq 0 112 it can be seen that the shape of air layer was simulated effectively by the method of combining the rans and vof model a continuous air layer was form at the bottom of ship when the ship model floating on even keel and the air bubble is evenly spilt from both sides of the stern the coverage area of the air layer in the cavity decreases when the ship model heeling angle is two degree the air layer moves to the heel side and most of it overflows on this side however when the ship model trim angle is one degree the coverage of the air layer is greatly reduced and easily broken it can only cover the area near the air injection and then overflows outwards in the calculation of the heel state the shape of the air layer is difficult to simulate by numerical method because the shape of the air layer is relatively random when the air is difficult to cover the entire bottom cavity 3 2 verification of ship resistance table 3 shows the comparison of calculation results and experiment results for the absolute drag reduction of the ship model under different air flow at fr 0 155when ship model is floating on even keel it can be seen that the total resistance error between the experimental value and the calculated value is within 3 0 fig 10 shows the calculation results and test results of the absolute drag reduction of the ship model for an fr range from 0 107 to 0 182 and cq 0 056 in different navigational states it can be seen that the total resistance error between the experimental value and the calculated value is also meet the requirement under different navigation state all error values are within 3 5 the result shows that the viscous flow field of the ship model with air layer by the combination of rans and vof model can accurately forecast the absolute drag reduction besides the drag reduction is better when the ship model floating on even keel the absolute drag reduction can reach more than 25 at the design speed from the above analysis it can find that the method with the combination of rans equations and vof model is suitable for the numerical simulation air layer drag reduction and the effect of ship attitude on perform of ship with bottom cavity 4 effect of heel 4 1 effect on shape of air layer fig 11 shows the shape of the air layer under different heeling for fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 it can be seen that the heeling has little effect on the coverage area of the bottom cavity when the heeling angle increase 0 1 2 however the ship heeling affected the overflow of air from the tail of the bottom cavity the air mainly overflows from the side of the heeling when the heeling angle is more than one degree fig 12 shows the image of the air layer on the cross section of the ship model at different heel angles for fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 it is clearly shown that the thickness of the air layer changes along the width of the ship when the heeling angle increases in order to show the thickness of the air layer along the width of the ship fig 13 shows the variation of the boundary of the air layer with the heeling angle on the cross section of the middle of the ship model in fig 13 the abscissa indicates the width of the ship the direction is parallel to the bottom of the ship the shaded part indicates the cavity β represents the angle of heeling θ represents the average angle of the air layer which is the angle between the line connecting the two ends of the cross section of the air layer and the bottom plane of ship it is shown that the average angle of the air layer increases with the heel angle increases table 4 shows the average angle of the air layer on the transverse section of the stern in different heeling angles when fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 from table 4 it can be seen that the average angle of the air layer increases with the increase of the heeling angle and is almost equal to the value of the heel angle there is a critical angle arctan h b c 1 93 fig 14 shows the shape of air layer for fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 when the heeling is more than arctan h b c 1 93 it can be seen that the air layer begins to break when the heeling angle is greater than the critical value and the effective coverage area by air layer decreases 4 2 effect on ship resistance fig 15 shows the variation of drag reduction with the heeling angle of ship model when fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 it is obvious that the drag reduction is more than 20 when the heeling angle of ship model is less than 1 5 the drag reduction decreases significantly when the heeling angle is more the critical angle arctan h b c 1 93 5 effect of trim 5 1 effect on shape of air layer fig 16 shows the shape of the air layer under different trim for fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 it can be seen that the air layer is relatively stable when the trim is small however the air layer starts to break when the trim angle is more than 0 5 the air overflows from the head of the bottom cavity in addition the air layer at the end of the bottom cavity was disturbed by the trim angle seriously fig 17 shows air layer image when the trim of ship model is 0 7 for fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 it can be seen that large tail angle has an adverse effect on the stability of the air layer and the air layer was broken in a larger area and the air overflow from the head of bottom cavity is very serious 5 2 effect on ship resistance fig 18 shows the variation of drag reduction with the trim angle of ship model when fr 0 155 and cq 0 056 it can be seen that the drag reduction decreases with the trim angle increases moreover the drag reduction is negative when the trim angle is greater than one degree 6 discussion and conclusion numerical simulations were conducted about the air layer on the lower surface of the flat ship model it can be confirmed from the simulations that the air layer generated by air injection at the bottom of the hull can be used as an effective means to reduce the frictional resistance of the ship model accordingly the following conclusions can be drawn from the numerical analysis 1 air layer in the bottom cavity can be reasonably simulated based on the rans equations and vof two phase flow model and the absolute drag reduction of the ship model can be reasonably predicted the coverage of the bottom air layer is closely related to the drag reduction of ship model the absolute drag reduction rate can reach more than 25 for a bulk carrier model with bottom cavity in this study 2 the attitude of the ship model has an important influence on the distribution of the bottom air layer for a ship model with a bottom cavity a stable air layer can be formed when the heeling is less than the critical value arctan h b c the air layer broke when the heeling is greater than the critical value arctan h b c the separation of air layer is intensified with the increase of heeling angle 3 the trim angle of the ship is unfavorable to the stability of the air layer and it should be avoided as much as possible in the course of navigation the numerical method for air layer drag reduction in the bottom cavity is shown in the above results and some related conclusions are listed the conclusions show that the scheme of the bottom cavity in this paper is effective for the large vessels sailing in the calm water unfortunately it also indicates that air cavity is inefficient for seagoing vessels in realistic operating conditions especially in areas with poor sea conditions in order to make the air cavity ship to adapt to different sea conditions the following discussion is given 4 for different sea conditions different depths of bottom cavity can be applied small bottom cavity can be used on the inland ships in the large sea area the depth of bottom cavity can be appropriately increased to improve the thickness of air layer and make the air layer in the bottom cavity more stable which will improve the effect of drag reduction 5 it is thought that set vertical partitions in the bottom cavity may be a good idea to improve the coverage of air layer when ship heeling in addition the coverage of air layer would be better by setting multiple air injection holes in the bottom cavity and injection simultaneously when ship trim 6 in the future research it is necessary to study the air layer shape in the bottom cavity and the drag

22718,soil permeability is one of key factors in the prediction of the wave induced seabed response which needs to be considered in the design of foundation around marine installations most previous studies in the field treated the soil permeability as a constant or varying in spacial domain although it depends on numerous soil parameters in this study the soil permeability is considered as a function of pore water pressures as reported in the literature with this new feature the governing equations will become non linear differential equations numerical examples demonstrate the considerable influence of dynamic soil permeability on the wave induced pore pressure and effective stresses it is concluded that the conventional model with constant soil permeability under estimates the liquefaction potential keywords dynamic permeability degree of saturation pore water pressures soil response wave loading 1 introduction based on biot s poro elastic theory biot 1941 several classic investigations for the wave induced soil response have been carried out since the 1970s among these yamamoto et al 1978 proposed an exact closed form analytical solution for an isotropic poro elastic and infinite seabed this framework was further extended to three dimensional cases for various wave and soil conditions hsu and jeng 1994 jeng and lin 1997 jeng 2018 liao et al 2018 sui et al 2019 another different approximation boundary layer approximation was proposed by mei and foda 1981 which provided a simple formulations of the wave induced soil response this approximation can provide precise prediction of soil response in fine sand rather than coarse sand as reported in hsu and jeng 1994 a detailed review of previous relevant research can be found in jeng 2003 recently qi et al 2019 reported a series of wave flume tests for the pore water pressure under combined wave and current loading which is the first set of experimental data with wave and current loading available in the literature in their paper the experimental data were also compared with the existing analytical solution and numerical model several numerical models were proposed for soil response around marine infrastructures such as mono piles sui et al 2015 lin et al 2017 offshore pipelines have been extensively used for the transportation of natural oil and gas from offshore platforms and disposal of industrial and municipal waste to ensure the safety of such submarine pipelines coastal engineers have to consider unexpected loads including waves currents anchor dropping and dredging which might cause its instability and decrease its lifespan therefore it is customary to bury the pipeline by trenching and refilling the soil however the cost is relatively high and it is time consuming fredsøe 2016 lots of investigations for wave seabed interactions around a submarine pipeline have been carried out in the past among these numerous laboratory experiments have been conducted to investigate the wave induced seabed response and the stability of submarine pipelines sumer et al 1999 2001 teh et al 2003 zhou et al 2011 sun et al 2019 these experiments indicated that excessive seepage flow and the resulting piping are the major factors in causing the onset of scour beneath the pipeline in addition to physical modelling several numerical models were developed to investigate more complicated wave seabed structure interactions wssi involving a fully buried pipeline in a trenched layer or a multi layered and anisotropic seabed gao et al 2003 gao and wu 2006 zhou et al 2013 guo et al 2019 however there is a major limitation of the above studies which is that the effect of linear or non linear waves was evaluated from the analytical solutions consequently these models could not predict the seabed response around a pipeline that is partly buried or mounted on the seabed recently zhao et al 2014 and lin et al 2016 proposed a fem model to remedy these limitations based on the framework zhao and jeng 2016 considered partially buried pipelines in a trench layer and proposed a design curve of backfill heights for pipeline protection later an intensive study for the wave current induced oscillatory soil response in the vicinity of a partially buried pipeline in a trench layer was carried out duan et al 2017 recently a 3 d model for wave seabed interactions around a submarine pipeline was proposed by liang and jeng 2018 using openfoam all the aforementioned studies have treated the soil permeability as a constant in the entire soil layer in fact soil permeability has been reported to be a function of void ratio e which varies with soil depth z furthermore pore water pressure is another factor that affects the soil permeability gardner 1958 wu and zhang 2009 civan et al 2011 according to gardner 1958 the hydraulic conductivity was expressed as 1 k p k s p ψ a e k s e α ψ a e e α p p ψ a e where k s is coefficient of permeability at full saturation α is de saturation coefficient and ψ a e is air entry value for a fully saturated soil α is set as zero the values of these parameters for several soil types are listed in the following table 1 the objective of this study is to include the aforementioned dynamic soil permeability into the existing model for the wave induced soil response in a porous seabed based on the new model a parametric study was conducted to examine the effects of dynamic soil permeability on the wave induced soil response in a porous seabed 2 theoretical model consider a soil matrix with a finite thickness h in a sandy seabed under wave loading as shown in fig 1 the wave crests are assumed to propagate in the positive x direction while the z direction is positive upward from the water soil interface termed as the seabed surface for the problem of wave soil interaction 2 1 governing equations based on conservation of mass biot s consolidation model biot 1941 has been commonly used as the governing equation for porous flow in a porous seabed i e 2 k p γ w n β p t γ w ϵ t where k is soil permeability p is pore water pressures γ w denotes the unit weight of pore water n is soil porosity and t is the time the volume strain ϵ and compressibility of pore fluid β are defined as 3 ϵ u x w z and β 1 k w 0 1 s r p a b s where u and w are the soil displacements in the x and z direction respectively k w 0 is the bulk modulus of pore water taken as 1 95 1 0 9 n m 2 s r is the degree of saturation and p a b s is the absolute water pressure extending 2 the storage equation becomes 4 k 2 p k p γ w n β p t γ w ϵ t substituting the expression of dynamic soil permeability into 4 the modified storage equation can be expressed as 5 k 2 p α k p x 2 p z 2 γ w n β p t γ w ϵ t the application background of 1 mainly involves the soil water retention curve for unsaturated soils in which the capillarity may be neglected hayek 2018 basically capillary finger is used for the coastal aquifer to represent the unsaturated layer rather than a sharp boundary at the free surface of groundwater the biot s consolidation equation 2 can be used for an unsaturated seabed when the degree of saturation is greater than 0 90 pietruszczak and pande 1996 the main objective of this study is to explore the influence of dynamic soil permeability on the wave induced soil response as the first approximation 1 is used in this study and more complicated functions can be used in the proposed model with further validation when considering a constant soil permeability the second term on the left hand side of 5 will vanish then 5 will becomes the conventional consolidation equation with constant soil permeability 34 for a fully saturated seabed α 0 the second term on the left hand side of 5 will vanish too for the effective stress concept and hooke s law based on conservation of momentum the force balance equilibrium within the seabed can be expressed as 6 σ x x τ x z z p x τ x z x σ z z p z where σ x and σ z are effective normal stresses in the x and z directions respectively and τ x z is the shear stresses under the plane strain conditions the relationship between stresses and soil displacements can be expressed as 7 σ x 2 g u x μ 1 2 μ ϵ σ z 2 g w z μ 1 2 μ ϵ τ x z g u z w x where g is shear modulus of soil which is related to poisson s ratio μ and young s modulus e as g e 2 1 μ substituting 7 into

boundary conditions are set in both side as reported in ye and jeng 2012 such a computational domain is sufficient for the concerned region at the middle of the computational domain additionally the submarine pipeline is simulated as a rigid impermeable object in which the no flow boundary condition is applied at its surface 14 p w n 0 where n represents the direction normal to the surface of the submarine pipeline this boundary condition is acceptable for a rigid object located within a porous seabed the wave induced pore pressures and soil displacement can be obtained by solving the

in the literature the present model can only be validated with the reduction form with a constant soil permeability with previous experimental data and numerical model to utilise the newly developed dynamic model to simulate simplified cases with constant soil permeability the air entry value was set to be a big number eg ψ a e 200 kpa in this way the pore pressure will never exceed the air entry value so that the soil permeability lies on the constant value region through the whole simulation process the experimental data for the wave induced pore water pressures around a buried pipeline in a

with comsol as shown in the figure the present model overall agrees with both experimental data and numerical models this confirms the capacity of the present fem model for the case with constant soil permeability although the above validation may not be perfect it is the only way for us to validate the proposed model with dynamic permeability because lack of experimental data it is necessary to conduct some advanced experiments to directly measure the permeability and pore pressures simultaneously even without a structure in the future 3 results and discussions the new contribution of this paper is the inclusion of the dynamic soil permeability in the existing models for wave seabed interactions near a buried pipeline two cases are considered to include both coarse sand seabed and fine sand seabed the coarse sand cases focuses on the presentation of dynamic permeability effects on pore pressure and vertical effective stress in the meantime the fine sand case highlighted the dynamic permeability effects on liquefaction the basic wave and soil properties for these two cases are listed in table 2 3 1 effects of dynamic soil permeability 3 1 1 coarse sand seabed in this section soil permeability for the conventional model and the present model will be compared fig 3 presents the dynamic soil permeability contour diagram and fig 4 illustrates the vertical distributions of soil permeability versus soil depth for various time interval in a sandy bed k s 1 0 3 m s in the contour diagram instead of a homogeneous and constant soil permeability k varies between 0 6 1 0 3 to 2 5 1 0 3 m s in the domain and also changes with time in fig 4 the cut line results of several time intervals t t 0 1 4 1 2 3 4 and 1 are presented together with constant soil permeability which is k k s 1 0 3 m s note that the results presented in the figure is located at the centre of the pipeline at x l 1 2 since the soil permeability is a function of pore water pressures the dynamic soil permeability varies as the time it is found that the maximum permeability occur at wave crests t t 0 1 while the minimum soil permeability occurs at wave troughs t t 1 2 moreover the dynamic soil permeability at t t 1 4 and 3 4 is identical to constant soil permeability because the pore pressure does not exceed the air entry value fig 5 represents the contour distribution of the wave induced pore water pressure around a buried pipeline in a porous seabed for various times both results of dynamic and constant soil permeability are included in the figure as shown in the figure the patterns of pore water pressure distribution with dynamic soil permeability is quite different from that with constant permeability for the case with a constant permeability the pore pressure contour diagram shows an almost symmetry shape while the results with dynamic permeability lost this feature in addition the vertical distribution of pressure from the cut line results located in the pipeline location is plotted as shown in fig 6 the solid lines are from the present model and the dashed lines are the conventional model results with constant soil permeability for all selected time intervals pore pressure curves shift to the right however due to the constrain on the top boundary pore pressure at the water seabed interface remains unchanged between the two models this is the cause of asymmetry from the contour diagram in addition to the wave induced pore water pressures effective normal stress is another key factor in the prediction of the wave induced seabed instability figs 7 and 8 are the contour diagram and vertical distribution diagram of the vertical effective stress both figures show dynamic effects through the whole length however compared with the pore pressure results the difference between the present model and the conventional model constant permeability on the effective stresses is less significant see fig 8 3 1 2 fine sand seabed this section focuses on the dynamic permeability effects on fine sand seabed k s 1 0 4 m s fig 9 shows the permeability contour in the whole seabed domain k varies from 0 24 1 0 4 to 6 5 1 0 4 m s but different from the coarse sand study case the dynamic k only happens on the top region as shown in fig 10 the vertical distribution figure shows that for all selected time intervals beneath the pipeline location permeability remains the level of constant value it is because pore pressure at that region is smaller than the air entry value above the pipeline location permeability varies with its maximum value occurs at wave crests and minimum value occurs at wave trough see fig 10 the contour figure for pore pressure and vertical distribution figure are shown in figs 11 and 12 again the dynamic permeability feature mainly happens on the top reign hence fig 12 b is the zoomed figure focus on top region the solid lines are the dynamic permeability model results and the dashed line plots the conventional model results although the permeability variation only occurs above the pipeline location the pore pressure changes extended to certain depth beneath the pipeline location extended to the level of around half the seabed thickness z h 0 5 below this point the pore pressure differences are difficult to observe see fig 12 furthermore the vertical effective stress results are plotted in contour diagram fig 13 and vertical distribution diagram fig 14 compared to the conventional model with constant permeability the differences on the top region can be observed however similar to the finding with the coarse sand seabed the dynamic permeability effect on pore pressure is more significant then the vertical effective stress 3 2 liquefaction around a buried pipeline the elevation of the wave induced liquefaction around an offshore pipeline is one of main concerns in the design of pipeline project in general the wave induced seabed liquefaction can be determined by zen and yamazaki 1990 15 u e p p b σ 0 where u e is the excess pore pressures p b is the dynamic wave pressure at the seabed surface which is given in 12 and σ 0 is the initial stress based on the above liquefaction criterion the wave induced liquefaction zone is illustrated in fig 15 since the wave induced oscillatory liquefaction occurs near wave troughs only the region near a wave trough is presented in the figure as shown in the figure the predicted liquefied zone by the conventional model with constant permeability is smaller that by the present model with dynamic soil permeability this implies that the previous model somehow under estimate the liquefaction potential 4 conclusions in this study a new concept of dynamic soil permeability was introduced into the conventional model for the wave seabed interactions this is the first model considering the soil permeability as a function of pore water pressures in the field based on numerical examples presented in this paper it is found that dynamic soil permeability has significant influence on both coarse and fine sand seabed the influence is more likely to extend to lower layer in coarse sand circumstance moreover the dynamic permeability has more significant influence on the pore pressure than effective normal stresses lastly the predicted liquefied zone by the present model is larger than that of the conventional model with a constant soil permeability note that the above conclusions are based on the numerical examples presented in this paper since no experimental data for the wave induced soil response with dynamic permeability is available the validation of the proposed model was limited to the special case with a constant permeability it is desire to conduct laboratory experiments to directly measure dynamic permeability and pore water pressure simultaneously furthermore we only considered dynamic soil permeability in this study the proposed model can be further extended to the cases for other parameters acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the griffith university research service team and the use of the high performance computing cluster gowonda to complete

22718,soil permeability is one of key factors in the prediction of the wave induced seabed response which needs to be considered in the design of foundation around marine installations most previous studies in the field treated the soil permeability as a constant or varying in spacial domain although it depends on numerous soil parameters in this study the soil permeability is considered as a function of pore water pressures as reported in the literature with this new feature the governing equations will become non linear differential equations numerical examples demonstrate the considerable influence of dynamic soil permeability on the wave induced pore pressure and effective stresses it is concluded that the conventional model with constant soil permeability under estimates the liquefaction potential keywords dynamic permeability degree of saturation pore water pressures soil response wave loading 1 introduction based on biot s poro elastic theory biot 1941 several classic investigations for the wave induced soil response have been carried out since the 1970s among these yamamoto et al 1978 proposed an exact closed form analytical solution for an isotropic poro elastic and infinite seabed this framework was further extended to three dimensional cases for various wave and soil conditions hsu and jeng 1994 jeng and lin 1997 jeng 2018 liao et al 2018 sui et al 2019 another different approximation boundary layer approximation was proposed by mei and foda 1981 which provided a simple formulations of the wave induced soil response this approximation can provide precise prediction of soil response in fine sand rather than coarse sand as reported in hsu and jeng 1994 a detailed review of previous relevant research can be found in jeng 2003 recently qi et al 2019 reported a series of wave flume tests for the pore water pressure under combined wave and current loading which is the first set of experimental data with wave and current loading available in the literature in their paper the experimental data were also compared with the existing analytical solution and numerical model several numerical models were proposed for soil response around marine infrastructures such as mono piles sui et al 2015 lin et al 2017 offshore pipelines have been extensively used for the transportation of natural oil and gas from offshore platforms and disposal of industrial and municipal waste to ensure the safety of such submarine pipelines coastal engineers have to consider unexpected loads including waves currents anchor dropping and dredging which might cause its instability and decrease its lifespan therefore it is customary to bury the pipeline by trenching and refilling the soil however the cost is relatively high and it is time consuming fredsøe 2016 lots of investigations for wave seabed interactions around a submarine pipeline have been carried out in the past among these numerous laboratory experiments have been conducted to investigate the wave induced seabed response and the stability of submarine pipelines sumer et al 1999 2001 teh et al 2003 zhou et al 2011 sun et al 2019 these experiments indicated that excessive seepage flow and the resulting piping are the major factors in causing the onset of scour beneath the pipeline in addition to physical modelling several numerical models were developed to investigate more complicated wave seabed structure interactions wssi involving a fully buried pipeline in a trenched layer or a multi layered and anisotropic seabed gao et al 2003 gao and wu 2006 zhou et al 2013 guo et al 2019 however there is a major limitation of the above studies which is that the effect of linear or non linear waves was evaluated from the analytical solutions consequently these models could not predict the seabed response around a pipeline that is partly buried or mounted on the seabed recently zhao et al 2014 and lin et al 2016 proposed a fem model to remedy these limitations based on the framework zhao and jeng 2016 considered partially buried pipelines in a trench layer and proposed a design curve of backfill heights for pipeline protection later an intensive study for the wave current induced oscillatory soil response in the vicinity of a partially buried pipeline in a trench layer was carried out duan et al 2017 recently a 3 d model for wave seabed interactions around a submarine pipeline was proposed by liang and jeng 2018 using openfoam all the aforementioned studies have treated the soil permeability as a constant in the entire soil layer in fact soil permeability has been reported to be a function of void ratio e which varies with soil depth z furthermore pore water pressure is another factor that affects the soil permeability gardner 1958 wu and zhang 2009 civan et al 2011 according to gardner 1958 the hydraulic conductivity was expressed as 1 k p k s p ψ a e k s e α ψ a e e α p p ψ a e where k s is coefficient of permeability at full saturation α is de saturation coefficient and ψ a e is air entry value for a fully saturated soil α is set as zero the values of these parameters for several soil types are listed in the following table 1 the objective of this study is to include the aforementioned dynamic soil permeability into the existing model for the wave induced soil response in a porous seabed based on the new model a parametric study was conducted to examine the effects of dynamic soil permeability on the wave induced soil response in a porous seabed 2 theoretical model consider a soil matrix with a finite thickness h in a sandy seabed under wave loading as shown in fig 1 the wave crests are assumed to propagate in the positive x direction while the z direction is positive upward from the water soil interface termed as the seabed surface for the problem of wave soil interaction 2 1 governing equations based on conservation of mass biot s consolidation model biot 1941 has been commonly used as the governing equation for porous flow in a porous seabed i e 2 k p γ w n β p t γ w ϵ t where k is soil permeability p is pore water pressures γ w denotes the unit weight of pore water n is soil porosity and t is the time the volume strain ϵ and compressibility of pore fluid β are defined as 3 ϵ u x w z and β 1 k w 0 1 s r p a b s where u and w are the soil displacements in the x and z direction respectively k w 0 is the bulk modulus of pore water taken as 1 95 1 0 9 n m 2 s r is the degree of saturation and p a b s is the absolute water pressure extending 2 the storage equation becomes 4 k 2 p k p γ w n β p t γ w ϵ t substituting the expression of dynamic soil permeability into 4 the modified storage equation can be expressed as 5 k 2 p α k p x 2 p z 2 γ w n β p t γ w ϵ t the application background of 1 mainly involves the soil water retention curve for unsaturated soils in which the capillarity may be neglected hayek 2018 basically capillary finger is used for the coastal aquifer to represent the unsaturated layer rather than a sharp boundary at the free surface of groundwater the biot s consolidation equation 2 can be used for an unsaturated seabed when the degree of saturation is greater than 0 90 pietruszczak and pande 1996 the main objective of this study is to explore the influence of dynamic soil permeability on the wave induced soil response as the first approximation 1 is used in this study and more complicated functions can be used in the proposed model with further validation when considering a constant soil permeability the second term on the left hand side of 5 will vanish then 5 will becomes the conventional consolidation equation with constant soil permeability 34 for a fully saturated seabed α 0 the second term on the left hand side of 5 will vanish too for the effective stress concept and hooke s law based on conservation of momentum the force balance equilibrium within the seabed can be expressed as 6 σ x x τ x z z p x τ x z x σ z z p z where σ x and σ z are effective normal stresses in the x and z directions respectively and τ x z is the shear stresses under the plane strain conditions the relationship between stresses and soil displacements can be expressed as 7 σ x 2 g u x μ 1 2 μ ϵ σ z 2 g w z μ 1 2 μ ϵ τ x z g u z w x where g is shear modulus of soil which is related to poisson s ratio μ and young s modulus e as g e 2 1 μ substituting 7 into 6 the force balance equilibrium can be re written as 8 g 2 u g 1 2 μ ϵ x p x g 2 w g 1 2 μ ϵ z p z to obtain the wave induced soil response the governing equations 5 and 8 can be solved with appropriated boundary conditions given in the next section once the pore water pressure p and soil displacements u and w are obtained the effective normal stress and shear stress can be further determined by 7 2 2 boundary conditions for a homogeneous soil matrix the wave induced soil response to the exciting wave can be obtained subject to some appropriate boundary conditions at the rigid

22719,specific risks to offshore oil and gas operations manifest in the arctic and other harsh environments such extreme operating conditions can disrupt the offshore infrastructure and cause major accidents posing a great challenge to operators a thorough investigation of past incidents helps to learn lessons to ensure that a recurrence of serious accidents affecting workers and the environment can be prevented the analysis of past incidents is divided into two parts first we offer a statistical analysis of offshore incidents triggered by natural events in the arctic and in similar harsh environments the analysis organised by location cause and type of damage failure mechanisms and consequences is based on data from the world offshore accident database woad second we analyse a selection of accidents that occurred in the recent past in ice prone seas with particular attention to potential deficiencies in safety measures design requirements and design methodologies operations planning and component reliability based on the analysis important lessons were identified which stress the need for further efforts to ensure the safety of workers and of assets and to get all actors involved in offshore operations engaged towards achieving a safer future for the exploitation of oil and gas resources keywords offshore structure incident analysis natural hazard lesson learned safety oil and gas 1 introduction offshore infrastructures for the exploration and extraction of oil and gas are exposed to environmental actions particularly assets operating at higher latitudes considering that the arctic contains some of the world s biggest recoverable hydrocarbon reserves the melting of the sea ice makes the area more and more economically attractive for future exploitation of the oil and gas fields however offshore oil and gas operations in the arctic and sub arctic areas require the management of a number of hazards both environmental and technological hydrocarbons inherently pose an ever present danger of fire and explosion in areas with a harsh climate topside facilities are usually completely enclosed which may allow gas from a leak to accumulate in a confined location and possibly lead to a vapour cloud explosion kaiser 2007 furthermore the fragile environment and extreme weather conditions are the major concerns ogp 2013 offshore operations in the arctic and sub arctic regions need to cope with extremely low temperatures in low temperature regimes precipitation can be abundant and in the form of snow freezing rain sleet or ice pellets visibility can be very limited because of fog darkness or precipitation in harsh environments severe storms with high winds and rough seas occur throughout the year in the north sea for instance wave heights can reach 30 m or more kaiser 2007 harsh environments encompass a variety of atmospheric and marine phenomena such as strong winds high waves and low temperatures bridges et al 2018 icebergs yulmetov et al 2016 and icing dehghani sanij et al 2017a 2017b which by themselves or combined exert significant stresses on the offshore infrastructure which can lead to incidents in europe the offshore safety directive 2013 30 eu establishes the minimum conditions for safe offshore exploration and exploitation of oil and gas with the objective to prevent major accidents or limiting the consequences for human life and health and for the environment the european commission s joint research centre jrc received the mandate from the european commission s directorate general for energy to support the eu member states in the implementation of the directive following the requirements of the directive a european offshore authorities group the euoag of which the jrc is the technical secretariat was established in 2012 within this group the role of the jrc is to identify and exchange good industry and regulatory practices and to facilitate the capacity building of member states competent authorities the jrc has also been involved for over a decade now in the development of methods and tools for the analysis and reduction of the risks of natural hazard triggered technological accidents natech for on and offshore industrial installations including pipelines in this context the jrc performed an analysis of hurricane triggered offshore incidents and found that offshore operations are vulnerable to extreme weather impact the authors analysed in particular the losses suffered by the offshore industry in the gulf of mexico gom due to the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 cruz and krausmann 2008 at high latitudes technological and natural hazards coexist permanently thus posing higher risks to both human life guozheng et al 2016 and the marine environment bellino et al 2013 the north sea and the norwegian sea have a significant history of oil and gas employment the need to reduce the risk for the operators and to protect the fragile environment contributed to the establishment of the highest safety standards in the world however as operations are expected to move further north to arctic waters new challenges and unknowns will come up with respect to new or intensified risks emergency response and mitigation of the consequences of potential incidents arctic council 2009 moreover the global worsening of extreme weather and sea conditions poses a challenge to the future of offshore operations demirbiliek 2010 and suggests that it is not sufficient to be prepared for a recurrence of events that happened in the past the climate in the north atlantic ocean has changed and the strength of storms has grown in recent years gulev and hasse 1999 suggesting that even worse extreme events might occur in the years to come due to climate change hewson and neu 2015 gave an overview of the most important assessments with climate models of the expected climatic changes in the extra tropical atlantic ocean and their impacts on extreme weather events on the neighbouring seas other studies indicate a future rougher maritime climate also in the north sea debernard et al 2002 a recent study has raised concerns regarding the susceptibility of offshore structures and their equipment to natural hazards and claimed that it is evident from past accidents in the offshore process facility that equipment failure risk is strongly dependent on the harsh environmental operating conditions deyab et al 2018 in fact storms and heavy seas can cause intense loading on the structural parts of offshore installations and alongside low temperature ice and poor visibility are promoters and triggers of incidents resulting in fatalities injuries pollution and significant economic losses singh et al 2010 cold environments impose serious stress on workers and may adversely affect both their physical and cognitive performance bea 2002 increasing the probability of both incidents and fatalities guozheng et al 2016 furthermore extreme temperatures wind waves or other external elements may seriously deteriorate the hardware components installed in the facility under analysis leading to an increment of failure likelihood with respect to similar facilities operating in a normal environment gao et al 2010 other studies focused on single safety issues related to operations in harsh environments some authors addressed the issue of equipment winterization highlighting the importance of reliable risk based approaches to evaluate the need for winterization yang et al 2013 and winterization design temperatures sulistiyono et al 2015 gao et al 2010 showed how reliability data collected in more temperate areas cannot be directly used for performance predictions of production facilities in the arctic harsh environment afenyo et al 2017 analysed arctic shipping accident scenarios with bayesian networks aiming to identify the most significant causative factors and help decision making in case of an accident abaei et al 2018 presented a model to evaluate the performance of floating structures in extreme stormy conditions arzaghi et al 2018 address the issue of hydrocarbon contamination in the arctic environment and propose a methodology for ecological risk assessment era of accidental oil spills from subsea pipelines homlong et al 2012 found that the harsh environment strongly affects not only the reliability but also the maintainability of systems by affecting all the elements it depends on resource availability e g men material tool accurate diagnostics correct installation logistic support and accessibility another study landucci et al 2017 relates harsh environments with a higher probability of safety barrier failure and domino effect all stakeholders acknowledge the hazards of the arctic and other harsh environments and associated safety measures are already being incorporated in regulatory frameworks international technical standards and best practices in the industry for example standardized industrial practices see general requirements iso 19900 2013 recommend the development of offshore structural design based on local environmental criteria using information from statistical observations and dedicated standards address the prevention of accidents in cold environments and particularly in the arctic see arctic offshore structures iso 19906 2010 offshore operations in harsh environments are supposed to be performed in compliance with these standards and practices despite these efforts incidents related to environmental triggers keep occurring emsa 2009 this study analyses past offshore incidents triggered by natural events enabling an understanding of why accidents happened their patterns of evolution and criticalities in safety measures and contributing to preventing their recurrence in the future in this context the goal of this study is two fold on the one hand it provides important lessons for conducting offshore operations in harsh environments like the arctic in a safe way by singling out areas that require additional research or simply more investments on the other hand it aims at raising awareness of policy makers for the development of adequate rules ensuring the highest level of safety in the arctic region it also aims to identify areas where future research or policy action is needed previous work on this topic includes the study of kaiser 2007 on energy loss in the offshore energy sector mainly considering loss of production and asset damage accounted for in monetary terms and christou and konstantinidou s work 2012 that provides insights into the main accidents that occurred in offshore oil and gas operations in their work they give an overview of the accident databases available for this sector and provide a brief statistical analysis for a generic review of past accidents including lessons learned from the most destructive accidents that occurred in the sector in this study we first analysed the world offshore accident database woad woad 2013 covering the period 1970 2013 to identify the most vulnerable infrastructure components and the riskiest operations in harsh environmental conditions to better understand the risks associated with expanding offshore activities to the arctic this initial screening was meant to spot the risk factors at a macroscopic level identifying criticalities simply based on the sheer number of records secondly a set of iconic case studies chosen to cover the criticalities identified in the previous step was reviewed highlighting the critical factors that led to past events design operations practice maintenance and planning are discussed with the aim to improve safety avoid major losses and to protect the environment from accidental hydrocarbon pollution this study concerns both process safety which focuses on the prevention and mitigation of events that may result in the release of hazardous materials and subsequent major accidents and on occupational safety which aims at reducing health risks to offshore workers the study concludes with recommendations for filling existing research and policy gaps to achieve higher offshore safety levels 2 methodology 2 1 data source and analysis methodology both qualitative and quantitative data was retrieved from the woad database to allow for each incident a sufficiently accurate depiction of the natural hazard characteristics the infrastructure damage modes and of their consequences as much as it was practicable the woad terminology woad 2013 was used in the analysis so as to enable the comparison with other studies originating from the same source a data set composed of 1085 incidents which were caused or promoted by the effect of natural events was created initially events were selected by filtering the incidents under the woad label equipment cause which lists incident causes according to the woad terminology incident records featuring weather lightning earthquake and volcanic eruption were automatically included in the data set however there were many cases in which this information was unavailable or others in which the natural events played a primary role also when the incidents were labelled under other categories such as exceeding design criteria structural failure fatigue corrosion and foundation problem to overcome this issue the comments field was included in the selection process a keyword based semi automatic screening was performed in the first phase followed by the manual processing of the resulting records records in which the role of natural events was found relevant in either causing or promoting the incident were added to the data set the list of the keywords used includes hurricane typhoon cyclone storm gale fog mist seismic earthquake bad weather wind wave freeze cold and ice information on damage and failure of different types of offshore facilities as well as on hazardous materials releases from these structures was also provided it should be noted however that detailed information on the events was missing for a relevant number of the analysed incidents since the goal of our study is to discuss the risks that are typical of the arctic and sub arctic regions a subset covering only the harsh offshore environments of the arctic and other ice prone seas was isolated from the data set of 1085 incident records comprising 314 events 2 2 arctic and other harsh environments in the context of hydrocarbon extraction alone a wide range of definitions of arctic exists given that each definition introduces variability of the key geographic and physical parameters it is very important for this study to provide a solid definition of harsh environment in this study we analysed the regions where the environmental hazards are similar to those in the arctic in particular those that include at least four of the following elements homlong et al 2012 low atmospheric temperatures with large variations throughout the year high intensity winds product of extratropical cyclones or polar lows foggy conditions and darkness during the winter period atmospheric icing due to the combined effects of precipitation and sea spray waves with high fetch propelled by strong winds iceberg collision hazard and presence of sea ice according to iso 19906 2010 iso 2010 20 regions compose the list of arctic and other cold regions some of them are not necessarily in the arctic geographically but all the regions are subject to similar sea ice iceberg and icing conditions therefore the technology developed and the r d activities related to these areas may be of relevance for the offshore petroleum activities in the arctic seas however the number of records in these areas is quite limited and we decided to extend the analysis to two other areas which also have operative challenges related to extreme weather and cold in addition to the regions reported in iso 19906 2010 iso 2010 the north sea and the norwegian sea were also included in the list of regions concerned in this study table 1 reports the considered regions the main geographic area to which they belong and the presence of incident records with environmental triggers in the dataset on which this analysis is based 3 results of the statistical analysis first the incidents were categorized depending on their severity fig 1 summarizes the number of incidents collected in the dataset by the extent of damage suffered by the structure the woad database has a five class categorization for damage which can be insignificant no damage minor damage significant damage severe damage and total loss using the same classification as described for fig 1 fig 2 shows different charts per geographic area each summarizing the relative number of incidents by damage category in one region the size of each chart is proportional to the number of incidents reported in the respective region note that while fig 2 is meant to provide a visual and illustrative representation of the statistics table a1 can be consulted to complement the illustration with numerical data see annex a the majority of incidents was recorded in the north sea region summing up to 86 of the total number however prudence should be exercised when drawing any conclusions based on the interpretation of these results the 86 share of incidents in the north sea must not be seen as an indicator of an inadequate level of safety in the region the reality is quite the opposite with this region being recognized as a reference when it comes to the regulation control and safety of offshore operations hence when reading these results one must consider 1 the sheer size of the offshore activities in a particular region quantified by the number of operational installations 2 the availability of information coming from a particular region i e the number of events actually reported by the operators an aspect mainly related to the regulatory framework and practices in the different jurisdictions of the region intuitively the number of incidents per category should decrease with an increase in the severity class however this is a pattern which was not observed in our results the reason may be the different regulatory requirements and industry practices in the various regions of this study which can lead to different incident reporting procedures and criteria for example in the north sea area strict regulation together with a long time tradition and solid stance of the operators with respect to the reporting of incidents covering the entire spectrum of severity including near misses in other jurisdictions governed by less restrictive regulatory frameworks operators might not be obliged to report the less relevant events e g in the caspian black sea region there are no incidents categorized as insignificant or minor consequently the ratio between serious and small damage is generally reversed and the number of insignificant and minor incidents is small compared to incidents that are more serious this can partially explain the common belief of some operators who wrongly perceive incidents triggered by environmental actions as extremely rare events with generally serious consequences e g total loss events deaths and extensive pollution however as the result for the north sea area shows low severity incidents have the highest frequency of occurrence 3 1 natural event trigger the main natural hazards affecting offshore operations are extreme meteorological conditions fig 3 summarizes the number of incidents collected in the set by type of natural hazard trigger natural hazard classes were not provided by the woad database and hence were defined in the framework of this study as poor visibility fog lightning storm or bad weather wave current or swell strong wind ice freeze or snow and earthquake or volcano using the same classification as for fig 3 fig 4 shows the relative number of incidents by natural hazard trigger and region the size of each chart is proportional to the number of incidents reported in the respective region while fig 4 provides a visual and illustrative representation of the statistics table a2 complements the illustration with numerical data see annex a in the woad weather related incidents were filed in the category equipment cause under the label weather general moreover the database generally does not provide detailed information regarding the mechanisms by which the adverse meteorological conditions triggered the incident we performed a manual screening of the incidents in an attempt to expose the nature of the natural hazard triggers for those cases in which the incident was unmistakably caused by sea movement and wave action we filed the event in the category wave current or swell for cases in which strong gale or high winds were to blame for the incident we filed the event in the category strong wind otherwise where it was unclear whether sea movement or wind action caused the incident we filed the event in the category storm or bad weather these three categories were by far the most frequent triggering natural hazards together having caused about 90 of the total number of incidents in our data set fig 3 incidents due to bad weather include falling loads collisions capsizing mooring or anchor failures towing accidents and seabed erosion the fourth most frequent trigger of incidents was lightning with 4 of incidents in the dataset given the safety concerns due to lightning the woad database has a specific label for these incidents which is ignition lightning lightning was responsible for fires at vent openings of tanks and for incidents during personnel transport by helicopters it is important to highlight that incidents due to lightning were only reported in the north sea region fig 4 low temperatures are a major factor to consider in case of offshore operations in the northern regions hydrocarbon producing areas which border the arctic are subject to sea ice freezing conditions and drifting icebergs kaiser 2007 incidents related to cold or low temperatures are labelled in the data set as ice freeze or snow their number relative to the size of the data set is however low only 8 recorded occurrences this being an indication that the risk from low temperatures is in most of the cases mitigated through technological and procedural means conversely in some regions of north america ice freeze or snow represent a considerable threat summing up to 15 of the recorded events the most frequent effects of these phenomena are ice floe impingement and malfunctioning caused by ice formation on critical equipment finally the data set featured a few incidents triggered by earthquake or volcano and poor visibility and fog earthquakes represent a peril to any structure fixed to the seabed in close proximity to a fault line or active tectonic region earthquake or volcano triggered five incidents all at fixed structures including three shut downs and two events due to submarine gas eruptions poor visibility and fog with a total of 3 recorded incidents features a mix of collisions and crane accidents 3 2 affected types of offshore structures and operations the number of incidents differs significantly depending on the type of structure and operations affected by a natural event fig 5 reports the distribution of the events by the type of operations ongoing at the time of the incident the woad database has its own classification for operations among those listed in the woad the types of operation that appear in the selected dataset are accommodation construct work unit demobilizing development drilling drilling unknown phase exploration drilling idle loading of liquids mobilizing other production repair work under repair service stacked standby testing transfer unknown dry wet transfer dry transfer wet under construction and well workover using the same classification as for fig 5 fig 6 shows the relative number of incidents by type of affected structure and operation similar to operation types the woad database has its own classification for structure types which are barge not drilling concrete structure drill barge drill ship fpso fsu helicopter offshore duty jacket jackup loading buoy mobile unit not drill pipeline semi submersible submersible and tension leg platform the size of the charts is proportional to the number of incidents that occurred in each structure category fig 6 provides an illustration of the statistics while table a3 in the annex shows the numerical data that complements fig 6 although from fig 5 it may seem that the highest number of incidents occurred during production 78 the combined number of incidents filed under activities associated with drilling operations i e exploration drilling drilling unknown phase and development drilling adds up to 91 events moreover the high number of events 55 that occurred during transfer operations i e transfer wet transfer dry and transfer unknown dry wet shows the relevance of the transportation risk which is often underestimated fig 5 overall the most frequently damaged offshore structures were semi submersible platforms followed by jackets jackups and concrete base structures fig 6 a high number of incidents involved helicopters and loading buoys while other structures were affected to a lesser degree by natural hazards for semi submersibles drilling operations account for the highest number of incident records 68 with a total of about 50 of incidents for this structure type 137 about 23 of the records for semi submersibles relates to incidents that occurred during transfer operations and another 9 during production the second most affected type of mobile structure by the number of records is jackup 42 in this case incidents during transport are the most numerous almost 50 doubling the number of incidents during drilling operations about 25 for fixed structures the two main affected types are steel jackets 47 and concrete structure 25 for these offshore structures more than 75 of the records relate to incidents during production fpso fsu and tlp are two classes of floating structure with an incident distribution similar to that of fixed structures and with a share of incidents in the production category reaching 83 and 75 respectively the structure type named helicopter offshore duty is also numerically relevant with 20 records all helicopter incidents fall under the operation labelled as other 3 3 incident scenarios this section analyses the dynamics of incidents to understand the incident causes and attempts to relate the type of events to the structure types fig 7 depicts the distribution of the incident categories each representing one specific scenario the woad database has its own classification for impact categories and it classifies them under the field main event among all the categories listed in woad under the section main event the ones that actually appear in the dataset are anchor mooring failure breakage or fatigue capsizing overturning toppling collision not offshore units collision offshore units crane accident falling load dropped object fire grounding helicopter accident leakage into hull list uncontrolled inclination loss of buoyancy or sinking other out of position adrift release of fluid or gas towline failure rupture and well problem no blowout using the same classification as for fig 7 fig 8 shows the relative number of incidents by type of affected structure and incident category the size of the charts is proportional to the number of incidents that occurred in each structure category fig 8 provides an illustration of the statistics while table a4 in the annex shows the numerical data that complements fig 8 anchor mooring failure describes incidents that follow the loss of control of the operation due to the snapping of one or more mooring lines it is in absolute the most frequent impact scenario with 49 records fig 7 affecting semi submersible rigs in particular but also drill ships fpso fsus and drill barges fig 8 this result confirms the vulnerability of station keeping systems of mobile drilling rigs operating in difficult environments ogp 2014 the problem of ensuring the reliability of mooring systems continues to be an area of concern falling loads dropped objects is the second most numerous impact category with 46 records this category accounts among others for unsecured objects exposed to the elements e g waves and pushed down to lower decks or to the sea crane incidents and failure of light structural parts e g wind wall lighting although these events rarely result in structural losses they have often had serious consequences for the onboard personnel triggered by high winds or platform rocking falling loads are mostly common at fixed offshore installations i e jackets and concrete structures although they have also been recorded even if to a lesser extent at semi submersible jackup and tension leg platforms the category other includes helicopter incidents and many other unconventional events like incidents during the transport of fixed structures however three serious helicopter accidents with many deaths have been assigned to the category helicopter accidents instead the category other also includes three incidents in which the structure was evacuated fearing an impact with pack ice headed toward the facility as shown in fig 7 a large number of incidents fall into this category breakage or fatigue is a broad category of impacts it features incidents in which one or more components were damaged buckled bent cracked or ripped off mechanical failures are often due to corrosion and fatigue fatigue is structure weakening due to the constant stress exerted on the installation over its life kaiser 2007 in 15 out of the 38 records in this category multiple failures were recorded these include a few cascading events in which the components that were ripped off also collided with other parts damaging them in 11 cases the waves exceeded the design air gap the distance between the underside of the lowest deck and the highest wave crest hitting the deck s bottom ripping away connection bridges or washing on the deck this event category concerns all kind of structures but fixed structures jacket and concrete base semisubmersible platforms loading buoys and jackups have the highest relative incident share for this event category when compared to other structures fig 8 rigs platforms and fpsos may capsize during heavy weather due to design issues or operations failure of primary structural components such as main braces jacket legs deck legs and piles often lead to listing or capsizing of units kaiser 2007 incidents of this kind are collected in the categories capsizing overturning toppling and list uncontrolled inclination which have the highest number of records 7 out of 11 and 4 out of 5 respectively for jackup structures the number of events recorded under the label towline failure is also significant most towline failures occurred during towing operations conducted in stormy weather this type of failure exhibits a particular propensity to cascade into more serious events in other more severe events e g grounding and loss of buoyancy or sinking the towline failure was the initial event that in conjunction with other circumstantial factors and failures evolved to the final aggravated outcome jackup rigs feature a worryingly high number of towline failures and in absolute numbers the most numerous incidents during transport operations semi submersible drill barges and other modus follow in this list it is important to mention that grounding and capsizing overturning toppling are the most common incident scenarios outside the north sea region this is possibly due to the fact that the offshore installations in other regions are more distant from rescuers than those in the north sea in fact remoteness is clearly a factor that can limit the available resources to recover control of a drifting structure collisions are the result of the contact between platforms barges ships or third party objects typically other vessels these events which are collected in two separate categories collision not offshore units and collision offshore units considering both offshore and non offshore vessels are numerous about 10 of the data set and mainly caused by bad weather swells or currents only in one case the collision between a platform and a supply vessel was caused by fog and in a further two cases the rigs collided with sea ice in fact under poor visibility conditions operator errors become more frequent in addition search and rescue operations are dramatically hampered by poor visibility and extreme weather in general release of fluid or gas is the category of events that resulted in spills of liquid pollutant into the sea this category accounts for 18 events about 6 of the data set fixed structures i e jacket and concrete structure are the most susceptible to this type of event followed by other production structures like semi submersibles tlps fpsos and loading buoys the released quantities are extremely variable from a few litres to several hundred cubic meters of hydrocarbons the category named fires is related to fire scenarios seven events were recorded in this category they are either fires that follow hydrocarbon releases or fires at vent openings in particular loading buoys and tension leg platforms show the highest relative occurrence of fires 4 analysis of recent accident case studies our analysis of incidents included in the woad encompasses events recorded over a time span of over 40 years for this reason some of the data is old and the lessons that can be learned might be outdated because previously identified concerns might already have been addressed in order to learn relevant lessons regarding the underlying causes that produce accidents during offshore operations in harsh environments some recent iconic incidents were analysed in more detail these examples are meant to highlight specific safety flaws that are ultimately responsible for accidents but that still need to be fully addressed table 2 summarizes the case studies considered for detailed accident analysis 4 1 ocean vanguard semi submersible 2004 on 14 december 2004 ocean vanguard was performing exploration drilling on the well 6406 3 1 in the norwegian sea when hurricane force winds 80 110 km h and massive waves 10 m pushed the rig about 524 feet 160 m off location after the brakes of two of the eight mooring lines failed almost at the same time woad 2013 consequently the tensioning system collapsed and the submerged part of the drilling riser broke in addition the blow out preventer bop on the sea floor tilted by 6 and the well was lost kvitrud 2014 it was only by chance that the incident did not turn into an environmental disaster an investigation concluded that the springs in the brake cylinder did not function as intended prior to the incident the manufacturer recommended to change the band brake but this had not been done in addition the pawl stopping the mechanism had been installed wrongly and did not work even if nobody was injured and no pollution occurred the incident resulted in a big financial loss because of its potential for a catastrophic outcome this incident represented a landmark event for the norwegian petroleum safety authority psa which subsequently started a systematic process of improving the reliability of anchoring and mooring systems in the norwegian continental shelf as a result a set of new standards was issued aiming at ensuring the integrity of station keeping systems see iso 19901 7 2013 these developments shifted concerns on issues such as recertification and inspection processes and repair traceability of the lines alongside the effectiveness of the system for sharing experiences and training of the crew on the function and maintenance of the anchoring and mooring systems a study of incidents affecting mooring lines was conducted to check the performance of the new standards discovering that the number of failures was still significant kvitrud 2014 these incidents highlight the importance of well planned and well executed procedures to ensure that the station keeping systems stay fully functional during operations and emergency situations 4 2 transocean winner semi submersible 2011 on 25 november 2011 the transocean winner semi submersible which was drilling on the t rex field in the norwegian sea faced the storm berit and was hit by winds exceeding 108 km h and wave heights of 24 m a break in a polyester fibre cable in a mooring line caused the rig to drift 15 20 m off its original position kvitrud 2014 evidence on the line indicated that it had already suffered weakening due to friction with an object e g trawler steel wire subsea installation near the seabed and possibly bending loading effect although the eye of the fibre had been designed to be always lifted above the seabed at all times this goal was not always achieved allowing contact with external objects damaging the rope kvitrud 2014 recommended the use of subsea buoys that keep the fibres from touching the seabed for future installations 4 3 kolskaya jack up rig 2011 on 18 december 2011 the kolskaya jack up rig capsized and sank in the sea of okhotsk in the russian federation while the icebreaker magadan and the tugboat neftegaz 55 were towing it to its new working location woad 2013 the operator decided to ignore the fact that towing in the winter in winter seasonal zones was prohibited according to the safety rules specified by the platform s manufacturer the reason for this violation was haste to conduct drilling operations on a new field as soon as possible in addition to that there was evidence that the hull of the oil rig was in poor condition and had been hastily repaired shortly before towing kolskaya 2012 of the 67 people known to have been aboard kolskaya 14 were rescued and 53 were declared missing or dead the decision taken by the ship owner to tow the rig during the ban on towage period not only highlights a violation of safety practices but it also shows ignorance or underestimation of the risks of natural hazards in addition insufficient safeguarding measures for the towage of the rig as well as the large delay between the termination of towage activities and the launch of rescue operations contributed to the dramatic outcome of this tragedy 4 4 kulluk drill barge 2012 unfortunately the kolskaya lesson was not sufficient for some rig operators to change their practices the following year on 31 december 2012 the drill barge kulluk drifted aground off sitkalidak island in the gulf of alaska woad 2013 it was being towed from captains bay alaska to its winter home in seattle when she encountered a storm four of the crew members on board of the tow vessel aiviq suffered minor injuries as a consequence of the accident on 27 december the tow line failed and aiviq lost control of the barge the following day the engines on board of the aiviq failed while trying to reconnect the tow with the help of the coast guard on 29 december the crew of 18 men was evacuated by the coast guard and the aiviq s engines were repaired on 30 december it was decided to bring the barge to a safe harbour to wait for the end of the storm but the towline parted again on 31 december the coast guard ship alert managed to reconnect the tow but the weather conditions worsened at only three miles from the shore and unable to pull the barge the alert was ordered to release the tow the kulluk then grounded off ocean bay is sitkalidak island despite the 143 000 gallons of diesel oil and 12 000 gallons of other petroleum products present on board there was no trace of environmental damage because of the grounding kulluk s movement south for the winter was at least in part motivated by an effort to avoid state of alaska property taxes on oil and gas extraction equipment according to the investigators this accident was due to shortcomings in the design of a plan with an insufficient margin of safety additionally the investigators added that no regulatory requirements existed for a warranty surveyor to review and approve the tow plan and its components instead the operator had retained warranty surveys on all five previous tows of kulluk and the surveyor approved the tow plan in its entirety ntsb 2015 given how dangerous alaskan waters are and that the aiviq had proven unreliable the company should have introduced some redundancy elements the company requested a metocean study to forecast the weather conditions for the scheduled towing rough weather was predicted with general conditions exceeding those that would allow the aiviq to maintain position with kulluk in tow even with a formal review process involving multiple entities the company ignored the natural hazards and the warnings of the aiviq master starting a risky operation in the worst environmental conditions and thereby putting the life of the drill barge crew in danger ntsb 2015 there was also another issue which regards the rules for inspections of the tow vessel main equipment the engines had failed several times that year and had been repaired by the engine manufacturer prior to the accident the investigators believe that a design flaw of the fuel oil storage tanks may have allowed seawater contamination of the fuel ntsb 2015 the towing gear was only visually inspected without any non destructive testing before the towing operation non destructive testing is not required by the current regulation unless integrity of the equipment is in doubt which is very subjective the towing gear was used in three previous voyages to tow the kulluk two of which encountered bad weather ntsb 2015 4 5 coslinnovator semi submersible 2015 mobile offshore drilling unit coslinnovator was struck by a rogue wave on 30 december 2015 while pursuing well operations at the troll field in the norwegian continental shelf the wave struck the rig on the top side exceeding the design air gap by several meters six windows on the lower deck and eleven on the mezzanine deck were forced inwards kvitrud and løland 2018 while the forward bulkhead of the box girder was deformed the unit suffered extensive damage to cabins and corridors spread over two decks forward on the port side consequently one person died and four were injured psa 2016 at the time of the accident it was not common practice to include horizontal slamming on the topside in the structure analyses even in cases in which a negative air gap was identified consequently the wave windows were not designed to withstand the horizontal force induced by the hit but only to resist hydrostatic pressure this allowed the water to break the windows installed on the lower decks and to flood into the living quarters psa 2016 a number of owner constellations and engineering companies were involved in the design of the structure this complexity caused disagreements and inadequate information flow between the players various air gap calculations existed for coslinnovator some yielding positive air gaps and some negative ones as well as a model test the psa observed that horizontal wave slamming had been disregarded in the design since the analyses by dnv and grenland group gg which showed a negative air gap were not taken into account during design psa 2016 eventually cosl used one of the initial air gap calculation which assessed a positive air gap of only 0 57 m for the design and construction of the unit however the psa investigation psa 2016 highlighted a number of flaws related to the air gap in the design calculations no hull wave interactions were taken into account the significant wave height considered was 0 5 m lower than that used by dnv tests performed after the first design calculations were not considered for the model calibration buoyancy elements added at a later stage of the design were not included the air gap was calculated in relatively few points the calculated air gap was lower than the minimum requirement of 1 5 m set by the norwegian maritime authority this accident highlighted the lack of harmonization among the design procedures of different players and it showed that the resistance to horizontal forces from wave impacts needs to be taken into consideration by designers regulatory bodies and classification societies especially for offshore activities in harsh environments although the rules state that topsides must be dimensioned to resist wave loads if a unit has a negative air gap these rules do not distinguish specifically between vertical and horizontal wave slamming about six months after the incident dnv gl 2016 published a new technical guideline dnvgl otg 13 providing a consistent and updated approach for calculating the air gap and wave load and the norwegian authorities demanded compliance with the dnv gl guidelines by november 1 2016 recently kvitrud and løland 2018 analysed 29 similar wave in deck incidents on board of 17 platforms in norwegian waters considering the interval 2000 2017 the platforms air gaps were recalculated according to the dnv gl guidelines revealing that many of the mobile platforms had negative air gaps in a 10 2 annual probability range most mobile platforms have already implemented major changes to increase their resistance to wave actions the authors suggest a number of structural and operational precautions aimed to reduce the risks to both the platform and its crew in storm conditions kvitrud and løland 2018 4 6 gunashli platform no 10 2015 on 4 december 2015 a fire broke out at platform no 10 in service since 1984 at the western section of the gunashli oilfield in the azerbaijani section of the caspian sea bagirova 2015 a total of 30 people on board were declared missing 33 were rescued several of whom were hospitalized in this area strong winds are common during the cold season a high pressure subsea pipeline was damaged in a heavy storm there was an explosion of the gas escaping from it and a fire broke out the high pressure gas pipeline simply could not endure the wave impact forces the region was battered by some of the worst weather seen in years with 12 m waves reported in the area around the platform in addition another incident occurred that day in the same area where three workers went missing from a second offshore oil platform production platform no 501 at the oil rocks oil field in the caspian sea after an accident triggered by the same storm azvision 2015 the offshore workers union published a detailed report of the accident owrpo pu 2016 because of the fire the platform partially collapsed and 28 oil and gas wells where shut the crew started evacuation procedures and got into the lifeboats the vessels were lowered on cables to about 10 m above sea level when it was decided not to drop them into the water to avoid them being dashed against the platform by the storm due to the strong wind and waves the hook of one of the lifeboats opened up while it was descending from the platform the lifeboat with 34 people on board hit piles of the platform and then fell into the sea the management of the emergency was heavily criticized owrpo pu 2016 procedures required the crew to be evacuated on lifeboats which meant certain death given the stormy conditions at that time according to the critics a safer alternative would have been to wait for rescue or for the storm to reduce violence in the residential section of the platform owrpo pu 2016 critics contend that the aging condition of the gunashli field s facilities poses a serious safety risk fourteen workers died in the accidents on socar s oil and gas platforms in 2014 on 26 september 2016 gunashli platform 19 suffered a gas leak and fire caused by bad weather while on 15 december 2016 a 150 m section of a scaffold bridge and an accommodation unit collapsed into the sea due to high winds part of this structure built in 1978 last underwent repairs six months prior to the accident marex 2018 in the accident ten workers went missing but only the body of one worker was recovered 5 lessons learned and recommendations harsh environmental conditions and extreme weather events accelerate the ageing of offshore infrastructure and enhance fatigue while on the other hand providing frequent high load stress during storms when an incident occurs the response and recovery from oil spills are challenging under any circumstance but it is even more critical in harsh environments particularly in the artic where people and animals depend on this unique ecosystem to survive it is therefore crucial to learn from past incidents to prevent their recurrence based on the analysis carried out in this study which identified persisting problems not yet fully solved the following summarizes lessons and associated recommendations for improving offshore safety in harsh environments station keeping systems are vulnerable to extreme weather about 60 of the offshore mooring line failures on the norwegian continental shelf from 2010 to 2014 occurred in heavy weather conditions with winds gusting from 50 to 110 km h and significant wave heights up to 10 m this was mainly due to the loss in the reliability of the mooring or anchor system caused by wear corrosion driven fatigue bending twisting of line overloading and or mechanical damage caused by friction with third objects since a number of concurrent factors such as insufficient design criteria only adequate for short return period natural hazards wrong operations and poor manufacturing are responsible for the continuing failures it is important to raise the attention of the industry to improving the reliability of station keeping systems this target can be achieved by implementing better procedures for the inspection repair and substitution of weakened parts and to ensure that their performance does not deteriorate with time kvitrud 2014 for instance suggests to improve material selection and fabrication protect against mechanical damage and corrosion enhance maintenance and inspection and to check limit states als abnormal accidental limit state fls fatigue limit state uls ultimate limit state there is too much variety amongst available design methodologies depending on the method chosen for the design of components systems or structures by various manufacturers the final facility may ultimately be more or less resistant to environmental effects an example is the coslinnovator case where an inappropriate method was applied for the calculation of the air gap the use of unsuitable methods may result in the underestimation of critical rig features design calculations should be verified by using different calculation methods and builders should rely on the result that returns the most conservative configuration transport operations are vulnerable to extreme weather the number of incidents during the transport of oil rigs during storms is significant indicating that this risk is severely underestimated unlike in structural design contingency management decisions such as scheduling transport operations seldom undergo reviews based on risk assessment despite the availability of specific methodologies abbassi et al 2017 this constantly puts the lives of the crew and the integrity of the facilities at risk as documented by the kolskaya s the kulluk s and other accidents businesses frequently overlook environmental hazards when facilities are outside their intended design environment and when decisions are taken on economic grounds transport planning should seriously take into consideration the hazards due to harsh weather and awareness of this risk needs to be raised to improve the safety culture emergency management should take natural hazards into consideration emergency management plays a decisive role in preventing major losses and protecting crew members in case of an accident planning for emergencies requires consideration of the possible extreme natural events at the operation site to be effective in every circumstance this is also generally valid every time a natural hazard affects technological systems and generates natech accidents necci et al 2018 highlighted that emergency procedures were generally found to be deficient to respond to natech accidents effectively and were subsequently updated to account for natural events this lesson is even more important for offshore operations in harsh environments where the remote location of some facilities can hamper the response even more in addition when natural hazards are not properly considered in emergency planning procedures can potentially exacerbate the gravity of an accident instead of mitigating it for example if procedures had successfully accounted for natural events the crew of the gunashli platform might have stayed on the platform in a temporary refuge waiting for rescue instead of being on the half lowered lifeboat which eventually cost some of them their lives it is thus recommended that emergency procedures are periodically reviewed and tested and that extreme natural events such as stormy weather are included as possible scenarios for emergency management planning ultimate decision power in multi entity decision making a decision on undertaking a risky procedure such as a towing may only be formally affected by the review of all the entities involved eventually there is one party with the ultimate power of approving the decision in the face of obvious risks this situation might encourage risk taking behaviour when a party has an interest in favour of the outcome with the higher risks this was the case in the kulluk accident where the company forced its decision to conduct towing regardless of the necessary review process given the risks associated with towing in that time of the year we recommend that all the parties involved in a multi entity review process be entitled to veto the decision if a party judges the risks as unacceptably high evacuation of non critical personnel should be performed if possible when extraordinary events are foreseen many national offshore safety rules require that most types of work should be stopped when storms are approaching however this is not always observed putting lives unnecessarily at risk when the gunashli accident occurred there were extra workers on the platform of the 63 people on the rig when the fire began 15 were members of a construction and drilling team companies should have considered keeping only a minimum critical crew on the rig while evacuating the non critical personnel in preparation for the storm corrosion wear and aging are serious risks low temperatures and water salinity increase the rate at which the structures age effectively reducing the operative life of components karadeniz 2001 risks increase very quickly in marine environments when fatigue and corrosion are not coped with in due time dong and frangopol 2015 frequent storms can increase the wear of structural components which in turn lose their resistance rather quickly a recent study investigated a set of major accidents that occurred in the period 2000 2011 and found that out of 183 accidents 80 44 were maintenance related okoh and haugen 2014 on top of this the worryingly high number of serious accidents that were reported in the last five years in particular in the azerbaijani sector of the caspian sea due to ageing related issues further highlights the importance of maintenance especially for structures subject to severe environmental conditions samarakoon and ratnayake 2015 for this reason the need to keep all the components in optimal operative conditions is paramount in harsh environments even if this implies that operators have to make an extra effort to better preserve components or even to replace entire facilities worst case scenarios may be exceeded contingency planners generally formulate worst case scenarios with regard to natural events it is the maximum critical intensity of an action that may be reasonably expected to occur when planning for emergency response under natural hazard loading safety officers should always take into account that the worst case scenarios may be exceeded by unforeseen catastrophic events this is particularly valid in environments such as the arctic where long periods of darkness low temperatures and limited access due to sea ice would render effective emergency response in case of an accident next to impossible if stronger environmental actions than the design values are forecast safety precautions should be taken kvitrud and løland 2018 in addition frequencies and intensities of extreme events are expected to increase due to climate change debernard et al 2002 met ocean criteria need to be adapted to factor in the possible effects of climate change on offshore design and operations where needed 6 conclusions and outlook this study analysed past incidents of the oil and gas offshore sector which occurred in the arctic and similar harsh environments and can be directly attributed to natural hazard impact the world offshore accident database was analysed to spot the main risks to offshore structures in the arctic a set of past relevant accidents was reviewed highlighting the underlying causes that ultimately produced considerable losses the study collected a set of lessons learned and recommendations for improving the safety of offshore operations in harsh environments this study showed that incidents in the offshore oil and gas industry due to natural hazards are a major problem in particular in harsh environments like the arctic or other ice prone seas the study concluded that incidents caused by natural hazards in the areas studied were frequent and resulted mostly but not always in low consequences the most important incident trigger was bad weather mainly causing loss of station keeping due to high winds and rough seas for floating structures and falling loads due to storms for fixed structures another important conclusion of this work is the high vulnerability to natural events of offshore infrastructure during transfer operations which has resulted in numerous incidents the high number of incidents caused by environmental factors over the last years is a direct consequence of overlooking or underestimating natural hazards during design and operation this is combined with the tendency to keep costs to a minimum such as by extending the operability beyond the design life limits rushing transport operations or delaying inspections and maintenance of vital components in addition some standards design methodologies and procedures were updated only after they had proven inadequate or ineffective when natural hazards of unexpected intensity challenged design assumptions if politics and industry wish to accept the challenges posed by the exploitation of hydrocarbon resources in the arctic and in similar harsh environments further efforts are necessary to ensure that offshore operations in these areas become both safe and economic the arctic is a very fragile environment that is already under scrutiny of the scientific community and the media due to the impacts triggered by climate change darkness low temperatures and limited access would severely complicate mitigating the consequences of a potential offshore incident policy makers and operators must be aware that in case of accidents they would be exposed to fierce criticism from the public with potentially dramatic repercussions on their political future and on investments for this reason they both should set their accident prevention policy toward the goal of achieving zero accidents this study identified a number of research gaps which need to be addressed to reduce the natural hazard risks to offshore infrastructure in harsh environments most importantly we need more knowledge of incident dynamics and consequences as well as assessment tools more detailed and structured loss data is required to better understand the underlying causes of accidents in the arctic regions researchers should aim at the development of an incident database that focuses on harsh environments funding should be allocated to research to improve the level of reliability of components and structures in harsh environments research is needed for developing novel non invasive diagnostic methods which allow the evaluation of the cumulative damage of vital components exposed to recurrent harsh weather responsible for fatigue wear and corrosion phenomena more specific rules and guidelines should be prepared to address the particular challenges associated with offshore operations under the difficult environmental conditions found in the arctic and ice prone seas in general there is a need for improved safety management methodologies able to cope with the interaction of both natural and technological risks and procedures that ensure risk informed decision making furthermore stakeholders need to be aware that with the expansion of offshore operations also the risk of multiple and simultaneous incidents during storms will increase as well as the risks for the arctic environment this phenomenon has already been observed in other parts of the world with a strong storm regime and a high density of offshore infrastructure cruz and krausmann 2008 in addition although a proactive attitude of the industry is required to prevent incidents other actors such as engineering companies manufacturers workers unions authorities and policymakers need to work together to build a safer future for the oil and gas sector in general and in harsh environments in particular appendix table a 1 number of incidents by damage extent rows and geographic location columns table a 1 caspian black sea europe arctic

22719,specific risks to offshore oil and gas operations manifest in the arctic and other harsh environments such extreme operating conditions can disrupt the offshore infrastructure and cause major accidents posing a great challenge to operators a thorough investigation of past incidents helps to learn lessons to ensure that a recurrence of serious accidents affecting workers and the environment can be prevented the analysis of past incidents is divided into two parts first we offer a statistical analysis of offshore incidents triggered by natural events in the arctic and in similar harsh environments the analysis organised by location cause and type of damage failure mechanisms and consequences is based on data from the world offshore accident database woad second we analyse a selection of accidents that occurred in the recent past in ice prone seas with particular attention to potential deficiencies in safety measures design requirements and design methodologies operations planning and component reliability based on the analysis important lessons were identified which stress the need for further efforts to ensure the safety of workers and of assets and to get all actors involved in offshore operations engaged towards achieving a safer future for the exploitation of oil and gas resources keywords offshore structure incident analysis natural hazard lesson learned safety oil and gas 1 introduction offshore infrastructures for the exploration and extraction of oil and gas are exposed to environmental actions particularly assets operating at higher latitudes considering that the arctic contains some of the world s biggest recoverable hydrocarbon reserves the melting of the sea ice makes the area more and more economically attractive for future exploitation of the oil and gas fields however offshore oil and gas operations in the arctic and sub arctic areas require the management of a number of hazards both environmental and technological hydrocarbons inherently pose an ever present danger of fire and explosion in areas with a harsh climate topside facilities are usually completely enclosed which may allow gas from a leak to accumulate in a confined location and possibly lead to a vapour cloud explosion kaiser 2007 furthermore the fragile environment and extreme weather conditions are the major concerns ogp 2013 offshore operations in the arctic and sub arctic regions need to cope with extremely low temperatures in low temperature regimes precipitation can be abundant and in the form of snow freezing rain sleet or ice pellets visibility can be very limited because of fog darkness or precipitation in harsh environments severe storms with high winds and rough seas occur throughout the year in the north sea for instance wave heights can reach 30 m or more kaiser 2007 harsh environments encompass a variety of atmospheric and marine phenomena such as strong winds high waves and low temperatures bridges et al 2018 icebergs yulmetov et al 2016 and icing dehghani sanij et al 2017a 2017b which by themselves or combined exert significant stresses on the offshore infrastructure which can lead to incidents in europe the offshore safety directive 2013 30 eu establishes the minimum conditions for safe offshore exploration and exploitation of oil and gas with the objective to prevent major accidents or limiting the consequences for human life and health and for the environment the european commission s joint research centre jrc received the mandate from the european commission s directorate general for energy to support the eu member states in the implementation of the directive following the requirements of the directive a european offshore authorities group the euoag of which the jrc is the technical secretariat was established in 2012 within this group the role of the jrc is to identify and exchange good industry and regulatory practices and to facilitate the capacity building of member states competent authorities the jrc has also been involved for over a decade now in the development of methods and tools for the analysis and reduction of the risks of natural hazard triggered technological accidents natech for on and offshore industrial installations including pipelines in this context the jrc performed an analysis of hurricane triggered offshore incidents and found that offshore operations are vulnerable to extreme weather impact the authors analysed in particular the losses suffered by the offshore industry in the gulf of mexico gom due to the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 cruz and krausmann 2008 at high latitudes technological and natural hazards coexist permanently thus posing higher risks to both human life guozheng et al 2016 and the marine environment bellino et al 2013 the north sea and the norwegian sea have a significant history of oil and gas employment the need to reduce the risk for the operators and to protect the fragile environment contributed to the establishment of the highest safety standards in the world however as operations are expected to move further north to arctic waters new challenges and unknowns will come up with respect to new or intensified risks emergency response and mitigation of the consequences of potential incidents arctic council 2009 moreover the global worsening of extreme weather and sea conditions poses a challenge to the future of offshore operations demirbiliek 2010 and suggests that it is not sufficient to be prepared for a recurrence of events that happened in the past the climate in the north atlantic ocean has changed and the strength of storms has grown in recent years gulev and hasse 1999 suggesting that even worse extreme events might occur in the years to come due to climate change hewson and neu 2015 gave an overview of the most important assessments with climate models of the expected climatic changes in the extra tropical atlantic ocean and their impacts on extreme weather events on the neighbouring seas other studies indicate a future rougher maritime climate also in the north sea debernard et al 2002 a recent study has raised concerns regarding the susceptibility of offshore structures and their equipment to natural hazards and claimed that it is evident from past accidents in the offshore process facility that equipment failure risk is strongly dependent on the harsh environmental operating conditions deyab et al 2018 in fact storms and heavy seas can cause intense loading on the structural parts of offshore installations and alongside low temperature ice and poor visibility are promoters and triggers of incidents resulting in fatalities injuries pollution and significant economic losses singh et al 2010 cold environments impose serious stress on workers and may adversely affect both their physical and cognitive performance bea 2002 increasing the probability of both incidents and fatalities guozheng et al 2016 furthermore extreme temperatures wind waves or other external elements may seriously deteriorate the hardware components installed in the facility under analysis leading to an increment of failure likelihood with respect to similar facilities operating in a normal environment gao et al 2010 other studies focused on single safety issues related to operations in harsh environments some authors addressed the issue of equipment winterization highlighting the importance of reliable risk based approaches to evaluate the need for winterization yang et al 2013 and winterization design temperatures sulistiyono et al 2015 gao et al 2010 showed how reliability data collected in more temperate areas cannot be directly used for performance predictions of production facilities in the arctic harsh environment afenyo et al 2017 analysed arctic shipping accident scenarios with bayesian networks aiming to identify the most significant causative factors and help decision making in case of an accident abaei et al 2018 presented a model to evaluate the performance of floating structures in extreme stormy conditions arzaghi et al 2018 address the issue of hydrocarbon contamination in the arctic environment and propose a methodology for ecological risk assessment era of accidental oil spills from subsea pipelines homlong et al 2012 found that the harsh environment strongly affects not only the reliability but also the maintainability of systems by affecting all the elements it depends on resource availability e g men material tool accurate diagnostics correct installation logistic support and accessibility another study landucci et al 2017 relates harsh environments with a higher probability of safety barrier failure and domino effect all stakeholders acknowledge the hazards of the arctic and other harsh environments and associated safety measures are already being incorporated in regulatory frameworks international technical standards and best practices in the industry for example standardized industrial practices see general requirements iso 19900 2013 recommend the development of offshore structural design based on local environmental criteria using information from statistical observations and dedicated standards address the prevention of accidents in cold environments and particularly in the arctic see arctic offshore structures iso 19906 2010 offshore operations in harsh environments are supposed to be performed in compliance with these standards and practices despite these efforts incidents related to environmental triggers keep occurring emsa 2009 this study analyses past offshore incidents triggered by natural events enabling an understanding of why accidents happened their patterns of evolution and criticalities in safety measures and contributing to preventing their recurrence in the future in this context the goal of this study is two fold on the one hand it provides important lessons for conducting offshore operations in harsh environments like the arctic in a safe way by singling out areas that require additional research or simply more investments on the other hand it aims at raising awareness of policy makers for the development of adequate rules ensuring the highest level of safety in the arctic region it also aims to identify areas where future research or policy action is needed previous work on this topic includes the study of kaiser 2007 on energy loss in the offshore energy sector mainly considering loss of production and asset damage accounted for in monetary terms and christou and konstantinidou s work 2012 that provides insights into the main accidents that occurred in offshore oil and gas operations in their work they give an overview of the accident databases available for this sector and provide a brief statistical analysis for a generic review of past accidents including lessons learned from the most destructive accidents that occurred in the sector in this study we first analysed the world offshore accident database woad woad 2013 covering the period 1970 2013 to identify the most vulnerable infrastructure components and the riskiest operations in harsh environmental conditions to better understand the risks associated with expanding offshore activities to the arctic this initial screening was meant to spot the risk factors at a macroscopic level identifying criticalities simply based on the sheer number of records secondly a set of iconic case studies chosen to cover the criticalities identified in the previous step was reviewed highlighting the critical factors that led to past events design operations practice maintenance and planning are discussed with the aim to improve safety avoid major losses and to protect the environment from accidental hydrocarbon pollution this study concerns both process safety which focuses on the prevention and mitigation of events that may result in the release of hazardous materials and subsequent major accidents and on occupational safety which aims at reducing health risks to offshore workers the study concludes with recommendations for filling existing research and policy gaps to achieve higher offshore safety levels 2 methodology 2 1 data source and analysis methodology both qualitative and quantitative data was retrieved from the woad database to allow for each incident a sufficiently accurate depiction of the natural hazard characteristics the infrastructure damage modes and of their consequences as much as it was practicable the woad terminology woad 2013 was used in the analysis so as to enable the comparison with other studies originating from the same source a data set composed of 1085 incidents which were caused or promoted by the effect of natural events was created initially events were selected by filtering the incidents under the woad label equipment cause which lists incident causes according to the woad terminology incident records featuring weather lightning earthquake and volcanic eruption were automatically included in the data set however there were many cases in which this information was unavailable or others in which the natural events played a primary role also when the incidents were labelled under other categories such as exceeding design criteria structural failure fatigue corrosion and foundation problem to overcome this issue the comments field was included in the selection process a keyword based semi automatic screening was performed in the first phase followed by the manual processing of the resulting records records in which the role of natural events was found relevant in either causing or promoting the incident were added to the data set the list of the keywords used includes hurricane typhoon cyclone storm gale fog mist seismic earthquake bad weather wind wave freeze cold and ice information on damage and failure of different types of offshore facilities as well as on hazardous materials releases from these structures was also provided it should be noted however that detailed information on the events was missing for a relevant number of the analysed incidents since the goal of our study is to discuss the risks that are typical of the arctic and sub arctic regions a subset covering only the harsh offshore environments of the arctic and other ice prone seas was isolated from the data set of 1085 incident records comprising 314 events 2 2 arctic and other harsh environments in the context of hydrocarbon extraction alone a wide range of definitions of arctic exists given that each definition introduces variability of the key geographic and physical parameters it is very important for this study to provide a solid definition of harsh environment in this study we analysed the regions where the environmental hazards are similar to those in the arctic in particular those that include at least four of the following elements homlong et al 2012 low atmospheric temperatures with large variations throughout the year high intensity winds product of extratropical cyclones or polar lows foggy conditions and darkness during the winter period atmospheric icing due to the combined effects of precipitation and sea spray waves with high fetch propelled by strong winds iceberg collision hazard and presence of sea ice according to iso 19906 2010 iso 2010 20 regions compose the list of arctic and other cold regions some of them are not necessarily in the arctic geographically but all the regions are subject to similar sea ice iceberg and icing conditions therefore the technology developed and the r d activities related to these areas may be of relevance for the offshore petroleum activities in the arctic seas however the number of records in these areas is quite limited and we decided to extend the analysis to two other areas which also have operative challenges related to extreme weather and cold in addition to the regions reported in iso 19906 2010 iso 2010 the north sea and the norwegian sea were also included in the list of regions concerned in this study table 1 reports the considered regions the main geographic area to which they belong and the presence of incident records with environmental triggers in the dataset on which this analysis is based 3 results of the statistical analysis first the incidents were categorized depending on their severity fig 1 summarizes the number of incidents collected in the dataset by the extent of damage suffered by the structure the woad database has a five class categorization for damage which can be insignificant no damage minor damage significant damage severe damage and total loss using the same classification as described for fig 1 fig 2 shows different charts per geographic area each summarizing the relative number of incidents by damage category in one region the size of each chart is proportional to the number of incidents reported in the respective region note that while fig 2 is meant to provide a visual and illustrative representation of the statistics table a1 can be consulted to complement the illustration with numerical data see annex a the majority of incidents was recorded in the north sea region summing up to 86 of the total number however prudence should be exercised when drawing any conclusions based on the interpretation of these results the 86 share of incidents in the north sea must not be seen as an indicator of an inadequate level of safety in the region the reality is quite the opposite with this region being recognized as a reference when it comes to the regulation control and safety of offshore operations hence when reading these results one must consider 1 the sheer size of the offshore activities in a particular region quantified by the number of operational installations 2 the availability of information coming from a particular region i e the number of events actually reported by the operators an aspect mainly related to the regulatory framework and practices in the different jurisdictions of the region intuitively the number of incidents per category should decrease with an increase in the severity class however this is a pattern which was not observed in our results the reason may be the different regulatory requirements and industry practices in the various regions of this study which can lead to different incident reporting procedures and criteria for example in the north sea area strict regulation together with a long time tradition and solid stance of the operators with respect to the reporting of incidents covering the entire spectrum of severity including near misses in other jurisdictions governed by less restrictive regulatory frameworks operators might not be obliged to report the less relevant events e g in the caspian black sea region there are no incidents categorized as insignificant or minor consequently the ratio between serious and small damage is generally reversed and the number of insignificant and minor incidents is small compared to incidents that are more serious this can partially explain the common belief of some operators who wrongly perceive incidents triggered by environmental actions as extremely rare events with generally serious consequences e g total loss events deaths and extensive pollution however as the result for the north sea area shows low severity incidents have the highest frequency of occurrence 3 1 natural event trigger the main natural hazards affecting offshore operations are extreme meteorological conditions fig 3 summarizes the number of incidents collected in the set by type of natural hazard trigger natural hazard classes were not provided by the woad database and hence were defined in the framework of this study as poor visibility fog lightning storm or bad weather wave current or swell strong wind ice freeze or snow and earthquake or volcano using the same classification as for fig 3 fig 4 shows the relative number of incidents by natural hazard trigger and region the size of each chart is proportional to the number of incidents reported in the respective region while fig 4 provides a visual and illustrative representation of the statistics table a2 complements the illustration with numerical data see annex a in the woad weather related incidents were filed in the category equipment cause under the label weather general moreover the database generally does not provide detailed information regarding the mechanisms by which the adverse meteorological conditions triggered the incident we performed a manual screening of the incidents in an attempt to expose the nature of the natural hazard triggers for those cases in which the incident was unmistakably caused by sea movement and wave action we filed the event in the category wave current or swell for cases in which strong gale or high winds were to blame for the incident we filed the event in the category strong wind otherwise where it was unclear whether sea movement or wind action caused the incident we filed the event in the category storm or bad weather these three categories were by far the most frequent triggering natural hazards together having caused about 90 of the total number of incidents in our data set fig 3 incidents due to bad weather include falling loads collisions capsizing mooring or anchor failures towing accidents and seabed erosion the fourth most frequent trigger of incidents was lightning with 4 of incidents in the dataset given the safety concerns due to lightning the woad database has a specific label for these incidents which is ignition lightning lightning was responsible for fires at vent openings of tanks and for incidents during personnel transport by helicopters it is important to highlight that incidents due to lightning were only reported in the north sea region fig 4 low temperatures are a major factor to consider in case of offshore operations in the northern regions hydrocarbon producing areas which border the arctic are subject to sea ice freezing conditions and drifting icebergs kaiser 2007 incidents related to cold or low temperatures are labelled in the data set as ice freeze or snow their number relative to the size of the data set is however low only 8 recorded occurrences this being an indication that the risk from low temperatures is in most of the cases mitigated through technological and procedural means conversely in some regions of north america ice freeze or snow represent a considerable threat summing up to 15 of the recorded events the most frequent effects of these phenomena are ice floe impingement and malfunctioning caused by ice formation on critical equipment finally the data set featured a few incidents triggered by earthquake or volcano and poor visibility and fog earthquakes represent a peril to any structure fixed to the seabed in close proximity to a fault line or active tectonic region earthquake or volcano triggered five incidents all at fixed structures including three shut downs and two events due to submarine gas eruptions poor visibility and fog with a total of 3 recorded incidents features a mix of collisions and crane accidents 3 2 affected types of offshore structures and operations the number of incidents differs significantly depending on the type of structure and operations affected by a natural event fig 5 reports the distribution of the events by the type of operations ongoing at the time of the incident the woad database has its own classification for operations among those listed in the woad the types of operation that appear in the selected dataset are accommodation construct work unit demobilizing development drilling drilling unknown phase exploration drilling idle loading of liquids mobilizing other production repair work under repair service stacked standby testing transfer unknown dry wet transfer dry transfer wet under construction and well workover using the same classification as for fig 5 fig 6 shows the relative number of incidents by type of affected structure and operation similar to operation types the woad database has its own classification for structure types which are barge not drilling concrete structure drill barge drill ship fpso fsu helicopter offshore duty jacket jackup loading buoy mobile unit not drill pipeline semi submersible submersible and tension leg platform the size of the charts is proportional to the number of incidents that occurred in each structure category fig 6 provides an illustration of the statistics while table a3 in the annex shows the numerical data that complements fig 6 although from fig 5 it may seem that the highest number of incidents occurred during production 78 the combined number of incidents filed under activities associated with drilling operations i e exploration drilling drilling unknown phase and development drilling adds up to 91 events moreover the high number of events 55 that occurred during transfer operations i e transfer wet transfer dry and transfer unknown dry wet shows the relevance of the transportation risk which is often underestimated fig 5 overall the most frequently damaged offshore structures were semi submersible platforms followed by jackets jackups and concrete base structures fig 6 a high number of incidents involved helicopters and loading buoys while other structures were affected to a lesser degree by natural hazards for semi submersibles drilling operations account for the highest number of incident records 68 with a total of about 50 of incidents for this structure type 137 about 23 of the records for semi submersibles relates to incidents that occurred during transfer operations and another 9 during production the second most affected type of mobile structure by the number of records is jackup 42 in this case incidents during transport are the most numerous almost 50 doubling the number of incidents during drilling operations about 25 for fixed structures the two main affected types are steel jackets 47 and concrete structure 25 for these offshore structures more than 75 of the records relate to incidents during production fpso fsu and tlp are two classes of floating structure with an incident distribution similar to that of fixed structures and with a share of incidents in the production category reaching 83 and 75 respectively the structure type named helicopter offshore duty is also numerically relevant with 20 records all helicopter incidents fall under the operation labelled as other 3 3 incident scenarios this section analyses the dynamics of incidents to understand the incident causes and attempts to relate the type of events to the structure types fig 7 depicts the distribution of the incident categories each representing one specific scenario the woad database has its own classification for impact categories and it classifies them under the field main event among all the categories listed in woad under the section main event the ones that actually appear in the dataset are anchor mooring failure breakage or fatigue capsizing overturning toppling collision not offshore units collision offshore units crane accident falling load dropped object fire grounding helicopter accident leakage into hull list uncontrolled inclination loss of buoyancy or sinking other out of position adrift release of fluid or gas towline failure rupture and well problem no blowout using the same classification as for fig 7 fig 8 shows the relative number of incidents by type of affected structure and incident category the size of the charts is proportional to the number of incidents that occurred in each structure category fig 8 provides an illustration of the statistics while table a4 in the annex shows the numerical data that complements fig 8 anchor mooring failure describes incidents that follow the loss of control of the operation due to the snapping of one or more mooring lines it is in absolute the most frequent impact scenario with 49 records fig 7 affecting semi submersible rigs in particular but also drill ships fpso fsus and drill barges fig 8 this result confirms the vulnerability of station keeping systems of mobile drilling rigs operating in difficult environments ogp 2014 the problem of ensuring the reliability of mooring systems continues to be an area of concern falling loads dropped objects is the second most numerous impact category with 46 records this category accounts among others for unsecured objects exposed to the elements e g waves and pushed down to lower decks or to the sea crane incidents and failure of light structural parts e g wind wall lighting although these events rarely result in structural losses they have often had serious consequences for the onboard personnel triggered by high winds or platform rocking falling loads are mostly common at fixed offshore installations i e jackets and concrete structures although they have also been recorded even if to a lesser extent at semi submersible jackup and tension leg platforms the category other includes helicopter incidents and many other unconventional events like incidents during the transport of fixed structures however three serious helicopter accidents with many deaths have been assigned to the category helicopter accidents instead the category other also includes three incidents in which the structure was evacuated fearing an impact with pack ice headed toward the facility as shown in fig 7 a large number of incidents fall into this category breakage or fatigue is a broad category of impacts it features incidents in which one or more components were damaged buckled bent cracked or ripped off mechanical failures are often due to corrosion and fatigue fatigue is structure weakening due to the constant stress exerted on the installation over its life kaiser 2007 in 15 out of the 38 records in this category multiple failures were recorded these include a few cascading events in which the components that were ripped off also collided with other parts damaging them in 11 cases the waves exceeded the design air gap the distance between the underside of the lowest deck and the highest wave crest hitting the deck s bottom ripping away connection bridges or washing on the deck this event category concerns all kind of structures but fixed structures jacket and concrete base semisubmersible platforms loading buoys and jackups have the highest relative incident share for this event category when compared to other structures fig 8 rigs platforms and fpsos may capsize during heavy weather due to design issues or operations failure of primary structural components such as main braces jacket legs deck legs and piles often lead to listing or capsizing of units kaiser 2007 incidents of this kind are collected in the categories capsizing overturning toppling and list uncontrolled inclination which have the highest number of records 7 out of 11 and 4 out of 5 respectively for jackup structures the number of events recorded under the label towline failure is also significant most towline failures occurred during towing operations conducted in stormy weather this type of failure exhibits a particular propensity to cascade into more serious events in other more severe events e g grounding and loss of buoyancy or sinking the towline failure was the initial event that in conjunction with other circumstantial factors and failures evolved to the final aggravated outcome jackup rigs feature a worryingly high number of towline failures and in absolute numbers the most numerous incidents during transport operations semi submersible drill barges and other modus follow in this list it is important to mention that grounding and capsizing overturning toppling are the most common incident scenarios outside the north sea region this is possibly due to the fact that the offshore installations in other regions are more distant from rescuers than those in the north sea in fact remoteness is clearly a factor that can limit the available resources to recover control of a drifting structure collisions are the result of the contact between platforms barges ships or third party objects typically other vessels these events which are collected in two separate categories collision not offshore units and collision offshore units considering both offshore and non offshore vessels are numerous about 10 of the data set and mainly caused by bad weather swells or currents only in one case the collision between a platform and a supply vessel was caused by fog and in a further two cases the rigs collided with sea ice in fact under poor visibility conditions operator errors become more frequent in addition search and rescue operations are dramatically hampered by poor visibility and extreme weather in general release of fluid or gas is the category of events that resulted in spills of liquid pollutant into the sea this category accounts for 18 events about 6 of the data set fixed structures i e jacket and concrete structure are the most susceptible to this type of event followed by other production structures like semi submersibles tlps fpsos and loading buoys the released quantities are extremely variable from a few litres to several hundred cubic meters of hydrocarbons the category named fires is related to fire scenarios seven events were recorded in this category they are either fires that follow hydrocarbon releases or fires at vent openings in particular loading buoys and tension leg platforms show the highest relative occurrence of fires 4 analysis of recent accident case studies our analysis of incidents included in the woad encompasses events recorded over a time span of over 40 years for this reason some of the data is old and the lessons that can be learned might be outdated because previously identified concerns might already have been addressed in order to learn relevant lessons regarding the underlying causes that produce accidents during offshore operations in harsh environments some recent iconic incidents were analysed in more detail these examples are meant to highlight specific safety flaws that are ultimately responsible for accidents but that still need to be fully addressed table 2 summarizes the case studies considered for detailed accident analysis 4 1 ocean vanguard semi submersible 2004 on 14 december 2004 ocean vanguard was performing exploration drilling on the well 6406 3 1 in the norwegian sea when hurricane force winds 80 110 km h and massive waves 10 m pushed the rig about 524 feet 160 m off location after the brakes of two of the eight mooring lines failed almost at the same time woad 2013 consequently the tensioning system collapsed and the submerged part of the drilling riser broke in addition the blow out preventer bop on the sea floor tilted by 6 and the well was lost kvitrud 2014 it was only by chance that the incident did not turn into an environmental disaster an investigation concluded that the springs in the brake cylinder did not function as intended prior to the incident the manufacturer recommended to change the band brake but this had not been done in addition the pawl stopping the mechanism had been installed wrongly and did not work even if nobody was injured and no pollution occurred the incident resulted in a big financial loss because of its potential for a catastrophic outcome this incident represented a landmark event for the norwegian petroleum safety authority psa which subsequently started a systematic process of improving the reliability of anchoring and mooring systems in the norwegian continental shelf as a result a set of new standards was issued aiming at ensuring the integrity of station keeping systems see iso 19901 7 2013 these developments shifted concerns on issues such as recertification and inspection processes and repair traceability of the lines alongside the effectiveness of the system for sharing experiences and training of the crew on the function and maintenance of the anchoring and mooring systems a study of incidents affecting mooring lines was conducted to check the performance of the new standards discovering that the number of failures was still significant kvitrud 2014 these incidents highlight the importance of well planned and well executed procedures to ensure that the station keeping systems stay fully functional during operations and emergency situations 4 2 transocean winner semi submersible 2011 on 25 november 2011 the transocean winner semi submersible which was drilling on the t rex field in the norwegian sea faced the storm berit and was hit by winds exceeding 108 km h and wave heights of 24 m a break in a polyester fibre cable in a mooring line caused the rig to drift 15 20 m off its original position kvitrud 2014 evidence on the line indicated that it had already suffered weakening due to friction with an object e g trawler steel wire subsea installation near the seabed and possibly bending loading effect although the eye of the fibre had been designed to be always lifted above the seabed at all times this goal was not always achieved allowing contact with external objects damaging the rope kvitrud 2014 recommended the use of subsea buoys that keep the fibres from touching the seabed for future installations 4 3 kolskaya jack up rig 2011 on 18 december 2011 the kolskaya jack up rig capsized and sank in the sea of okhotsk in the russian federation while the icebreaker magadan and the tugboat neftegaz 55 were towing it to its new working location woad 2013 the operator decided to ignore the fact that towing in the winter in winter seasonal zones was prohibited according to the safety rules specified by the platform s manufacturer the reason for this violation was haste to conduct drilling operations on a new field as soon as possible in addition to that there was evidence that the hull of the oil rig was in poor condition and had been hastily repaired shortly before towing kolskaya 2012 of the 67 people known to have been aboard kolskaya 14 were rescued and 53 were declared missing or dead the decision taken by the ship owner to tow the rig during the ban on towage period not only highlights a violation of safety practices but it also shows ignorance or underestimation of the risks of natural hazards in addition insufficient safeguarding measures for the towage of the rig as well as the large delay between the termination of towage activities and the launch of rescue operations contributed to the dramatic outcome of this tragedy 4 4 kulluk drill barge 2012 unfortunately the kolskaya lesson was not sufficient for some rig operators to change their practices the following year on 31 december 2012 the drill barge kulluk drifted aground off sitkalidak island in the gulf of alaska woad 2013 it was being towed from captains bay alaska to its winter home in seattle when she encountered a storm four of the crew members on board of the tow vessel aiviq suffered minor injuries as a consequence of the accident on 27 december the tow line failed and aiviq lost control of the barge the following day the engines on board of the aiviq failed while trying to reconnect the tow with the help of the coast guard on 29 december the crew of 18 men was evacuated by the coast guard and the aiviq s engines were repaired on 30 december it was decided to bring the barge to a safe harbour to wait for the end of the storm but the towline parted again on 31 december the coast guard ship alert managed to reconnect the tow but the weather conditions worsened at only three miles from the shore and unable to pull the barge the alert was ordered to release the tow the kulluk then grounded off ocean bay is sitkalidak island despite the 143 000 gallons of diesel oil and 12 000 gallons of other petroleum products present on board there was no trace of environmental damage because of the grounding kulluk s movement south for the winter was at least in part motivated by an effort to avoid state of alaska property taxes on oil and gas extraction equipment according to the investigators this accident was due to shortcomings in the design of a plan with an insufficient margin of safety additionally the investigators added that no regulatory requirements existed for a warranty surveyor to review and approve the tow plan and its components instead the operator had retained warranty surveys on all five previous tows of kulluk and the surveyor approved the tow plan in its entirety ntsb 2015 given how dangerous alaskan waters are and that the aiviq had proven unreliable the company should have introduced some redundancy elements the company requested a metocean study to forecast the weather conditions for the scheduled towing rough weather was predicted with general conditions exceeding those that would allow the aiviq to maintain position with kulluk in tow even with a formal review process involving multiple entities the company ignored the natural hazards and the warnings of the aiviq master starting a risky operation in the worst environmental conditions and thereby putting the life of the drill barge crew in danger ntsb 2015 there was also another issue which regards the rules for inspections of the tow vessel main equipment the engines had failed several times that year and had been repaired by the engine manufacturer prior to the accident the investigators believe that a design flaw of the fuel oil storage tanks may have allowed seawater contamination of the fuel ntsb 2015 the towing gear was only visually inspected without any non destructive testing before the towing operation non destructive testing is not required by the current regulation unless integrity of the equipment is in doubt which is very subjective the towing gear was used in three previous voyages to tow the kulluk two of which encountered bad weather ntsb 2015 4 5 coslinnovator semi submersible 2015 mobile offshore drilling unit coslinnovator was struck by a rogue wave on 30 december 2015 while pursuing well operations at the troll field in the norwegian continental shelf the wave struck the rig on the top side exceeding the design air gap by several meters six windows on the lower deck and eleven on the mezzanine deck were forced inwards kvitrud and løland 2018 while the forward bulkhead of the box girder was deformed the unit suffered extensive damage to cabins and corridors spread over two decks forward on the port side consequently one person died and four were injured psa 2016 at the time of the accident it was not common practice to include horizontal slamming on the topside in the structure analyses even in cases in which a negative air gap was identified consequently the wave windows were not designed to withstand the horizontal force induced by the hit but only to resist hydrostatic pressure this allowed the water to break the windows installed on the lower decks and to flood into the living quarters psa 2016 a number of owner constellations and engineering companies were involved in the design of the structure this complexity caused disagreements and inadequate information flow between the players various air gap calculations existed for coslinnovator some yielding positive air gaps and some negative ones as well as a model test the psa observed that horizontal wave slamming had been disregarded in the design since the analyses by dnv and grenland group gg which showed a negative air gap were not taken into account during design psa 2016 eventually cosl used one of the initial air gap calculation which assessed a positive air gap of only 0 57 m for the design and construction of the unit however the psa investigation psa 2016 highlighted a number of flaws related to the air gap in the design calculations no hull wave interactions were taken into account the significant wave height considered was 0 5 m lower than that used by dnv tests performed after the first design calculations were not considered for the model calibration buoyancy elements added at a later stage of the design were not included the air gap was calculated in relatively few points the calculated air gap was lower than the minimum requirement of 1 5 m set by the norwegian maritime authority this accident highlighted the lack of harmonization among the design procedures of different players and it showed that the resistance to horizontal forces from wave impacts needs to be taken into consideration by designers regulatory bodies and classification societies especially for offshore activities in harsh environments although the rules state that topsides must be dimensioned to resist wave loads if a unit has a negative air gap these rules do not distinguish specifically between vertical and horizontal wave slamming about six months after the incident dnv gl 2016 published a new technical guideline dnvgl otg 13 providing a consistent and updated approach for calculating the air gap and wave load and the norwegian authorities demanded compliance with the dnv gl guidelines by november 1 2016 recently kvitrud and løland 2018 analysed 29 similar wave in deck incidents on board of 17 platforms in norwegian waters considering the interval 2000 2017 the platforms air gaps were recalculated according to the dnv gl guidelines revealing that many of the mobile platforms had negative air gaps in a 10 2 annual probability range most mobile platforms have already implemented major changes to increase their resistance to wave actions the authors suggest a number of structural and operational precautions aimed to reduce the risks to both the platform and its crew in storm conditions kvitrud and løland 2018 4 6 gunashli platform no 10 2015 on 4 december 2015 a fire broke out at platform no 10 in service since 1984 at the western section of the gunashli oilfield in the azerbaijani section of the caspian sea bagirova 2015 a total of 30 people on board were declared missing 33 were rescued several of whom were hospitalized in this area strong winds are common during the cold season a high pressure subsea pipeline was damaged in a heavy storm there was an explosion of the gas escaping from it and a fire broke out the high pressure gas pipeline simply could not endure the wave impact forces the region was battered by some of the worst weather seen in years with 12 m waves reported in the area around the platform in addition another incident occurred that day in the same area where three workers went missing from a second offshore oil platform production platform no 501 at the oil rocks oil field in the caspian sea after an accident triggered by the same storm azvision 2015 the offshore workers union published a detailed report of the accident owrpo pu 2016 because of the fire the platform partially collapsed and 28 oil and gas wells where shut the crew started evacuation procedures and got into the lifeboats the vessels were lowered on cables to about 10 m above sea level when it was decided not to drop them into the water to avoid them being dashed against the platform by the storm due to the strong wind and waves the hook of one of the lifeboats opened up while it was descending from the platform the lifeboat with 34 people on board hit piles of the platform and then fell into the sea the management of the emergency was heavily criticized owrpo pu 2016 procedures required the crew to be evacuated on lifeboats which meant certain death given the stormy conditions at that time according to the critics a safer alternative would have been to wait for rescue or for the storm to reduce violence in the residential section of the platform owrpo pu 2016 critics contend that the aging condition of the gunashli field s facilities poses a serious safety risk fourteen workers died in the accidents on socar s oil and gas platforms in 2014 on 26 september 2016 gunashli platform 19 suffered a gas leak and fire caused by bad weather while on 15 december 2016 a 150 m section of a scaffold bridge and an accommodation unit collapsed into the sea due to high winds part of this structure built in 1978 last underwent repairs six months prior to the accident marex 2018 in the accident ten workers went missing but only the body of one worker was recovered 5 lessons learned and recommendations harsh environmental conditions and extreme weather events accelerate the ageing of offshore infrastructure and enhance fatigue while on the other hand providing frequent high load stress during storms when an incident occurs the response and recovery from oil spills are challenging under any circumstance but it is even more critical in harsh environments particularly in the artic where people and animals depend on this unique ecosystem to survive it is therefore crucial to learn from past incidents to prevent their recurrence based on the analysis carried out in this study which identified persisting problems not yet fully solved the following summarizes lessons and associated recommendations for improving offshore safety in harsh environments station keeping systems are vulnerable to extreme weather about 60 of the offshore mooring line failures on the norwegian continental shelf from 2010 to 2014 occurred in heavy weather conditions with winds gusting from 50 to 110 km h and significant wave heights up to 10 m this was mainly due to the loss in the reliability of the mooring or anchor system caused by wear corrosion driven fatigue bending twisting of line overloading and or mechanical damage caused by friction with third objects since a number of concurrent factors such as insufficient design criteria only adequate for short return period natural hazards wrong operations and poor manufacturing are responsible for the continuing failures it is important to raise the attention of the industry to improving the reliability of station keeping systems this target can be achieved by implementing better procedures for the inspection repair and substitution of weakened parts and to ensure that their performance does not deteriorate with time kvitrud 2014 for instance suggests to improve material selection and fabrication protect against mechanical damage and corrosion enhance maintenance and inspection and to check limit states als abnormal accidental limit state fls fatigue limit state uls ultimate limit state there is too much variety amongst available design methodologies depending on the method chosen for the design of components systems or structures by various manufacturers the final facility may ultimately be more or less resistant to environmental effects an example is the coslinnovator case where an inappropriate method was applied for the calculation of the air gap the use of unsuitable methods may result in the underestimation of critical rig features design calculations should be verified by using different calculation methods and builders should rely on the result that returns the most conservative configuration transport operations are vulnerable to extreme weather the number of incidents during the transport of oil rigs during storms is significant indicating that this risk is severely underestimated unlike in structural design contingency management decisions such as scheduling transport operations seldom undergo reviews based on risk assessment despite the availability of specific methodologies abbassi et al 2017 this constantly puts the lives of the crew and the integrity of the facilities at risk as documented by the kolskaya s the kulluk s and other accidents businesses frequently overlook environmental hazards when facilities are outside their intended design environment and when decisions are taken on economic grounds transport planning should seriously take into consideration the hazards due to harsh weather and awareness of this risk needs to be raised to improve the safety culture emergency management should take natural hazards into consideration emergency management plays a decisive role in preventing major losses and protecting crew members in case of an accident planning for emergencies requires consideration of the possible extreme natural events at the operation site to be effective in every circumstance this is also generally valid every time a natural hazard affects technological systems and generates natech accidents necci et al 2018 highlighted that emergency procedures were generally found to be deficient to respond to natech accidents effectively and were subsequently updated to account for natural events this lesson is even more important for offshore operations in harsh environments where the remote location of some facilities can hamper the response even more in addition when natural hazards are not properly considered in emergency planning procedures can potentially exacerbate the gravity of an accident instead of mitigating it for example if procedures had successfully accounted for natural events the crew of the gunashli platform might have stayed on the platform in a temporary refuge waiting for rescue instead of being on the half lowered lifeboat which eventually cost some of them their lives it is thus recommended that emergency procedures are periodically reviewed and tested and that extreme natural events such as stormy weather are included as possible scenarios for emergency management planning ultimate decision power in multi entity decision making a decision on undertaking a risky procedure such as a towing may only be formally affected by the review of all the entities involved eventually there is one party with the ultimate power of approving the decision in the face of obvious risks this situation might encourage risk taking behaviour when a party has an interest in favour of the outcome with the higher risks this was the case in the kulluk accident where the company forced its decision to conduct towing regardless of the necessary review process given the risks associated with towing in that time of the year we recommend that all the parties involved in a multi entity review process be entitled to veto the decision if a party judges the risks as unacceptably high evacuation of non critical personnel should be performed if possible when extraordinary events are foreseen many national offshore safety rules require that most types of work should be stopped when storms are approaching however this is not always observed putting lives unnecessarily at risk when the gunashli accident occurred there were extra workers on the platform of the 63 people on the rig when the fire began 15 were members of a construction and drilling team companies should have considered keeping only a minimum critical crew on the rig while evacuating the non critical personnel in preparation for the storm corrosion wear and aging are serious risks low temperatures and water salinity increase the rate at which the structures age effectively reducing the operative life of components karadeniz 2001 risks increase very quickly in marine environments when fatigue and corrosion are not coped with in due time dong and frangopol 2015 frequent storms can increase the wear of structural components which in turn lose their resistance rather quickly a recent study investigated a set of major accidents that occurred in the period 2000 2011 and found that out of 183 accidents 80 44 were maintenance related okoh and haugen 2014 on top of this the worryingly high number of serious accidents that were reported in the last five years in particular in the azerbaijani sector of the caspian sea due to ageing related issues further highlights the importance of maintenance especially for structures subject to severe environmental conditions samarakoon and ratnayake 2015 for this reason the need to keep all the components in optimal operative conditions is paramount in harsh environments even if this implies that operators have to make an extra effort to better preserve components or even to replace entire facilities worst case scenarios may be exceeded contingency planners generally formulate worst case scenarios with regard to natural events it is the maximum critical intensity of an action that may be reasonably expected to occur when planning for emergency response under natural hazard loading safety officers should always take into account that the worst case scenarios may be exceeded by unforeseen catastrophic events this is particularly valid in environments such as the arctic where long periods of darkness low temperatures and limited access due to sea ice would render effective emergency response in case of an accident next to impossible if stronger environmental actions than the design values are forecast safety precautions should be taken kvitrud and løland 2018 in addition frequencies and intensities of extreme events are expected to increase due to climate change debernard et al 2002 met ocean criteria need to be adapted to factor in the possible effects of climate change on offshore design and operations where needed 6 conclusions and outlook this study analysed past incidents of the oil and gas offshore sector which occurred in the arctic and similar harsh environments and can be directly attributed to natural hazard impact the world offshore accident database was analysed to spot the main risks to offshore structures in the arctic a set of past relevant accidents was reviewed highlighting the underlying causes that ultimately produced considerable losses the study collected a set of lessons learned and recommendations for improving the safety of offshore operations in harsh environments this study showed that incidents in the offshore oil and gas industry due to natural hazards are a major problem in particular in harsh environments like the arctic or other ice prone seas the study concluded that incidents caused by natural hazards in the areas studied were frequent and resulted mostly but not always in low consequences the most important incident trigger was bad weather mainly causing loss of station keeping due to high winds and rough seas for floating structures and falling loads due to storms for fixed structures another important conclusion of this work is the high vulnerability to natural events of offshore infrastructure during transfer operations which has resulted in numerous incidents the high number of incidents caused by environmental factors over the last years is a direct consequence of overlooking or underestimating natural hazards during design and operation this is combined with the tendency to keep costs to a minimum such as by extending the operability beyond the design life limits rushing transport operations or delaying inspections and maintenance of vital components in addition some standards design methodologies and procedures were updated only after they had proven inadequate or ineffective when natural hazards of unexpected intensity challenged design assumptions if politics and industry wish to accept the challenges posed by the exploitation of hydrocarbon resources in the arctic and in similar harsh environments further efforts are necessary to ensure that offshore operations in these areas become both safe and economic the arctic is a very fragile environment that is already under scrutiny of the scientific community and the media due to the impacts triggered by climate change darkness low temperatures and limited access would severely complicate mitigating the consequences of a potential offshore incident policy makers and operators must be aware that in case of accidents they would be exposed to fierce criticism from the public with potentially dramatic repercussions on their political future and on investments for this reason they both should set their accident prevention policy toward the goal of achieving zero accidents this study identified a number of research gaps which need to be addressed to reduce the natural hazard risks to offshore infrastructure in harsh environments most importantly we need more knowledge of incident dynamics and consequences as well as assessment tools more detailed and structured loss data is required to better understand the underlying causes of accidents in the arctic regions researchers should aim at the development of an incident database that focuses on harsh environments funding should be allocated to research to improve the level of reliability of components and structures in harsh environments research is needed for developing novel non invasive diagnostic methods which allow the evaluation of the cumulative damage of vital components exposed to recurrent harsh weather responsible for fatigue wear and corrosion phenomena more specific rules and guidelines should be prepared to address the particular challenges associated with offshore operations under the difficult environmental conditions found in the arctic and ice prone seas in general there is a need for improved safety management methodologies able to cope with the interaction of both natural and technological risks and procedures that ensure risk informed decision making furthermore stakeholders need to be aware that with the expansion of offshore operations also the risk of multiple and simultaneous incidents during storms will increase as well as the risks for the arctic environment this phenomenon has already been observed in other parts of the world with a strong storm regime and a high density of offshore infrastructure cruz and krausmann 2008 in addition although a proactive attitude of the industry is required to prevent incidents other actors such as engineering companies manufacturers workers unions authorities and policymakers need to work together to build a safer future for the oil and gas sector in general and in harsh environments in particular appendix table a 1 number of incidents by damage extent rows and geographic location columns table a 1 caspian black sea europe arctic
