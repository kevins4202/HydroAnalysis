this study we aim to determine the effects of local environmental control versus spatial dynamics in shaping fish metacommunities by investigating fish compositional structure in perennial and intermittent sites of a mediterranean intermittent river evrotas river southern greece approx 100km during a wet year 2009 that followed two extremely dry years 2007 2008 since fish species were locally extirpated from all intermittent sites during the drought years we hypothesized that during our survey neighboring sites independently of their hydrological regime perennial or intermittent or their local environmental conditions will harbor similar fish assemblages due to the effect of dispersal we also discuss the concepts of the metacommunity theory that best apply in an intermittent non regulated river such as the evrotas river and provide conservation perspectives in a climate change context 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the current study was conducted at the evrotas river which is located in the southern end of the balkan peninsula in southern greece fig 1 the topographical hydrological climatic geological and landscape cover of the evrotas river basin have been described by karaouzas et al 2018 the semiarid climate combined with downwelling and water abstractions result to a highly seasonal flow regime with zero flows prevailing in summer when whole sections of the river are reduced to isolated pools or even dry out completely followed by flood events in autumn and winter skoulikidis et al 2011 during summer some segments located in the upper middle and the lower part of evrotas river that are fed by karstic and alluvial springs display perennial flow about 20 of the main river course length acting as refugia during the drying period the river hosts in total six freshwater species while some euryaline species can enter the lower part of the river vardakas et al 2015 three are endemics of high conservation concern listed in the iucn red list namely the evrotas chub squalius keadicus stephanidis 1971 the spartian minnowroach tropidophoxinellus spartiaticus schmidt ries 1943 and the evrotas minnow pelasgus laconicus kottelat and barbieri 2004 concerning some ecological elements of these endemics the evrotas chub is the largest species among them it can reach a maximum size of 25 cm in total length over 5 years both females and males mature at the second year at about 10 cm sl and the breeding season occurs in mid spring april may the evrotas chub can be characterized as a habitat generalist since it occupies both slow and faster flowing microhabitats vardakas et al 2017 in contrast the spartian minnowroach and the evrotas minnow are less rheophilic species than the chub showing a marked preference for deep habitats with slow flow vardakas et al 2017 they are strongly phytophilic species that depend on vegetation for reproduction foraging and protection from natural enemies the spartian minnowroach can reach about 15 cm in total length while the minnow rarely exceeds 7 cm in length both species are spring spawners two more native fishes occur in the study area which are the critically endangered european eel anguilla anguilla linnaeus 1758 and the freshwater blenny salaria fluviatilis asso 1801 additionally the river hosts one non indigenous species the eastern mosquitofish gambusia holbrooki girard 1859 which has established a reproducing population near the river s estuary finally individuals of the mugilidae family are usually caught in the lower section of the river 2 2 sampling procedures fish samplings were conducted at 12 sites six perennial and six intermittent along the longitudinal axis of the main stem of evrotas river fig 1 during the summer period low flow of 2009 which was a relatively wet year after two extremely dry years 2007 and 2008 see fig 2 while certain segments of the evrotas river dry every year approx 20 of the river the years 2007 and 2008 were exceptionally dry with almost 80 of the river channel length drying out skoulikidis et al 2011 during the drought years the same sections of the river were desiccated sites for this study were defined as perennial or intermittent based on whether they had retained flow or became dry during the 2007 and 2008 drought events in summer 2009 all sites were sampled since there was continuous flow along the entire river length sampling sites were selected based on generic macro habitat representativeness namely all habitats i e riffles runs glides and pools were present as well as accessibility sampling consisted of a single pass of a 100 m river stretch without using a stop net however during every pass sampling was conducted at a river stretch demarcated by physical barriers e g shallow riffles to minimize fish escape in all sampling sessions the same field crew participated to ensure that effort was consistent throughout the surveys a hans grassl gmbh battery powered backpack electrofisher model ig200 2 dc

measured to 5 cm size class intervals and then released alive back to the river for each site a number of local environmental variables known to determine fish environmental niches were recorded specifically physicochemical parameters i e conductivity Œºs cm 1 cond dissolved oxygen mg l 1 do ph and water temperature c t were recorded at three random points in each site in addition habitat parameters i e mean wetted width m ww active channel width m ac mean depth cm d and shadedness sh were recorded at 10 transects in each site 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 environmental and community differences between perennial and intermittent sites to test for environmental and community dissimilarities between perennial and intermittent sites cluster analysis using the grouping average algorithm and anosim statistical analysis were performed clarke 1993 environmental dissimilarity was based on euclidean distance and community dissimilarity was based on bray curtis similarity on squared root abundance data using primer6 clarke and gorley 2006 furthermore each environmental variable was tested between perennial and intermittent sites using the kruskal wallis non parametric test to further test for differences in fish abundances the kruskal wallis non parametric test between perennial and intermittent sites was performed in addition size related differences for small chub 5 cm total length and large chub 5 cm total length roughly corresponding to juveniles and adults respectively between perennial and intermittent sites were tested by the kruskal wallis non parametric test for the much smaller minnow no separate size analysis was conducted since there is a difficulty in distinguishing juveniles and adults in the field 2 3 2 environmental versus spatial control in shaping fish metacommunities to disentangle the effects of environment and spatial controls in shaping fish metacommunities variation partitioning was applied where spatial variables were defined using asymmetric eigenvector map aem analysis blanchet et al 2008 aem is designed to model directional spatial processes all sites were located in the river s main stem and thus they were connected between them only through the one directional water course potentially allowing the dispersal of fish from upstream to downstream sites the result of aem is a set of spatial variables eigenfunctions that represent directional spatial processes i e processes that can be represented by directional arrows in the geographic space and explain spatial distribution of fish from broad to fine scale a site by edge matrix including the connections between sampling sites and flow direction was created and weights to the edges were assigned blanchet et al 2011 weights help model the strength of dispersal between the sites and were generated using the function d d max a where d is the distance between subsequent sites dmax is the maximum distance in the dataset while a could take different values here we tested values of a from 1 3 also tested in previous studies e g blanchet et al 2011 liu et al 2013 and selected a 1 since it yielded the highest adjusted r2 after forward selection 69 explained variation compared to the other a values tested distance was based on the calculated distance from source spatial autocorrelation was tested using moran s i among aem eigenfunctions and both positive and negative autocorrelation was found significant thus in the forward selection procedure the whole set of eigenfunctions was used from the 11 aem eigenfunctions produced aem1 aem4 corresponded to broad scale spatial processes whereas aem 8 aem 11 corresponded to fine scale spatial processes the selected aem eigenfunctions together with the environmental variables were used to perform variation partitioning using partial rda to assess the relative contribution of spatial and environmental factors in driving fish metacommunity variation environmental data were log transformed except for data in proportions that were arcsin transformed prior to use fish data were hellinger transformed and 9999 permutations were used in each test while statistical significance was set at 0 05 level aem analysis was performed in r v 3 3 3 r core team 2017 using the packages aem blanchet et al 2015 vegan v 2 4 2 oksanen et al 2017 and packfor dray et al 2016 3 results 3 1 environmental variations overall the values of the environmental variables measured at the 12 sampling sites indicated low among site variation table 1 environmental variables did not differentiate perennial and intermittent sites anosim r 0 03 p 0 563 nor did they reveal any trend along the longitudinal gradient site number 1 12 from source to outflow respectively fig 3 3 2 fish metacommunity composition a total of 4 606 fish belonging to six freshwater and one euryaline species were captured the mean species richness was 3 75 0 97 with a range from two to five species while total fish abundance ranged from 145 to 804 individuals per site the three endemic fish species were the most abundant and widespread in the study area in both perennial and intermittent sites table 2 the minnowroach was the most abundant species 42 4 of the total catch occurring in 11 out of 12 sites followed by the chub 32 1 occurring in 10 out of 12 sites and the minnow 19 3 occurring in 11 out of 12 sites there was no statistically significant difference between fish abundance in intermittent and perennial sites chi square 0 23 p 0 63 with the total abundance being 2 582 and 2 024 individuals to intermittent sites and perennial sites respectively the same trend was evident when comparing the total abundance of the native fish only chi square 0 41 p 0 52 and each native fish species separately p 0 05 in all cases community composition did not differ between intermittent and perennial sites anosim r 0 035 p 0 617 however sites closer to each other along the longitudinal gradient were more similar fig 4 with one exception a site located in the upper evrotas site 2 in fig 1 where minnowroach was absent the fish communities of the two most downstream sites site 11 and 12 in fig 1 were grouped separately from all the other sites fig 4 since these sites were lacking chubs hosting instead the eastern mosquitofish and mugilidae size differences were not statistically significant for chubs chi square 3 40 p 0 069 and minnowroaches chi square 1 09 p 0 297 between perennial and intermittent sites however most intermittent sites as well as few downstream perennial sites indicated higher percentages of juvenile fish fig 5 3 3 fish metacommunity structure a total of 11 spatial variables were produced following the aem analysis spatial variables that were significant in driving fish community structure were both of broad aem1 and aem2 and of fine aem9 scale broad scale aem variables were able to detect the river gradient from upstream to downstream figs 6 and 7 a from large full circles to large open circles along the longitudinal gradient this gradient was more pronounced in the rda analysis fig 7a where upstream sites presented the most negative rda1 score large full circles while the downstream sites indicated the highest positive rda1 score large open circles towards this gradient fish community structure also shifted from the species found upstream evrotas chub evrotas minnow to the species mainly found downstream eastern mosquitofish mugilidae fig 6 the fine scale aem variable and the only significant environmental variable that described the community structure dissolved oxygen separated the sites along the second axis of the rda figs 6 and 7b the rda2 scores did not represent a specific spatial trend as shown in the mixed full and open circles of various diameter along the longitudinal axis fig 7b overall the spatial structure was more important in explaining metacommunity variations 53 than the environmental variables as the latter explained only 3 of the community variation whereas 16 was explained by the spatial structure of the environmental variables fig 8 4 discussion in this study we explored the hypothesis that contrary to what is reported for most lotic environments spatial dynamics would be the leading factor shaping fish metacommunity in the main stem of an intermittent river our results indicate that spatial factors were more important than environmental ones in explaining fish metacommunity structures in this intermittent river thereby corroborating recent empirical findings falke and fausch 2010 datry et al 2016b the broad scale aem variables detected a strong longitudinal gradient in local community structure regardless of the intermittent or perennial regime of sites this pattern of variation hints a potential underlying mechanism that structures fish metacommunities along an upstream downstream gradient however local stream characteristics such as wetted width depth and temperature were not associated with shifts in community structure only a small percentage 16 indicated a specific spatial trend of environmental factors in our results one possible reason is that along its course the evrotas river is fed by several spring fed karstic springs which may spatially reset environmental conditions during low flow periods creating sections with similar environmental conditions in addition the river has undergone substantial hydromorphological alteration especially during the past 60 years leading to habitat homogeneity in several segments skoulikidis et al 2011 according to the rda analysis the only significant environmental variable that described community structure was dissolved oxygen a highly fluctuating element depending largely on local environmental factors e g flow velocity and temperature and anthropogenic disturbances e g pollution one additional possible reason for the low percentage of variation attributed in environmental factors is that in the current study large scale variables which can be used as a surrogate of environmental conditions in a locality e g distance from source were not included in our analyses er≈ës et al 2012 selecting a priori which environmental variables may have dominant effects on community assembly is quite complex heino et al 2015 this difficulty is common to studies examining the influence of environmental drivers on species distribution and assemblages gilbert and bennett 2010 merow et al 2014 and represents a setback in statistical modeling burnham and anderson 2002 wenger and olden 2012 future studies on fish metacommunities in ires should encompass broader scale variables such as landscape attributes and local hydraulic conditions lamouroux et al 2002 er≈ës et al 2017 according to the metacommunity theory the four concepts i e species sorting mass effects neutral and patch dynamics are not mutually exclusive and communities may in fact be organized by a combination of those processes cottenie 2005 gravel et al 2006 logue et al 2011 both spatially but also temporally er≈ës et al 2012 fernandes et al 2014 sarremejane et al 2017 datry et al 2017 in the evrotas river the intermittent sections dried completely for several months during the summer periods of 2007 and 2008 skoulikidis et al 2011 yet at the time of the 2009 survey all species were present and abundant at all sections we can infer that in 2008 dispersal was a strong constraint on the distribution of species whereas in 2009 dispersal allowed the recolonization of the intermittent sites furthermore in contrast with studies which classify species to dispersion modes based on size e g de bie et al 2012 heino et al 2014 we argue that such classifications for the endemic fish species of evrotas are not applicable here since dispersal in the evrotas is mainly achieved passively during high flow periods when fish are swept downstream colonizing formerly desiccated sections skoulikidis et al 2011 recolonization was a fairly rapid process as within one year after the drought of 2008 fish abundances in the intermittent sections recovered to levels higher than those observed in the perennial sections suggesting that recovery was accomplished mainly via downstream drift of young life stages this is consistent with other studies showing rapid recovery of drought affected fish communities with the rate of recovery being determined by physical factors i e hydrology degree of habitat fragmentation dispersal barriers as well as refugia and the species life history characteristics i e fecundity and dispersal abilities see detenbeck et al 1992 matthews and marsh matthews 2003 mas mart√≠ et al 2010 matthews et al 2013 in the case of the evrotas fishes in the wet phase almost all conditions were favourable for dispersal e g smooth gradient no major dams we consider however the reproductive potential of evrotas fish species to be a dominant reason for the rapid recovery success like most freshwater fish species the endemic species of evrotas produce more offspring than needed for compensating losses that occurred during the drying phase considering the fact that fish densities in the intermittent sites were found to be higher than in the perennial ones it is tempting to suggest that biotic interactions may also play some role relief from competition and predation of the arriving offspring due to the high percentage of juveniles in previously desiccated sites neighboring perennial and intermittent sites harbored similar fish assemblages suggesting a homogenizing effect of dispersal on community structure this pattern suggests the prevalence of a mass effects mechanism through source sink dynamics upon rewetting datry et al 2017 heino et al 2014 dispersal is an important process structuring aquatic communities in both mass effects and species sorting metacommunity models leibold et al 2004 however in the species sorting model dispersal allows species to track differences in environmental conditions and select their preferred habitats niches in the mass effects model dispersal is substantially higher and at such rate that obscures the effects of environmental filtering leibold et al 2004 cottenie 2005 datry et al 2016c eventually under the mass effects model deviations of metacommunity structure from solely environmental control should be gradually observed i e some species to be present in environmentally suboptimal sites the lack of correspondence between local community composition and environmental conditions in the evrotas supports the mass effects model we contend however that the two major metacommunity mechanisms seem to be acting temporarily and sometimes simultaneously on the evrotas fish fauna species sorting acts deterministically to shape local communities according to the local environmental conditions in the perennial sections operating all year round in the intermittent sections species sorting operates interruptedly and due to frequent extirpation events plays a minor role in structuring local communities however species sorting exerts structural control over the entire metacommunity since the perennial sections constitute source habitats that provide colonists to the intermittent sections the second mechanism is dispersal primarily through mass effects dynamics downstream drift passive or active mainly of early developmental stages during the reproductive period is the dominant dispersal mechanism of fishes in riverine systems lechner et al 2016 pavlov and mikheev 2017 the cyprinid species inhabiting the evrotas river are spring spawners and their reproductive season coincides with a period of high flows and increased habitat connectivity economou et al 1999 this life history trait offers many opportunities for downstream drift of eggs and larvae and also for migratory movements of juveniles and adults in the presence of hydrological or other environmental perturbation mass effects may act as a safety valve against temporal or spatial disturbances that cause local extinctions and thereby confer stability to the metacommunity at the basin scale intermittent reaches are quickly recolonized and given sufficient time they may recover to their pre disturbance states magalh√£es et al 2007 matthews et al 2013 following rewetting the importance of dispersal declines while that of species sorting increases however a new dry period can occur before complete recovery leading to the reset of the entire process fish species in mediterranean rivers are assumed to be adapted to high seasonal fluctuations in flows cid et al 2017 however the hydrological variability in these ecosystems is severely increasing favoring the spatial and temporal extension of dry events and reducing habitat availability for river biota jaeger et al 2014 skoulikidis et al 2017 our study emphasizes the need to adopt the

measured to 5 cm size class intervals and then released alive back to the river for each site a number of local environmental variables known to determine fish environmental niches were recorded specifically physicochemical parameters i e conductivity Œºs cm 1 cond dissolved oxygen mg l 1 do ph and water temperature c t were recorded at three random points in each site in addition habitat parameters i e mean wetted width m ww active channel width m ac mean depth cm d and shadedness sh were recorded at 10 transects in each site 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 environmental and community differences between perennial and intermittent sites to test for environmental and community dissimilarities between perennial and intermittent sites cluster analysis using the grouping average algorithm and anosim statistical analysis were performed clarke 1993 environmental dissimilarity was based on euclidean distance and community dissimilarity was based on bray curtis similarity on squared root abundance data using primer6 clarke and gorley 2006 furthermore each environmental variable was tested between perennial and intermittent sites using the kruskal wallis non parametric test to further test for differences in fish abundances the kruskal wallis non parametric test between perennial and intermittent sites was performed in addition size related differences for small chub 5 cm total length and large chub 5 cm total length roughly corresponding to juveniles and adults respectively between perennial and intermittent sites were tested by the kruskal wallis non parametric test for the much smaller minnow no separate size analysis was conducted since there is a difficulty in distinguishing juveniles and adults in the field 2 3 2 environmental versus spatial control in shaping fish metacommunities to disentangle the effects of environment and spatial controls in shaping fish metacommunities variation partitioning was applied where spatial variables were defined using asymmetric eigenvector map aem analysis blanchet et al 2008 aem is designed to model directional spatial processes all sites were located in the river s main stem and thus they were connected between them only through the one directional water course potentially allowing the dispersal of fish from upstream to downstream sites the result of aem is a set of spatial variables eigenfunctions that represent directional spatial processes i e processes that can be represented by directional arrows in the geographic space and explain spatial distribution of fish from broad to fine scale a site by edge matrix including the connections between sampling sites and flow direction was created and weights to the edges were assigned blanchet et al 2011 weights help model the strength of dispersal between the sites and were generated using the function d d max a where d is the distance between subsequent sites dmax is the maximum distance in the dataset while a could take different values here we tested values of a from 1 3 also tested in previous studies e g blanchet et al 2011 liu et al 2013 and selected a 1 since it yielded the highest adjusted r2 after forward selection 69 explained variation compared to the other a values tested distance was based on the calculated distance from source spatial autocorrelation was tested using moran s i among aem eigenfunctions and both positive and negative autocorrelation was found significant thus in the forward selection procedure the whole set of eigenfunctions was used from the 11 aem eigenfunctions produced aem1 aem4 corresponded to broad scale spatial processes whereas aem 8 aem 11 corresponded to fine scale spatial processes the selected aem eigenfunctions together with the environmental variables were used to perform variation partitioning using partial rda to assess the relative contribution of spatial and environmental factors in driving fish metacommunity variation environmental data were log transformed except for data in proportions that were arcsin transformed prior to use fish data were hellinger transformed and 9999 permutations were used in each test while statistical significance was set at 0 05 level aem analysis was performed in r v 3 3 3 r core team 2017 using the packages aem blanchet et al 2015 vegan v 2 4 2 oksanen et al 2017 and packfor dray et al 2016 3 results 3 1 environmental variations overall the values of the environmental variables measured at the 12 sampling sites indicated low among site variation table 1 environmental variables did not differentiate perennial and intermittent sites anosim r 0 03 p 0 563 nor did they reveal any trend along the longitudinal gradient site number 1 12 from source to outflow respectively fig 3 3 2 fish metacommunity composition a total of 4 606 fish belonging to six freshwater and one euryaline species were captured the mean species richness was 3 75 0 97 with a range from two to five species while total fish abundance ranged from 145 to 804 individuals per site the three endemic fish species were the most abundant and widespread in the study area in both perennial and intermittent sites table 2 the minnowroach was the most abundant species 42 4 of the total catch occurring in 11 out of 12 sites followed by the chub 32 1 occurring in 10 out of 12 sites and the minnow 19 3 occurring in 11 out of 12 sites there was no statistically significant difference between fish abundance in intermittent and perennial sites chi square 0 23 p 0 63 with the total abundance being 2 582 and 2 024 individuals to intermittent sites and perennial sites respectively the same trend was evident when comparing the total abundance of the native fish only chi square 0 41 p 0 52 and each native fish species separately p 0 05 in all cases community composition did not differ between intermittent and perennial sites anosim r 0 035 p 0 617 however sites closer to each other along the longitudinal gradient were more similar fig 4 with one exception a site located in the upper evrotas site 2 in fig 1 where minnowroach was absent the fish communities of the two most downstream sites site 11 and 12 in fig 1 were grouped separately from all the other sites fig 4 since these sites were lacking chubs hosting instead the eastern mosquitofish and mugilidae size differences were not statistically significant for chubs chi square 3 40 p 0 069 and minnowroaches chi square 1 09 p 0 297 between perennial and intermittent sites however most intermittent sites as well as few downstream perennial sites indicated higher percentages of juvenile fish fig 5 3 3 fish metacommunity structure a total of 11 spatial variables were produced following the aem analysis spatial variables that were significant in driving fish community structure were both of broad aem1 and aem2 and of fine aem9 scale broad scale aem variables were able to detect the river gradient from upstream to downstream figs 6 and 7 a from large full circles to large open circles along the longitudinal gradient this gradient was more pronounced in the rda analysis fig 7a where upstream sites presented the most negative rda1 score large full circles while the downstream sites indicated the highest positive rda1 score large open circles towards this gradient fish community structure also shifted from the species found upstream evrotas chub evrotas minnow to the species mainly found downstream eastern mosquitofish mugilidae fig 6 the fine scale aem variable and the only significant environmental variable that described the community structure dissolved oxygen separated the sites along the second axis of the rda figs 6 and 7b the rda2 scores did not represent a specific spatial trend as shown in the mixed full and open circles of various diameter along the longitudinal axis fig 7b overall the spatial structure was more important in explaining metacommunity variations 53 than the environmental variables as the latter explained only 3 of the community variation whereas 16 was explained by the spatial structure of the environmental variables fig 8 4 discussion in this study we explored the hypothesis that contrary to what is reported for most lotic environments spatial dynamics would be the leading factor shaping fish metacommunity in the main stem of an intermittent river our results indicate that spatial factors were more important than environmental ones in explaining fish metacommunity structures in this intermittent river thereby corroborating recent empirical findings falke and fausch 2010 datry et al 2016b the broad scale aem variables detected a strong longitudinal gradient in local community structure regardless of the intermittent or perennial regime of sites this pattern of variation hints a potential underlying mechanism that structures fish metacommunities along an upstream downstream gradient however local stream characteristics such as wetted width depth and temperature were not associated with shifts in community structure only a small percentage 16 indicated a specific spatial trend of environmental factors in our results one possible reason is that along its course the evrotas river is fed by several spring fed karstic springs which may spatially reset environmental conditions during low flow periods creating sections with similar environmental conditions in addition the river has undergone substantial hydromorphological alteration especially during the past 60 years leading to habitat homogeneity in several segments skoulikidis et al 2011 according to the rda analysis the only significant environmental variable that described community structure was dissolved oxygen a highly fluctuating element depending largely on local environmental factors e g flow velocity and temperature and anthropogenic disturbances e g pollution one additional possible reason for the low percentage of variation attributed in environmental factors is that in the current study large scale variables which can be used as a surrogate of environmental conditions in a locality e g distance from source were not included in our analyses er≈ës et al 2012 selecting a priori which environmental variables may have dominant effects on community assembly is quite complex heino et al 2015 this difficulty is common to studies examining the influence of environmental drivers on species distribution and assemblages gilbert and bennett 2010 merow et al 2014 and represents a setback in statistical modeling burnham and anderson 2002 wenger and olden 2012 future studies on fish metacommunities in ires should encompass broader scale variables such as landscape attributes and local hydraulic conditions lamouroux et al 2002 er≈ës et al 2017 according to the metacommunity theory the four concepts i e species sorting mass effects neutral and patch dynamics are not mutually exclusive and communities may in fact be organized by a combination of those processes cottenie 2005 gravel et al 2006 logue et al 2011 both spatially but also temporally er≈ës et al 2012 fernandes et al 2014 sarremejane et al 2017 datry et al 2017 in the evrotas river the intermittent sections dried completely for several months during the summer periods of 2007 and 2008 skoulikidis et al 2011 yet at the time of the 2009 survey all species were present and abundant at all sections we can infer that in 2008 dispersal was a strong constraint on the distribution of species whereas in 2009 dispersal allowed the recolonization of the intermittent sites furthermore in contrast with studies which classify species to dispersion modes based on size e g de bie et al 2012 heino et al 2014 we argue that such classifications for the endemic fish species of evrotas are not applicable here since dispersal in the evrotas is mainly achieved passively during high flow periods when fish are swept downstream colonizing formerly desiccated sections skoulikidis et al 2011 recolonization was a fairly rapid process as within one year after the drought of 2008 fish abundances in the intermittent sections recovered to levels higher than those observed in the perennial sections suggesting that recovery was accomplished mainly via downstream drift of young life stages this is consistent with other studies showing rapid recovery of drought affected fish communities with the rate of recovery being determined by physical factors i e hydrology degree of habitat fragmentation dispersal barriers as well as refugia and the species life history characteristics i e fecundity and dispersal abilities see detenbeck et al 1992 matthews and marsh matthews 2003 mas mart√≠ et al 2010 matthews et al 2013 in the case of the evrotas fishes in the wet phase almost all conditions were favourable for dispersal e g smooth gradient no major dams we consider however the reproductive potential of evrotas fish species to be a dominant reason for the rapid recovery success like most freshwater fish species the endemic species of evrotas produce more offspring than needed for compensating losses that occurred during the drying phase considering the fact that fish densities in the intermittent sites were found to be higher than in the perennial ones it is tempting to suggest that biotic interactions may also play some role relief from competition and predation of the arriving offspring due to the high percentage of juveniles in previously desiccated sites neighboring perennial and intermittent sites harbored similar fish assemblages suggesting a homogenizing effect of dispersal on community structure this pattern suggests the prevalence of a mass effects mechanism through source sink dynamics upon rewetting datry et al 2017 heino et al 2014 dispersal is an important process structuring aquatic communities in both mass effects and species sorting metacommunity models leibold et al 2004 however in the species sorting model dispersal allows species to track differences in environmental conditions and select their preferred habitats niches in the mass effects model dispersal is substantially higher and at such rate that obscures the effects of environmental filtering leibold et al 2004 cottenie 2005 datry et al 2016c eventually under the mass effects model deviations of metacommunity structure from solely environmental control should be gradually observed i e some species to be present in environmentally suboptimal sites the lack of correspondence between local community composition and environmental conditions in the evrotas supports the mass effects model we contend however that the two major metacommunity mechanisms seem to be acting temporarily and sometimes simultaneously on the evrotas fish fauna species sorting acts deterministically to shape local communities according to the local environmental conditions in the perennial sections operating all year round in the intermittent sections species sorting operates interruptedly and due to frequent extirpation events plays a minor role in structuring local communities however species sorting exerts structural control over the entire metacommunity since the perennial sections constitute source habitats that provide colonists to the intermittent sections the second mechanism is dispersal primarily through mass effects dynamics downstream drift passive or active mainly of early developmental stages during the reproductive period is the dominant dispersal mechanism of fishes in riverine systems lechner et al 2016 pavlov and mikheev 2017 the cyprinid species inhabiting the evrotas river are spring spawners and their reproductive season coincides with a period of high flows and increased habitat connectivity economou et al 1999 this life history trait offers many opportunities for downstream drift of eggs and larvae and also for migratory movements of juveniles and adults in the presence of hydrological or other environmental perturbation mass effects may act as a safety valve against temporal or spatial disturbances that cause local extinctions and thereby confer stability to the metacommunity at the basin scale intermittent reaches are quickly recolonized and given sufficient time they may recover to their pre disturbance states magalh√£es et al 2007 matthews et al 2013 following rewetting the importance of dispersal declines while that of species sorting increases however a new dry period can occur before complete recovery leading to the reset of the entire process fish species in mediterranean rivers are assumed to be adapted to high seasonal fluctuations in flows cid et al 2017 however the hydrological variability in these ecosystems is severely increasing favoring the spatial and temporal extension of dry events and reducing habitat availability for river biota jaeger et al 2014 skoulikidis et al 2017 our study emphasizes the need to adopt the

1061,as a function of the dominant vegetation cover patterns of variation in the structure and composition of both the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities and their functional feeding groups ffg were examined at pristine streams of two high andean micro catchments of southern ecuador ten sampling segments were defined in the study streams surrounded by either tussock grass tg quinua forest qf

temperature ph and nitrite nitrate concentrations exhibited low values of diversity richness relative abundance of non insects piercer and parasites further high values of relative abundance of plecoptera predators were observed in hmf apparently due to higher water velocities and their resistance to these flow conditions the composition of the macroinvertebrate community showed similarity in tg and qf it was observed at the three study sites a dominance of organisms generally tolerant to lower availability of oxygen chironomidae and non insect class and curiously to higher concentrations of nutrients it was found some taxa associated with the presence of organic matter in the sediment because they use allochthonous resources phylloecus key words andean macroinvertebrates pristine vegetation cover functional feeding groups 1 introduction the ecological and hydrological characteristics of lotic systems are strongly depending on surrounding vegetation

contribution of leaves soil and wood affecting as such benthic composition sponseller et al 2010 i√±iguez armijos et al 2014 indirectly riparian vegetation influences these dynamics of food availability for benthic communities through the processes of microbial decomposition that imply the modification of carbon and dissolved organic nutrients collins et al 2016 in addition density of vegetation canopy influences the amount of solar radiation that reaches the river which determines primary production and as such impacts the development of macroinvertebrates b√ºcker et al 2010

et al 2011 wang et al 2011 herein jacobsen 2004 and madsen et al 2015 found that the number of species of aquatic communities in the andean region increased as elevation decreased a contrasting pattern was however observed in some families of different groups of organisms such as diatoms wang et al 2011 macroinvertebrates jacobsen 2004 and fish albert et al 2011 benthic macroinvertebrate communities perform much of their life cycle in lotic ecosystems and appear to be structured by landscape factors such as land use catchment vegetation cover surface geology and geographic basin factors ding et al 2017 however other studies statzner and beche 2010 rezende et al 2014 vimos lojano et al 2017 indicate that local scale variables e g hydraulic flow substrate types water chemistry riparian vegetation etc seem to play a more prominent role in the structuring of macroinvertebrate communities due to the sensibility of macroinvertebrates to local and regional factors their role for assessing the environmental conditions of aquatic ecosystems has been for long recognised hodkinson and jackson 2005 acosta et al 2009 approximately 80 of the earth s land surface is already modified by anthropic activities resulting in progressively significant impacts on a wide range of ecosystem services at different scales naiman et al 1995 barnett et al 2008 thus today pristine ecosystems considered true natural laboratories for the detection of environmental changes hannah et al 2007 hampel et al 2010 are really scarce globally hereafter they would provide baseline information that could be used in comparative studies with regard to altered ecosystems hodkinson and jackson 2005 bailey et al 2014 some studies have been conducted to assess the effects of climate change on freshwater systems in the northern hemisphere piggott et al 2015 lund et al 2016 however in ecuador the lack of long term meteorological and biological data precludes this type of research with the consequent difficulty for an adequate and sustainable management of land and water resources particularly in current times characterised by a booming of hydroelectricity generation and mining projects being developed in these ecosystems espinosa and rivera 2016 the main objective of this research was examining the patterns of variation in the structure and composition of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities and their functional feeding groups fgg as a function of the characteristics of their habitats i e pristine headwater andean streams thus this research aimed at answering the following research questions i is it possible to find variations in biological variables or ffg or the structure of communities as a function of the native riparian vegetation ii is it possible to discern which environmental conditions are responsible for the patterns observed in the biological variables ffg and macroinvertebrate communities and iii can certain taxa be associated with the dominant type of riparian vegetation the results of this study are likely to contribute to establish a baseline for future research about the impact of local and global anthropic changes on andean ecosystems 2

et al 2010 the second study site the pallcayacu microcatchment fig 1 is located in the upper basin of the paute river which has a surface of about 6 439 km2 its main river reach spans about 120 km from the andean headwaters to the amazon region has an elevation range between 440 and 4 680 m a s l and is divided into 18 sub basins sotomayor et al 2018 the pallcayacu microcatchment has an approximate area of 19 2 km2 and an elevation range varying between 2 520 and 3 620 m a s l the main land uses in the region are agriculture forestry and pasture the main land cover year 2011 in the pallcayacu microcatchment is tropical montane forest tmf 58 agricultural land 18 tussock grass 15 pasture other than tussock grass 4 wetlands 3 and other 2 these two microcatchments were selected to represent the range of environmental heterogeneity in the upper jubones and paute basins respectively precipitation patterns vary across the study regions depending on their geographical position on the andean range in the zhurucay microcatchment the rainy period on average is from january to may with heavier rains in january and february and more dry days between june and december v√°zquez 2010 studholme et al 2017 in the pallcayacu microcatchment the drier season spans from november to february and the peak rainfall occurs in june july studholme et al 2017 three different riparian vegetation types were considered in this study namely pajonal i e tussock grass tg quinua forest qf i e polylepis sp and high montane forest hmf in the tg locations the dominant flora is calamagrostis intermedia whereas the qf locations are dominated by polylepis incana kunth and p reticulata kunth concentrated in riparian banks hmf locations host a high variety of species of trees and shrubs such as styloceras laurifolia buxaceae hedyosmum cumbalense cloranthaceae clusia multiflora clusaiceae cyathea sp cyatheaceae palicourea sp rubiaceae and asteraceae sp 2 2 monitoring environmental variables seven sampling stations 4 at tg and 3 at qf were established within the zhurucay microcatchment whilst three stations at hmf were defined within the pallcayacu microcatchment fig 1 on average tg stations were located at about 3 700 m a s l qf stations at 3 640 m a s l and hmf stations at 2 740 m a s l in every station a 50 m long segment was defined for the monthly collection of biotic and abiotic samples throughout the period august december of 2017 that was chosen with the aim of avoiding as much as possible peak discharge events physical chemical variables were recorded in

substrate of the streambed at each sampling point was determined considering this simplified classification bedrock boulder pebble gravel sand silt aquatic vegetation or the combination of these types according to the guidelines provided by elosegi 2009 2 3 biotic monitoring at each of the 50 m long stream segments six macroinvertebrate samples replicates were collected using a hess cylinder diameter 15 5 cm mesh size 250 microns the six replicates were collected at the most representative habitats run riffle pool the samples were preserved in 10 formaldehyde solution and were washed at the laboratory using a 250 ¬µm sieve the macroinvertebrates were identified at the lowest possible taxonomic level using taxonomic keys of dom√≠nguez et al 2009 after removal of the organisms the remaining sediment was used to measure the weight of organic matter afdw g m 2 according to steinman et al 2011 for determining the chlorophyll a content chl a ¬µg cm 2 three stones were randomly collected from the streambed at each stream segment monthly the periphyton was extracted from the surface of the stones using a brush and the application of distilled water within a standard quadrant 2 2 cm2 the resulting solution was filtered using a vacuum pump with whatman gf f filters diameter 47 mm mesh size 0 7 microns the chl a was determined according to the spectrophotometric method described in steinman et al 2011 2 4 data analysis the correlated environmental variables spearman s r value 0 7 were discarded from the statistical analysis hence 4 were discarded out of the 16 physical chemical variables the density of the taxa for every one of the 50 m long stream segments was defined by averaging the respective densities of the six replicates avoiding as such the effects of microhabitats this was done for all of the sampling campaigns and stream segments these averaged densities were then transformed logarithmically i e log x 1 and were further standardised by dividing them by their mean value the environmental variables with the exception of ph were logarithmically transformed i e log x or log x 1 with the intention of increasing the homogeneity of their variances quinn and keough 2002 the following biological variables bv were calculated total taxa richness richness number of taxa total density density ind m 2 pielou s evenness evenness quinn and

shredder sh scraper sc filtering collector cf piercer pi predator pr and parasite pa previously species that had a relative abundance of less than the 5 of the total sample size were considered as rare and were as such eliminated from the data set to avoid a distortion effect on the statistical results two tests were performed to inspect whether significant differences exist among biological variables and the ffg bv ffg as a function of vegetation cover firstly the kruskal wallis h test k w quinn and keough 2002 was used to define whether the variance of the ranks scores of the bv ffg were significantly different as a function of the vegetation cover secondly in the case that the bv ffg were significantly different the mann whitney u post hoc test m w quinn and keough 2002 was performed for finding out the pairs of vegetation covers i e tg vs qf tg vs hmf and qf vs hmf where the bv ffg were significantly different type 1 error i e rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true was minimised by adjusting p values with the bonferroni correction quinn and keough 2002 and the k w results were inspected through box charts further for the set of bv ffg for which the k w test found significant differences a multiple linear regression model eq 1 among these n bv ffg yj and the m environmental variables xi was developed using the forward step selection procedure quinn and

adj hieber et al 2005 the contribution of each independent xi variable in the statistical model was identified by the value of the beta Œ≤ standardised regression coefficient miles and shevlin 2001 finally the differences among environmental variables selected through the regression models as a function of the predominant vegetation cover were assessed through the application of the k w test and the mann whitney u post hoc tests with the bonferroni correction all of the above depicted statistical analyses were executed with the spss statistical software version 20 imb spss inc armonk new york for studying the relationship of aquatic communities with the environmental variables and with the dominant vegetation cover the detrended correspondence analysis dca was applied which suggested the use of a linear response model redundancy analysis lep≈° and ≈°milauer 2003 the forward automatic selection with bonferroni correction was used to choose environmental variables that have a significant effect on the composition of the community ≈°milauer and lep≈° 2014 these statistical analyses were carried out with the help of the canoco software version 5 ≈°milauer and lep≈° 2014 finally the compositions of the macroinvertebrate communities were compared as function of the predominant vegetation cover through the analysis of similarity anosim that uses the bray curtis measure of similarity further a global goodness of fit statistical value 1 r 1 was obtained r values close to 1 indicate that the majority of the most similar compositions of communities are within the same

selected turb as the variable that is explaining the variation of richness in hmf however non significant differences were obtained for turb as a function of the type of vegetation cover after the bonferroni correction in addition the multiple regression analysis suggested th and ph as variables negatively influencing the diversity in qf and hmf and v positively influencing the diversity in hmf table 3 th v and ph exhibited fig 3 a b c annex b significantly higher values in hmf than in tg and qf furthermore the k w test indicated annex a significant differences p 0 05 between the relative abundance of plecoptera and non insects the m w test annex a fig 2c suggested that the relative abundance of plecoptera was significantly higher in hmf 1 3 than at tg 0 3 and qf 0 2 in contrast the relative abundance of non insect annex a fig 2d was lower in hmf 16 3 as compared to tg 34 4 in this context multiple regression analysis suggested table 3 that v had a positive influence on the relative abundance of plecoptera at tg and hmf while t had negative influence at qf the relative abundance of non insect seemed to be determined negatively by ph at qf and hmf and positively by v at qf and by turb at hmf annex b significantly higher values of t were observed fig 3d annex b at hmf than at tg and qf upon the rda fig 4 illustrates some differences in the composition of the macroinvertebrates community as a function of the studied vegetation covers this was corroborated by the anosim test r 0 64 p 0 001 the greatest community difference was observed among hmf and tg r 0 93 p 0 001 and qf r 0 81 p 0 001 the rda suggested an overlap in terms of the composition of the community between the tg and qf ecosystems similarly to anosim where the low r value 0 26 suggest no composition differences despite of the p value 0 001 forward automatic selection on the explanatory variables revealed that v nitri ni turb and th affected significantly the macroinvertebrate community fig 4 table 4 all of these environmental variables except turb were significantly higher in hmf than in tg and qf annex b table 1 further the first ordering axis reflects a gradient related to these variables leptohyphes mortionella anacroneuria simuliium anchytarsus smicridea are the typical taxa under these conditions in the hmf the first and second axes explained respectively 24 1 and

helobdella phylloecus and heterelmis seemed to be related to the higher afdw depth was higher and seemed to be important in tg and qf in particular for the taxa austrolimnius tanypodinae limneidae chironominae and oxyethira 3 3 relationships among functional feeding groups ffg and dominant vegetation cover with regard to ffg of macroinvertebrates the k w test identified four groups scraper sc piercer pi predator pr and parasite pa varying significantly among the different types of vegetation covers annex a the relative abundance of sc was higher and the relative abundance of pi was lower in hmf than in tg without statistically differing from qf fig 5 a b annex a multiple regression table 3 suggested that the sc were negatively related to the afdw at qf and positively to ph at hmf pi were positively related to afdw at qf and negatively related to the ph at hmf further afdw did not show significant differences as a function of the tree vegetation types annex b the relative abundance of pr was higher fig 5c annex a in hmf than in tg and qf in this respect depth and afdw were selected by the multiple regression analysis table 3 as the environmental variables that negatively influenced this feeding group at tg and qf respectively no significant difference of depth was observed in the three ecosystems annex b finally the relative abundance of pa was significantly lower at hmf fig 5d annex a than at tg and qf multiple regression table 3 suggested that this variable was defined positively by v and ph at tg and negatively by th at hmf 4 discussion the catchment scale spatial distribution of aquatic communities is largely due to the environmental conditions of the habitats associated with the type of vegetation cover and the underlying geology fierro et al 2017 fraaije et al 2019 however factors that intervene in community control exclusively in high tropical andean aquatic ecosystems are still relatively unknown b√ºcker et al 2010 r√≠os touma et al 2011 vimos lojano et al 2018 hereafter the current study focused on examining the catchment and local scale factors that could be relevant for the structure of the community and for the functional feeding groups of macroinvertebrates in two high mountain pristine micro catchments 4 1 relationships among environmental characteristics and dominant vegetation cover the predominance of histosols and tg vegetation in the zhurucay microcatchment mosquera et al 2015 apparently influenced the homogeneity of the physical chemical characteristics of the water in the habitats of tg and qf as compared to the respective characteristics in hmf these physical chemical characteristics in tg and qf resulted similar to those observed by r√≠os touma et al 2011 in the piburja stream p√°ramo located approximately at 315 km to the north of the current study site at about 3 300 m a s l low temperatures are very typical on high mountains kasangaki et al 2008 and in general temperature increases as elevation decreases jacobsen et al 2003 2004 t is among the most significant physical chemical variables for macroinvertebrates in the high mountains miserendino et al 2011 at the present study sites higher t was observed at the lower hmf ecosystem however although this temperature variation was statistically significant apparently did not represent an important factor for macroinvertebrate communities further the effect that tree canopy has on rivers is normally the reduction of water temperature and primary productivity owing to the obstruction of the solar radiation b√ºcker et al 2010 however this study revealed that despite the significant canopy cover difference among arboreal qf and herbaceous tg ecosystems t and primary productivity remained the same suggesting as such that the type of vegetation cover is not very relevant for these variables at these high elevations which differs from what has been observed at lower elevations b√ºcker et al 2010 on the other hand higher turb and tds is the result of increased q and v which was observed in the hmf ecosystem likely as the result of i the greater cumulative rainfall in the pallcayacu as compared to the zhurucay microcatchment and ii the approximately two times higher average slope of the pallcayacu with respect to the zhurucay microcatchment higher nitri ni could be related to more intense rainfall and higher q in rivers surrounded by agriculture or cattle raising monaghan and smith 2012 however the sampling site at the pallcayacu microcatchment was situated at a pristine environment hence this could be attributed to the fact that the forest soil in high altitudes accumulate higher carbon marian et al 2017 and nitrogen stores tashi et al 2016 and are subjected to higher seepage rates they have a greater potential for leaching of nitrate di and cameron 2002 4 2 relationships among biological variables functional feeding groups ffg aquatic communities and dominant vegetation cover the study revealed that v q turb th ph related to the type of vegetation cover b√ºcker et al 2010 i√±iguez armijos et al 2014 and hydro morphological characteristics of the catchment directly affected the composition and structure of the benthic community and the ffg in this context change in ph affects aquatic life indirectly by modifying the dissolved oxygen level of the water the photosynthesis of aquatic organisms phytoplankton and the sensitivity of these organisms to pollution ngodhe et al 2014 prommi and payakka 2015 found direct correlation of richness and diversity to ph as many species favoured slightly alkaline ph in basic habitats the present study also indicated that diversity non insects and several ffg s were sensitive even to the small changes in ph furthermore the flow regime is a critical component in determining aquatic communities bunn and arthington 2002 vimos lojano et al 2018 this study suggested that the pallcayacu microcatchment with higher v exhibited a decrease in the diversity of macroinvertebrates resulting from the associated greater hydraulic stress apparently organisms that are not adapted to strong velocities such as those of the non insect class specifically the oligochaeta james et al 2008 were significantly impacted unlike some taxa i e anacroneuria of the order plecoptera that are characterised by being relatively large and robust tamaris turizo et al 2007 allowing them to be strongly attached to the substrate under higher velocity events tomanov√° and tedesco 2007 in this study a greater number of anacroneuria was found in the hmf streams characterised by higher velocities which matches the results of other studies on similar andean streams sajam√≠ et al 2016 another representative group in the hmf habitats was the genus simulium r√≠os touma et al 2011 pavitra et al 2019 the body structure of which is characterised by an anal ring with rows of hooks that may allow it adhering strongly to the substrate pavitra et al 2019 in general many aquatic ecology studies relate th turb and nitri ni with the impact of land use change on the macroinvertebrate community b√ºcker et al 2010 miserendino et al 2011 however biotic variation in pristine areas is still poorly understood miserendino et al 2011 although the order diptera and the non insect class oligochaetes and hyalella are generally distinctive of pasture zones james et al 2008 these two groups were among the dominant taxa in the current pristine study sites which matches the results of a previous study performed at pristine locations of new zealand mountains olsen et al 2001 and andean streams scheibler et al 2014 the elevation is likely to influence the dominance of diptera and the non insect class since it restricts the variability of the ecosystem to a certain number of taxa mainly resistant to the availability of dissolved oxygen jacobsen et al 2003 and the variability of q mosquera et al 2015 with regard to the order diptera the chironomidae family with a relative abundance of 47 7 presents multivoltinism boothroyd 1999 and a higher mobility in the adult state robinson et al 2003 which may allow it to prevail in these environments the organisms of this family mainly scrapers are also abundant in neotropical streams situated in the lowlands of costa rica lorion and kennedy 2009 however the availability of periphyton is low in the higher andean streams so that the relative abundance of chironomidae is likely to be more related to its plausible adaptation to the availability of food and hydraulic conditions vescovi rosa et al 2011 furthermore the entry of litter from riparian vegetation represents an important source of energy and nutrients for the macroinvertebrates especially for the detritivores shredders that are very abundant in environments with an arboreal canopy gra√ßa 2001 this study suggested that the amount of organic matter in the bed of streams was not significantly related to the presence of shredders as a function of the predominant vegetation cover among the factors that possibly explain this are the hydromorphological conditions such as v and the slope of the streams which exert a pulling force that diminishes the availability of the organic matter r√≠os touma et al 2009 moreover the low presence of shredders could be attributed to the leaf type of vegetation tussock grass polylepis sp and gynoxys sp which might be of little preference by these groups it is reported that the characteristics of leaves can strongly influence the palatability of shredders reis et al 2019 the genus phylloecus representative of shredders and mainly present in lower andean rivers 1 300 m a s l characterised by smaller slopes than the ones of the streams herein studied encalada et al 2010 however in the current high mountain streams also exhibited an association with the available amount of organic matter the presence of predators in the habitats with lower organic matter content could be related to the higher water velocity reigning in these habitats higher flows are likely to wash away the organic matter leaving the inorganic substrate which do not affect considerably to predators due to their more robust body structure tamaris turizo et al 2007 5 conclusions the present study suggested that high andean headwaters with qf and tg vegetation share many of the environmental characteristics hmf differed both in environmental variables and macroinvertebrate communities from the other two sites however all of the three high andean headwaters because of their elevation are restricted to a certain number of taxa mainly resistant to the lower availability of dissolved oxygen and variation of discharge as for the spatial distribution of aquatic communities the most influential variables were th turb v and nitri ni which were at the same time positively correlated to the hmf vegetation in the same context it was observed the influence of the chemical hydromorphological characteristics v turb ph th of the stream on some of the biological variables and functional groups it was observed at the three study sites a dominance of organisms generally tolerant to lower availability of oxygen chironomidae and non insect class and curiously to higher concentrations of nutrients in general shredders are very abundant in environments with an arboreal canopy however in this study only some taxa of shredders i e phylloecus were associated with the presence of organic matter in the sediment other taxa predators of plecoptera are predominant in the high andean ecosystems due to their resistance to flow conditions it is worth noticing that no relevant differences were found between the qf and tg stream segments in terms of the important physical chemical variables as well as the macroinvertebrate communities finally the sites selected for the current study still represent pristine ecosystems and as such could provide a baseline for comparison with relevant information from other impacted ecosystems and or for future research that could concentrate for instance on examining the impact of local or regional anthropic changes the more

1061,as a function of the dominant vegetation cover patterns of variation in the structure and composition of both the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities and their functional feeding groups ffg were examined at pristine streams of two high andean micro catchments of southern ecuador ten sampling segments were defined in the study streams surrounded by either tussock grass tg quinua forest qf or high mountain forest hmf in each segment environmental and biological samples were collected different statistical analyses were implemented for assessing possible relationships between biological and environmental variables tg and qf streams were found to share many physical and biological characteristics hmf ecosystems which are characterised by greater total hardness water velocity temperature ph and nitrite nitrate concentrations exhibited low values of diversity richness relative abundance of non insects piercer and parasites further high values of relative abundance of plecoptera predators were observed in hmf apparently due to higher water velocities and their resistance to these flow conditions the composition of the macroinvertebrate community showed similarity in tg and qf it was observed at the three study sites a dominance of organisms generally tolerant to lower availability of oxygen chironomidae and non insect class and curiously to higher concentrations of nutrients it was found some taxa associated with the presence of organic matter in the sediment because they use allochthonous resources phylloecus key words andean macroinvertebrates pristine vegetation cover functional feeding groups 1 introduction the ecological and hydrological characteristics of lotic systems are strongly depending on surrounding vegetation cover wallace et al 1997 feyen and v√°zquez 2015 in this context riparian vegetation are important filters protecting rivers from adjacent disturbed areas miserendino et al 2011 fraaije et al 2019 further riparian vegetation influences the dynamics of the quality and quantity of food available for certain invertebrates fierro et al 2017 fraaije et al 2019 directly through allochthonous contribution of leaves soil and wood affecting as such benthic composition sponseller et al 2010 i√±iguez armijos et al 2014 indirectly riparian vegetation influences these dynamics of food availability for benthic communities through the processes of microbial decomposition that imply the modification of carbon and dissolved organic nutrients collins et al 2016 in addition density of vegetation canopy influences the amount of solar radiation that reaches the river which determines primary production and as such impacts the development of macroinvertebrates b√ºcker et al 2010 larson et al 2019 however the relationship between native vegetation cover and aquatic communities in small headwater rivers of high mountain areas in south america miserendino and pizzolon 2004 giraldo et al 2014 and particularly in ecuador b√ºcker et al 2010 vimos lojano et al 2017 has been so far little studied at a global scale species richness has a strong relation with elevation albert et al 2011 wang et al 2011 herein jacobsen 2004 and madsen et al 2015 found that the number of species of aquatic communities in the andean region increased as elevation decreased a contrasting pattern was however observed in some families of different groups of organisms such as diatoms wang et al 2011 macroinvertebrates jacobsen 2004 and fish albert et al 2011 benthic macroinvertebrate communities perform much of their life cycle in lotic ecosystems and appear to be structured by landscape factors such as land use catchment vegetation cover surface geology and geographic basin factors ding et al 2017 however other studies statzner and beche 2010 rezende et al 2014 vimos lojano et al 2017 indicate that local scale variables e g hydraulic flow substrate types water chemistry riparian vegetation etc seem to play a more prominent role in the structuring of macroinvertebrate communities due to the sensibility of macroinvertebrates to local and regional factors their role for assessing the environmental conditions of aquatic ecosystems has been for long recognised hodkinson and jackson 2005 acosta et al 2009 approximately 80 of the earth s land surface is already modified by anthropic activities resulting in progressively significant impacts on a wide range of ecosystem services at different scales naiman et al 1995 barnett et al 2008 thus today pristine ecosystems considered true natural laboratories for the detection of environmental changes hannah et al 2007 hampel et al 2010 are really scarce globally hereafter they would provide baseline information that could be used in comparative studies with regard to altered ecosystems hodkinson and jackson 2005 bailey et al 2014 some studies have been conducted to assess the effects of climate change on freshwater systems in the northern hemisphere piggott et al 2015 lund et al 2016 however in ecuador the lack of long term meteorological and biological data precludes this type of research with the consequent difficulty for an adequate and sustainable management of land and water resources particularly in current times characterised by a booming of hydroelectricity generation and mining projects being developed in these ecosystems espinosa and rivera 2016 the main objective of this research was examining the patterns of variation in the structure and composition of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities and their functional feeding groups fgg as a function of the characteristics of their habitats i e pristine headwater andean streams thus this research aimed at answering the following research questions i is it possible to find variations in biological variables or ffg or the structure of communities as a function of the native riparian vegetation ii is it possible to discern which environmental conditions are responsible for the patterns observed in the biological variables ffg and macroinvertebrate communities and iii can certain taxa be associated with the dominant type of riparian vegetation the results of this study are likely to contribute to establish a baseline for future research about the impact of local and global anthropic changes on andean ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the first study site the zhurucay microcatchment fig 1 belongs to the jubones river basin which has an approximate area of 4 354 km2 its river has an approximate length of 124 km and is divided into nine sub basins v√°zquez 2010 mosquera et al 2015 further the elevation of this basin varies between 4 120 m above the average sea level a s l by the western cordillera and the sea level by the pacific ocean the zhurucay microcatchment has a drainage area of 7 97 km2 and its altitudinal range varies between 3 200 and 3 900 m a s l the main land cover for year 2010 is studholme et al 2017 grassland tussock grass 58 6 cushion plants and grasses other than pajonal 19 4 riparian polylepis woodlots particularly p incana kunth y p reticulata kunth 17 7 and introduced pine 4 3 land use consists of light pasture non cultivated land with non intensive grazing in the order of two heads ha 1 and agriculture particularly cultivated grass and potato v√°zquez et al 2010 the second study site the pallcayacu microcatchment fig 1 is located in the upper basin of the paute river which has a surface of about 6 439 km2 its main river reach spans about 120 km from the andean headwaters to the amazon region has an elevation range between 440 and 4 680 m a s l and is divided into 18 sub basins sotomayor et al 2018 the pallcayacu microcatchment has an approximate area of 19 2 km2 and an elevation range varying between 2 520 and 3 620 m a s l the main land uses in the region are agriculture forestry and pasture the main land cover year 2011 in the pallcayacu microcatchment is tropical montane forest tmf 58 agricultural land 18 tussock grass 15 pasture other than tussock grass 4 wetlands 3 and other 2 these two microcatchments were selected to represent the range of environmental heterogeneity in the upper jubones and paute basins respectively precipitation patterns vary across the study regions depending on their geographical position on the andean range in the zhurucay microcatchment the rainy period on average is from january to may with heavier rains in january and february and more dry days between june and december v√°zquez 2010 studholme et al 2017 in the pallcayacu microcatchment the drier season spans from november to february and the peak rainfall occurs in june july studholme et al 2017 three different riparian vegetation types were considered in this study namely pajonal i e tussock grass tg quinua forest qf i e polylepis sp and high montane forest hmf in the tg locations the dominant flora is calamagrostis intermedia whereas the qf locations are dominated by polylepis incana kunth and p reticulata kunth concentrated in riparian banks hmf locations host a high variety of species of trees and shrubs such as styloceras laurifolia buxaceae hedyosmum cumbalense cloranthaceae clusia multiflora clusaiceae cyathea sp cyatheaceae palicourea sp rubiaceae and asteraceae sp 2 2 monitoring environmental variables seven sampling stations 4 at tg and 3 at qf were established within the zhurucay microcatchment whilst three stations at hmf were defined within the pallcayacu microcatchment fig 1 on average tg stations were located at about 3 700 m a s l qf stations at 3 640 m a s l and hmf stations at 2 740 m a s l in every station a 50 m long segment was defined for the monthly collection of biotic and abiotic samples throughout the period august december of 2017 that was chosen with the aim of avoiding as much as possible peak discharge events physical chemical variables were recorded in situ with the use of a multiple water quality sensor u 50 series http www horiba com including water temperature t c electric conductivity ec ¬µs cm 1 total dissolved solids tds g l 1 turbidity turb ntu dissolved oxygen do mg l 1 and the redox potential orp mv in addition surface water samples were collected and the following variables were analysed using standard methods apha 2005 alkalinity mg caco3 l 1 total hardness th mg caco3 l 1 and nitrite nitrate concentration nitri ni ¬µg n l 1 water depth depth cm was determined using a graduated rod water velocity v cm s 1 was measured with a propeller type flow meter hydromate cmc3 the stream discharge q was calculated once per month at each sampling station by employing the velocity integration method boiten 2008 the type of dominant substrate of the streambed at each sampling point was determined considering this simplified classification bedrock boulder pebble gravel sand silt aquatic vegetation or the combination of these types according to the guidelines provided by elosegi 2009 2 3 biotic monitoring at each of the 50 m long stream segments six macroinvertebrate samples replicates were collected using a hess cylinder diameter 15 5 cm mesh size 250 microns the six replicates were collected at the most representative habitats run riffle pool the samples were preserved in 10 formaldehyde solution and were washed at the laboratory using a 250 ¬µm sieve the macroinvertebrates were identified at the lowest possible taxonomic level using taxonomic keys of dom√≠nguez et al 2009 after removal of the organisms the remaining sediment was used to measure the weight of organic matter afdw g m 2 according to steinman et al 2011 for determining the chlorophyll a content chl a ¬µg cm 2 three stones were randomly collected from the streambed at each stream segment monthly the periphyton was extracted from the surface of the stones using a brush and the application of distilled water within a standard quadrant 2 2 cm2 the resulting solution was filtered using a vacuum pump with whatman gf f filters diameter 47 mm mesh size 0 7 microns the chl a was determined according to the spectrophotometric method described in steinman et al 2011 2 4 data analysis the correlated environmental variables spearman s r value 0 7 were discarded from the statistical analysis hence 4 were discarded out of the 16 physical chemical variables the density of the taxa for every one of the 50 m long stream segments was defined by averaging the respective densities of the six replicates avoiding as such the effects of microhabitats this was done for all of the sampling campaigns and stream segments these averaged densities were then transformed logarithmically i e log x 1 and were further standardised by dividing them by their mean value the environmental variables with the exception of ph were logarithmically transformed i e log x or log x 1 with the intention of increasing the homogeneity of their variances quinn and keough 2002 the following biological variables bv were calculated total taxa richness richness number of taxa total density density ind m 2 pielou s evenness evenness quinn and

following relative abundance of the main ffg were calculated tomanov√° 2007 according to the principle of the fuzzy code chevene et al 1994 using the following ffg absorber a collector gatherer cg shredder sh scraper sc filtering collector cf piercer pi predator pr and parasite pa previously species that had a relative abundance of less than the 5 of the total sample size were considered as rare and were as such eliminated from the data set to avoid a distortion effect on the statistical results two tests were performed to inspect whether significant differences exist among biological variables and the ffg bv ffg as a function of vegetation cover firstly the kruskal wallis h test k w quinn and keough 2002 was used to define whether the variance of the ranks scores of the bv ffg were significantly different as a function of the vegetation cover secondly in the case that the bv ffg were significantly different the mann whitney u post hoc test m w quinn and keough 2002 was performed for finding out the pairs of vegetation covers i e tg vs qf tg vs hmf and qf vs hmf where the bv ffg were significantly different type 1 error i e rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true was minimised by adjusting p values with the bonferroni correction quinn and keough 2002 and the k w results were inspected through box charts further for the set of bv ffg for which the k w test found significant differences a multiple linear regression model eq 1 among these n bv ffg yj and the m environmental variables xi was developed using the forward step selection procedure quinn and keough 2002 in each vegetation type separately this analysis was carried out to identify the plausible environmental variables that might be responsible for the differences of the bv ffg 1 y j Œ≤ 0 i 1 i m Œ≤ i x i where Œ≤0 and Œ≤i are the linear regression coefficients for judging on the robustness of the statistical models of all of the studied bv ffg it was considered the adjusted r2 value r2 adj hieber et al 2005 the contribution of each independent xi variable in the statistical model was identified by the value of the beta Œ≤ standardised regression coefficient miles and shevlin 2001 finally the differences among environmental variables selected through the regression models as a function of the predominant vegetation cover were assessed through the application of the k w test and the mann whitney u post hoc tests with the bonferroni correction all of the above depicted statistical analyses were executed with the spss statistical software version 20 imb spss inc armonk new york for studying the relationship of aquatic communities with the environmental variables and with the dominant vegetation cover the detrended correspondence analysis dca was applied which suggested the use of a linear response model redundancy analysis lep≈° and ≈°milauer 2003 the forward automatic selection with bonferroni correction was used to choose environmental variables that have a significant effect on the composition of the community ≈°milauer and lep≈° 2014 these statistical analyses were carried out with the help of the canoco software version 5 ≈°milauer and lep≈° 2014 finally the compositions of the macroinvertebrate communities were compared as function of the predominant vegetation cover through the analysis of similarity anosim that uses the bray curtis measure of similarity further a global goodness of fit statistical value 1 r 1 was obtained r values close to 1 indicate that the majority of the most similar compositions of communities are within the same vegetation cover this latter analysis was performed using the primer software version 6 clarke and gorley 2006 3 results 3 1 environmental characteristics of the sampling locations higher average values of t were observed in all of the sampling stations located in the hmf vegetation cover table 1 the highest recorded value was 12 6 c hfm3 it is the same case for turb ec q and nitri ni whose highest average values were observed at hmf1 i e 13 2 ntu turb 99 6 ¬µs cm 1 ec 26 9 l s 1 q and 72 4 ¬µgn l 1 nitri ni further the highest average values of afdw were table 1 85 4 g m 2 hmf1 183 2 g

and dominant vegetation cover a total of 55 macroinvertebrate taxa belonging mostly to the insect class were collected at all sampling stations table 2 the number of taxa per sampling station ranged from 24 to 31 and the mean density ranged between 937 and 21 383 ind m 2 the k w test showed significant differences p 0 05 between richness and diversity as a function of the three vegetation covers annex a the m w test suggested that fig 2 a annex a the average richness was significantly lower in hmf 23 taxa in relation to qf 27 taxa the k w test suggested fig 2b annex a a similar trend for the average diversity which was significantly lower in hmf 1 8 compared to tg 2 1 and qf 2 2 further the multiple regression analysis table 3 with richness as the dependent variable and r2 adj 0 5 selected turb as the variable that is explaining the variation of richness in hmf however non significant differences were obtained for turb as a function of the type of vegetation cover after the bonferroni correction in addition the multiple regression analysis suggested th and ph as variables negatively influencing the diversity in qf and hmf and v positively influencing the diversity in hmf table 3 th v and ph exhibited fig 3 a b c annex b significantly higher values in hmf than in tg and qf furthermore the k w test indicated annex a significant differences p 0 05 between the relative abundance of plecoptera and non insects the m w test annex a fig 2c suggested that the relative abundance of plecoptera was significantly higher in hmf 1 3 than at tg 0 3 and qf 0 2 in contrast the relative abundance of non insect annex a fig 2d was lower in hmf 16 3 as compared to tg 34 4 in this context multiple regression analysis suggested table 3 that v had a positive influence on the relative abundance of plecoptera at tg and hmf while t had negative influence at qf the relative abundance of non insect seemed to be determined negatively by ph at qf and hmf and positively by v at qf and by turb at hmf annex b significantly higher values of t were observed fig 3d annex b at hmf than at tg and qf upon the rda fig 4 illustrates some differences in the composition of the macroinvertebrates community as a function of the studied vegetation covers this was corroborated by the anosim test r 0 64 p 0 001 the greatest community difference was observed among hmf and tg r 0 93 p 0 001 and qf r 0 81 p 0 001 the rda suggested an overlap in terms of the composition of the community between the tg and qf ecosystems similarly to anosim where the low r value 0 26 suggest no composition differences despite of the p value 0 001 forward automatic selection on the explanatory variables revealed that v nitri ni turb and th affected significantly the macroinvertebrate community fig 4 table 4 all of these environmental variables except turb were significantly higher in hmf than in tg and qf annex b table 1 further the first ordering axis reflects a gradient related to these variables leptohyphes mortionella anacroneuria simuliium anchytarsus smicridea are the typical taxa under these conditions in the hmf the first and second axes explained respectively 24 1 and 6 1 of the variation of the community data set further the second ordering axis indicated a gradient in relation to depth and afdw table 4 the taxa of hydracarina allaudomya sphariidae hyalella helobdella phylloecus and heterelmis seemed to be related to the higher afdw depth was higher and seemed to be important in tg and qf in particular for the taxa austrolimnius tanypodinae limneidae chironominae and oxyethira 3 3 relationships among functional feeding groups ffg and dominant vegetation cover with regard to ffg of macroinvertebrates the k w test identified four groups scraper sc piercer pi predator pr and parasite pa varying significantly among the different types of vegetation covers annex a the relative abundance of sc was higher and the relative abundance of pi was lower in hmf than in tg without statistically differing from qf fig 5 a b annex a multiple regression table 3 suggested that the sc were negatively related to the afdw at qf and positively to ph at hmf pi were positively related to afdw at qf and negatively related to the ph at hmf further afdw did not show significant differences as a function of the tree vegetation types annex b the relative abundance of pr was higher fig 5c annex a in hmf than in tg and qf in this respect depth and afdw were selected by the multiple regression analysis table 3 as the environmental variables that negatively influenced this feeding group at tg and qf respectively no significant difference of depth was observed in the three ecosystems annex b finally the relative abundance of pa was significantly lower at hmf fig 5d annex a than at tg and qf multiple regression table 3 suggested that this variable was defined positively by v and ph at tg and negatively by th at hmf 4 discussion the catchment scale spatial distribution of aquatic communities is largely due to the environmental conditions of the habitats associated with the type of vegetation cover and the underlying geology fierro et al 2017 fraaije et al 2019 however factors that intervene in community control exclusively in high tropical andean aquatic ecosystems are still relatively unknown b√ºcker et al 2010 r√≠os touma et al 2011 vimos lojano et al 2018 hereafter the current study focused on examining the catchment and local scale factors that could be relevant for the structure of the community and for the functional feeding groups of macroinvertebrates in two high mountain pristine micro catchments 4 1 relationships among environmental characteristics and dominant vegetation cover the predominance of histosols and tg vegetation in the zhurucay microcatchment mosquera et al 2015 apparently influenced the homogeneity of the physical chemical characteristics of the water in the habitats of tg and qf as compared to the respective characteristics in hmf these physical chemical characteristics in tg and qf resulted similar to those observed by r√≠os touma et al 2011 in the piburja stream p√°ramo located approximately at 315 km to the north of the current study site at about 3 300 m a s l low temperatures are very typical on high mountains kasangaki et al 2008 and in general temperature increases as elevation decreases jacobsen et al 2003 2004 t is among the most significant physical chemical variables for macroinvertebrates in the high mountains miserendino et al 2011 at the present study sites higher t was observed at the lower hmf ecosystem however although this temperature variation was statistically significant apparently did not represent an important factor for macroinvertebrate communities further the effect that tree canopy has on rivers is normally the reduction of water temperature and primary productivity owing to the obstruction of the solar radiation b√ºcker et al 2010 however this study revealed that despite the significant canopy cover difference among arboreal qf and herbaceous tg ecosystems t and primary productivity remained the same suggesting as such that the type of vegetation cover is not very relevant for these variables at these high elevations which differs from what has been observed at lower elevations b√ºcker et al 2010 on the other hand higher turb and tds is the result of increased q and v which was observed in the hmf ecosystem likely as the result of i the greater cumulative rainfall in the pallcayacu as compared to the zhurucay microcatchment and ii the approximately two times higher average slope of the pallcayacu with respect to the zhurucay microcatchment higher nitri ni could be related to more intense rainfall and higher q in rivers surrounded by agriculture or cattle raising monaghan and smith 2012 however the sampling site at the pallcayacu microcatchment was situated at a pristine environment hence this could be attributed to the fact that the forest soil in high altitudes accumulate higher carbon marian et al 2017 and nitrogen stores tashi et al 2016 and are subjected to higher seepage rates they have a greater potential for leaching of nitrate di and cameron 2002 4 2 relationships among biological variables functional feeding groups ffg aquatic communities and dominant vegetation cover the study revealed that v q turb th ph related to the type of vegetation cover b√ºcker et al 2010 i√±iguez armijos et al 2014 and hydro morphological characteristics of the catchment directly affected the composition and structure of the benthic community and the ffg in this context change in ph affects aquatic life indirectly by modifying the dissolved oxygen level of the water the photosynthesis of aquatic organisms phytoplankton and the sensitivity of these organisms to pollution ngodhe et al 2014 prommi and payakka 2015 found direct correlation of richness and diversity to ph as many species favoured slightly alkaline ph in basic habitats the present study also indicated that diversity non insects and several ffg s were sensitive even to the small changes in ph furthermore the flow regime is a critical component in determining aquatic communities bunn and arthington 2002 vimos lojano et al 2018 this study suggested that the pallcayacu microcatchment with higher v exhibited a decrease in the diversity of macroinvertebrates resulting from the associated greater hydraulic stress apparently organisms that are not adapted to strong velocities such as those of the non insect class specifically the oligochaeta james et al 2008 were significantly impacted unlike some taxa i e anacroneuria of the order plecoptera that are characterised by being relatively large and robust tamaris turizo et al 2007 allowing them to be strongly attached to the substrate under higher velocity events tomanov√° and tedesco 2007 in this study a greater number of anacroneuria was found in the hmf streams characterised by higher velocities which matches the results of other studies on similar andean streams sajam√≠ et al 2016 another representative group in the hmf habitats was the genus simulium r√≠os touma et al 2011 pavitra et al 2019 the body structure of which is characterised by an anal ring with rows of hooks that may allow it adhering strongly to the substrate pavitra et al 2019 in general many aquatic ecology studies relate th turb and nitri ni with the impact of land use change on the macroinvertebrate community b√ºcker et al 2010 miserendino et al 2011 however biotic variation in pristine areas is still poorly understood miserendino et al 2011 although the order diptera and the non insect class oligochaetes and hyalella are generally distinctive of pasture zones james et al 2008 these two groups were among the dominant taxa in the current pristine study sites which matches the results of a previous study performed at pristine locations of new zealand mountains olsen et al 2001 and andean streams scheibler et al 2014 the elevation is likely to influence the dominance of diptera and the non insect class since it restricts the variability of the ecosystem to a certain number of taxa mainly resistant to the availability of dissolved oxygen jacobsen et al 2003 and the variability of q mosquera et al 2015 with regard to the order diptera the chironomidae family with a relative abundance of 47 7 presents multivoltinism boothroyd 1999 and a higher mobility in the adult state robinson et al 2003 which may allow it to prevail in these environments the organisms of this family mainly scrapers are also abundant in neotropical streams situated in the lowlands of costa rica lorion and kennedy 2009 however the availability of periphyton is low in the higher andean streams so that the relative abundance of chironomidae is likely to be more related to its plausible adaptation to the availability of food and hydraulic conditions vescovi rosa et al 2011 furthermore the entry of litter from riparian vegetation represents an important source of energy and nutrients for the macroinvertebrates especially for the detritivores shredders that are very abundant in environments with an arboreal canopy gra√ßa 2001 this study suggested that the amount of organic matter in the bed of streams was not significantly related to the presence of shredders as a function of the predominant vegetation cover among the factors that possibly explain this are the hydromorphological conditions such as v and the slope of the streams which exert a pulling force that diminishes the availability of the organic matter r√≠os touma et al 2009 moreover the low presence of shredders could be attributed to the leaf type of vegetation tussock grass polylepis sp and gynoxys sp which might be of little preference by these groups it is reported that the characteristics of leaves can strongly influence the palatability of shredders reis et al 2019 the genus phylloecus representative of shredders and mainly present in lower andean rivers 1 300 m a s l characterised by smaller slopes than the ones of the streams herein studied encalada et al 2010 however in the current high mountain streams also exhibited an association with the available amount of organic matter the presence of predators in the habitats with lower organic matter content could be related to the higher water velocity reigning in these habitats higher flows are likely to wash away the organic matter leaving the inorganic substrate which do not affect considerably to predators due to their more robust body structure tamaris turizo et al 2007 5 conclusions the present study suggested that high andean headwaters with qf and tg vegetation share many of the environmental characteristics hmf differed both in environmental variables and macroinvertebrate communities from the other two sites however all of the three high andean headwaters because of their elevation are restricted to a certain number of taxa mainly resistant to the lower availability of dissolved oxygen and variation of discharge as for the spatial distribution of aquatic communities the most influential variables were th turb v and nitri ni which were at the same time positively correlated to the hmf vegetation in the same context it was observed the influence of the chemical hydromorphological characteristics v turb ph th of the stream on some of the biological variables and functional groups it was observed at the three study sites a dominance of organisms generally tolerant to lower availability of oxygen chironomidae and non insect class and curiously to higher concentrations of nutrients in general shredders are very abundant in environments with an arboreal canopy however in this study only some taxa of shredders i e phylloecus were associated with the presence of organic matter in the sediment other taxa predators of plecoptera are predominant in the high andean ecosystems due to their resistance to flow conditions it is worth noticing that no relevant differences were found between the qf and tg stream segments in terms of the important physical chemical variables as well as the macroinvertebrate communities finally the sites selected for the current study still represent pristine ecosystems and as such could provide a baseline for comparison with relevant information from other impacted ecosystems and or for future research that could concentrate for instance on examining the impact of local or regional anthropic changes the more

begun 60 years after the natural lake was dried this research is aimed at linking a series of environmental drivers with the phytoplankton functional groups during a dry year after the lake s refilling period to investigate seasonal and spatial dynamics and to get an insight into lake s ecology for both monitoring and management purposes in situ physical and chemical measurements along with water and plankton sampling took place monthly from may 2014 till march 2015 a combination of direct ordination multivariate statistical analyses and distance based approaches were used to examine spatial and temporal patterns and to test dissimilarities among and within the stations phytoplankton was assorted in reynolds functional groups the lake s hydrology was also modelled the research results presented karla lake as a homogeneously degraded system the major environmental parameters affecting phytoplankton community were ortho phosphates and temperature in a lake with long retention time the five functional groups that were dominant during the survey were comprised by representatives of cyanobacteria followed by chlorophytes and diatoms many of them indicative of warm shallow turbid nutrient rich waters phytoplankton revealed a seasonal trend with prolonged summer low differentiation among seasons and uninterrupted winter succession the relations and patterns found

freshwater ecosystems provide a wide range of ecosystem services these are influenced by all sort of land use changes morphological alterations and resource overexploitation with detrimental impact on their ecological state jackson 2011 such cases are nowadays apparent in a plenty of lake ecosystems with eutrophication being the most important problem counteracting the presence of a favorable environmental state jeppesen et al 2017 climatic conditions are also key drivers of lakes ecological status especially in south mediterranean where the prolonged summer period the intensity of solar radiation and the augmented water temperature enhance the vulnerability of lakes shallow lakes are the most impaired due to a variety of important pressures and stressors moss et al 1996 2003 s√∏ndergaard et al 2007 environmental parameters coupled with lake morphometric factors and nutrients act synergistically in making such lakes more prone to switch to a turbid stable state phillips et al 2016 with consequent results in the community structure jeppesen et al 2000 and water quality hilt et al 2018 shallow lake communities and especially phytoplankton are strongly influenced by climatic and eco hydro morphological parameters tundisi et al 1998 as such lakes typically have large surface areas with small depth and well lighted sediments throughout the year changes in water budget and inflows affect their water chemistry beklioglu et al 2007 beklioglu and tan 2008 hanson et al 2017 the complexity in shallow lakes rises even more when these are also characterized as heavily modified water bodies meaning substantially changed in character due morphological modifications european commission 2000 2000 60 ec it was noticed long ago that some processes like water flow wind speed shade water temperature and nutrient concentration can affect ecological equilibria steele 1978 but the extent to which ecological niches control the patterns for the biota at different trophic levels and at different spatial and temporal scales remains an open issue soininen et al 2011 especially for phytoplankton variations in space and time are dependent upon species composition growth and reproduction rates which in turn are nutrient dependent dokulil 1988 dokulil and teubner 2000 reynolds 2004 lampert and sommer 2007 phytoplankton is deemed as suitable element for studying the effects of short term environmental changes at different spatial and temporal scales due to its short generation times leibold and norberg 2004 angeler et al 2010 moreover it is a key element to assist the understanding of system s functioning and pinpoint relations from practical point of view chalar 2009 physical constraints on phytoplankton are being studied for about 50 years reynolds 1972 but studies on the role of physical factors on phytoplankton distribution and abundances are intensified only in the last two decades reynolds 1994 zohary et al 2010 lake morphometry along with external energy like air temperature wind mixing and precipitation stipulate nutrient recycling couture et al 2014 and hence phytoplankton composition and abundance in phytoplankton besides classical taxonomy and taxonomic measures a grouping based on functional traits can reflect local environmental conditions and serve as a biodiversity change indicator monnet et al 2014 lindenmayer et al 2015 larsen et al 2018 use of functional groups in spatial and temporal dynamics research were favored in better describing biodiversity trends and their drivers dornelas et al 2014 mcgill et al 2015 larsen et al 2018 reynolds functional groups rfgs reynolds et al 2002 padis√°k et al 2009 classification scheme is a useful tool to get an insight into ecological processes that take place in the lake this method aggregates species with similar traits as well as common sensitivity and tolerance to environmental factors kruk et al 2017 many studies focus on how different environmental and spatial parameters such as hydrological physical and chemical ones isabwe et al 2018 wu et al 2018 shape phytoplankton community this approach may result in inaccurate prioritizations and thus mislead stakeholders or managers wu et al 2018 so there is a need for a parallel monitoring of the biota and the number of environmental drivers synchronously in space and time belletti et al 2017 lake karla 39 31 60 00 n 22 41 60 00 e lake area 38 km2 a former natural shallow lake used to be one of the most important greek shallow lakes until 1962 the lake is situated in one of the most productive plains thessaly which dried out for agricultural purposes in 2010 after more than 30 years of groundwater over abstraction and fertilizing water intensive monocultures it was re constructed the history the value and the multiple services of lake karla are explained in detail by sidiropoulos et al 2017 and gkelis et al 2017 by 2015 the lake was already in high trophic status gkelis et al 2017 as receiving high loading of nutrients for years skordas et al 2015 high evaporation 775 mm potential evapotranspiration vs 560 mm precipitation vasiliades et al 2009 and very low inflows besides precipitation shape water retention time close to infinity especially for the studied years 2014 2015 the lowest water level was recorded sidiropoulos et al 2017 lake karla a shallow lentic system has characteristics of both an old and a newly formed ecosystem and related studies demonstrated intra annual variations tzabiras et al 2016 gkelis et al 2017 laspidou et al 2017 sidiropoulos et al 2017 bobori et al 2018 lake karla is under multiple pressures mainly agriculture uncontrolled farming water abstraction hydrology regulation and low catchment inflows resulting in eutrophication dominance of cyanobacteria and decline of biodiversity bobori et al 2018 the aim of this study is to expand our knowledge on phytoplankton for this new lake project by correlating several environmental drivers with phytoplankton functional groups dynamics within a dry year during the lake s refilling in favor of both management and monitoring moreover spatial dynamics are assessed to test the effect of terrain dissimilarities sites proximity to different pressures and extreme drought that separated a part of the lake while the temporal ones are examined to investigate the effect of drought and inflows interruption besides the seasonal patterns 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and sampling procedure in order to create a time series of physical and chemical parameters and

their proximity to different pressures sheepfolds greenhouses almond orchards cattle grazing pig farms ditches pumping station fig 1 the sampling sites were located about 10m from the shore few macrophytes were visible along with some reeds and bogs only in the deepest station s4 and in the rest of the stations the sediment was bare from november 2014 until february 2015 the station s1 was cut off from the lake as a separate pond due to severe water level drop and in the rest of the lake the depth did not exceed 1 5 m in situ measurements of ph conductivity ms cm dissolved oxygen do mg

grouped into four categories physicochemical eutrophication climate and hydrological parameters table 1 the physicochemical and eutrophication related parameters were based on field data collected during the survey the climate related parameters were three variables i e air temperature precipitation wind speed obtained through the closest meteorological station http meteosearch meteo gr regarding the hydrological parameters calculation these were modeled in a monthly step representing the actual operation conditions of lake karla from may 2014 until march 2015 using uthrl uthbal loukas et al 2007 2008 results were coupled with the database provided by the management body of the protected area karla mavrovouni kefalovryso velestino delta pinios and are in line with the research conducted by sidiropoulos et al 2017 the closest meteorological station s data located in velestino were adopted and hence precipitation and evaporation were calculated according to the altitude gradient deep infiltration and connection with the aquifer were modeled using lak3 package merritt and konikow 2000 for modflow water abstraction directly from the lake was deemed as zero because it is prohibited for irrigation purposes in that way a series of hydrological parameters were calculated table 1 2 3 phytoplankton community for phytoplankton taxonomic counting uterm√∂hl technique en 15204 2006 was adopted diversity was calculated with shannon h shannon 1948 evenness j pielou 1966 and simpson d simpson 1949 indices to correlate phytoplankton temporal and spatial variations with environmental conditions the updated phytoplankton reynolds functional groups rfgs list by padis√°k et al 2009 for lentic and lotic systems was used furthermore reynolds et al 2002 and relevant literature for grouping species in the mediterranean area e g becker et al 2010 √ßelik and sevindik 2015 demir et al 2014 soylu and g√∂n√ºlol 2010 was also considered 2 4 data processing and statistical analyses prior to analyses the seasonal mean values of the physicochemical parameters and rfgs were calculated the spearman correlation was performed within each category of environmental parameters to identify and exclude the intercorrelated ones rs 0 8 spss v24 all data were log x 1 transformed except for temperature and ph which were standardized two association matrices physicochemical parameters x stations rfgs x stations were generated using euclidean distance and bray curtis similarity respectively clarke and warwick 2001 analyses of similarities anosim 999 permutations of physicochemical parameters and rfgs were carried out to identify differences among the sampling sites and the seasons in anosim r values 0 75 indicate strong differences whereas r 0 5 implies overlapping but separate groups and r 0 25 non existing differences between groups clarke and warwick 2001 the results were plotted via multidimensional scaling mds additionally the similarity percentages simper analysis was performed to identify which physicochemical parameters and rfgs contributed most cut off contribution 90 for similarities and dissimilarities within and among seasons and sampling sites clarke et al 2014 all the above statistical analyses were applied using primer v6 software clarke and gorley 2006 then a redundancy analysis rda was performed to investigate the effects of environmental parameters on rfgs using the r package vegan oksanen et al 2006 the rda constrained a form of multiple regression of a multivariate set of predictor parameters on a multivariate set of response parameters to identify the most important explanatory parameters p 0 05 to be included in the prda a forward selection procedure was performed using r package pack for dray 2005 the contribution of the four groups of environmental parameters in structuring the rfgs composition was assigned through the use of variance partitioning with partial rda using the varpart function of the r library vegan oksanen et al 2006 this analysis allows the decomposition of the variance of the response matrix among sets of explanatory variables to identify the contributions to the total variance borcard et al 1992 legendre and legendre 1998 3 results 3 1 physicochemical and hydrological parameters variations of physicochemical parameters among stations and seasons were

concentrations of ortho phosphates po4 p ranged from 0 050 mg l s1 spr 14 to 0 376 mg l s2 sum 14 with highest concentrations observed during the summer table 2 from the hydrological modelling of lake karla for the survey year the water balance was slightly positive with intra annual water level fluctuation a water level drop during summer months due to high evaporation 3 3 hm3 monthly finally resulted in an increase 0 8 m during winter mostly due to the inflow from pinios river and the direct precipitation in lake and less due to the inflow from the basin table 3 during the major part of the modeled period the inflow from pinios was merely adequate to balance the losses by evaporation 3 2 phytoplankton community in lake karla a total of 118 taxa was identified cyanobacteria 30 51 and chlorophytes 29 66 were the most specious groups followed by diatoms 8 47 from the ten diatom species recorded half were benthic besides the precautions taken in order to minimize turbulence caused by the sampling higher number of species was recorded in the cut off s1 station 98 taxa during all samplings but the total number of species recorded in the other stations did not differ greatly s2 88 s3 94 s4 95 on average 32 4 species were recorded in each sampling cyanobacteria were the most abundant group 10 besides feb 15 s3 reaching up to 86 in the station s1 followed by chlorophytes and diatoms the total abundance ranged from 5 104 to 6 105 cells filaments colonies per l and blooms were often recorded all stations showed a winter chlorophyte diatom abundance peak and a cyanobacteria peak during warm season and autumn prolonged warm period besides s1 where cyanobacteria were prevailing all year round unequal abundances among samples were revealed by shannon diversity index Œ∑ having monthly average values ranging from 2 56 to 4 06 fig 2 similarly simpson index d showed no dominance having monthly average values ranging from 0 09 up to 0 37 fig 2 quite even distribution among species abundances was also revealed by pielou s evenness index j 0 5 to 0 78 fig 2 spring is underrepresented due to the inexistence of multiple monthly samplings though the general trend is depicted describing in all seasons and stations a uniform distribution without dominant species the sum of the species identified was sorted in 23 rfgs the 6 groups contributing most to the total average abundance almost 70 are the s1 x1 d j lo and x3 with species usually found in shallow mixed and eutrophic lakes according to group traits in fig 3 the 10 rfgs explaining the 88 of the average abundance are presented in which half of the identified taxa 58 are included the identified representatives of these groups along with their usual habitats and sensitivities are presented in table 4 some species from other rfgs were also quite abundant but could not affect their groups total contribution in total abundance e g anabaenopsis elenkinii from h1 rfg or raphidiopsis raciborskii from sn the s1 and x1 groups were the most abundant ones in all seasons together exceeding 40 of each season s average abundance with representatives from the cyanobacteria and chlorophytes respectively also x3 contribution in spr 14 and win 14 15 j in sum 14 and d in spr 15 were important about 15 of each season s average abundance 3 3 spatial and temporal pattern of phytoplankton community the mds plots revealed a clear temporal distinction for physicochemical and rfgs fig 4 a and c while no clear spatial differences were discernible fig 4 b and d the anosim analysis comparing physicochemical and rfgs among seasons showed that r values were high r 0 929 all pairwise r 0 463 p 0 05 and r 0 546 all pairwise r 0 385 p 0 05 which indicated a temporal pattern in contrast r values among stations were relatively low p 0 05 i e for physicochemical parameters were 0 171 all pairwise r 0 131 p 0 05 and for rfgs 0 071 all pairwise r 0 036 p 0 05 regarding simper analysis in physicochemical parameters temperature was extracted as the main parameter differentiating the stations and the seasons appendix table a1 and a2 the same analysis for rfgs showed that s1 contributed more to the assemblage structure of each station appendix table a3 while for seasons the functional groups j spr 14 12 28 aut 14 7 28 s1 sum 14 7 34 spr 15 8 88 and x1 win 14 15 7 32 appendix table a4 played a more important role a low dissimilarity ranging from 14 8 to 21 31 among stations during the survey year revealed a homogenous system 3 4 environmental parameters explaining rfgs variance according to spearman correlation dissolved oxygen and water temperature were strongly correlated rs 0 963 p 0 01 and thus dissolved oxygen was excluded of the physicochemical category table a5 within eutrophication category no correlation was recorded table a6 in the climate category strong negative correlation was found between air temperature and precipitation rs 0 850 p 0 01 table a7 in this category the air temperature remained for the analysis in the hydrology category most of the parameters were strongly intercorrelated table a8 thus only two parameters eres and qr remained thus 10 out of the 18 parameters were selected for the correlation analyses the rda ordination of rfgs showed that the proportion of variance explained by the entire set of environmental parameters was 58 02 the first rda axis explained variance 39 72 was negatively correlated to ortho phosphates po4 p score 0 57 and wind speed w score 0 48 fig 5 the most important components for the second rda axis explained variance 18 30 were air and water temperature airt and wt scores 0 86 and 0 86 respectively fig 5 the h1 and sn were positively correlated to ortho phosphates and wind speed the significant explanatory parameters p 0 05 for each category are presented in table 5 according to the forward selection that took place prior to prda these parameters explained 52 7 of total rfgs variance for lake karla physicochemical 23 3 of total variance and climate 27 7 of total variance categories contributed more while eutrophication and hydrology were accounted for the 0 5 and 1 3 of the total variance fig 6 interactions among the categories explained 5 67 of total variance 4 discussion this study presents the relation of environmental drivers physicochemical eutrophication climatic hydrological with phytoplankton composition and dynamics in lake karla which is often subject to draught conditions it was based to a large extent on functional groups to pinpoint ecohydrological liaisons the case study of lake karla has particular interest since it had disappeared during a period of 60 years the lake refilled to fulfill human needs flooding protection irrigation drinking water but also as a biodiversity hot spot sidiropoulos et al 2017 although it is a protected area it has many peculiarities as is intensively hydrologically managed nutrient enriched with high water conductivity and a history of algal blooms fish and bird kills 4 1 variations of environmental drivers before refilling lake karla has experienced a long fertilization period chamoglou et al 2014 which resulted in internal loading processes from sediment resuspension bobori et al 2018 lake karla is also affected by agricultural and industrial land uses from the catchment area leading to eutrophication the water analysis carried out in lake karla the last years 2013 2015 bobori et al 2018 classified the lake as eutrophic with hypertrophic signals during the warm period according to the present survey a different nutrient profile was noticed namely lower concentrations of dissolved nutrients than previous study bobori et al 2018 in this study the nutrient concentrations fluctuated during the seasons corresponding both to fertilization periods and to potential sediment resuspension given the internal nutrient loading sidiropoulos et al 2017 due to its shallowness in all stations except from s3 station high no3 n concentrations were observed during autumn on the contrary high concentrations of ortho phosphates were observed in summer besides this temporal seasonal heterogeneity no spatial pattern was observed water level and lake volume were constantly low lower than the levels recorded during the first years 2010 2012 of refilling sidiropoulos et al 2012 loukas et al 2015 given the fact that the connection with pinios river was not fully operating during the survey year this restoration measure seem adequate to counterbalance the water volume excluding this artificial inflow the high evaporation combined with reduced inflows from the catchment and the low precipitation result in definite water level drop actually water level halved within 2 years 2012 2014 but more intensively during the survey year chamoglou et al 2014 affecting conductivity this parameter did not show a clear concentration or dilution effect or fertilizing period wash off but just kept rising through the survey period any other dry year might also affect the system s ecology probably in a similar way 4 2 spatial temporal variation the refilling of the lake along with the establishment of new hydro environmental conditions affected the biota profile reynolds functional groups showed no spatial patterns despite the station cut off and the dissimilarity among stations morphology and pressures this finding could prove that specific lake morphometric features or local pressures cannot support the forming or the existence of spatial niches within such a shallow eutrophic lake given the survey year was one of the driest inflow of pinios river was very low during 2014 and no flushing events took place during the phytoplankton growth period thus the input of external energy could not lead in decomposing the lake in horizontally heterogeneous units margalef 1994 mantzouki et al 2016 the highest dissimilarity was recorded when the cutoff station s1 was compared to the others partially supporting the view that hydrological connectivity promotes connectivity between the structural components of the system as the biota but was not adequate to separate it completely from the others major similarity was attributed to the most abundant s1 d and j groups all representatives of shallow mixed turbid eutrophic waters reynolds et al 2002 padis√°k et al 2009 this homogeneity given the degraded status described by the nutrient concentrations and augmented turbidity shows that perhaps proximity to sources of pollution flows and morphological traits e g substrate slope affect physicochemical variables but not enough to create different microhabitats and these in turn control the phytoplankton community as for the system s temporal dynamics the succession of taxa reflected by rfgs separate the winter and indicates that autumn is a more or less uninterrupted continuation of summer the particularity of warmer lakes as lake karla are not suitable for fitting to known limnological models but our data fit with the modified peg model for mediterranean lakes moustaka gouni et al 2014 these findings also support that physical factors that lead to seasonal cycles water level fluctuations water residence time water flow rates temperature can shift the seasonal dynamic of phytoplankton and thus the explanatory value of the environmental factors increases naselli flores and barone 2007 geraldes and boavida 2007 4 3 phytoplankton relation with environmental drivers lake karla was expected to support many of the rfgs containing cyanobacteria and chlorophytes as a shallow mediterranean eutrophic lake and it is confirmed also besides there was a waiting time in every sampling to reduce sediment resuspension several benthic diatoms species were found probably due to shallowness of the water column an interesting finding of the rda performed using rfgs is that h1 and sn which contains n fixing diazotroph cyanobacteria representatives appeared following fertilization and wash off period and the abundances raised from early summer until mid autumn both groups were positively correlated with the ortho phosphates concerning the rfgs correlated with air temperature besides sn and m microcystis spp mp gyrosigma sp appeared during the winter and h2 representatives lemmermaniella sp were found only during mid warm period july august with low abundance this in line with the fact that in polymictic medium high alkalinity humic lakes the phytoplankton community is explained by retention time peretyatko et al 2007 romo et al 2013 and a synergy between po4 p and temperature richardson et al 2018 reservoirs are generally more complex systems than natural lakes because of their interaction with the watershed tundisi and straskraba 1999 appearing environmental gradients which usually induce spatial heterogeneity the role of climatic variables was important according to the prda the example of karla s system could be considered more as a warm polymictic lake subjected to various hydrological alterations subject to frequent extreme and persistent droughts tzabiras et al 2015 coupled with the non regular inflow from pinios river 5 conclusions in conclusion based on the findings of this study the proximity to pollution sources and pressures were not adequate to form a spatial gradient in this newly lake reservoir system the functional groups did not show a particular preference for any discriminant lake feature thus characterizing the lake as homogenous on the other hand a clear temporal pattern with a prolonged warm period and uninterrupted winter succession was depicted it remains to be seen if these phytoplankton trends will still prevail in a fully operating reservoir and during a shift to wet conditions the dominant phytoplankton functional groups dŒø not exhibit spatial differences in these four out of the five stations used also in the national monitoring routine regarding the wfd implementation this could perhaps be capitalized towards reducing the monitoring effort furthermore the rfgs with the most abundant representatives seem to be susceptible in flushing and mixing from a management point of view these findings along with the expected regularity of inflows from pinios river and the already constructed technical infrastructure for flood management could be of use for rehabilitation planning by inducing artificial changes in hydrological patterns and flushing events coupled with the established artificial wetland for nutrient load reduction declaration

begun 60 years after the natural lake was dried this research is aimed at linking a series of environmental drivers with the phytoplankton functional groups during a dry year after the lake s refilling period to investigate seasonal and spatial dynamics and to get an insight into lake s ecology for both monitoring and management purposes in situ physical and chemical measurements along with water and plankton sampling took place monthly from may 2014 till march 2015 a combination of direct ordination multivariate statistical analyses and distance based approaches were used to examine spatial and temporal patterns and to test dissimilarities among and within the stations phytoplankton was assorted in reynolds functional groups the lake s hydrology was also modelled the research results presented karla lake as a homogeneously degraded system the major environmental parameters affecting phytoplankton community were ortho phosphates and temperature in a lake with long retention time the five functional groups that were dominant during the survey were comprised by representatives of cyanobacteria followed by chlorophytes and diatoms many of them indicative of warm shallow turbid nutrient rich waters phytoplankton revealed a seasonal trend with prolonged summer low differentiation among seasons and uninterrupted winter succession the relations and patterns found are useful for monitoring as for management purposes to enhance the reservoir s capacity keywords environmental parameters eutrophication lake karla reynolds functional groups 1 introduction despite freshwater ecosystems provide a wide range of ecosystem services these are influenced by all sort of land use changes morphological alterations and resource overexploitation with detrimental impact on their ecological state jackson 2011 such cases are nowadays apparent in a plenty of lake ecosystems with eutrophication being the most important problem counteracting the presence of a favorable environmental state jeppesen et al 2017 climatic conditions are also key drivers of lakes ecological status especially in south mediterranean where the prolonged summer period the intensity of solar radiation and the augmented water temperature enhance the vulnerability of lakes shallow lakes are the most impaired due to a variety of important pressures and stressors moss et al 1996 2003 s√∏ndergaard et al 2007 environmental parameters coupled with lake morphometric factors and nutrients act synergistically in making such lakes more prone to switch to a turbid stable state phillips et al 2016 with consequent results in the community structure jeppesen et al 2000 and water quality hilt et al 2018 shallow lake communities and especially phytoplankton are strongly influenced by climatic and eco hydro morphological parameters tundisi et al 1998 as such lakes typically have large surface areas with small depth and well lighted sediments throughout the year changes in water budget and inflows affect their water chemistry beklioglu et al 2007 beklioglu and tan 2008 hanson et al 2017 the complexity in shallow lakes rises even more when these are also characterized as heavily modified water bodies meaning substantially changed in character due morphological modifications european commission 2000 2000 60 ec it was noticed long ago that some processes like water flow wind speed shade water temperature and nutrient concentration can affect ecological equilibria steele 1978 but the extent to which ecological niches control the patterns for the biota at different trophic levels and at different spatial and temporal scales remains an open issue soininen et al 2011 especially for phytoplankton variations in space and time are dependent upon species composition growth and reproduction rates which in turn are nutrient dependent dokulil 1988 dokulil and teubner 2000 reynolds 2004 lampert and sommer 2007 phytoplankton is deemed as suitable element for studying the effects of short term environmental changes at different spatial and temporal scales due to its short generation times leibold and norberg 2004 angeler et al 2010 moreover it is a key element to assist the understanding of system s functioning and pinpoint relations from practical point of view chalar 2009 physical constraints on phytoplankton are being studied for about 50 years reynolds 1972 but studies on the role of physical factors on phytoplankton distribution and abundances are intensified only in the last two decades reynolds 1994 zohary et al 2010 lake morphometry along with external energy like air temperature wind mixing and precipitation stipulate nutrient recycling couture et al 2014 and hence phytoplankton composition and abundance in phytoplankton besides classical taxonomy and taxonomic measures a grouping based on functional traits can reflect local environmental conditions and serve as a biodiversity change indicator monnet et al 2014 lindenmayer et al 2015 larsen et al 2018 use of functional groups in spatial and temporal dynamics research were favored in better describing biodiversity trends and their drivers dornelas et al 2014 mcgill et al 2015 larsen et al 2018 reynolds functional groups rfgs reynolds et al 2002 padis√°k et al 2009 classification scheme is a useful tool to get an insight into ecological processes that take place in the lake this method aggregates species with similar traits as well as common sensitivity and tolerance to environmental factors kruk et al 2017 many studies focus on how different environmental and spatial parameters such as hydrological physical and chemical ones isabwe et al 2018 wu et al 2018 shape phytoplankton community this approach may result in inaccurate prioritizations and thus mislead stakeholders or managers wu et al 2018 so there is a need for a parallel monitoring of the biota and the number of environmental drivers synchronously in space and time belletti et al 2017 lake karla 39 31 60 00 n 22 41 60 00 e lake area 38 km2 a former natural shallow lake used to be one of the most important greek shallow lakes until 1962 the lake is situated in one of the most productive plains thessaly which dried out for agricultural purposes in 2010 after more than 30 years of groundwater over abstraction and fertilizing water intensive monocultures it was re constructed the history the value and the multiple services of lake karla are explained in detail by sidiropoulos et al 2017 and gkelis et al 2017 by 2015 the lake was already in high trophic status gkelis et al 2017 as receiving high loading of nutrients for years skordas et al 2015 high evaporation 775 mm potential evapotranspiration vs 560 mm precipitation vasiliades et al 2009 and very low inflows besides precipitation shape water retention time close to infinity especially for the studied years 2014 2015 the lowest water level was recorded sidiropoulos et al 2017 lake karla a shallow lentic system has characteristics of both an old and a newly formed ecosystem and related studies demonstrated intra annual variations tzabiras et al 2016 gkelis et al 2017 laspidou et al 2017 sidiropoulos et al 2017 bobori et al 2018 lake karla is under multiple pressures mainly agriculture uncontrolled farming water abstraction hydrology regulation and low catchment inflows resulting in eutrophication dominance of cyanobacteria and decline of biodiversity bobori et al 2018 the aim of this study is to expand our knowledge on phytoplankton for this new lake project by correlating several environmental drivers with phytoplankton functional groups dynamics within a dry year during the lake s refilling in favor of both management and monitoring moreover spatial dynamics are assessed to test the effect of terrain dissimilarities sites proximity to different pressures and extreme drought that separated a part of the lake while the temporal ones are examined to investigate the effect of drought and inflows interruption besides the seasonal patterns 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and sampling procedure in order to create a time series of physical and chemical parameters and phytoplankton assemblages monthly samplings were conducted from may 2014 representing spring 2014 spr 14 until march 2015 representing spring 2015 spr 15 months june august 2014 represent summer 2014

their proximity to different pressures sheepfolds greenhouses almond orchards cattle grazing pig farms ditches pumping station fig 1 the sampling sites were located about 10m from the shore few macrophytes were visible along with some reeds and bogs only in the deepest station s4 and in the rest of the stations the sediment was bare from november 2014 until february 2015 the station s1 was cut off from the lake as a separate pond due to severe water level drop and in the rest of the lake the depth did not exceed 1 5 m in situ measurements of ph conductivity ms cm dissolved oxygen do mg l and water temperature wt c were coupled with water sampling for nutrients nitrates no3 n mg l and ammonium nh4 n mg l concentrations were measured from filtered water samples and ortho phosphates po4 p mg l from unfiltered ones all nutrients were analyzed spectrophotometrically using hach lange lck kits for phytoplankton analysis samples were collected with a 20 l calibrated plastic container from the top 50 cm of the water column and subsamples were preserved immediately with lugol s solution 2 2 environmental parameters eighteen environmental parameters were included in the analyses grouped into four categories physicochemical eutrophication climate and hydrological parameters table 1 the physicochemical and eutrophication related parameters were based on field data collected during the survey the climate related parameters were three variables i e air temperature precipitation wind speed obtained through the closest meteorological station http meteosearch meteo gr regarding the hydrological parameters calculation these were modeled in a monthly step representing the actual operation conditions of lake karla from may 2014 until march 2015 using uthrl uthbal loukas et al 2007 2008 results were coupled with the database provided by the management body of the protected area karla mavrovouni kefalovryso velestino delta pinios and are in line with the research conducted by sidiropoulos et al 2017 the closest meteorological station s data located in velestino were adopted and hence precipitation and evaporation were calculated according to the altitude gradient deep infiltration and connection with the aquifer were modeled using lak3 package merritt and konikow 2000 for modflow water abstraction directly from the lake was deemed as zero because it is prohibited for irrigation purposes in that way a series of hydrological parameters were calculated table 1 2 3 phytoplankton community for phytoplankton taxonomic counting uterm√∂hl technique en 15204 2006 was adopted diversity was calculated with shannon h shannon 1948 evenness j pielou 1966 and simpson d simpson 1949 indices to correlate phytoplankton temporal and spatial variations with environmental conditions the updated phytoplankton reynolds functional groups rfgs list by padis√°k et al 2009 for lentic and lotic systems was used furthermore reynolds et al 2002 and relevant literature for grouping species in the mediterranean area e g becker et al 2010 √ßelik and sevindik 2015 demir et al 2014 soylu and g√∂n√ºlol 2010 was also considered 2 4 data processing and statistical analyses prior to analyses the seasonal mean values of the physicochemical parameters and rfgs were calculated the spearman correlation was performed within each category of environmental parameters to identify and exclude the intercorrelated ones rs 0 8 spss v24 all data were log x 1 transformed except for temperature and ph which were standardized two association matrices physicochemical parameters x stations rfgs x stations were generated using euclidean distance and bray curtis similarity respectively clarke and warwick 2001 analyses of similarities anosim 999 permutations of physicochemical parameters and rfgs were carried out to identify differences among the sampling sites and the seasons in anosim r values 0 75 indicate strong differences whereas r 0 5 implies overlapping but separate groups and r 0 25 non existing differences between groups clarke and warwick 2001 the results were plotted via multidimensional scaling mds additionally the similarity percentages simper analysis was performed to identify which physicochemical parameters and rfgs contributed most cut off contribution 90 for similarities and dissimilarities within and among seasons and sampling sites clarke et al 2014 all the above statistical analyses were applied using primer v6 software clarke and gorley 2006 then a redundancy analysis rda was performed to investigate the effects of environmental parameters on rfgs using the r package vegan oksanen et al 2006 the rda constrained a form of multiple regression of a multivariate set of predictor parameters on a multivariate set of response parameters to identify the most important explanatory parameters p 0 05 to be included in the prda a forward selection procedure was performed using r package pack for dray 2005 the contribution of the four groups of environmental parameters in structuring the rfgs composition was assigned through the use of variance partitioning with partial rda using the varpart function of the r library vegan oksanen et al 2006 this analysis allows the decomposition of the variance of the response matrix among sets of explanatory variables to identify the contributions to the total variance borcard et al 1992 legendre and legendre 1998 3 results 3 1 physicochemical and hydrological parameters variations of physicochemical parameters among stations and seasons were observed during the survey period table 2 the lake is a warm mean water temperature 17 42 c and alkalic mean value ph 8 56 water body conductivity varied from 0 80 ms cm in spr 14 at s1 to 8 00 ms cm in win 14 15 at s3 mostly rising throughout the survey period but without a clear trend the lowest values of dissolved oxygen were observed during the warm period 4 94 mg l at s3 while the highest 14

nitrate concentrations compared to the rest of the stations but co varied the highest value of ammonium was observed in spr 15 at s1 0 314 mg l while the lowest was in aut 14 at s2 0 035 mg l table 2 concentrations of ortho phosphates po4 p ranged from 0 050 mg l s1 spr 14 to 0 376 mg l s2 sum 14 with highest concentrations observed during the summer table 2 from the hydrological modelling of lake karla for the survey year the water balance was slightly positive with intra annual water level fluctuation a water level drop during summer months due to high evaporation 3 3 hm3 monthly finally resulted in an increase 0 8 m during winter mostly due to the inflow from pinios river and the direct precipitation in lake and less due to the inflow from the basin table 3 during the major part of the modeled period the inflow from pinios was merely adequate to balance the losses by evaporation 3 2 phytoplankton community in lake karla a total of 118 taxa was identified cyanobacteria 30 51 and chlorophytes 29 66 were the most specious groups followed by diatoms 8 47 from the ten diatom species recorded half were benthic besides the precautions taken in order to minimize turbulence caused by the sampling higher number of species was recorded in the cut off s1 station 98 taxa during all samplings but the total number of species recorded in the other stations did not differ greatly s2 88 s3 94 s4 95 on average 32 4 species were recorded in each sampling cyanobacteria were the most abundant group 10 besides feb 15 s3 reaching up to 86 in the station s1 followed by chlorophytes and diatoms the total abundance ranged from 5 104 to 6 105 cells filaments colonies per l and blooms were often recorded all stations showed a winter chlorophyte diatom abundance peak and a cyanobacteria peak during warm season and autumn prolonged warm period besides s1 where cyanobacteria were prevailing all year round unequal abundances among samples were revealed by shannon diversity index Œ∑ having monthly average values ranging from 2 56 to 4 06 fig 2 similarly simpson index d showed no dominance having monthly average values ranging from 0 09 up to 0 37 fig 2 quite even distribution among species abundances was also revealed by pielou s evenness index j 0 5 to 0 78 fig 2 spring is underrepresented due to the inexistence of multiple monthly samplings though the general trend is depicted describing in all seasons and stations a uniform distribution without dominant species the sum of the species identified was sorted in 23 rfgs the 6 groups contributing most to the total average abundance almost 70 are the s1 x1 d j lo and x3 with species usually found in shallow mixed and eutrophic lakes according to group traits in fig 3 the 10 rfgs explaining the 88 of the average abundance are presented in which half of the identified taxa 58 are included the identified representatives of these groups along with their usual habitats and sensitivities are presented in table 4 some species from other rfgs were also quite abundant but could not affect their groups total contribution in total abundance e g anabaenopsis elenkinii from h1 rfg or raphidiopsis raciborskii from sn the s1 and x1 groups were the most abundant ones in all seasons together exceeding 40 of each season s average abundance with representatives from the cyanobacteria and chlorophytes respectively also x3 contribution in spr 14 and win 14 15 j in sum 14 and d in spr 15 were important about 15 of each season s average abundance 3 3 spatial and temporal pattern of phytoplankton community the mds plots revealed a clear temporal distinction for physicochemical and rfgs fig 4 a and c while no clear spatial differences were discernible fig 4 b and d the anosim analysis comparing physicochemical and rfgs among seasons showed that r values were high r 0 929 all pairwise r 0 463 p 0 05 and r 0 546 all pairwise r 0 385 p 0 05 which indicated a temporal pattern in contrast r values among stations

hydrological with phytoplankton composition and dynamics in lake karla which is often subject to draught conditions it was based to a large extent on functional groups to pinpoint ecohydrological liaisons the case study of lake karla has particular interest since it had disappeared during a period of 60 years the lake refilled to fulfill human needs flooding protection irrigation drinking water but also as a biodiversity hot spot sidiropoulos et al 2017 although it is a protected area it has many peculiarities as is intensively hydrologically managed nutrient enriched with high water conductivity and a history of algal blooms fish and bird kills 4 1 variations of environmental drivers before refilling lake karla has experienced a long fertilization period chamoglou et al 2014 which resulted in internal loading processes from sediment resuspension bobori et al 2018 lake karla is also affected by agricultural and industrial land uses from the catchment area leading to eutrophication the water analysis carried out in lake karla the last years 2013 2015 bobori et al 2018 classified the lake as eutrophic with hypertrophic signals during the warm period according to the present survey a different nutrient profile was noticed namely lower concentrations of dissolved nutrients than previous study bobori et al 2018 in this study the nutrient concentrations fluctuated during the seasons corresponding both to fertilization periods and to potential sediment resuspension given the internal nutrient loading sidiropoulos et al 2017 due to its shallowness in all stations except from s3 station high no3 n concentrations were observed during autumn on the contrary high concentrations of ortho phosphates were observed in summer besides this temporal seasonal heterogeneity no spatial pattern was observed water level and lake volume were constantly low lower than the levels recorded during the first years 2010 2012 of refilling sidiropoulos et al 2012 loukas et al 2015 given the fact that the connection with pinios river was not fully operating during the survey year this restoration measure seem adequate to counterbalance the water volume excluding this artificial inflow the high evaporation combined with reduced inflows from the catchment and the low precipitation result in definite water level drop actually water level halved within 2 years 2012 2014 but more intensively during the survey year chamoglou et al 2014 affecting conductivity this parameter did not show a clear concentration or dilution effect or fertilizing period wash off but just kept rising through the survey period any other dry year might also affect the system s ecology probably in a similar way 4 2 spatial temporal variation the refilling of the lake along with the establishment of new hydro environmental conditions affected the biota profile reynolds functional groups showed no spatial patterns despite the station cut off and the dissimilarity among stations morphology and pressures this finding could prove that specific lake morphometric features or local pressures cannot support the forming or the existence of spatial niches within such a shallow eutrophic lake given the survey year was one of the driest inflow of pinios river was very low during 2014 and no flushing events took place during the phytoplankton growth period thus the input of external energy could not lead in decomposing the lake in horizontally heterogeneous units margalef 1994 mantzouki et al 2016 the highest dissimilarity was recorded when the cutoff station s1 was compared to the others partially supporting the view that hydrological connectivity promotes connectivity between the structural components of the system as the biota but was not adequate to separate it completely from the others major similarity was attributed to the most abundant s1 d and j groups all representatives of shallow mixed turbid eutrophic waters reynolds et al 2002 padis√°k et al 2009 this homogeneity given the degraded status described by the nutrient concentrations and augmented turbidity shows that perhaps proximity to sources of pollution flows and morphological traits e g substrate slope affect physicochemical variables but not enough to create different microhabitats and these in turn control the phytoplankton community as for the system s temporal dynamics the succession of taxa reflected by rfgs separate the winter and indicates that autumn is a more or less uninterrupted continuation of summer the particularity of warmer lakes as lake karla are not suitable for fitting to known limnological models but our data fit with the modified peg model for mediterranean lakes moustaka gouni et al 2014 these findings also support that physical factors that lead to seasonal cycles water level fluctuations water residence time water flow rates temperature can shift the seasonal dynamic of phytoplankton and thus the explanatory value of the environmental factors increases naselli flores and barone 2007 geraldes and boavida 2007 4 3 phytoplankton relation with environmental drivers lake karla was expected to support many of the rfgs containing cyanobacteria and chlorophytes as a shallow mediterranean eutrophic lake and it is confirmed also besides there was a waiting time in every sampling to reduce sediment resuspension several benthic diatoms species were found probably due to shallowness of the water column an interesting finding of the rda performed using rfgs is that h1 and sn which contains n fixing diazotroph cyanobacteria representatives appeared following fertilization and wash off period and the abundances raised from early summer until mid autumn both groups were positively correlated with the ortho phosphates concerning the rfgs correlated with air temperature besides sn and m microcystis spp mp gyrosigma sp appeared during the winter and h2 representatives lemmermaniella sp were found only during mid warm period july august with low abundance this in line with the fact that in polymictic medium high alkalinity humic lakes the phytoplankton community is explained by retention time peretyatko et al 2007 romo et al 2013 and a synergy between po4 p and temperature richardson et al 2018 reservoirs are generally more complex systems than natural lakes because of their interaction with the watershed tundisi and straskraba 1999 appearing environmental gradients which usually induce spatial heterogeneity the role of climatic variables was important according to the prda the example of karla s system could be considered more as a warm polymictic lake subjected to various hydrological alterations subject to frequent extreme and persistent droughts tzabiras et al 2015 coupled with the non regular inflow from pinios river 5 conclusions in conclusion based on the findings of this study the proximity to pollution sources and pressures were not adequate to form a spatial gradient in this newly lake reservoir system the functional groups did not show a particular preference for any discriminant lake feature thus characterizing the lake as homogenous on the other hand a clear temporal pattern with a prolonged warm period and uninterrupted winter succession was depicted it remains to be seen if these phytoplankton trends will still prevail in a fully operating reservoir and during a shift to wet conditions the dominant phytoplankton functional groups dŒø not exhibit spatial differences in these four out of the five stations used also in the national monitoring routine regarding the wfd implementation this could perhaps be capitalized towards reducing the monitoring effort furthermore the rfgs with the most abundant representatives seem to be susceptible in flushing and mixing from a management point of view these findings along with the expected regularity of inflows from pinios river and the already constructed technical infrastructure for flood management could be of use for rehabilitation planning by inducing artificial changes in hydrological patterns and flushing events coupled with the established artificial wetland for nutrient load reduction declaration

1063,vegetation living in agricultural channels drainage ditches or irrigation channels supports ecosystem functions such as water flow regulation retention of sediments agricultural pollutants and plant propagules and bank strengthening the review focuses on plant community functional parameters aggregations of plant functional traits and community properties that need to be considered to study the dynamics of these ecosystem functions to support further modeling work on the functioning of these semiaquatic ecosystems it also provides an up to date overview of the effects of channel management practices on vegetation because these practices are a potential lever with which to drive plant community functional parameters and properties and in turn ecosystem functions the review points out that the mean height density and flexibility of the plant cover sometimes integrated in the blockage factor mainly influence the average components of the water flow associated with the functions of water regulation and retention of sediments and non floating propagules the density of plants or area of the plant cover at the water surface are generally used to explain floating propagule retention the biomasses of living and dead vegetation are the properties used to assess the retention of agricultural pollutants root density and root length density as well as tensile strength of the root system are parameters generally associated with bank strengthening regarding the effects of channel management practices this work highlights that research generally has focused on the resulting plant richness and diversity but has not provided much information on associated plant community functional parameters and properties keywords ditch irrigation channel plant community properties plant community functional parameters ecosystem function management practices 1 introduction networks of agricultural channels irrigation channels and drainage ditches play a considerable role in the abiotic and biotic fluxes in agricultural landscapes irrigation channels are built to conduct water from a source to its place of use l√≥pez pomares et al 2015 ditches are built to transfer excess water from agricultural plots levavasseur et al 2012 they also play an antierosive role in places where high water velocities occur such as in mediterranean landscapes with steep slopes ramos and porta 1997 roose and sabir 2002 and play a drainage role carluer and marsily 2004 krause et al 2007 in places where the water table has to be lowered to enable cultivation their existence results from human decision making and sometimes their establishment took place hundreds of years ago berger 2000 they are organized into networks i e they are connected to each other hydraulically as well as ecologically their density can reach 200 m ha in mediterranean landscapes levavasseur et al 2015 agricultural channels cover a limited surface area of landscapes for example ditch networks in mediterranean areas never represent more than 4 of cultivated areas based on data from levavasseur et al 2014b most of these agricultural channels are uncoated earth channels and especially the small ones no more than 1 5 meters in width that are located upstream of the network for drainage ditches and downstream of the network for irrigation channels these small agricultural channels therefore can host flora and fauna species herzon and helenius 2008 they also are generally subject to intermittent flows associated with rainfall frequency and intensity or irrigation the flora encountered in channels is generally not specific to these ecosystems i e it is encountered in other places of the catchment although in some contexts we can find plants of conservation interest mountford and arnold 2006 agricultural networks are important habitats for floral species herzon and helenius 2008 that were located in natural freshwater bodies and floodplains in the past armitage et al 2003 because they often represent the only sources of open water in agricultural landscapes channels and ditches generally have a high plant diversity meier et al 2017 plants living in agricultural channels are generally terrestrial or semiaquatic composed mainly of forbs and graminoids bouldin et al 2004 clarke 2015 levavasseur et al 2014a maheu giroux and blois 2006 rudi et al 2018b szymura et al 2009 and sometimes strictly aquatic clarke 2015 janse 1998 milsom et al 2004 according to the topographic climatic and pedological contexts as well as location in the channels network the vegetation must be managed regularly by users farmers and irrigation managers to restore its hydraulic capacity for transport dollinger et al 2015 in mediterranean agricultural areas one or two practices such as mowing burning clearing and chemical weeding are conducted every year levavasseur et al 2014a s√§nchez mart√≠n et al 2018 dredging is carried out every 5 to 10 years to remove the deposited sediments these frequencies can vary according to pedoclimatic context milsom et al 2004 twisk et al 2003 these management practices according to their typology frequency and location in the channel can alter the ditch bed material dollinger et al 2015 and vegetation in the short term they directly affect the shape of the plant cover dollinger et al 2017 levavasseur et al 2014a but in the medium and long term management practices have the additional effect of modifying the composition of plant communities and their dynamics leng et al 2011 manhoudt et al 2007 milsom et al 2004 rudi 2019 s√§nchez mart√≠n et al 2018 twisk et al 2003 nowadays studies have highlighted the multifunctionality of agricultural channels vegetation dollinger et al 2015 herzon and helenius 2008 pierce et al 2012 which is a significant provider of functions such as water flow regulation and bank strengthening as well as sediment agricultural pollutant and plant propagule retention a propagule is any structure for dispersal or reproduction i e seeds spores and rhizomes this multifunctionality of vegetation living in agricultural channels explains why these infrastructures are often referred to as agroecological relying properly on these ecosystem functions could decrease intervention time and costs for farmers by reducing soil loss from farmed areas decreasing the frequency of bank failure and reducing weed spreading while limiting overflows it could also help decrease the concentrations of sediments and agricultural pollutants in receiving ecosystems which could result in lower water treatment costs for society these functions are mainly influenced by physical and to a lesser extent chemical biological interactions between vegetation and water flow fields in the channel as a consequence the dynamics of the functions result mainly from i the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation in the agricultural channels and ii the spatiotemporal components of water flow fields which especially depend on the frequency and intensity of rainfalls and irrigations as well as the topological pedological and morphological characteristics of the channel dollinger et al 2015 it seems reasonable to think that vegetation would be a powerful lever with which to optimize channels ecosystem functions because i vegetation is already managed by farmers regularly and ii the management of vegetation produces few negative impacts on the ecosystem if properly conducted for studying and modeling channels ecosystem functions a relevant spatial scale has to be chosen nepf 2012b when estimating channels functions at the landscape scale the resolution at which the channels need to be studied is the reach scale rudi 2019 in this paper the term reach refers to a channel section with homogeneous properties as defined in lagacherie et al 2006 which generally corresponds to a description of vegetation at the community level community functional parameters are plant functional traits aggregated at the level of the community for example mean height and a community property is a feature estimated at the community level for example density violle et al 2007 better consideration of these plant community functional parameters and properties in the modeling of ecosystems functioning should enhance our ability to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of the ecosystem functions that they provide diaz et al 2003 lavorel et al 2017 mori et al 2013 and it would provide us with information on the parameters and properties that we need to measure and monitor in the field additionally it would allow us to know which type of vegetation is desirable in channels in terms of parameters properties rather than species which would provide more generic rules to managers and stakeholders for managing ecosystems functions rudi 2019 although these types of approaches are currently encouraged several challenges remain as the community functional parameters and properties responsible for the dynamics of ecosystem functions have not been clearly identified moreover if management practices anthropogenic drivers represent a lever with which to manage the dynamics of these parameters and properties and in turn ecosystem functions dollinger et al 2016 2017 vinatier et al 2018 it would be useful to collect data on the effects of these practices on plant community parameters and properties the first objective of the review was to determine the plant community functional parameters and community properties involved in three main functions of agricultural channels i water flow regulation ii retention and iii bank strengthening we focused on parameters and properties that have a clearly established relationship with the studied functions that has been documented in research papers the second objective was to collect data on the effect of management practices on plant community functional parameters and properties the review first presents an overview of ecosystem functions provided by vegetation in agricultural channels then it presents an up to date overview of plant community functional parameters and properties generally associated with the studied ecosystem functions in the last section the review presents what we currently know about the effect of management practices on the dynamics of plant community functional parameters and community properties in agricultural channels 2 material and methods scope of the study and methodology the review focuses on uncoated and therefore vegetated channels located in temperate climatic contexts with a focus on mediterranean agricultural areas in terms of morphology a study by levavasseur et al 2012 revealed that 75 of ditches in a mediterranean agricultural landscape had a width between 50 to 120 cm and a depth between 30 and 80 cm mediterranean irrigation channels range from widths depths of a few meters upstream of the network to widths depths of 50 cm dowsntream the channels bordering the plots rudi 2019 the ratio depth on width of agricultural channels is therefore more important than for natural waterways rudi 2019 in this study we will focus on agricultural channels with slopes under 5 because channels with steep slopes were poorly studied to this day as underlined in the introduction they can be intermittent or permanent according to the climatic context and location according to the network bulk velocities range from some centimeters per second to an order of magnitude of 1 m s 1 in accordance with the maximal depths of the channels the water depth rarely exceeds 1 2 meters the flow regime is most of the time subcritical to gather data on plant community functional parameters and properties involved in water flow regulation retention and bank strengthening as well as on the effect of management practices on plant communities in agricultural channels we relied on four scientific databases science direct wiley online library springer link and google scholar we then collected all papers that contained the keyword ditch irrigation channel and irrigation canal with vegetation or plant resulting in 5087 papers we then sorted the relevant papers resulting in 146 papers dealing with the interactions between vegetation and the studied ecosystem functions and with their management practices in agricultural channels or flumes the papers collected from databases as well as other additional relevant papers were read and studied carefully around 250 note that papers relying on flume experiments although not conducted in agricultural areas were considered relevant for understanding some of the studied functions due to the physical similarity and comparable morphologies and hydraulic conditions of flumes and small agricultural channels the relationships between individual plant traits community functional parameters and properties and ecosystem functions are presented in fig 1 3 overview of the functions of vegetation in agricultural channels agricultural channel vegetation is generally composed of terrestrial and semiaquatic species bouldin et al 2004 clarke 2015 maheu giroux and blois 2006 rudi et al 2018b szymura et al 2009 and sometimes of strictly aquatic species cassan et al 2015 clarke 2015 janse 1998 milsom et al 2004 sabbatini et al 1998 according to the flow regime especially intermittence or not and other conditions topographic climatic and pedological they form sparse or dense cover that is homogeneously distributed in the channel or forms patches as illustrated in fig 2 vegetation is involved in ecosystem functions that have already been highlighted in other research works focusing on agricultural channels aspe et al 2016 dollinger et al 2015 herzon and helenius 2008 needelman et al 2007 pierce et al 2012 three main types of functions provided by agricultural channels vegetation have been identified fig 3 the first of these functions is water flow regulation water flow regulation in agricultural channels can be assessed through average components of water flow such as velocity and water height the modification of these components in a plurality of locations in the network can in turn affect the discharge and hydrograms at the outlet of the networks of channels the presence of vegetation usually generates hydraulic resistance and therefore reduces water velocity and increases water height the effect of vegetation on water flow regulation is particularly interesting under conditions of heavy rainfalls and steep slopes as can be found in mediterranean landscapes because vegetation in agricultural channels can contribute to mitigating the peak of floods according to the topological conditions and organization of the channels network moussa et al 2002 the second ecosystem function provided by agricultural channel vegetation is retention sediments agricultural pollutants and plant propagules the presence of vegetation can enhance retention by three main means i it can affect the components of the water flow and then favor sedimentation of particles transported in the water column ii it can mechanically retain particles and iii dissolved pollutants can be absorbed or adsorbed by vegetation the retention of sediments can reduce the turbidity of water in receiving ecosystems at the outlet of the ditch networks fiener and auerswald 2003 flora and kr√∂ger 2014 vegetation also slows the transfer of pesticides to receiving ecosystems dollinger et al 2015 2016 lagacherie et al 2006 margoum et al 2003 and therefore favors their degradation in the channels last standing vegetation influences the dispersal of species through agricultural channels by retaining plant propagules seeds and other propagules such as rhizomes transported by water rudi et al 2018a soomers et al 2010 this limits the spread of adventitious propagules in cultivated areas rudi et al 2018a but consequently also limits the dispersal of non adventitious or protected species the last type of function is bank strengthening terrestrial and semiaquatic vegetation plays a part in maintaining the banks of waterways through the dissipation of hydraulic energy due to the presence of the aboveground part of the plants but also through the stabilization and limitation of soil bank loss due to the development of the root system de baets et al 2006 ghestem et al 2011 mamo and bubenzer 2001 pollen bankhead and simon 2010 we therefore assume that the effects of vegetation are similar between agricultural channels and natural waterways in the following paragraphs we aim to characterize plant functional community parameters and properties involved in the ecosystem functions described above 4 characterization of plant community functional parameters and properties involved in ecosystem functions of vegetation 4 1 plant community functional parameters and properties involved in water flow regulation the function of water regulation is generally assessed through the velocity of the water flow and the height of the water column water velocity and height mainly rely on imposed hydraulic conditions inflow downstream conditions as well as on a physical quantity called hydraulic resistance in agricultural channels hydraulic resistance is largely driven by vegetation when it is present in the channels hydraulic resistance induced by vegetation in channels can be studied at different spatial resolutions i at the plant resolution or lower resolution such as the stem or leaf scale when relevant but this approach is not practicable when estimating ecosystem functions in a whole network of channels ii at the resolution of small homogeneous plant covers iii at the reach resolution in this case the total hydraulic resistance is generally encompassed in a global resistance coefficient 4 1 1 characterization of the hydraulic resistance of homogeneous plant covers in small sections of channels plant cover in agricultural channels exerts a drag force opposite to the motion of the water a quadratic drag law can be used to assess this spatially averaged drag force f eq 1 1 f 1 2 c d a œÅ v 2 where cd is the drag coefficient a is the area of plants projected in the flow direction l 2 œÅ is the density of water m l 3 and vis the local flow velocity l t 1 the coefficient cd is dependent on community parameters and properties such as the projected area a nepf 2012a and therefore on density d li and shen 1973 mean diameter d li and shen 1973 and morphology james et al 2004 nepf 2012a as well as flexibility james et al 2004 nepf 2012b explains that for large reynolds numbers calculated at the stem scale it is reasonable to choose a constant drag coefficient cd between 0 7 and 1 5 this drag coefficient is often fixed at 1 when no data are available for estimating it more accurately in contrast for small stem reynolds numbers cd can take larger values and increases as the reynolds number decreases tanino and nepf 2008 velocity fields are heterogeneous within plant cover nepf 2012a generally studies differentiate emergent and submerged plant covers because the mean velocity and turbulence fields can be truly different in these two conditions defina and bixio 2005 finnigan 2000 nepf and vivoni 2000 fig 4 the scale of turbulence in submerged plant covers is also dependent on the density of the cover which is generally defined as sparse or dense table 1 sparse submerged covers are covers with approximately cdahp 0 04 and dense submerged covers are covers with approximately cdahp 0 1 belcher et al 2003 nepf et al 2007 with a representing the frontal area of the plant cover by volume and hp the height of the plant cover note that all conditions sparse and dense plant covers as well as submerged and emergent covers are commonly found in agricultural channels in emergent conditions the mean velocity inside the vegetation is always lower than that for a bare bed channel however the vegetation concomitantly creates an increase in turbulence the turbulence inside the plant cover is greater than that due to bed friction and therefore the total turbulence cannot be predicted from only the bed shear velocity nepf 2012b as is commonly done in studies on bare beds in submerged conditions two main configurations are observed nepf 2012b fig 4 if the plant cover is sparse the velocity profile has the shape of a turbulent boundary layer in this case turbulence intensity increases with vegetation density nepf 2012a if the plant cover is dense the velocity profile has an inflection point as observed in fig 4 c when the vegetation is dense and thus an inflection point occurs in the velocity profile plant cover scale vortices are expected to appear brown and roshko 1974 it is possible to predict the length of penetration Œ¥e of these kelvin helmholtz vortices in the plant cover nepf et al 2007 this length of penetration decreases with an increasing density of stems for 0 2 cdahp 1 Œ¥e c d a 1 nepf et al 2007 when cdahp 0 2 Œ¥e hp and the vortex penetrates to the bed lastly when c d a 1 2 d Œ¥e 2d white and nepf 2008 in both emergent and submerged conditions flexible vegetation can bend under the effect of water velocity this phenomenon is called reconfiguration vogel 1996 and is dependent on water velocity the streamlining of the vegetation with increasing water velocity might also change the friction coefficient c at the interface of the top of the plant cover and the free layer of water aberle and j√§rvel√§ 2013 luhar and nepf 2011 then chapman et al 2015 proposed the prediction of drag coefficients for plants or flexible elements with different flexibilities in real conditions in agricultural channels most of the vegetation is flexible because it is composed mainly of nonligneous species to the best of our knowledge no estimation of flexibility for a whole plant community has been conducted and research has generally considered individual plants despite the importance of this property for understanding flow patterns a flexible cover can move according to the mean and turbulent fields nepf and ghisalberti 2008 the progressive waving of the vegetation due to the passage of the kelvin helmholtz vortices is named monami and was first observed for seagrasses fonseca and kenworthy 1987 grizzle et al 1996 and then experimentally characterized in flumes for example see okamoto et al 2016 in their study okamoto et al 2016 revealed that the quantity of vegetation waving at the same time was associated with the lenght scale of the turbulence in the mixing layer zone 4 1 2 characterization of hydraulic resistance in real plant cover at the reach scale hydraulic resistance at the reach scale is generally described by a resistance coefficient which is commonly the manning n darcy weisbach or chezy coefficient but some authors have proposed other coefficients for example james et al 2004 in traditional hydraulic engineering resistance coefficients were assessed through visual aspect of channel then refering to tables linking channels features including vegetation to resistance coefficient values see chow 1959 for example manning s coefficient n is widely used and is associated to flow characteristics by manning s equation manning 1890 eq 2 2 n r 2 3 i s 1 2 u with r the hydraulic radius l is the energy grade line slope l l 1 and uthe cross sectional area averaged velocity l t 1 however vegetation presenting very different morphologies and characteristics according to the context this approach was considered as limiting and led to inaccurate values of resistance coefficients green 2005a this led many authors to propose formulas allowing to predict resistance from measurable plant community parameters and properties note that as underlined by folkard 2011 it seems that the use of resistance coefficient n to account for vegetation resistance is only valid when the height of vegetation cover is low compared to the height of water however despite the lack of theoretical validity n is still really used in practice research focusing on flow resistance caused by vegetation at the reach scale increased approximately 15 years ago first luhar et al 2008 highlighted that in natural channels the architecture of the submerged vegetation was of low importance for predicting the resistance coefficient luhar and nepf 2013 showed that the individual description of all patches with their own properties did not give very different results for resistance coefficient predictions compared to those obtained with an average description at the reach scale according to green 2005b luhar et al 2008 nikora et al 2008 the blockage factor b had the best explanatory power for three resistance coefficients manning darcy weisbach and chezy the blockage factor b is the fraction of channel cross section occupied by vegetation b whp wh with w and hp being respectively the width and height of the vegetation cover w the width of the channel and h the height of water the relationship between the resistance coefficient and b has been reported as nonlinear by many authors nepf 2012a nikora et al 2008 vinatier et al 2017 nikora et al 2008 interpreted this nonlinearity as the result of a decrease of bed contribution to total resistance with an increase in vegetation and suggested that linear formulas were thus poorly accurate in emergent conditions fathi maghadam and kouwen 1997 showed that the shape and distribution of vegetation were poor descriptors of resistance equations and highlighted the role of vegetation density d aberle and j√§rvel√§ 2013 argued that the density and ability for reconfiguration were the most important properties for determining the resistance this was empirically inferred with decreasing exponential laws in bailly et al 2015 recently rubol et al 2018 successfully modeled the resistance by representing the vegetation as a porous medium many formulas predicting resistance coefficients based on plant community parameters and properties have been developed some of them are presented in table 2 in practice at the network scale few hydraulic or hydrological models consider the resistance created by vegetation especially its spatialization at the resolution of reaches when vegetative resistance is considered its relationship with vegetation properties is highly simplified as in doncker et al 2009 or bertoldi et al 2014 who considered a really simplified relationship between vegetation biomass and the resistance coefficient these last two examples have been found for natural waterways no studies on this subject were found for agricultural channels 4 2 plant community functional parameters and properties involved in retention of sediments agricultural pollutants and plant propagules 4 2 1 sediment transport and deposition it is generally considered that the presence of vegetation is associated with increased sedimentation of suspended particles in rivers flumes and agricultural channels abt et al 1994 cotton et al 2006 l√≥pez and garc√≠a 1998 and decreased bed load transport kothyari et al 2009 however some researchers have observed the opposite such as van katwijk et al 2010 who reported negative net sedimentation in patches of sparse vegetation seagrass compared with a bare bed at the local scale palmer et al 2004 described the capture by a plant stem of small suspended particles range 177 210 Œºm relying on a metrics named the particle capture efficiency Œ∑ using an empirical formula eq 3 of the form 3 Œ∑ a r e c b d p d c with a b and c positive constants rec the collector reynolds number described as rec ud ŒΩ and dp the particle diameter based on the same formalisms fauria et al 2015 showed the significant role of the biofilms developing on vegetation for small particles capture range 1 25 250 Œºm in some aquatic systems note that these biofilms developing on freshwater vegetation have been mainly characterized in streams besemer 2015 and marshes buesing et al 2009 they present an important diversity affected by several interacting factors although abundance and community assemblage of biofilms seem specifically affected by the presence of inorganic nutrients and dissolved organic matter olapade and leff 2005 relying on plant density conditions relevant to the ones found in agricultural channels 2724 and 7209 s t e m s m 2 and on a natural biofilm developed in eutrophic conditions fauria et al 2015 determined new coefficients for the formulation of the particle capture efficiency Œ∑ especially with b a negative exponent highlighting the fact that particle retention is decreased with increased flow velocity coming back to a more traditional approach for bare beds the settling velocity of the particles and the minimal shear stress for entrainment are generally used to model entrainment and transport to understand the interactions between sediment transport and vegetation in channels more deeply nepf 2012a reported that sediment transport was linked not only to the mean bed stress as for bare bed sediment transport but also to the profile of turbulence indeed luhar et al 2008 found that in sparse plant cover the turbulent stress remained elevated close to the bed whereas it was reduced in dense plant cover for plant cover for which cdahp 0 1 the resuspension is of the same order of magnitude as that for bare bed channels in other words plant cover below this threshold has a limited influence on sediment retention moore 2004 even noted enhanced erosion under these conditions due to the augmentation of stem scale turbulence for plant cover above this threshold we observed in paragraph 4 1 1 that the penetration scale of the kevin helmholtz vortices was dependent on the density of the stems in this case the higher the density the more important the sheltering between adjacent stems as a consequence the bed is protected from the turbulent stress caused by kevin helmholtz vortices and the momentum transfer is therefore extremely reduced additionally the mean bed stress is generally reduced in the presence of vegetation nepf 2012a but the methods used to characterize it are still controversial nepf 2012a yang et al 2015 recently yang et al 2015 presented a formula eq 4 for estimating the effective friction velocity u eff in the presence of vegetation but only for plant covers with frontal areas per volumetric unit a up to 4 3 m 1 4 u e f f m a x c f v 0 2 ŒΩ v 0 d with v 0 the local time averaged velocity in the uniform layer l t 1 cf the drag coefficient for the bare bed ŒΩ the kinematic viscosity of water l 2 t 1 and dthe diameter of the stems l under these conditions stem diameter d is considered a determining parameter for bed shear stress independent of density other studies focused on the effects of patches of vegetation on sediment transport and deposition ortiz et al 2013 zong and nepf 2011 in the wake behind a patch it seems that sedimentation is increased but this appears to be true only for emergent and rigid patches ortiz et al 2013 however at the leading edge of the patch where the flow is generally deflected the net deposition is reduced compared to that of the bare bed zong and nepf 2011 bouma et al 2007 and sand jensen and vindb√¶k madsen 1992 reported that these two mechanisms explained why patches generally grow in length but rarely grow in width along open channels nepf 2012a and solari et al 2016 reported that no general model currently exists for sediment transport in vegetated channels first most of the models are based on the estimation of bed shear stress however as stated before the bed shear stress in vegetated flows is very difficult to calculate nepf 2012a yang et al 2015 second as turbulence is reported as an influential parameter for resuspension and transport under some conditions bed shear stress might not be sufficient to take into account the effect of vegetation on sediment transport vollmer and kleinhans 2007 4 2 2 agricultural pollutants pesticides and nutrients retention sorption is a major mechanism involved in pesticides retention in agricultural areas dousset et al 2010 stehle et al 2011 in particular in farmed ditches dollinger et al 2015 this has been demonstrated for an insecticide pyrethroid bennett et al 2005 and a herbicide diuron dollinger et al 2016 margoum et al 2006 sorption increases with increasing organic content for most pesticides namely hydrophobic ones margoum et al 2006 this explains that an effective retention has been observed not only in the presence of living vegetation but also in the presence of litter dead vegetation at the bottom of agricultural channels based on these principles margoum et al 2003 proposed a retention index based on the relative cover in the wetted section of channel of living vegetation dead vegetation and sediments reported as herbicide retention power hrp in lagacherie et al 2006 eq 5 5 h r p l v 2 d v 0 5 s d with lv the relative cover of living vegetation dv the relative cover of dead vegetation and sd the relative cover of sediments more recently dollinger et al 2016 proposed a sorption induced pesticide retention indicator spri directly based on masses of the different elements composing the bottom and banks of the channel including living and dead vegetation eq 6 6 s p r i i n m i k d i i n m i k d i v l 100 with i being material i composing the channel i e living vegetation dead vegetation soil ash mi the corresponding mass of material i m kdi the linear adsorption coefficient l 3 m 1 and vl the volume of water flowing during a flow event l 3 additionally absorption of pesticides by vegetation is also expected to play a role in retention but it is not easy to differentiate between absorption and adsorption in field experiments moore et al 2011 vegetation can also indirectly drive the retention of pesticides prone to adsorption on sediments by influencing sedimentation rates under some conditions see paragraph 4 2 1 vegetation can also increase water retention times and therefore favor sorption dollinger 2016 and biodegradation mechanisms liu et al 2012 regarding nutrients castaldelli et al 2015 showed that n uptake by agricultural channel vegetation was low but that vegetation played a role in microbial denitrification by providing interfaces favoring the activity of bacteria to the best of our knowledge only janse 1998 proposed a model assessing nutrient uptake by vegetation in agricultural channels based on the biomasses of plant functional groups as for pesticides nutrients that tend to be transported bounded on sediments for example p might also be retained by vegetation through increased sedimentation bouldin et al 2004 liu et al 2008 4 2 3 plant propagule retention traditionally studies on hydrochorous plant propagule dispersal distinguishes nonfloating and floating propagules usually seeds indeed seeds can be transported in the bedload suspended in the flow or at the water surface carthey et al 2016 for nonfloating seeds gurnell 2007 established an analogy between sediment and seed transport this was confirmed by an experiment led by chambert and james 2009 who concluded that the main factors explaining the entrainment and deposition of nonfloating seeds were minimum critical shear stress necessary for their entrainment and the settling velocity therefore the plant community functional parameters and properties of the standing vegetation involved in the retention of nonfloating seeds are the same as those described in paragraph 4 2 1 for floating seeds defina and peruzzo 2010 reported the four main mechanisms governing the seed plant interactions in an artificial flume the cheerios effect when a seed is attracted by the meniscus around the stem due to surface tension forces vella and mahadevan 2005 inertial impaction when a collision between a seed and plant results in a change in the direction of the seed palmer et al 2004 wake trapping when the seed is temporarily trapped in the recirculation zone behind a stem white and nepf 2003 and net trapping when plants form a net that stops the seeds defina and peruzzo 2010 many studies mainly focused on the cheerios effect highlighted the role of stem density more precisely the mean centre to centre spacing in the rate of propagules retention defina and peruzzo 2012 liu et al 2019 white and nepf 2003 net trapping depends on the density height and spatial distribution of plants in the reach homogeneous distribution or existence of patches as well as on plant architectures at the water surface rudi and vinatier personnal observation at low velocities the cheerios effect is important but it disappears progressively as turbulent diffusion phenomena become too important chambert and james 2009 defina and peruzzo 2012 peruzzo et al 2012 2016 net trapping is generally predominant when stem density and water turbulence are important defina and peruzzo 2010 in addition for floating seeds the velocity fields at the water surface significantly influence the deposition of seeds soomers et al 2010 in this context emergent vegetation can be considered a porous obstacle modifying the velocity fields defina and peruzzo 2010 and the presence of vegetation is susceptible to creating recessional flows recirculating flows or eddies which explain in great part the variations in seed retention along a channel merritt and wohl 2002 nilsson et al 1991 due to the inherent difficulty of taking into account some plant parameters such as the specific architecture of plants at the scale of the community in heterogeneous plant covers rudi et al 2018a vinatier et al 2018 relied on a measure of the area of vegetation at the water surface at the scale of a section of approximately one meter accounting for the porosity of vegetation because this property was assumed to explain seed deposition with good performance these metrics were assessed through image analysis structure from motion using multi view stereo algorithm note however that this approach is less performing in case of abundant vegetation because the highest strata of vegetation might hide the water surface in some images 4 3 plant community functional parameters and properties involved in bank strengthening plants growing in agricultural channels have root systems that develop on the channel bottom or bank soil substrates most monocotyledons have fibrous root systems and dicotyledons generally have taproot systems from which other roots sometimes grow laterally beyond this coarse differentiation channels plants exhibit a gradient of root systems differing in length deepness diameter architecture junction and spatial distribution in soils these root parameters and properties in interaction with soil properties channel morphology and hydrologic hydraulic regimes greatly influence the stability of channels banks some parameters and properties of root systems such as root density rd de baets et al 2006 root length density rld corresponding to the cumulative length of root per soil unit volume de baets et al 2006 pollen bankhead and simon 2010 root biomass and total root volume pollen bankhead and simon 2010 have been reported to have an effect on the limitation of the erosion rates of banks and therefore on bank strengthening it has been shown that the volume of eroded soil is a negative exponential of rld or rd de baets et al 2006 pollen bankhead and simon 2010 due to this nonlinearity there appears to be a threshold of rld above which an increase in rld has little effect on the eroded volume of soil this threshold was found to be approximately 50 k m r o o t s m s o i l 3 by pollen bankhead and simon 2010 for switchgrass panicum virgatum and approximately 400 k m r o o t s m s o i l 3 by de baets et al 2006 for a mixture of lolium sp and festuca sp the difference in the values of the threshold could arise not only from differences in root properties especially diameter distributions in the soil profile but also from differences in experimental conditions the negative exponential shape observed between rld and rd and the volume of eroded soil led de baets et al 2006 to propose a power and a hill curve functions for this relationship for which they obtained good correlation coefficients equations 7 and 8 7 r s d 16 38 r l d 0 78 8 r s d r l d 2 22 r l d 2 22 0 000026 with rsd being the relative soil detachment rate however it seems difficult to experimentally differentiate the influence of the aboveground and belowground parts of the plant mamo and bubenzer 2001 zhang et al 2013 indeed aboveground part of the plant community also tend to dissipate hydraulic energy and therefore protect the banks soils from hydraulic erosion some aboveground plant architectures such as the presence of rosettes can also protect the soil kramer and weaver 1936 in addition some parameters such as the distribution of root diameters in a soil unit and the number of roots were reported to be related to the full root tensile strength which is frequently used in models evaluating the stability of stream banks and based on mechanical reinforcement pollen bankhead and simon 2009 fibrous roots operstein and frydman 2000 and fibrils li et al 1991 are considered more efficient than taproots zhang et al 2013 in increasing soil resistance the technical literature on waterway bank strengthening suggests sowing the banks with perennial and fibrous rooted vegetation such as elymus sp calamagrostis sp phleum sp apel 2015 or tripsacum dactyloides ghestem et al 2011 however according to reubens et al 2007 it seems that for slope stabilization plants with deep anchorage and many lateral roots for example dicotyledons would be more effective than plants with only fibrous roots ghestem et al 2011 also stressed the importance of considering the network of macropores pores from 30 ¬µm generally of biotic origin in the mechanisms governing slope stability and therefore bank strengthening indeed high convergence of macropores or dead end macropores can generate high pore water pressure in turn destabilizing the banks root orientation upslope or downslope is also of great importance deep rooted plants generally perform better than shallow rooted plants in terms of driving water away from unstable areas however well developed fibrous and shallow root systems can help dissipate pore water pressures that could otherwise concentrate in one location ghestem et al 2011 finally pollen bankhead and simon 2010 highlighted the hydrological effect of root systems on bank stability total evapotranspiration driven by the composition of the plant community removes water from the soil and therefore influences soil matrix suction this is assumed to influence apparent soil cohesion but this hydrological effect of plants on bank stability is still difficult to quantify pollen bankhead and simon 2010 5 effects of channel management practices on plant community functional parameters and properties the main aim of managing a ditch or a channel is to restore its hydraulic capacity dollinger et al 2015 s√§nchez mart√≠n et al 2018 different management practices mowing dredging burning chemical weeding and clearing affect the communities in the short term less than one year and medium between one and five years and long term more than five years in the short term the practices of mowing dredging burning and chemical weeding affect the dynamics of height density and porosity of vegetation as was illustrated by dollinger et al 2017 vinatier et al 2018 see fig 5 these two studies related the dynamics of functional parameters and properties of plant communities driven by management practices throughout the year to the dynamics of ecosystem functions in which vegetation is involved especially water regulation and pollutant and propagule retention the two papers suggested that both the temporality and type of practice are determinant of the resulting ecosystem functions in the medium term dredging allows a return to the early stages of vegetation succession clarke 2015 and therefore allows more replacements of plant species teurlincx et al 2018 mowing and burning generally maintain or improve richness and diversity chaudron et al 2016 milsom et al 2004 s√§nchez mart√≠n et al 2018 these practices influence competitive interactions betweens species because the distribution of water nutrients and light is modified indeed frequently disturbed ecosystems have been reported to be less competitive than natural ones connell 1978 odum 1969 successions at a multiyear scale after management are generally characterized by strictly aquatic plants in the early stages and emergent facultative plants and herbs in the late stages clarke 2015 milsom et al 2004 which implies different parameters and properties janse 1998 showed that the level of nutrient n and p that depends on management practices in adjacent fields and inside the ditch influenced the composition of the plant community duckweed was mainly found in highly loaded ditches and submerged plants were found in poorly loaded ditches they showed that there was a critical level in nutrient input that triggered the shift in plant community composition note that most studies on channel management practices focused on general indices of richness diversity or productivity and did not clearly evaluate the response of vegetation in terms of community parameters or properties moreover the long term effect of management practices on community composition has been poorly studied and is difficult to predict blomqvist et al 2006 6 discussion in conclusion the vegetation in agricultural channels is involved in three main ecosystem functions i water regulation ii retention of sediments propagules and agricultural pollutants iii bank strengthening at the local scale parameters and properties such as the drag coefficient frontal area density height stem diameter and flexibility are generally used to assess the effect of vegetation on water flow at the reach scale the parameters and properties used to assess water flow regulation are mainly the mean height of the plant cover porosity flexibility and the density of the plant community these parameters and properties are sometimes integrated in a global property named the blockage factor which is the fraction of channel cross section occupied by vegetation the mean height and density of plant cover are easily measurable it is far more complicated to measure the flexibility rudi 2019 porosity vinatier et al 2018 or blockage factor vinatier et al 2017 of a vegetation cover regarding the retention function sediments and nonfloating seeds the parameters and properties generally used to assess the effect of vegetation on the function are those affecting the mean velocity and the turbulence especially the drag coefficient density diameters of stems and height as well as the width of patches however this function has been generally studied in small sections of channels due to the complexity of the processes involved indeed the calculation of bed shear stress in the presence of vegetation and the quantification of turbulence and its influence on particle transport are far from being elucidated for floating propagules especially floating seeds the height of the plant cover is the most influencial parameter because only emergent vegetation is involved in retention the architecture of individual plants and the spatial distribution of the plants play a significant role in net trapping in practice the total area of the plants at the water surface is generally associated with seed retention for agricultural pollutants the biomass of living or dead vegetation in contact with them is the plant community property generally used to assess the retention function for n and p retention biomass is also influential because vegetation can both absorb nutrients and create interfaces for biodegradation but the quantification of n and p decay in agricultural channels has mainly been demonstrated experimentally only a few studies have proposed to model it to date see for example janse 1998 for bank strengthening aboveground community parameters and properties involved in the control of the average components of water flow are those associated with the dissipation of hydraulic energy aboveground parts of the plant community play a role in protecting the banks soils from hydraulic erosion belowground community functional parameters such as root density and root length density are frequently used for the prediction of soil loss under different hydraulic conditions and the number of roots per unit area of soil and the total tensile strength associated with these roots are often used in bank stability models the plant parameters and properties involved in the studied ecosystem functions are summarized in table 3 this review pointed out that knowledge of the effect of plant functional parameters and properties on channel ecosystem functions is far more developed for water regulation than for the other functions mechanisms underlying water regulation have been described both at the local scale and at the reach scale using physical and semiempirical approaches although research on the effect of heterogeneous vegetation cover on water flow fields remains to be conducted bank strengthening has been explored especially for waterways with models based on the number of roots and tensile strength which do not explicitly take into account the complexity of the relationships between soil texture structure root systems and their effect on the hydrological status of the soil matrix this can be partly explained by i the complexity of the relationships between soils and roots that involve physical biological and chemical processes ii the difficulty of measuring belowground properties and parameters and iii the dynamic nature of the contributions of the different effects of roots on bank stability pollen bankhead and simon 2010 moreover regarding root systems other properties parameters such as root system architecture and orientation with respect to the banks of the channel as well as the hydrological effect of root systems on soil reinforcement have been poorly explored nonfloating propagules and sediment retention is still difficult to model at the reach scale due to the complexity of the processes involved especially due to the effect of turbulent phenomena in vegetated channels the retention of pesticides as well as nutrients is generally related to total plant biomass which is an integrative parameter due to the difficulty to disentangle the processes involved in the function e g both dissolved and bound particle transport quantification of the role of absorption effect of water residence times on sorption processes similarly the retention of floating propagules in vegetated channels is influenced by the specific features of the propagules e g roundness density and shape carthey et al 2016 chambert and james 2009 jager et al 2019 as well as by hydrodynamic conditions at the free surface of water and other environmental factors such as the intensity and direction of wind soomers et al 2010 that make it even more difficult to study therefore research efforts still need to be made to be able to quantify accurately the effect of vegetation and of its dynamics on the three studied ecosystem functions channel management practices mowing dredging burning clearing and chemical weeding influence the dynamics of vegetation composition and properties parameters in the short and long term however except for a few studies dollinger et al 2017 vinatier et al 2018 the effect of management practices on the dynamics of these properties and parameters has not been clearly addressed because research traditionally focused on the effect of management practices on preserving the richness and diversity of plant communities this review therefore identifies a lack of knowledge of the potential for management practices to drive the properties and parameters of plant communities that are involved in the three ecosystem functions studied 7 conclusion water regulation retention of sediments agricultural pollutants and plant propagules and bank strengthening are essential ecosystem functions that support the agroecological transition because they help limit the harmful effects of agriculture on ecosystems it would be interesting to adopt an approach based on community parameters properties to understand how vegetation influences the functioning of agricultural channels because doing so would allow generical conclusions about the effect of vegetation on these ecosystem functions to be drawn and support the subsequent modeling of these functions this review provides insights into the parameters properties that have been clearly associated with the studied ecosystem functions in the literature and that can be measured in the field or modeled to study the dynamics of these ecosystem functions in space and time modifying plant community parameters and properties through agricultural channel management could be a powerful lever with which to manage ecosystem functions and optimize them in space and time however the potential role of agricultural channel vegetation remains largely underestimated and underexploited declaration of competing

1063,vegetation living in agricultural channels drainage ditches or irrigation channels supports ecosystem functions such as water flow regulation retention of sediments agricultural pollutants and plant propagules and bank strengthening the review focuses on plant community functional parameters aggregations of plant functional traits and community properties that need to be considered to study the dynamics of these ecosystem functions to support further modeling work on the functioning of these semiaquatic ecosystems it also provides an up to date overview of the effects of channel management practices on vegetation because these practices are a potential lever with which to drive plant community functional parameters and properties and in turn ecosystem functions the review points out that the mean height density and flexibility of the plant cover sometimes integrated in the blockage factor mainly influence the average components of the water flow associated with the functions of water regulation and retention of sediments and non floating propagules the density of plants or area of the plant cover at the water surface are generally used to explain floating propagule retention the biomasses of living and dead vegetation are the properties used to assess the retention of agricultural pollutants root density and root length density as well as tensile strength of the root system are parameters generally associated with bank strengthening regarding the effects of channel management practices this work highlights that research generally has focused on the resulting plant richness and diversity but has not provided much information on associated plant community functional parameters and properties keywords ditch irrigation channel plant community properties plant community functional parameters ecosystem function management practices 1 introduction networks of agricultural channels irrigation channels and drainage ditches play a considerable role in the abiotic and biotic fluxes in agricultural landscapes irrigation channels are built to conduct water from a source to its place of use l√≥pez pomares et al 2015 ditches are built to transfer excess water from agricultural plots levavasseur et al 2012 they also play an antierosive role in places where high water velocities occur such as in mediterranean landscapes with steep slopes ramos and porta 1997 roose and sabir 2002 and play a drainage role carluer and marsily 2004 krause et al 2007 in places where the water table has to be lowered to enable cultivation their existence results from human decision making and sometimes their establishment took place hundreds of years ago berger 2000 they are organized into networks i e they are connected to each other hydraulically as well as ecologically their density can reach 200 m ha in mediterranean landscapes levavasseur et al 2015 agricultural channels cover a limited surface area of landscapes for example ditch networks in mediterranean areas never represent more than 4 of cultivated areas based on data from levavasseur et al 2014b most of these agricultural channels are uncoated earth channels and especially the small ones no more than 1 5 meters in width that are located upstream of the network for drainage ditches and downstream of the network for irrigation channels these small agricultural channels therefore can host flora and fauna species herzon and helenius 2008 they also are generally subject to intermittent flows associated with rainfall frequency and intensity or irrigation the flora encountered in channels is generally not specific to these ecosystems i e it is encountered in other places of the catchment although in some contexts we can find plants of conservation interest mountford and arnold 2006 agricultural networks are important habitats for floral species herzon and helenius 2008 that were located in natural freshwater bodies and floodplains in the past armitage et al 2003 because they often represent the only sources of open water in agricultural landscapes channels and ditches generally have a high plant diversity meier et al 2017 plants living in agricultural channels are generally terrestrial or semiaquatic composed mainly of forbs and graminoids bouldin et al 2004 clarke 2015 levavasseur et al 2014a maheu giroux and blois 2006 rudi et al 2018b szymura et al 2009 and sometimes strictly aquatic clarke 2015 janse 1998 milsom et al 2004 according to the topographic climatic and pedological contexts as well as location in the channels network the vegetation must be managed regularly by users farmers and irrigation managers to restore its hydraulic capacity for transport dollinger et al 2015 in mediterranean agricultural areas one or two practices such as mowing burning clearing and chemical weeding are conducted every year levavasseur et al 2014a s√§nchez mart√≠n et al 2018 dredging is carried out every 5 to 10 years to remove the deposited sediments these frequencies can vary according to pedoclimatic context milsom et al 2004 twisk et al 2003 these management practices according to their typology frequency and location in the channel can alter the ditch bed material dollinger et al 2015 and vegetation in the short term they directly affect the shape of the plant cover dollinger et al 2017 levavasseur et al 2014a but in the medium and long term management practices have the additional effect of modifying the composition of plant communities and their dynamics leng et al 2011 manhoudt et al 2007 milsom et al 2004 rudi 2019 s√§nchez mart√≠n et al 2018 twisk et al 2003 nowadays studies have highlighted the multifunctionality of agricultural channels vegetation dollinger et al 2015 herzon and helenius 2008 pierce et al 2012 which is a significant provider of functions such as water flow regulation and bank strengthening as well as sediment agricultural pollutant and plant propagule retention a propagule is any structure for dispersal or reproduction i e seeds spores and rhizomes this multifunctionality of vegetation living in agricultural channels explains why these infrastructures are often referred to as agroecological relying properly on these ecosystem functions could decrease intervention time and costs for farmers by reducing soil loss from farmed areas decreasing the frequency of bank failure and reducing weed spreading while limiting overflows it could also help decrease the concentrations of sediments and agricultural pollutants in receiving ecosystems which could result in lower water treatment costs for society these functions are mainly influenced by physical and to a lesser extent chemical biological interactions between vegetation and water flow fields in the channel as a consequence the dynamics of the functions result mainly from i the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation in the agricultural channels and ii the spatiotemporal components of water flow fields which especially depend on the frequency and intensity of rainfalls and irrigations as well as the topological pedological and morphological characteristics of the channel dollinger et al 2015 it seems reasonable to think that vegetation would be a powerful lever with which to optimize channels ecosystem functions because i vegetation is already managed by farmers regularly and ii the management of vegetation produces few negative impacts on the ecosystem if properly conducted for studying and modeling channels ecosystem functions a relevant spatial scale has to be chosen nepf 2012b when estimating channels functions at the landscape scale the resolution at which the channels need to be studied is the reach scale rudi 2019 in this paper the term reach refers to a channel section with homogeneous properties as defined in lagacherie et al 2006 which generally corresponds to a description of vegetation at the community level community functional parameters are plant functional traits aggregated at the level of the community for example mean height and a community property is a feature estimated at the community level for example density violle et al 2007 better consideration of these plant community functional parameters and properties in the modeling of ecosystems functioning should enhance our ability to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of the ecosystem functions that they provide diaz et al 2003 lavorel et al 2017 mori et al 2013 and it would provide us with information on the parameters and properties that we need to measure and monitor in the field additionally it would allow us to know which type of vegetation is desirable in channels in terms of parameters properties rather than species which would provide more generic rules to managers and stakeholders for managing ecosystems functions rudi 2019 although these types of approaches are currently encouraged several challenges remain as the community functional parameters and properties responsible for the dynamics of ecosystem functions have not been clearly identified moreover if management practices anthropogenic drivers represent a lever with which to manage the dynamics of these parameters and properties and in turn ecosystem functions dollinger et al 2016 2017 vinatier et al 2018 it would be useful to collect data on the effects of these practices on plant community parameters and properties the first objective of the review was to determine the plant community functional parameters and community properties involved in three main functions of agricultural channels i water flow regulation ii retention and iii bank strengthening we focused on parameters and properties that have a clearly established relationship with the studied functions that has been documented in research papers the second objective was to collect data on the effect of management practices on plant community functional parameters and properties the review first presents an overview of ecosystem functions provided by vegetation in agricultural channels then it presents an up to date overview of plant community functional parameters and properties generally associated with the studied ecosystem functions in the last section the review presents what we currently know about the effect of management practices on the dynamics of plant community functional parameters and community properties in agricultural channels 2 material and methods scope of the study and methodology the review focuses on uncoated and therefore vegetated channels located in temperate climatic contexts with a focus on mediterranean agricultural areas in terms of morphology a study by levavasseur et al 2012 revealed that 75 of ditches in a mediterranean agricultural landscape had a width between 50 to 120 cm and a depth between 30 and 80 cm mediterranean irrigation channels range from widths depths of a few meters upstream of the network to widths depths of 50 cm dowsntream the channels bordering the plots rudi 2019 the ratio depth on width of agricultural channels is therefore more important than for natural waterways rudi 2019 in this study we will focus on agricultural channels with slopes under 5 because channels with steep slopes were poorly studied to this day as underlined in the introduction they can be intermittent or permanent according to the climatic context and location according to the network bulk velocities range from some centimeters per second to an order of magnitude of 1 m s 1 in accordance with the maximal depths of the channels the water depth rarely exceeds 1 2 meters the flow regime is most of the time subcritical to gather data on plant community functional parameters and properties involved in water flow regulation retention and bank strengthening as well as on the effect of management practices on plant communities in agricultural channels we relied on four scientific databases science direct wiley online library springer link and google scholar we then collected all papers that contained the keyword ditch irrigation channel and irrigation canal with vegetation or plant resulting in 5087 papers we then sorted the relevant papers resulting in 146 papers dealing with the interactions between vegetation and the studied ecosystem functions and with their management practices in agricultural channels or flumes the papers collected from databases as well as other additional relevant papers were read and studied carefully around 250 note that papers relying on flume experiments although not conducted in agricultural areas were considered relevant for understanding some of the studied functions due to the physical similarity and comparable morphologies and hydraulic conditions of flumes and small agricultural channels the relationships between individual plant traits community functional parameters and properties and ecosystem functions are presented in fig 1 3 overview of the functions of vegetation in agricultural channels agricultural channel vegetation is generally composed of terrestrial and semiaquatic species bouldin et al 2004 clarke 2015 maheu giroux and blois 2006 rudi et al 2018b szymura et al 2009 and sometimes of strictly aquatic species cassan et al 2015 clarke 2015 janse 1998 milsom et al 2004 sabbatini et al 1998 according to the flow regime especially intermittence or not and other conditions topographic climatic and pedological they form sparse or dense cover that is homogeneously distributed in the channel or forms patches as illustrated in fig 2 vegetation is involved in ecosystem functions that have already been highlighted in other research works focusing on agricultural channels aspe et al 2016 dollinger et al 2015 herzon and helenius 2008 needelman et al 2007 pierce et al 2012 three main types of functions provided by agricultural channels vegetation have been identified fig 3 the first of these functions is water flow regulation water flow regulation in agricultural channels can be assessed through average components of water flow such as velocity and water height the modification of these components in a plurality of locations in the network can in turn affect the discharge and hydrograms at the outlet of the networks of channels the presence of vegetation usually generates hydraulic resistance and therefore reduces water velocity and increases water height the effect of vegetation on water flow regulation is particularly interesting under conditions of heavy rainfalls and steep slopes as can be found in mediterranean landscapes because vegetation in agricultural channels can contribute to mitigating the peak of floods according to the topological conditions and organization of the channels network moussa et al 2002 the second ecosystem function provided by agricultural channel vegetation is retention sediments agricultural pollutants and plant propagules the presence of vegetation can enhance retention by three main means i it can affect the components of the water flow and then favor sedimentation of particles transported in the water column ii it can mechanically retain particles and iii dissolved pollutants can be absorbed or adsorbed by vegetation the retention of sediments can reduce the turbidity of water in receiving ecosystems at the outlet of the ditch networks fiener and auerswald 2003 flora and kr√∂ger 2014 vegetation also slows the transfer of pesticides to receiving ecosystems dollinger et al 2015 2016 lagacherie et al 2006 margoum et al 2003 and therefore favors their degradation in the channels last standing vegetation influences the dispersal of species through agricultural channels by retaining plant propagules seeds and other propagules such as rhizomes transported by water rudi et al 2018a soomers et al 2010 this limits the spread of adventitious propagules in cultivated areas rudi et al 2018a but consequently also limits the dispersal of non adventitious or protected species the last type of function is bank strengthening terrestrial and semiaquatic vegetation plays a part in maintaining the banks of waterways through the dissipation of hydraulic energy due to the presence of the aboveground part of the plants but also through the stabilization and limitation of soil bank loss due to the development of the root system de baets et al 2006 ghestem et al 2011 mamo and bubenzer 2001 pollen bankhead and simon 2010 we therefore assume that the effects of vegetation are similar between agricultural channels and natural waterways in the following paragraphs we aim to characterize plant functional community parameters and properties involved in the ecosystem functions described above 4 characterization of plant community functional parameters and properties involved in ecosystem functions of vegetation 4 1 plant community functional parameters and properties involved in water flow regulation the function of water regulation is generally assessed through the velocity of the water flow and the height of the water column water velocity and height mainly rely on imposed hydraulic conditions inflow downstream conditions as well as on a physical quantity called hydraulic resistance in agricultural channels hydraulic resistance is largely driven by vegetation when it is present in the channels hydraulic resistance induced by vegetation in channels can be studied at different spatial resolutions i at the plant resolution or lower resolution such as the stem or leaf scale when relevant but this approach is not practicable when estimating ecosystem functions in a whole network of channels ii at the resolution of small homogeneous plant covers iii at the reach resolution in this case the total hydraulic resistance is generally encompassed in a global resistance coefficient 4 1 1 characterization of the hydraulic resistance of homogeneous plant covers in small sections of channels plant cover in agricultural channels exerts a drag force opposite to the motion of the water a quadratic drag law can be used to assess this spatially averaged drag force f eq 1 1 f 1 2 c d a œÅ v 2 where cd is the drag coefficient a is the area of plants projected in the flow direction l 2 œÅ is the density of water m l 3 and vis the local flow velocity l t 1 the coefficient cd is dependent on community parameters and properties such as the projected area a nepf 2012a and therefore on density d li and shen 1973 mean diameter d li and shen 1973 and morphology james et al 2004 nepf 2012a as well as flexibility james et al 2004 nepf 2012b explains that for large reynolds numbers calculated at the stem scale it is reasonable to choose a constant drag coefficient cd between 0 7 and 1 5 this drag coefficient is often fixed at 1 when no data are available for estimating it more accurately in contrast for small stem reynolds numbers cd can take larger values and increases as the reynolds number decreases tanino and nepf 2008 velocity fields are heterogeneous within plant cover nepf 2012a generally studies differentiate emergent and submerged plant covers because the mean velocity and turbulence fields can be truly different in these two conditions defina and bixio 2005 finnigan 2000 nepf and vivoni 2000 fig 4 the scale of turbulence in submerged plant covers is also dependent on the density of the cover which is generally defined as sparse or dense table 1 sparse submerged covers are covers with approximately cdahp 0 04 and dense submerged covers are covers with approximately cdahp 0 1 belcher et al 2003 nepf et al 2007 with a representing the frontal area of the plant cover by volume and hp the height of the plant cover note that all conditions sparse and dense plant covers as well as submerged and emergent covers are commonly found in agricultural channels in emergent conditions the mean velocity inside the vegetation is always lower than that for a bare bed channel however the vegetation concomitantly creates an increase in turbulence the turbulence inside the plant cover is greater than that due to bed friction and therefore the total turbulence cannot be predicted from only the bed shear velocity nepf 2012b as is commonly done in studies on bare beds in submerged conditions two main configurations are observed nepf 2012b fig 4 if the plant cover is sparse the velocity profile has the shape of a turbulent boundary layer in this case turbulence intensity increases with vegetation density nepf 2012a if the plant cover is dense the velocity profile has an inflection point as observed in fig 4 c when the vegetation is dense and thus an inflection point occurs in the velocity profile plant cover scale vortices are expected to appear brown and roshko 1974 it is possible to predict the length of penetration Œ¥e of these kelvin helmholtz vortices in the plant cover nepf et al 2007 this length of penetration decreases with an increasing density of stems for 0 2 cdahp 1 Œ¥e c d a 1 nepf et al 2007 when cdahp 0 2 Œ¥e hp and the vortex penetrates to the bed lastly when c d a 1 2 d Œ¥e 2d white and nepf 2008 in both emergent and submerged conditions flexible vegetation can bend under the effect of water velocity this phenomenon is called reconfiguration vogel 1996 and is dependent on water velocity the streamlining of the vegetation with increasing water velocity might also change the friction coefficient c at the interface of the top of the plant cover and the free layer of water aberle and j√§rvel√§ 2013 luhar and nepf 2011 then chapman et al 2015 proposed the prediction of drag coefficients for plants or flexible elements with different flexibilities in real conditions in agricultural channels most of the vegetation is flexible because it is composed mainly of nonligneous species to the best of our knowledge no estimation of flexibility for a whole plant community has been conducted and research has generally considered individual plants despite the importance of this property for understanding flow patterns a flexible cover can move according to the mean and turbulent fields nepf and ghisalberti 2008 the progressive waving of the vegetation due to the passage of the kelvin helmholtz vortices is named monami and was first observed for seagrasses fonseca and kenworthy 1987 grizzle et al 1996 and then experimentally characterized in flumes for example see okamoto et al 2016 in their study okamoto et al 2016 revealed that the quantity of vegetation waving at the same time was associated with the lenght scale of the turbulence in the mixing layer zone 4 1 2 characterization of hydraulic resistance in real plant cover at the reach scale hydraulic resistance at the reach scale is generally described by a resistance coefficient which is commonly the manning n darcy weisbach or chezy coefficient but some authors have proposed other coefficients for example james et al 2004 in traditional hydraulic engineering resistance coefficients were assessed through visual aspect of channel then refering to tables linking channels features including vegetation to resistance coefficient values see chow 1959 for example manning s coefficient n is widely used and is associated to flow characteristics by manning s equation manning 1890 eq 2 2 n r 2 3 i s 1 2 u with r the hydraulic radius l is the energy grade line slope l l 1 and uthe cross sectional area averaged velocity l t 1 however vegetation presenting very different morphologies and characteristics according to the context this approach was considered as limiting and led to inaccurate values of resistance coefficients green 2005a this led many authors to propose formulas allowing to predict resistance from measurable plant community parameters and properties note that as underlined by folkard 2011 it seems that the use of resistance coefficient n to account for vegetation resistance is only valid when the height of vegetation cover is low compared to the height of water however despite the lack of theoretical validity n is still really used in practice research focusing on flow resistance caused by vegetation at the reach scale increased approximately 15 years ago first luhar et al 2008 highlighted that in natural channels the architecture of the submerged vegetation was of low importance for predicting the resistance coefficient luhar and nepf 2013 showed that the individual description of all patches with their own properties did not give very different results for resistance coefficient predictions compared to those obtained with an average description at the reach scale according to green 2005b luhar et al 2008 nikora et al 2008 the blockage factor b had the best explanatory power for three resistance coefficients manning darcy weisbach and chezy the blockage factor b is the fraction of channel cross section occupied by vegetation b whp wh with w and hp being respectively the width and height of the vegetation cover w the width of the channel and h the height of water the relationship between the resistance coefficient and b has been reported as nonlinear by many authors nepf 2012a nikora et al 2008 vinatier et al 2017 nikora et al 2008 interpreted this nonlinearity as the result of a decrease of bed contribution to total resistance with an increase in vegetation and suggested that linear formulas were thus poorly accurate in emergent conditions fathi maghadam and kouwen 1997 showed that the shape and distribution of vegetation were poor descriptors of resistance equations and highlighted the role of vegetation density d aberle and j√§rvel√§ 2013 argued that the density and ability for reconfiguration were the most important properties for determining the resistance this was empirically inferred with decreasing exponential laws in bailly et al 2015 recently rubol et al 2018 successfully modeled the resistance by representing the vegetation as a porous medium many formulas predicting resistance coefficients based on plant community parameters and properties have been developed some of them are presented in table 2 in practice at the network scale few hydraulic or hydrological models consider the resistance created by vegetation especially its spatialization at the resolution of reaches when vegetative resistance is considered its relationship with vegetation properties is highly simplified as in doncker et al 2009 or bertoldi et al 2014 who considered a really simplified relationship between vegetation biomass and the resistance coefficient these last two examples have been found for natural waterways no studies on this subject were found for agricultural channels 4 2 plant community functional parameters and properties involved in retention of sediments agricultural pollutants and plant propagules 4 2 1 sediment transport and deposition it is generally considered that the presence of vegetation is associated with increased sedimentation of suspended particles in rivers flumes and agricultural channels abt et al 1994 cotton et al 2006 l√≥pez and garc√≠a 1998 and decreased bed load transport kothyari et al 2009 however some researchers have observed the opposite such as van katwijk et al 2010 who reported negative net sedimentation in patches of sparse vegetation seagrass compared with a bare bed at the local scale palmer et al 2004 described the capture by a plant stem of small suspended particles range 177 210 Œºm relying on a metrics named the particle capture efficiency Œ∑ using an empirical formula eq 3 of the form 3 Œ∑ a r e c b d p d c with a b and c positive constants rec the collector reynolds number described as rec ud ŒΩ and dp the particle diameter based on the same formalisms fauria et al 2015 showed the significant role of the biofilms developing on vegetation for small particles capture range 1 25 250 Œºm in some aquatic systems note that these biofilms developing on freshwater vegetation have been mainly characterized in streams besemer 2015 and marshes buesing et al 2009 they present an important diversity affected by several interacting factors although abundance and community assemblage of biofilms seem specifically affected by the presence of inorganic nutrients and dissolved organic matter olapade and leff 2005 relying on plant density conditions relevant to the ones found in agricultural channels 2724 and 7209 s t e m s m 2 and on a natural biofilm developed in eutrophic conditions fauria et al 2015 determined new coefficients for the formulation of the particle capture efficiency Œ∑ especially with b a negative exponent highlighting the fact that particle retention is decreased with increased flow velocity coming back to a more traditional approach for bare beds the settling velocity of the particles and the minimal shear stress for entrainment are generally used to model entrainment and transport to understand the interactions between sediment transport and vegetation in channels more deeply nepf 2012a reported that sediment transport was linked not only to the mean bed stress as for bare bed sediment transport but also to the profile of turbulence indeed luhar et al 2008 found that in sparse plant cover the turbulent stress remained elevated close to the bed whereas it was reduced in dense plant cover for plant cover for which cdahp 0 1 the resuspension is of the same order of magnitude as that for bare bed channels in other words plant cover below this threshold has a limited influence on sediment retention moore 2004 even noted enhanced erosion under these conditions due to the augmentation of stem scale turbulence for plant cover above this threshold we observed in paragraph 4 1 1 that the penetration scale of the kevin helmholtz vortices was dependent on the density of the stems in this case the higher the density the more important the sheltering between adjacent stems as a consequence the bed is protected from the turbulent stress caused by kevin helmholtz vortices and the momentum transfer is therefore extremely reduced additionally the mean bed stress is generally reduced in the presence of vegetation nepf 2012a but the methods used to characterize it are still controversial nepf 2012a yang et al 2015 recently yang et al 2015 presented a formula eq 4 for estimating the effective friction velocity u eff in the presence of vegetation but only for plant covers with frontal areas per volumetric unit a up to 4 3 m 1 4 u e f f m a x c f v 0 2 ŒΩ v 0 d with v 0 the local time averaged velocity in the uniform layer l t 1 cf the drag coefficient for the bare bed ŒΩ the kinematic viscosity of water l 2 t 1 and dthe diameter of the stems l under these conditions stem diameter d is considered a determining parameter for bed shear stress independent of density other studies focused on the effects of patches of vegetation on sediment transport and deposition ortiz et al 2013 zong and nepf 2011 in the wake behind a patch it seems that sedimentation is increased but this appears to be true only for emergent and rigid patches ortiz et al 2013 however at the leading edge of the patch where the flow is generally deflected the net deposition is reduced compared to that of the bare bed zong and nepf 2011 bouma et al 2007 and sand jensen and vindb√¶k madsen 1992 reported that these two mechanisms explained why patches generally grow in length but rarely grow in width along open channels nepf 2012a and solari et al 2016 reported that no general model currently exists for sediment transport in vegetated channels first most of the models are based on the estimation of bed shear stress however as stated before the bed shear stress in vegetated flows is very difficult to calculate nepf 2012a yang et al 2015 second as turbulence is reported as an influential parameter for resuspension and transport under some conditions bed shear stress might not be sufficient to take into account the effect of vegetation on sediment transport vollmer and kleinhans 2007 4 2 2 agricultural pollutants pesticides and nutrients retention sorption is a major mechanism involved in pesticides retention in agricultural areas dousset et al 2010 stehle et al 2011 in particular in farmed ditches dollinger et al 2015 this has been demonstrated for an insecticide pyrethroid bennett et al 2005 and a herbicide diuron dollinger et al 2016 margoum et al 2006 sorption increases with increasing organic content for most pesticides namely hydrophobic ones margoum et al 2006 this explains that an effective retention has been observed not only in the presence of living vegetation but also in the presence of litter dead vegetation at the bottom of agricultural channels based on these principles margoum et al 2003 proposed a retention index based on the relative cover in the wetted section of channel of living vegetation dead vegetation and sediments reported as herbicide retention power hrp in lagacherie et al 2006 eq 5 5 h r p l v 2 d v 0 5 s d with lv the relative cover of living vegetation dv the relative cover of dead vegetation and sd the relative cover of sediments more recently dollinger et al 2016 proposed a sorption induced pesticide retention indicator spri directly based on masses of the different elements composing the bottom and banks of the channel including living and dead vegetation eq 6 6 s p r i i n m i k d i i n m i k d i v l 100 with i being material i composing the channel i e living vegetation dead vegetation soil ash mi the corresponding mass of material i m kdi the linear adsorption coefficient l 3 m 1 and vl the volume of water flowing during a flow event l 3 additionally absorption of pesticides by vegetation is also expected to play a role in retention but it is not easy to differentiate between absorption and adsorption in field experiments moore et al 2011 vegetation can also indirectly drive the retention of pesticides prone to adsorption on sediments by influencing sedimentation rates under some conditions see paragraph 4 2 1 vegetation can also increase water retention times and therefore favor sorption dollinger 2016 and biodegradation mechanisms liu et al 2012 regarding nutrients castaldelli et al 2015 showed that n uptake by agricultural channel vegetation was low but that vegetation played a role in microbial denitrification by providing interfaces favoring the activity of bacteria to the best of our knowledge only janse 1998 proposed a model assessing nutrient uptake by vegetation in agricultural channels based on the biomasses of plant functional groups as for pesticides nutrients that tend to be transported bounded on sediments for example p might also be retained by vegetation through increased sedimentation bouldin et al 2004 liu et al 2008 4 2 3 plant propagule retention traditionally studies on hydrochorous plant propagule dispersal distinguishes nonfloating and floating propagules usually seeds indeed seeds can be transported in the bedload suspended in the flow or at the water surface carthey et al 2016 for nonfloating seeds gurnell 2007 established an analogy between sediment and seed transport this was confirmed by an experiment led by chambert and james 2009 who concluded that the main factors explaining the entrainment and deposition of nonfloating seeds were minimum critical shear stress necessary for their entrainment and the settling velocity therefore the plant community functional parameters and properties of the standing vegetation involved in the retention of nonfloating seeds are the same as those described in paragraph 4 2 1 for floating seeds defina and peruzzo 2010 reported the four main mechanisms governing the seed plant interactions in an artificial flume the cheerios effect when a seed is attracted by the meniscus around the stem due to surface tension forces vella and mahadevan 2005 inertial impaction when a collision between a seed and plant results in a change in the direction of the seed palmer et al 2004 wake trapping when the seed is temporarily trapped in the recirculation zone behind a stem white and nepf 2003 and net trapping when plants form a net that stops the seeds defina and peruzzo 2010 many studies mainly focused on the cheerios effect highlighted the role of stem density more precisely the mean centre to centre spacing in the rate of propagules retention defina and peruzzo 2012 liu et al 2019 white and nepf 2003 net trapping depends on the density height and spatial distribution of plants in the reach homogeneous distribution or existence of patches as well as on plant architectures at the water surface rudi and vinatier personnal observation at low velocities the cheerios effect is important but it disappears progressively as turbulent diffusion phenomena become too important chambert and james 2009 defina and peruzzo 2012 peruzzo et al 2012 2016 net trapping is generally predominant when stem density and water turbulence are important defina and peruzzo 2010 in addition for floating seeds the velocity fields at the water surface significantly influence the deposition of seeds soomers et al 2010 in this context emergent vegetation can be considered a porous obstacle modifying the velocity fields defina and peruzzo 2010 and the presence of vegetation is susceptible to creating recessional flows recirculating flows or eddies which explain in great part the variations in seed retention along a channel merritt and wohl 2002 nilsson et al 1991 due to the inherent difficulty of taking into account some plant parameters such as the specific architecture of plants at the scale of the community in heterogeneous plant covers rudi et al 2018a vinatier et al 2018 relied on a measure of the area of vegetation at the water surface at the scale of a section of approximately one meter accounting for the porosity of vegetation because this property was assumed to explain seed deposition with good performance these metrics were assessed through image analysis structure from motion using multi view stereo algorithm note however that this approach is less performing in case of abundant vegetation because the highest strata of vegetation might hide the water surface in some images 4 3 plant community functional parameters and properties involved in bank strengthening plants growing in agricultural channels have root systems that develop on the channel bottom or bank soil substrates most monocotyledons have fibrous root systems and dicotyledons generally have taproot systems from which other roots sometimes grow laterally beyond this coarse differentiation channels plants exhibit a gradient of root systems differing in length deepness diameter architecture junction and spatial distribution in soils these root parameters and properties in interaction with soil properties channel morphology and hydrologic hydraulic regimes greatly influence the stability of channels banks some parameters and properties of root systems such as root density rd de baets et al 2006 root length density rld corresponding to the cumulative length of root per soil unit volume de baets et al 2006 pollen bankhead and simon 2010 root biomass and total root volume pollen bankhead and simon 2010 have been reported to have an effect on the limitation of the erosion rates of banks and therefore on bank strengthening it has been shown that the volume of eroded soil is a negative exponential of rld or rd de baets et al 2006 pollen bankhead and simon 2010 due to this nonlinearity there appears to be a threshold of rld above which an increase in rld has little effect on the eroded volume of soil this threshold was found to be approximately 50 k m r o o t s m s o i l 3 by pollen bankhead and simon 2010 for switchgrass panicum virgatum and approximately 400 k m r o o t s m s o i l 3 by de baets et al 2006 for a mixture of lolium sp and festuca sp the difference in the values of the threshold could arise not only from differences in root properties especially diameter distributions in the soil profile but also from differences in experimental conditions the negative exponential shape observed between rld and rd and the volume of eroded soil led de baets et al 2006 to propose a power and a hill curve functions for this relationship for which they obtained good correlation coefficients equations 7 and 8 7 r s d 16 38 r l d 0 78 8 r s d r l d 2 22 r l d 2 22 0 000026 with rsd being the relative soil detachment rate however it seems difficult to experimentally differentiate the influence of the aboveground and belowground parts of the plant mamo and bubenzer 2001 zhang et al 2013 indeed aboveground part of the plant community also tend to dissipate hydraulic energy and therefore protect the banks soils from hydraulic erosion some aboveground plant architectures such as the presence of rosettes can also protect the soil kramer and weaver 1936 in addition some parameters such as the distribution of root diameters in a soil unit and the number of roots were reported to be related to the full root tensile strength which is frequently used in models evaluating the stability of stream banks and based on mechanical reinforcement pollen bankhead and simon 2009 fibrous roots operstein and frydman 2000 and fibrils li et al 1991 are considered more efficient than taproots zhang et al 2013 in increasing soil resistance the technical literature on waterway bank strengthening suggests sowing the banks with perennial and fibrous rooted vegetation such as elymus sp calamagrostis sp phleum sp apel 2015 or tripsacum dactyloides ghestem et al 2011 however according to reubens et al 2007 it seems that for slope stabilization plants with deep anchorage and many lateral roots for example dicotyledons would be more effective than plants with only fibrous roots ghestem et al 2011 also stressed the importance of considering the network of macropores pores from 30 ¬µm generally of biotic origin in the mechanisms governing slope stability and therefore bank strengthening indeed high convergence of macropores or dead end macropores can generate high pore water pressure in turn destabilizing the banks root orientation upslope or downslope is also of great importance deep rooted plants generally perform better than shallow rooted plants in terms of driving water away from unstable areas however well developed fibrous and shallow root systems can help dissipate pore water pressures that could otherwise concentrate in one location ghestem et al 2011 finally pollen bankhead and simon 2010 highlighted the hydrological effect of root systems on bank stability total evapotranspiration driven by the composition of the plant community removes water from the soil and therefore influences soil matrix suction this is assumed to influence apparent soil cohesion but this hydrological effect of plants on bank stability is still difficult to quantify pollen bankhead and simon 2010 5 effects of channel management practices on plant community functional parameters and properties the main aim of managing a ditch or a channel is to restore its hydraulic capacity dollinger et al 2015 s√§nchez mart√≠n et al 2018 different management practices mowing dredging burning chemical weeding and clearing affect the communities in the short term less than one year and medium between one and five years and long term more than five years in the short term the practices of mowing dredging burning and chemical weeding affect the dynamics of height density and porosity of vegetation as was illustrated by dollinger et al 2017 vinatier et al 2018 see fig 5 these two studies related the dynamics of functional parameters and properties of plant communities driven by management practices throughout the year to the dynamics of ecosystem functions in which vegetation is involved especially water regulation and pollutant and propagule retention the two papers suggested that both the temporality and type of practice are determinant of the resulting ecosystem functions in the medium term dredging allows a return to the early stages of vegetation succession clarke 2015 and therefore allows more replacements of plant species teurlincx et al 2018 mowing and burning generally maintain or improve richness and diversity chaudron et al 2016 milsom et al 2004 s√§nchez mart√≠n et al 2018 these practices influence competitive interactions betweens species because the distribution of water nutrients and light is modified indeed frequently disturbed ecosystems have been reported to be less competitive than natural ones connell 1978 odum 1969 successions at a multiyear scale after management are generally characterized by strictly aquatic plants in the early stages and emergent facultative plants and herbs in the late stages clarke 2015 milsom et al 2004 which implies different parameters and properties janse 1998 showed that the level of nutrient n and p that depends on management practices in adjacent fields and inside the ditch influenced the composition of the plant community duckweed was mainly found in highly loaded ditches and submerged plants were found in poorly loaded ditches they showed that there was a critical level in nutrient input that triggered the shift in plant community composition note that most studies on channel management practices focused on general indices of richness diversity or productivity and did not clearly evaluate the response of vegetation in terms of community parameters or properties moreover the long term effect of management practices on community composition has been poorly studied and is difficult to predict blomqvist et al 2006 6 discussion in conclusion the vegetation in agricultural channels is involved in three main ecosystem functions i water regulation ii retention of sediments propagules and agricultural pollutants iii bank strengthening at the local scale parameters and properties such as the drag coefficient frontal area density height stem diameter and flexibility are generally used to assess the effect of vegetation on water flow at the reach scale the parameters and properties used to assess water flow regulation are mainly the mean height of the plant cover porosity flexibility and the density of the plant community these parameters and properties are sometimes integrated in a global property named the blockage factor which is the fraction of channel cross section occupied by vegetation the mean height and density of plant cover are easily measurable it is far more complicated to measure the flexibility rudi 2019 porosity vinatier et al 2018 or blockage factor vinatier et al 2017 of a vegetation cover regarding the retention function sediments and nonfloating seeds the parameters and properties generally used to assess the effect of vegetation on the function are those affecting the mean velocity and the turbulence especially the drag coefficient density diameters of stems and height as well as the width of patches however this function has been generally studied in small sections of channels due to the complexity of the processes involved indeed the calculation of bed shear stress in the presence of vegetation and the quantification of turbulence and its influence on particle transport are far from being elucidated for floating propagules especially floating seeds the height of the plant cover is the most influencial parameter because only emergent vegetation is involved in retention the architecture of individual plants and the spatial distribution of the plants play a significant role in net trapping in practice the total area of the plants at the water surface is generally associated with seed retention for agricultural pollutants the biomass of living or dead vegetation in contact with them is the plant community property generally used to assess the retention function for n and p retention biomass is also influential because vegetation can both absorb nutrients and create interfaces for biodegradation but the quantification of n and p decay in agricultural channels has mainly been demonstrated experimentally only a few studies have proposed to model it to date see for example janse 1998 for bank strengthening aboveground community parameters and properties involved in the control of the average components of water flow are those associated with the dissipation of hydraulic energy aboveground parts of the plant community play a role in protecting the banks soils from hydraulic erosion belowground community functional parameters such as root density and root length density are frequently used for the prediction of soil loss under different hydraulic conditions and the number of roots per unit area of soil and the total tensile strength associated with these roots are often used in bank stability models the plant parameters and properties involved in the studied ecosystem functions are summarized in table 3 this review pointed out that knowledge of the effect of plant functional parameters and properties on channel ecosystem functions is far more developed for water regulation than for the other functions mechanisms underlying water regulation have been described both at the local scale and at the reach scale using physical and semiempirical approaches although research on the effect of heterogeneous vegetation cover on water flow fields remains to be conducted bank strengthening has been explored especially for waterways with models based on the number of roots and tensile strength which do not explicitly take into account the complexity of the relationships between soil texture structure root systems and their effect on the hydrological status of the soil matrix this can be partly explained by i the complexity of the relationships between soils and roots that involve physical biological and chemical processes ii the difficulty of measuring belowground properties and parameters and iii the dynamic nature of the contributions of the different effects of roots on bank stability pollen bankhead and simon 2010 moreover regarding root systems other properties parameters such as root system architecture and orientation with respect to the banks of the channel as well as the hydrological effect of root systems on soil reinforcement have been poorly explored nonfloating propagules and sediment retention is still difficult to model at the reach scale due to the complexity of the processes involved especially due to the effect of turbulent phenomena in vegetated channels the retention of pesticides as well as nutrients is generally related to total plant biomass which is an integrative parameter due to the difficulty to disentangle the processes involved in the function e g both dissolved and bound particle transport quantification of the role of absorption effect of water residence times on sorption processes similarly the retention of floating propagules in vegetated channels is influenced by the specific features of the propagules e g roundness density and shape carthey et al 2016 chambert and james 2009 jager et al 2019 as well as by hydrodynamic conditions at the free surface of water and other environmental factors such as the intensity and direction of wind soomers et al 2010 that make it even more difficult to study therefore research efforts still need to be made to be able to quantify accurately the effect of vegetation and of its dynamics on the three studied ecosystem functions channel management practices mowing dredging burning clearing and chemical weeding influence the dynamics of vegetation composition and properties parameters in the short and long term however except for a few studies dollinger et al 2017 vinatier et al 2018 the effect of management practices on the dynamics of these properties and parameters has not been clearly addressed because research traditionally focused on the effect of management practices on preserving the richness and diversity of plant communities this review therefore identifies a lack of knowledge of the potential for management practices to drive the properties and parameters of plant communities that are involved in the three ecosystem functions studied 7 conclusion water regulation retention of sediments agricultural pollutants and plant propagules and bank strengthening are essential ecosystem functions that support the agroecological transition because they help limit the harmful effects of agriculture on ecosystems it would be interesting to adopt an approach based on community parameters properties to understand how vegetation influences the functioning of agricultural channels because doing so would allow generical conclusions about the effect of vegetation on these ecosystem functions to be drawn and support the subsequent modeling of these functions this review provides insights into the parameters properties that have been clearly associated with the studied ecosystem functions in the literature and that can be measured in the field or modeled to study the dynamics of these ecosystem functions in space and time modifying plant community parameters and properties through agricultural channel management could be a powerful lever with which to manage ecosystem functions and optimize them in space and time however the potential role of agricultural channel vegetation remains largely underestimated and underexploited declaration of competing

parameters which are related to the regulation effects of the two rain gardens one is traditional media the other is modified media are studied results indicate that the drainmod shows greater ability to optimize the rain gardens comparing with recarga the runoff reduction rates are significantly decreased by 16 0 and 19 9 by increasing rainfall conditions and the ratio of rain garden area to catchment area rr c respectively no3 n is significantly reduced by 22 5 22 5 and 17 9 on different rainfall conditions concentrations and rr c respectively and the levels of pollutant reduction are better than nh3 n with the thickness of aquifer filler layer and internal aquifer increasing the runoff reduction rates are increased by 19 1 38 7 and 5 0 respectively meanwhile the load reduction rates for no3 n are increased by 5 6 28 9 and 16 4 and for nh3 n are 6 2 17 0 and 14 0 respectively the rsm is utilized to explore the correlation between different scenarios and water quantity quality reduction rates which is used in the optimization of the rain gardens optimization results show that with the constraint of higher inflow concentration and 80 of the annual runoff reduction

gardens keywords recarga drainmod design expert factor optimization 1 introduction with the global urbanization increasing rain resources are becoming scarce junk et al 2018 impervious surfaces expand and alters the natural hydrological cycle patra et al 2018 various problems like non point source pollution increasing surface runoff reduction of rainwater infiltration and frequent urban waterlogging cause hydrological stress on the river s ecosystems at the same time it brings great challenges to the existing urban infrastructure lal 2013 wagner and zalewski 2009 the water ecosystem used as a management tool in ecohydrology that is the basis of sustainable development strategies it can be realized through the combination of innovative ecosystem biotechnology and existing urban engineering infrastructure wagner and breil 2013 from the perspective of ecohydrology the emergence of low impact development lid infrastructures provides a new idea for urban stormwater problems caused by the rapid development of urbanization and become the basis of sustainable development strategies to cope with global changes li et al 2018 as an integrated approach of stormwater management based on rainwater harvesting and source control lid improves chemical physical and a certain extent hydro morphological conditions for the functioning of water ecosystems by reducing fluxes elosegi and sabater 2013 an understanding of the lid facilities including absorbing capacity the resultant potential and limits for water matter and pollutant transformations are fundamental to recover the urban ecohydrology wagner et al 2013 with the lid technology extensively building the scholars have done lots of research on it and most of them focus on regulation effects and regional scale simulation however the scenario simulation by single facility lid models and the optimization of key parameters of lid facilities are rarely studied li at al 2018 the single facility lid hydrological models have emerged as a scientific and effective measure for lid optimization design and the evaluation and prediction of operational performance common single facility lid hydrological models include recarga drainmod hydrus and swc qi and qi 2017 among them the recarga and drainmod are easily and precisely applied however few studies analyzed the performance of the two models in northwest china therefore the current study uses the recarga and drainmod models to investigate the rain gardens in the tongde and kangding communities respectively in the xixian new area of shaanxi province the applicability and accuracy of the two lid models are compared and analyzed in northwest china the regulation effects of rain gardens on water quantity and quality under different conditions were simulated by changing the impact factors rainfall conditions ratio of rain garden area to catchment area and pollutant concentration and design parameters aquifer depth filling layer depth and internal aquifer depth of the rain gardens design expert was used to analyze and explore the correlation between different design parameters and the regulation efficiencies of rain garden to optimize the parameters and provide a basis for the rational design of rain gardens 2 materials and methods 2 1 model principle and parameter comparison single facility lid hydrological models were designed for different simulation objects hence their advantages limitations and applicable conditions vary selecting the appropriate model can improve the efficiency and accuracy of the model simulation therefore the structural principles the input and output conditions of the recarga and drainmod models were compared in table 1 table 1 shows that the two models based on the principle of water balance different modules used to simulate the hydrological characteristics of the rain gardens these modules are suitable for hydrological simulations involving long term sequences although drainmod needs to input more parameters than recarga it can simulate the depth of the inner aquifer the solute migration and transformation after the rainwater enters the rain garden especially on the migrations of nitrogen and salt in rain gardens youssef et al 2018 2 2 overview of study area the rain gardens in this study located in the tongde community east longitude 108 43 8 4 north latitude 34

garden 2 3 establishment of study area model according to the basic data of the study area the two hydrological models were established via recarga and drainmod individually four types of parameters entered meteorological data soil data design parameters of drainage systems and nitrogen transport parameters skaggs et al 2012 the recarga does not need to enter the nitrogen transport parameters the meteorological data input for the 2017 daily rainfall obtained from the weather station of xi an university of technology water resources institute and the 2017 daily maximum and minimum temperatures obtained from the weather network were used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration using the steady state thornthwaite empirical formula thornthwaite 1948 table 2 lists rainfall duration rainfall maximum rainfall intensity rainfall type and runoff reduction rate during the monitoring period the inflow and outflow water samples were measured by 30 triangular rafts and the water level data are collected by a network liquid level acquisition system mx7200 the amount of water inflow and outflow of the garden was calculated by the following formula q 8 15 Œº t g Œ∏ 2 2 g h 2 5 where q

runoff volume v is v i 1 n q i Œ¥ t i where qi is the instantaneous inflow or outflow of the i th period l min Œ¥t is the monitoring time period min initial stage of rainfall the samples of inflow and outflow were taken in every 5 mins when rainfall lasts for 20 min the samples were taken every 10 min when it last for 1h then taken in every 20 min the samples from the field were taken in time to the 4 c refrigerator water sample analysis indicators including the no3 n and nh3 n and they were analyzed completely in 1 2 days ultraviolet spectrophotometry and nessler s reagent spectrometry were used to determine the no3 n and nh3 n respectively state epa of china 2012 the tensiometer and cutting ring were used to determine soil moisture and saturated hydraulic conductivity respectively guo et al 2019 the design parameters of the drainage system are the basic parameters of the rain gardens including the depth of the drain pipe the depth of the impervious layer and the drainage coefficient except for the drainage coefficient comes from the reference all of these parameters are measured in the field nitrogen transport parameters include initial nitrogen content of soil and rainfall nitrification process parameters denitrification process parameters and organic matter decomposition parameters among these parameters the nitrification process parameters denitrification process parameters and organic matter decomposition parameters are gained from the reference for the initial nitrogen content of soil no3 n was extracted by the potassium chloride solution from the soil and nh3 n was extracted by the potassium chloride solution from the soil state epa of china 2012 after the parameter input is completed hydrology and nitrogen modules were selected for simulation in the model and the model run continuously for the entire period 2 4 model parameter 2 4 1 parameter sensitivity analysis parameter sensitivity analysis aims to qualitatively or quantitatively evaluate the effects of model input errors on model output in this study the parameters that must be determined are selected and the morris screening method was used to analyze the local sensitivity of the model parameters becker et al 2018 the modified morris screening method allows independent variables to be varied by a fixed percentage of the step size and the final sensitivity discriminant factor is the average of multiple morris coefficients sharifan et al 2010 the formula is s i 1 n y i 1 y i y 0 p i 1 p i 100 n where s is the factor of parameter sensitivity yi is the output value of the i th run of the model yi 1 is the output value of the i 1 th run y0 is the initial value of the calculated result after the parameter adjustment pi is the percent change of the parameter value after the i th run model relative to the initial parameter value pi 1 is the percent change of the parameter value after the i 1 th run model relative to the initial parameter value n is the running times of the model according to the factor of parameter sensitivity value s the morris method was used to divide the sensitivities of the parameters into four categories s 1 highly sensitive parameter 0 2 s 1 sensitive parameter 0 05 s 0 2 moderately sensitive parameter and 0 s 0 05 insensitive parameter ge and menendez 2017 the simulation results are shown in table a 1 supplementary information the results of the parameter sensitivity analysis are as follows in the recarga model kn dp kp sensitivity parameter ds dd ks moderate sensitivity parameter and dn insensitivity parameter in the

combined with the sensitivity analysis results the parameters of the rain gardens in the two models were verified in parameter calibration the squared correlation coefficient r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens grunwald and qi 2006 were used to evaluate the simulation results of the model the simulation results of the rain garden in the tongde community were selected and shown in fig 2 in the verification results of the recarga model the r2 values of the runoff simulated and measured results for the tongde and kangding communities are 0 53 and 0 61 respectively and the ens values are 0 35 and 0 43 respectively as for the verification results of the drainmod the r2 values of the tongde and kangding communities are 0 89 and 0 91 respectively and the ens values are 0 74 and 0 72 respectively the r2 and ens values of the pollutant index were higher than 0 92 and 0 32 respectively the model verification results show that the drainmod can simulate the migration of pollutants in the rain gardens and the depth of the inner aquifer and that its simulation accuracy is higher than that of the recarga the drainmod in the study area has good reliability and stability therefore the drainmod was selected for the scenario design and discussion the simulation results are shown in table a 2 supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 scenario design 3 1 1 external impact factors 1 different rainfall conditions by comparing and analyzing the adaptability and simulation accuracy in this study area the drainmod was selected after the calibration to simulate different scenarios according to the meteorological data of xi an meteorological station in the past 60 years and the hydrological frequency distribution curve software the selected rainstorm frequencies are 25 50 and 75 to compare the results of the different rainfall conditions easily three levels of the rainfall time series consist of wet year 1972 normal year 1990 and dry year 1995 the corresponding annual rainfalls were 635 542 and 466 mm respectively the hydrological effects of the study area were analyzed and compared 2 different catchment areas according to the sponge city construction technical guide low impact development system construction trial a rain garden is characterized by a scattered layout and an adequately large scale and the ratio of rain garden area to catchment area rr c generally 5 10 the rr c set as 6 8 and 10 for analysis 3 different concentrations referring to the monitoring of non point source pollution of urban rainfall runoff by li et al 2012 and jiang et al 2018 from 2012 to 2018 the concentrations of no3 n and nh3 n in the runoff that enters the rain gardens were high 12 and 6 mg l respectively moderate 6 and 3 mg l respectively and low 3 and 1 5 mg l respectively 3 1 2 internal design parameters 1 different aquifer depths the depth of the aquifer in the rain garden should be determined according to the plant s flood resistance and soil permeability and is generally set to 20 30 cm in this study aquifer depths of 20 25 and 30 cm are selected for analysis 2 different media layer depths the type and depth of the medium layer should meet the requirements of effluent quality and the technical requirements for plant cultivation and landscaping maintenance management the depth of the media layer of a rain garden is generally 25 120 cm the medium layer was divided into the planting soil layer and the filling layer the planting soil depth is set to 20 cm and the depths of the filling layer are 10 50 and 100 cm 3 different internal aquifer depths the gravel layer mainly plays a role in drainage the depth of the gravel layer in a rain garden is generally 25 30 cm a perforated drain pipe with a diameter of 100 150 mm buried at the bottom in improving the storage of the rain garden a gravel storage layer with a certain depth added below the invert of the drainage pipe such that it remains anaerobic this layer is called the internal aquifer area in this study the depths of the internal aquifer are 10 15 and 20 cm 3 2 effects of rain garden regulation under different external impact factors the drainmod was used to simulate the regulation effects of the rain gardens in different scenarios to conveniently compare different external impact factors the specifications of the rain gardens are selected the same as the study area in the simulation according to the principle of water balance rainfall in the rain garden comes in three forms drainage evaporation et and overflow the amounts of drainage et and overflow in the rain gardens are shown in fig 3 and the reduction results are shown in table 3 the load reduction rates for no3 n and nh3 n are shown in figures a 1 and a 2 respectively fig 3 shows that under different rainfall conditions tang et al 2018 reached the same conclusion as the rainfall conditions increase from the dry year to the wet year the runoff of inflow rainwater increases the total amount of drainage and the overflow flow rate gradually increase while the efficiency of rain garden regulation decreases with the increase of the rr c from 6 to 10 the runoff of inflow rainwater decreases according to the total amount of drainage and overflow decrease while the efficiency of rain garden regulation increases the results in table 3 shows that the total annual runoff reduction rates in tongde and kangding were 43 5 79 9 and 45 2 81 1 respectively under all scenarios the total runoff control rates significantly decreased by 16 0 and 19 9 by increasing rainfall conditions and rr c respectively the simulation results show that as the rainfall conditions vary from the dry year to the wet year the load reduction rate of no3 n increases whereas that of nh3 n decreases in the two gardens with the increase of the rr c the load reduction rates of nitrogen increase because the greater the proportion of garden area the less rainfall handled per unit area of the garden among all conditions the reduction rates of no3 n and nh3 n loads can exceed 50 the three external impact factors the rainfall condition rr c and the concentration have the higher influence on no3 n than nh3 n for the rainfall condition the influential levels of no3 n and nh3 n were 22 5 and 21 6 while the influential levels were 22 5 and 14 0 for the rr c 17 9 and 14 9 for the concentration moreover the reduction rates of no3 n load in the kangding rain garden were better than those in the tongde rain garden whereas the results of nh3 n showed minimal change the reason for this phenomenon is that the kangding rain garden is a drainage arrangement with an internal aquifer area the internal aquifer forms an anaerobic zone which promotes the denitrification and improves the effects of nitrate nitrogen at the same time some nitrate nitrogen is dissimilatory redacted to ammonia nitrogen under the condition of low oxygen which was consistent with the results of li et al 2018 3 3 effects of rain garden regulation under different internal design parameters the impact factors are fixed i e the rainfall condition is the normal year the inflow concentration is moderate concentration and rr c is 8 to conveniently compare and study the different internal design parameters with the tongde rain garden as an example the amounts of drainage et and overflow under different internal design parameters are shown in fig 4 and the reduction results are shown in table 4 fig 4 shows that as aquifer depth increases from 20 cm to 30 cm the total annual runoff control rates increased at first and then gradually decline the results of wang et al 2017 also showed that an increase in aquifer layer depth can decrease the overflow of rain gardens and thereby increase the load reduction rates in certain as the depths of the filling layers increase the total annual runoff control rates and load reduction rates of the rain gardens increase the results table 4 show that for different aquifer depths the average levels of the total annual runoff control rate the load reduction rates of no3 n and nh3 n were 19 2 5 6 and 6 3 respectively while which are 38 7 28 9 and 17 0 for the different filling layers wang 2011 also reached similar conclusions because as the depth of a rain garden s filler layer increases the water holding capacity and adsorption capacity of the filler increase and the amounts of drainage and overflow decrease in current research the main direction of studies on nitrogen removal from runoff pollutants is the effective removal of nitrate and the setting of an internal aquifer area is controversial brown and hunt 2011 the results in table 4 show that when the internal aquifer areas at different depths the regulation effects of rain gardens on the average total annual runoff control rate and the load reduction rates of no3 n and nh3 n reached its peak at 15cm table 4 shows that the levels of the average total annual runoff control rate the load reduction rates of no3 n and nh3 n were 5 0 16 4 and 14 0 under different internal aquifer depths respectively 3 4 design expert optimization of rain garden design parameters in the design expert software there is a special module that is a response surface methodology rsm qian at al 2017 based on the analysis and simulation results of the bsm explore the correlation between the regulation effects of the rain garden and the different factors to optimize the parameters 3 4 1 multiple quadratic regression analysis of the regulation effect of rain garden according to the conditions the impact factors the design parameters of the rain garden and the simulation results of the model that is the total annual runoff reduction rates and the pollutant reduction rates are sequentially input according to the results of model significance test both significance values of two rain gardens are less than 0 005 the correction coefficient r2 of annual runoff total control rate nitrate nitrogen load reduction rate and ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate of tongde and kangding rain gardens are both greater than 0 9 they can be used to analyze the three impact factors the rainfall conditions rr c and pollutants concentration and three design parameters aquifer depth filler layer depth and internal aquifer depth on the regulation effects of rain garden the specific

reduction with higher inflow concentration and 80 annual runoff rate at different rainfall and rr c conditions the three design parameters namely thickness of aquifer filler layer and internal aquifer are optimized the optimization results are shown in table 5 the optimization results in table 5 show that under the same qualification conditions the rain garden in kangding has lower total height than the rain garden in tongde that because the type of filler permeability coefficient saturated water content and internal aquifer greatly influence the regulation effects of the rain gardens optimization results show that with higher inflow concentration and the target of 80 total annual runoff control rate the rain garden with planting soil has a variation range on the total height 24cm 28cm on the rainfall conditions and rr c respectively meanwhile they are 25cm and 33cm for the rain garden with modified media as 60 planting soil 30 sand 5 sawdust 5 water treatment residue by volume to meet over 70 load reduction rates the rain garden with planting soil can treat stormwater under the combinations of rainfall conditions and rr c that is wet year 6 10 normal year 6 8 and dry year 6 the rain garden with modified media can treat stormwater as follows wet year 6 8 normal year 6 10 and dry year 6 8 4 conclusions the natural hydrological cycle is changing by global urbanization the water ecosystem used as a management tool in ecohydrology that is the basis of sustainable development strategies the single facility lid hydrological models have emerged as a scientific and effective measure for lid optimization design and the evaluation and prediction of operational performance the recarga and drainmod models were established to simulate the rain gardens in a sponge city pilot area in northwest china the verification results show that the drainmod has better reliability and stability than the recarga three impact factors rainfall conditions ratio of rain garden area to catchment area and pollutant concentration and three design parameters aquifer depth filling layer depth and internal aquifer depth related to the regulation effects of rain gardens were studied it can be concluded that by increasing rainfall conditions and rr c the total runoff control rates significantly decreased by 16 0 and 19 9 respectively the three external impact factors the rainfall condition rr c and the concentration have the higher influence on no3 n than nh3 n for the internal parameters the total annual runoff control rate changes slightly whereas the load reduction rates increase when the aquifer depth increases due to the filling layer depths increase from 10 cm to 100 cm the average levels of the total annual runoff control rate the load reduction rates of no3 n and nh3 n increased by 38 7 28 9 and 17 0 when the internal aquifer areas at different depths the regulation effects of rain gardens reached its peak at 15cm by combining the results of drainmod the rsm

engineering infrastructure wagner and breil 2013 from the perspective of ecohydrology the emergence of low impact development lid infrastructures provides a new idea for urban stormwater problems caused by the rapid development of urbanization and become the basis of sustainable development strategies to cope with global changes li et al 2018 as an integrated approach of stormwater management based on rainwater harvesting and source control lid improves chemical physical and a certain extent hydro morphological conditions for the functioning of water ecosystems by reducing fluxes elosegi and sabater 2013 an understanding of the lid facilities including absorbing capacity the resultant potential and limits for water matter and pollutant transformations are fundamental to recover the urban ecohydrology wagner et al 2013 with the lid technology extensively building the scholars have done lots of research on it and most of them focus on regulation effects and regional scale simulation however the scenario simulation by single facility lid models and the optimization of key parameters of lid facilities are rarely studied li at al 2018 the single facility lid hydrological models have emerged as a scientific and effective measure for lid optimization design and the evaluation and prediction of operational performance common single facility lid hydrological models include recarga drainmod hydrus and swc qi and qi 2017 among them the recarga and drainmod are easily and precisely applied however few studies analyzed the performance of the two models in northwest china therefore the current study uses the recarga and drainmod models to investigate the rain gardens in the tongde and kangding communities respectively in the xixian new area of shaanxi province the applicability and accuracy of the two lid models are compared and analyzed in northwest china the regulation effects of rain gardens on water quantity and quality under different conditions were simulated by changing the impact factors rainfall conditions ratio of rain garden area to catchment area and pollutant concentration and design parameters aquifer depth filling layer depth and internal aquifer depth of the rain gardens design expert was used to analyze and explore the correlation between different design parameters and the regulation efficiencies of rain garden to optimize the parameters and provide a basis for the rational design of rain gardens 2 materials and methods 2 1 model principle and parameter comparison single facility lid hydrological models were designed for different simulation objects hence their advantages limitations and applicable conditions vary selecting the appropriate model can improve the efficiency and accuracy of the model simulation therefore the structural principles the input and output conditions of the recarga and drainmod models were compared in table 1 table 1 shows that the two models based on the principle of water balance different modules used to simulate the hydrological characteristics of the rain gardens these modules are suitable for hydrological simulations involving long term sequences although drainmod needs to input more parameters than recarga it can simulate the depth of the inner aquifer the solute migration and transformation after the rainwater enters the rain garden especially on the migrations of nitrogen and salt in rain gardens youssef et al 2018 2 2 overview of study area the rain gardens in this study located in the tongde community east longitude 108 43 8 4 north latitude 34

garden 2 3 establishment of study area model according to the basic data of the study area the two hydrological models were established via recarga and drainmod individually four types of parameters entered meteorological data soil data design parameters of drainage systems and nitrogen transport parameters skaggs et al 2012 the recarga does not need to enter the nitrogen transport parameters the meteorological data input for the 2017 daily rainfall obtained from the weather station of xi an university of technology water resources institute and the 2017 daily maximum and minimum temperatures obtained from the weather network were used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration using the steady state thornthwaite empirical formula thornthwaite 1948 table 2 lists rainfall duration rainfall maximum rainfall intensity rainfall type and runoff reduction rate during the monitoring period the inflow and outflow water samples were measured by 30 triangular rafts and the water level data are collected by a network liquid level acquisition system mx7200 the amount of water inflow and outflow of the garden was calculated by the following formula q 8 15 Œº t g Œ∏ 2 2 g h 2 5 where q

runoff volume v is v i 1 n q i Œ¥ t i where qi is the instantaneous inflow or outflow of the i th period l min Œ¥t is the monitoring time period min initial stage of rainfall the samples of inflow and outflow were taken in every 5 mins when rainfall lasts for 20 min the samples were taken every 10 min when it last for 1h then taken in every 20 min the samples from the field were taken in time to the 4 c refrigerator water sample analysis indicators including the no3 n and nh3 n and they were analyzed completely in 1 2 days ultraviolet spectrophotometry and nessler s reagent spectrometry were used to determine the no3 n and nh3 n respectively state epa of china 2012 the tensiometer and cutting ring were used to determine soil moisture and saturated hydraulic conductivity respectively guo et al 2019 the design parameters of the drainage system are the basic parameters of the rain gardens including the depth of the drain pipe the depth of the impervious layer and the drainage coefficient except for the drainage coefficient comes from the reference all of these parameters are measured in the field nitrogen transport parameters include initial nitrogen content of soil and rainfall nitrification process parameters denitrification process parameters and organic matter decomposition parameters among these parameters the nitrification process parameters denitrification process parameters and organic matter decomposition parameters are gained from the reference for the initial nitrogen content of soil no3 n was extracted by the potassium chloride solution from the soil and nh3 n was extracted by the potassium chloride solution from the soil state epa of china 2012 after the parameter input is completed hydrology and nitrogen modules were selected for simulation in the model and the model run continuously for the entire period 2 4 model parameter 2 4 1 parameter sensitivity analysis parameter sensitivity analysis aims to qualitatively or quantitatively evaluate the effects of model input errors on model output in this study the parameters that must be determined are selected and the morris screening method was used to analyze the local sensitivity of the model parameters becker et al 2018 the modified morris screening method allows independent variables to be varied by a fixed percentage of the step size and the final sensitivity discriminant factor is the average of multiple morris coefficients sharifan et al 2010 the formula is s i 1 n y i 1 y i y 0 p i 1 p i 100 n where s is the factor of parameter sensitivity yi is the output value of the i th run of the model yi 1 is the output value of the i 1 th run y0 is the initial value of the calculated result after the parameter adjustment pi is the percent change of the parameter value after the i th run model relative to the initial parameter value pi 1 is the percent change of the parameter value after the i 1 th run model relative to the initial parameter value n is the running times of the model according to the factor of parameter sensitivity value s the morris method was used to divide the sensitivities of the parameters into four categories s 1 highly sensitive parameter 0 2 s 1 sensitive parameter 0 05 s 0 2 moderately sensitive parameter and 0 s 0 05 insensitive parameter ge and menendez 2017 the simulation results are shown in table a 1 supplementary information the results of the parameter sensitivity analysis are as follows in the recarga model kn dp kp sensitivity parameter ds dd ks moderate sensitivity parameter and dn insensitivity parameter in the

combined with the sensitivity analysis results the parameters of the rain gardens in the two models were verified in parameter calibration the squared correlation coefficient r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens grunwald and qi 2006 were used to evaluate the simulation results of the model the simulation results of the rain garden in the tongde community were selected and shown in fig 2 in the verification results of the recarga model the r2 values of the runoff simulated and measured results for the tongde and kangding communities are 0 53 and 0 61 respectively and the ens values are 0 35 and 0 43 respectively as for the verification results of the drainmod the r2 values of the tongde and kangding communities are 0 89 and 0 91 respectively and the ens values are 0 74 and 0 72 respectively the r2 and ens values of the pollutant index were higher than 0 92 and 0 32 respectively the model verification results show that the drainmod can simulate the migration of pollutants in the rain gardens and the depth of the inner aquifer and that its simulation accuracy is higher than that of the recarga the drainmod in the study area has good reliability and stability therefore the drainmod was selected for the scenario design and discussion the simulation results are shown in table a 2 supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 scenario design 3 1 1 external impact factors 1 different rainfall conditions by comparing and analyzing the adaptability and simulation accuracy in this study area the drainmod was selected after the calibration to simulate different scenarios according to the meteorological data of xi an meteorological station in the past 60 years and the hydrological frequency distribution curve software the selected rainstorm frequencies are 25 50 and 75 to compare the results of the different rainfall conditions easily three levels of the rainfall time series consist of wet year 1972 normal year 1990 and dry year 1995 the corresponding annual rainfalls were 635 542 and 466 mm respectively the hydrological effects of the study area were analyzed and compared 2 different catchment areas according to the sponge city construction technical guide low impact development system construction trial a rain garden is characterized by a scattered layout and an adequately large scale and the ratio of rain garden area to catchment area rr c generally 5 10 the rr c set as 6 8 and 10 for analysis 3 different concentrations referring to the monitoring of non point source pollution of urban rainfall runoff by li et al 2012 and jiang et al 2018 from 2012 to 2018 the concentrations of no3 n and nh3 n in the runoff that enters the rain gardens were high 12 and 6 mg l respectively moderate 6 and 3 mg l respectively and low 3 and 1 5 mg l respectively 3 1 2 internal design parameters 1 different aquifer depths the depth of the aquifer in the rain garden should be determined according to the plant s flood resistance and soil permeability and is generally set to 20 30 cm in this study aquifer depths of 20 25 and 30 cm are selected for analysis 2 different media layer depths the type and depth of the medium layer should meet the requirements of effluent quality and the technical requirements for plant cultivation and landscaping maintenance management the depth of the media layer of a rain garden is generally 25 120 cm the medium layer was divided into the planting soil layer and the filling layer the planting soil depth is set to 20 cm and the depths of the filling layer are 10 50 and 100 cm 3 different internal aquifer depths the gravel layer mainly plays a role in drainage the depth of the gravel layer in a rain garden is generally 25 30 cm a perforated drain pipe with a diameter of 100 150 mm buried at the bottom in improving the storage of the rain garden a gravel storage layer with a certain depth added below the invert of the drainage pipe such that it remains anaerobic this layer is called the internal aquifer area in this study the depths of the internal aquifer are 10 15 and 20 cm 3 2 effects of rain garden regulation under different external impact factors the drainmod was used to simulate the regulation effects of the rain gardens in different scenarios to conveniently compare different external impact factors the specifications of the rain gardens are selected the same as the study area in the simulation according to the principle of water balance rainfall in the rain garden comes in three forms drainage evaporation et and overflow the amounts of drainage et and overflow in the rain gardens are shown in fig 3 and the reduction results are shown in table 3 the load reduction rates for no3 n and nh3 n are shown in figures a 1 and a 2 respectively fig 3 shows that under different rainfall conditions tang et al 2018 reached the same conclusion as the rainfall conditions increase from the dry year to the wet year the runoff of inflow rainwater increases the total amount of drainage and the overflow flow rate gradually increase while the efficiency of rain garden regulation decreases with the increase of the rr c from 6 to 10 the runoff of inflow rainwater decreases according to the total amount of drainage and overflow decrease while the efficiency of rain garden regulation increases the results in table 3 shows that the total annual runoff reduction rates in tongde and kangding were 43 5 79 9 and 45 2 81 1 respectively under all scenarios the total runoff control rates significantly decreased by 16 0 and 19 9 by increasing rainfall conditions and rr c respectively the simulation results show that as the rainfall conditions vary from the dry year to the wet year the load reduction rate of no3 n increases whereas that of nh3 n decreases in the two gardens with the increase of the rr c the load reduction rates of nitrogen increase because the greater the proportion of garden area the less rainfall handled per unit area of the garden among all conditions the reduction rates of no3 n and nh3 n loads can exceed 50 the three external impact factors the rainfall condition rr c and the concentration have the higher influence on no3 n than nh3 n for the rainfall condition the influential levels of no3 n and nh3 n were 22 5 and 21 6 while the influential levels were 22 5 and 14 0 for the rr c 17 9 and 14 9 for the concentration moreover the reduction rates of no3 n load in the kangding rain garden were better than those in the tongde rain garden whereas the results of nh3 n showed minimal change the reason for this phenomenon is that the kangding rain garden is a drainage arrangement with an internal aquifer area the internal aquifer forms an anaerobic zone which promotes the denitrification and improves the effects of nitrate nitrogen at the same time some nitrate nitrogen is dissimilatory redacted to ammonia nitrogen under the condition of low oxygen which was consistent with the results of li et al 2018 3 3 effects of rain garden regulation under different internal design parameters the impact factors are fixed i e the rainfall condition is the normal year the inflow concentration is moderate concentration and rr c is 8 to conveniently compare and study the different internal design parameters with the tongde rain garden as an example the amounts of drainage et and overflow under different internal design parameters are shown in fig 4 and the reduction results are shown in table 4 fig 4 shows that as aquifer depth increases from 20 cm to 30 cm the total annual runoff control rates increased at first and then gradually decline the results of wang et al 2017 also showed that an increase in aquifer layer depth can decrease the overflow of rain gardens and thereby increase the load reduction rates in certain as the depths of the filling layers increase the total annual runoff control rates and load reduction rates of the rain gardens increase the results table 4 show that for different aquifer depths the average levels of the total annual runoff control rate the load reduction rates of no3 n and nh3 n were 19 2 5 6 and 6 3 respectively while which are 38 7 28 9 and 17 0 for the different filling layers wang 2011 also reached similar conclusions because as the depth of a rain garden s filler layer increases the water holding capacity and adsorption capacity of the filler increase and the amounts of drainage and overflow decrease in current research the main direction of studies on nitrogen removal from runoff pollutants is the effective removal of nitrate and the setting of an internal aquifer area is controversial brown and hunt 2011 the results in table 4 show that when the internal aquifer areas at different depths the regulation effects of rain gardens on the average total annual runoff control rate and the load reduction rates of no3 n and nh3 n reached its peak at 15cm table 4 shows that the levels of the average total annual runoff control rate the load reduction rates of no3 n and nh3 n were 5 0 16 4 and 14 0 under different internal aquifer depths respectively 3 4 design expert optimization of rain garden design parameters in the design expert software there is a special module that is a response surface methodology rsm qian at al 2017 based on the analysis and simulation results of the bsm explore the correlation between the regulation effects of the rain garden and the different factors to optimize the parameters 3 4 1 multiple quadratic regression analysis of the regulation effect of rain garden according to the conditions the impact factors the design parameters of the rain garden and the simulation results of the model that is the total annual runoff reduction rates and the pollutant reduction rates are sequentially input according to the results of model significance test both significance values of two rain gardens are less than 0 005 the correction coefficient r2 of annual runoff total control rate nitrate nitrogen load reduction rate and ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate of tongde and kangding rain gardens are both greater than 0 9 they can be used to analyze the three impact factors the rainfall conditions rr c and pollutants concentration and three design parameters aquifer depth filler layer depth and internal aquifer depth on the regulation effects of rain garden the specific

reduction with higher inflow concentration and 80 annual runoff rate at different rainfall and rr c conditions the three design parameters namely thickness of aquifer filler layer and internal aquifer are optimized the optimization results are shown in table 5 the optimization results in table 5 show that under the same qualification conditions the rain garden in kangding has lower total height than the rain garden in tongde that because the type of filler permeability coefficient saturated water content and internal aquifer greatly influence the regulation effects of the rain gardens optimization results show that with higher inflow concentration and the target of 80 total annual runoff control rate the rain garden with planting soil has a variation range on the total height 24cm 28cm on the rainfall conditions and rr c respectively meanwhile they are 25cm and 33cm for the rain garden with modified media as 60 planting soil 30 sand 5 sawdust 5 water treatment residue by volume to meet over 70 load reduction rates the rain garden with planting soil can treat stormwater under the combinations of rainfall conditions and rr c that is wet year 6 10 normal year 6 8 and dry year 6 the rain garden with modified media can treat stormwater as follows wet year 6 8 normal year 6 10 and dry year 6 8 4 conclusions the natural hydrological cycle is changing by global urbanization the water ecosystem used as a management tool in ecohydrology that is the basis of sustainable development strategies the single facility lid hydrological models have emerged as a scientific and effective measure for lid optimization design and the evaluation and prediction of operational performance the recarga and drainmod models were established to simulate the rain gardens in a sponge city pilot area in northwest china the verification results show that the drainmod has better reliability and stability than the recarga three impact factors rainfall conditions ratio of rain garden area to catchment area and pollutant concentration and three design parameters aquifer depth filling layer depth and internal aquifer depth related to the regulation effects of rain gardens were studied it can be concluded that by increasing rainfall conditions and rr c the total runoff control rates significantly decreased by 16 0 and 19 9 respectively the three external impact factors the rainfall condition rr c and the concentration have the higher influence on no3 n than nh3 n for the internal parameters the total annual runoff control rate changes slightly whereas the load reduction rates increase when the aquifer depth increases due to the filling layer depths increase from 10 cm to 100 cm the average levels of the total annual runoff control rate the load reduction rates of no3 n and nh3 n increased by 38 7 28 9 and 17 0 when the internal aquifer areas at different depths the regulation effects of rain gardens reached its peak at 15cm by combining the results of drainmod the rsm of design expert software was utilized to explore the correlation between different scenarios and water quantity quality reduction rates which is used to optimize the structural parameters of rain gardens under the same qualification conditions the rain garden with planting soil has a lower total height than the rain garden with modified media as 60 planting soil 30 sand 5 sawdust 5 water treatment residue by volume with higher inflow concentration and 80 the annual runoff reduction rate the total heights change 26 cm and 30 cm on the different rainfall and rr c conditions respectively to meet over 70 load reduction rates the rain garden with planting soil can treat stormwater under the combinations of rainfall conditions and rr c that is wet year 6 10 normal year 6 8 and dry year 6 8 the rain garden with modified media can treat stormwater as follows wet year 6 8 normal year 6 10 and dry year 6 8 the results of this work provide a theoretical basis and important data support for
