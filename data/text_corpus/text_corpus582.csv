2910,a typical karst aquifer configuration is the multiple conduit structure however it remains to be investigated how the aperture distributions and the flow rate should influence the transport process in the multiple conduit structures to better understand the transport process in the multiple conduit structures 11 lab scale dual conduit structures are manufactured by varying the apertures of the two conduits h 1 and h 2 denote the aperture width of the shorter conduit and the longer conduit respectively solute transport experiments of three different flow rates are conducted on these structures as the flow rate increases the dual conduit structures are more likely to present dual peaked btcs the 11 structures make one exhaustive representation of the possible aperture combination of the dual conduit structures and the transport experiments have been conducted by three flow rates varying by 2 degrees of magnitude so the experimental results constitute a detailed material that should improve the understanding of transport processes in such structures two numerical models weighted sum advection dispersion equation wsade and dual region mobile immobile model drmim are applied to fit the experimental btcs in order to obtain some insight into the actual solute transport processes by exploring the calibrated model parameters considering the possible effect of solute detention we initially applied the drmim model this drmim better replicated the experimental btcs than the wsade this study suggests the karst community shall take the drmim as one candidate transport model for characterizing the dual peaked btcs obtained in karst aquifers keywords dual conduit structure flow rate aperture width dual peaked btc data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction artificial tracing is a useful tool for investigating karst aquifers goldscheider et al 2008a injecting a known quantity of tracer at an upstream position and monitoring the variations in the tracer concentration at a downstream location yields a breakthrough curve btc btcs can bring information on underground karst geometry wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 and effective transport parameters goldscheider and drew 2007 laboratory experiments have been widely applied to investigate the flow and transport processes through complex karst aquifers the major advantage of lab scale experiments over field experiments is their flexibility in that they allow for a flexible selection of sampling points easy implementation of different hydraulic conditions as well as detailed knowledge of the geometry of the studied media mohammadi et al 2021 according to mohammadi et al 2021 the common laboratory karst models can be categorized into three groups rock block pipe fracture network and pipe matrix coupling model for the rock block model artificial fractures or conduits can be created on a rock block to make a physical model the rock block model has supported various research works including hydraulic tomography brauchler et al 2003 2013 sharmeen et al 2012 investigation of the flow process anaya et al 2014 cherubini et al 2012 develi babadagli 2015 difrenna et al 2008 leven et al 2004 investigation of solute cherubini et al 2012 and heat transport process cherubini et al 2017 pastore et al 2015 concerning the pipe fracture network model researchers have manufactured single fracture models qian et al 2007 2011 tzelepis et al 2015 fracture networks hull et al 1987 karay hajnal 2015 and conduit networks anger alexander 2013 field leij 2012 wu et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 the experiments on these lab scale models have revealed some fundamental mechanisms controlling the flow and transport process in karst media for example qian et al 2011 found that the solute transport process in a single fracture exhibit btcs with heavy tailing field and leij 2012 found that three karst geometries may exhibit multi peaked btcs an auxiliary conduit is connected to the main conduit waterfall and pools while the effect of matrix is not considered in the pipe fracture network models several studies have focused on the effect of the transport exchange between conduits and matrix to this end they have used pipe matrix coupling models castro 2017 faulkner et al 2009 florea wicks 2001 gallegos et al 2013 li et al 2008 mohammadi et al 2019 xiao et al 2018 for example li et al 2008 have studied contaminant retention processes in the matrix of pipe matrix coupling models mohammadi et al 2019 built bench scale karst models and investigated the influence of hydraulic gradient and cave pattern on tracing test btcs the classical advection dispersion equation ade bear 1988 majdalani et al 2015 model often fails to reproduce the btcs of the tracing tests goldscheider et al 2008b hauns et al 2001 massei et al 2006 moreno tsang 1991 perrin luetscher 2008 the ade is valid for the btcs obtained in homogeneous porous media under some conditions berkowitz et al 2006 however all aquifers are heterogeneous to different degrees bakalowicz 2005 ghodrati jury 1992 levy berkowitz 2003 and among them fractured and karst aquifers are particularly heterogeneous bakalowicz 2005 heterogeneous media entail anomalous or non fickian transport behaviors which may exhibit btcs with early arrivals and late time tails or multi peaked btcs these particularities cannot be well represented by the ade model a variety of models accounting for anomalous transport have been developed mobile immobile model mim van genuchten wierenga 1976 and transient storage model tsm runkel 1998 have a similar structure one mobile region the main channel governed by ade and one immobile stagnant region the two regions exchange mass due to concentration difference the tsm has been applied to reproduce btcs from solute transport experiments in lab scale karst models dewaide et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 2021 the multi region ade model majdalani et al 2015 2018 consists of two or more ade regions flowing in parallel and these regions exchange mass due to concentration differences these multi region ade models were successfully used to model lab scale solute transport experiments field leij 2012 majdalani et al 2015 2018 wang et al 2020 the so called weighted sum ade wsade model field leij 2012 also considers several parallel ade regions while the mass exchange between the regions is not considered dual peaked btcs can be reproduced by the two region ade model wang et al 2020 or the wsade model field leij 2012 the tracing btcs can be influenced by different properties of karst aquifers via numerical simulation of solute transport process in a conceptual karst model of dual flow system i e conduit and matrix peely et al 2021 have studied the effect of six properties on the btcs including i tracing distance and karst tortuosity ii hydraulic gradient iii matrix hydraulic conductivity iv exchange flow v conduit diameter and vi conduit roughness height for example increasing tracing distance causes the peak concentration c p to decrease and the peak time t p to become longer increasing tortuosity also causes c p to decrease and t p to lengthen for another example increasing the exchange coefficient the degree of hydraulic connection between the conduit and the host matrix causes c p to increase and t p to shorten the diameter variation of a single conduit may cause btcs with strong tailing hauns et al 2001 zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 the different karst network patterns should influence the btcs shape mohammadi et al 2019 and multi peaked btcs are frequently observed in karst aquifers in a previous study wang et al 2020 we carried out solute transport experiments on different dual conduit karst configurations and investigated how the dual peaked btcs can be influenced by some properties of the dual conduit structure specifically increasing the length ratio causes the two peaks to be more separated increasing the total length causes the two peaks to be more separated and the concentration value of both peaks to be lower the connection angles between the divergence conduits and the convergence conduit also influence the btcs however the study presented by wang et al 2020 has two main limitations first we assumed an ideal situation for all the structures the two conduits have the same diameter since the objective of wang et al 2020 is to study the effect of length and connection angle of the conduits this ideal situation does not harm the previous experimental conclusions according to the field observations the different conduits usually bear different diameters it is unclear how the different conduit diameter combinations may influence the transport process thus it is important to study the structures that have different conduit diameter combinations in order to better understand the transport process in such dual conduit structures second the previous transport experiments have been conducted under a constant flow rate while in natural karst aquifers flow rate is not constant it is also unclear how the flow rate may influence the transport process the objective of this paper is to answer two research questions that arose from the one dimensional experiments reported in wang et al 2020 namely the influence of conduits aperture and flow rate on the transport process in dual conduit structures 11 bench scale physical configurations with different aperture combinations are built solute transport experiments are conducted under three different flow rates then two transport models are applied in this study the weighted sum advection dispersion equation wsade model and the dual region mobile immobile model drmim we use both models to fit the observed btcs and check how the different transport processes may influence the calibrated model parameters along with wang et al 2020 the purpose of the present paper is to enrich and complement the available experimental and modeling material on the transport process in dual conduit structures 2 experimental setup 2 1 dual conduit structures the dual conduit experimental models are made of transparent pvc boards assembled in three layers the top and bottom layers fig 1 a c are the same a single pvc board 150 25 2 cm the middle layer fig 1a c includes five boards of various sizes with a thickness of 0 5 cm the three layers are assembled fig 1d with transparent silicone the void in the middle layer serves as the space for fluid flow in this physical model we make 11 different physical configurations by varying the position of the central board marked by the red dot in fig 1b in the middle layer the apertures of the main and parallel conduits are denoted respectively by h 1 and h 2 fig 2 h 1 and h 2 are varied by 1 cm increments such that h 1 h 2 10 cm for all configurations table 1 leaving the total void volume v m 675 cm3 unchanged the various geometric configurations are labeled in the form h 1 h 2 e g configuration 4 6 stands for h 1 4 cm and h 2 6 cm for the central board in the middle layer the spacing from the longitudinal axis is denoted as m m h 2 5 cm 5 cm h 1 the 11 configurations are divided into two groups group 1 includes configurations 1 6 the shorter conduit has a smaller aperture than the longer conduit h 1 h 2 group 2 includes configurations 7 11 the shorter conduit has a larger aperture h 1 h 2 with these configurations we focus on the effect of conduit apertures while the other properties of the dual conduit structures remain constant first the lengths of the dual conduits are constant for these configurations 105 cm for the shorter conduit and 125 cm for the longer conduit second the connection angle combinations θ 1 θ 2 of the 11 configurations are considered to be the same θ 1 0 and θ 2 90 fig 2 we have applied a rather large scale for this experimental model 150 15 0 5 cm aiming at reducing the error in the model geometry which can be inevitable to a certain degree in the manufacturing process the error in the aperture of the conduits may cause especially detrimental damage to the experimental results because the flow resistance of a single conduit is highly sensitive to the aperture barnard et al 1966 to reduce the effect caused by the possible aperture error we apply as large a scale as possible for the experimental model on a large scale the influence caused by the aperture error would be relatively minor 2 2 step tracing experiments the experimental setup of solute tracing experiments is shown in fig 3 the physical model is placed on a horizontal platform to eliminate density effects the physical model is first filled with deionized water the inlet is connected to a solution tank deionized water nacl concentration c 0 0 06 mol l a peristaltic pump lead fluidtm supplies the flow rate q l s at the outlet a sensor wtw tetracon 325tm conductimeter resolution 10 6 mol l is used to measure the tracer concentration and infer the btc the outflowing water falls into a glass placed on a weighing machine mettler toledotm that allows the flow rate to be monitored the sensor and weighing machine are connected to a data logger campbell cr1000tm for automatic data sampling a step tracing test is conducted under a constant flow rate until the concentration at the outlet reaches c 0 to reduce measurement error each experiment is replicated three times the final data is obtained as the average of the three experimental btcs denoted as c t three different flow rates spanning two orders of magnitudes are used for the three flow rates the different data sampling intervals and total experimental time are shown in table 2 3 numerical modeling 3 1 transport models a weighted sum advection dispersion equation wsade model with two regions we consider applying the two region wsade model table 3 because the physical structures have two flow conduits the definition sketch of the two region wsade is shown in fig 4 two regions are assumed to flow in parallel without any exchange in both regions the ade model is assumed valid 1a c i t u i c i x d i 2 c i x 2 0 i 1 2 1b w 1 w 2 1 the total concentration at the outlet is obtained from a flux balance 2 c w 1 u 1 c 1 w 2 u 2 c 2 w 1 u 1 w 2 u 2 where ci is the outlet concentration ml 3 of region i di is the dispersion coefficient l2t 1 l 1 5 m is the model length t is time t ui is the flow velocity lt 1 x is the space coordinate l and wi is the volume fraction of region i owing to equation 1b only one of the two fractions w 1 w 2 is a free parameter the parameter set u 1 u 2 d 1 d 2 w 1 is calibrated to fit the experimental btcs to reduce the size of the parameter space regions 1 and 2 are distinguished by imposing u 1 u 2 by definition b dual region mobile immobile drmim model the drmim model is based on the mobile immobile mim model van genuchten wierenga 1976 the mim consists of a mobile region governed by the conventional ade and an immobile region the two regions are coupled by an exchange term for the drmim model the total concentration at the outlet is the superposition of two regions of mim fig 5 the governing equations of the drmim model are 3a w m i c m i t w i m i c i m i t w m i d m i 2 c m i x 2 w m i u m i c m i x i 1 2 3b w i m i c i m i t k i c m i c i m i i 1 2 3c w i m i w m i w m i m i

are the dispersion coefficients in the two mim regions k 1 and k 2 t 1 are the mass transfer coefficients u m 1 and u m 2 lt 1 are the flow velocities w m 1 and w m 2 are the volume fractions of the mobile regions w im 1 and w im 2 are the volume fractions of the immobile regions w mim 1 and w mim 2 are the volumetric fractions of the two mim regions the total concentration at the outlet is obtained from a flux balance over the two mobile regions 4 c w m 1 u m 1 c m 1 w m 2 u m 2 c m 2 w m 1 u m 1 w m 2 u m 2 owing to equations 3c d the four fractions w m 1 w m 2 w im 1 w im 2 have three degrees of freedom in practice nine independent parameters are calibrated to fit the experimental btcs u m 1 d m 1 k 1 w m 1 u m 2 d m 2 k 2 w m 2 w mim 1 as for the wsade model by definition u m 1 u m 2 the drmim model has more parameters and thus more flexibility than the wsade model then the drmim should be expected to better reproduce some btcs than the wsade 3 2 parameter calibration technique the model parameters are calibrated with the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method haario et al 2006 the mcmc method is a bayesian approach that evaluates the posterior distributions of parameters vrugt et al 2006 to achieve a fast convergence of the chain we first perform a manual fitting of the model response to the experimental btcs to find the initial parameter set then the metropolis hastings algorithm robert 2015 successively draws samples from the posterior distribution by forming a markov chain of the model parameter set in this work we assume the posterior probability density is of a gaussian type for each chain 10 000 iterations are executed the mean value of the last 50 sampled parameter sets is determined as the calibrated parameter value the root mean square error rmse objective function is applied to evaluate the deviation and the convergence of the mcmc chains 5 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n where x is the experimental data n is the data quantity y is the simulated data 4 results 4 1 experiment results some treatments are conducted to the concentration variations of the step tracing experiments c t first the derivative of c t to t denoted as c der t is calculated and used for the exhibition of the experiment results and model benchmarking if the injection signal is a concentration step using c der t is equivalent to performing a tracing experiment using a dirac pulse input signal majdalani et al 2015 which is more approximate to the common practice in natural aquifers second the c der t curves are normalized with pore volume 6a p v t tq v m 6b c n t c d e r t 0 c d e r t d p v t where c n is the normalized concentration pv is the injected pore volume fraction v m 675 cm3 is the volume of the physical model l3 all of the experimental btcs are exhibited in the form of c n pv because this transformation makes it convenient for us to compare the experiment btcs of different flow rates after the normalization the area below the curve of c n pv is 1 unitless 4 1 1 effect of flow rate fig 6 shows the experimental c n pv curves for the three flow rates the 11 configurations are divided into two groups for plotting for group 1 h 1 h 2 fig 6a for group 2 h 1 h 2 fig 6b for the lowest flow rate of 6 69 10 5 l s 2 rpm the curves are right skewed and the curves of 2 rpm have the lowest peak value when compared to the other two flow rates the curves of the middle flow rate 6 84 10 4 l s 20 rpm have the largest peak value and sharpest peak all of these curves of the middle flow rate are still single peaked while there is a bump on the falling limb of the 8 2 curve which indicates the existence of two separate tracer plumes the curves of the highest flow rate 6 62 10 3 l s 200 rpm have a medium peak value under this flow rate there are three types of curves 1 some curves show obvious dual peaks 5 5 4 6 9 1 2 other curves have one peak while there is an obvious bump on the falling limb 6 4 7 3 8 2 these btcs are similar to the dual peaked btcs but the two peaks are so close that they superpose 3 some configurations exhibit curves with only one peak 3 7 2 8 1 9 0 10 10 0 when compared to lowest and middle flow rates more curves of the highest flow rate exhibit dual peaked curves 4 1 2 effect of aperture the effect of aperture variation is analyzed using the curves of the highest flow rate because this is the flow rate for which the contrast between the btcs is the most pronounced the 11 btcs are divided into two groups for plotting for group 1 h 1 h 2 fig 7 a for group 2 h 1 h 2 fig 7b in fig 7a configurations 5 5 and 4 6 yield btcs with two peaks which indicates a significant difference between the travel times in the main and diverging conduit for 5 5 the early peak is larger than the later peak the btc for configuration 4 6 is rather unusual in that the early peak is slightly smaller than the late peak while dual peaked btcs are known to mostly exhibit a larger early peak than the late peak field leij 2012 florea wicks 2001 mohammadi et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the remaining configurations 3 7 2 8 1 9 0 10 exhibit single peaked btcs those btcs are similar in fig 7b the btcs of configurations 6 4 7 3 and 8 2 exhibit a single peak but a bump is visible within the falling limb these btcs appear as intermediate between the dual peaked and single peaked btcs as the configuration changes from 5 to 5 to 8 2 the btcs peak the early plume occurs increasingly earlier as the configuration changes from 8 to 2 to 10 0 the btcs peak occurs increasingly later as the configuration changes from 6 to 4 to 10 0 the late plume bump or the second peak occurs increasingly delayed among all of the configurations the btcs obtained by 5 5 and 4 6 exhibit lower peak values than the other configurations the falling limbs of these two btcs are also more delayed than the others hauns et al 2001 showed that different karst geometry may cause different steamline distributions thus different degrees of solute detention effects the solute transport processes in the experiments should also be different due to the different structure of the configurations there may be a stronger detention effect for the transport processes in configurations 5 5 and 4 6 which has caused these two btcs to be more delayed comparing group 1 to group 2 we find that configurations 4 6 and 6 4 exhibit very different btcs for 4 6 the early peak is smaller than the late peak for 6 4 there is a bump on the falling limb similarly configuration 3 7 exhibits different results from 7 to 3 etc the difference between the two groups suggests that both conduit lengths and apertures influence the transport process in this study the double peaks overlap to a large extent 5 5 4 6 in contrast with dual peaked btcs reported by field leij 2012 wang et al 2020 the present experiments exhibit only a slight separation between the two peaks this can be explained by a small contrast between the lengths of the conduits length ratio 125 105 1 19 for our dual conduit structures as discussed in wang et al 2020 the closer the length ratio to unity the closer the two peaks are 4 2 modeling results in this section we present the modeling results to the btcs of the highest flow rate 6 62 10 3 l s 200 rpm and investigate how the aperture setup may influence the model parameters the modeling results of the 2 rpm curves and the 20 rpm curves can be found in appendix a 4 2 1 wsade the wsade model can reproduce most of the btcs fig 8 the rmse values range between 2 59 10 4 and 6 36 10 4 m2 s table 4 for configuration 5 5 the dual peaked btc is well reproduced rmse 4 87 10 4 region 1 accounts for the first peak of the btc and region 2 accounts for the second one for configuration 4 6 wsade exhibits a degraded fitting performance rmse 5 69 10 4 and the wsade model fails to reproduce the double peak behavior for configurations 3 7 2 8 1 9 0 10 and 10 0 the wsade well reproduces the single peaked btcs rmse ranges between 2 59 10 4 and 3 96 10 4 for configurations 6 4 7 3 and 8 2 the fitting performances are also good rmse ranges between 2 81 10 4 and 6 36 10 4 region 1 accounts for the first peak and region 2 accounts for the bump on the falling limb for configuration 9 1 the fitting performance is degraded as the second peak is not well reproduced rmse 4 70 10 4 we examine the calibrated wsade parameters for the configurations with m 1 cm the velocity u 1 is larger than u 2 the dispersion d 1 is smaller than d 2 and the volume fraction w 1 is larger than 0 5 configuration 4 6 m 1 cm presents the smallest u 1 and the smallest u 2 among all configurations the small values of u 1 and u 2 indicate that t peak1 and t peak2 the peak time of wsade region 1 and region 2 respectively are larger than the other configurations configuration 4 6 presents the largest d 1 4 13 10 4 m2 s and the largest w 1 0 793 this is because the wsade region 1 covers most of the btc while region 2 covers only a small part of the tail for 4 6 fig 8 from configurations 3 7 to 0 10 m 2 to 5 cm u 1 ranges between 1 61 10 2 and 1 69 10 2 m s u 2 ranges between 1 28 10 2 and 1 36 10 2 m s d 1 ranges between 1 45 10 4 and 2 00 10 4 d 2 ranges between 6 34 10 4 to 8 94 10 4 m2 s w 1 shows decreasing trend on the whole it decreases from 0 609 to 0 527 then we introduce the calibrated wsade parameters for the configurations with negative m from configuration 5 5 to 8 2 m 0 1 2 3 u 1 increases from 1 77 10 2 to 1 85 10 2 from 8 to 2 to 10 0 m 3 4 5 u 1 decreases to 1 70 10 2 from 5 to 5 to 6 4 u 2 increases from 1 38 10 2 to 1 54 10 2 then from 6 to 4 to 9 1 u 2 decreases from 1 54 10 2 to 1 17 10 2 the values u 1 and u 2 reflect the variations in the arrival times of the peaks in fig 7b from 5 to 5 to 9 1 m 0 4 d 1 increases from 6 34 10 5 to 2 04 10 4 and d 2 increases from 5 47 10 4 to 1 22 10 3 w 1 the volume fraction of the faster region increases from 0 099 to 0 597 d 2 is larger than d 1 for all flow configurations larger d 2 values are needed so that wsade region 2 can generate a wider peak to reproduce the later tail of the experimental btcs further explanations are provided in section 5 3 4 2 2 drmim the drmim can well reproduce all btcs fig 10 capturing all of the features of the btcs the peaks the bumps and the tails visually the drmim exhibits better characterization for the dual peaked curves 5 5 4 6 9 1 and the bump tail curves 6 4 7 3 8 2 than the wsade fig 8 we calculate the rmse values of the two models fitting results in fig 8 and fig 10 quantitatively the rmse values of the drmim are much lower than the wsade fig 11 the calibrated drmim parameters are presented in table 4 and shown in fig 12 as shown in fig 12a u m 1 value has exhibited a relatively smaller variance than u m 2 for the single peaked btcs m 2 3 4 5 5 cm the contrasts between u m 1 and u m 2 are relatively smaller for the dual peaked btcs m 0 1 4 cm or the bump tailed btcs m 1 2 3 cm the contrasts between u m 1 and u m 2 are relatively larger as the configuration changes from 5 to 5 to 8 2 m decreases from 0 to 3 the early peak arrives increasingly earlier thus u m 1 increases from 1 74 10 2 to 1 83 10 2 m s from 8 to 2 to 10 0 m decreases from 3 to 5 the early peak arrives increasingly delayed thus u m 1 decreases from 1 83 10 2 to 1 70 10 2 m s as the configuration changes from 6 to 4 to 9 1 m decreases from 1 to 4 the late peak arrives increasingly delayed thus u m 2 decreases from 1 46 10 2 to 8 27 10 3 m s while parameters d m 1 d m 2 k 1 k 2 w im 1 w im 2 do not show continuous variations fig 12b e the variations of these parameters may be caused by parameter equifinality which means that more than one parameter set will reproduce the observations equally well concerning a particular performance measure cobelli distefano 1980 equifinality can be caused by parameters that are insensitive johnston pilgrim 1976 and or interactive ibbitt o donnell 1974 in appendix b we show that the problem of parameter equifinality does exist in the parameter calibration process as m increases from 4 to 5 w m 1 decreases from 0 675 to 0 370 w m 2 increases from 0 206 to 0 423 5 discussion 5 1 representativeness of the experiments for karst tracer tests the purpose of the present subsection is to investigate how representative of field scale configurations the present experiments are the ratio of conduit length to diameter ratio the péclet number and the reynolds number is computed from the model calibrated parameters and given in table 5 the characteristic diameter of the conduit in rectangle shape is calculated as 7 d c 2 h w h w where h is the conduit aperture w 0 005 m is the thickness of the flow channel since we know the model length is l 1 5 m the calculated values of l d c range from 158 to 225 the values of the length to diameter ratio in natural karst aquifers are found to range from 25 to 25 000 according to the summary in wang et al 2020 thus the experimental values are reasonable the péclet number is a measure of the relative importance of advection versus diffusion for a solute transport process the longitudinal dispersion d l l2t 1 can be used instead of diffusion in the calculation of the péclet number 8 p e lu d l we apply the calibrated parameters of the wsade for the calculation of this number the calibrated parameters of u 1 and u 2 are used for this u values of d 1 and d 2 are used for this d l with u 1 and d 1 the calculated pé values for the experiments range from 53 5 to 418 4 with u 2 and d 2 the calculated pé values range from 14 4 to 82 8 d 1 is always much smaller than d 2 fig 9b so the pé calculated by u 1 and d 1 are larger than that by u 2 and d 2 according to the tracing tests carried out in real karst systems the calculated pé values range from 12 to 331 summarized in wang et al 2020 most of the experimental pé values are within the range in the field tests we check the flow regime of the experiments by calculating the reynolds number 9 r e ρ u d h μ 4 ρ u a μ p 4 ρ q μ p where a l2 is the cross section area d h l is the hydraulic diameter of the pipe p l is the wetted perimeter q l3t 1 is the flow rate u lt 1 is the average flow velocity μ ml 1t 1 is the fluid dynamic viscosity and ρ ml 3 is the fluid density again the calibrated wsade parameters of u 1 and u 2 are used for this calculation according to table 5 the reynolds number of the experiments ranges from 1 to 168 while researchers have noted that re varies between 6500 and 80 000 in natural karst aquifers duran et al 2016 morales et al 2010 in summary our experimental models can be representative of the natural karst systems in terms of geometric and kinematic similarities l dc and pé while not in the dynamic similarity re the flow regime of the experiments is laminar re 2000 we are clear that the turbulent flow regime is more generally observed in natural karst conduits in practice it would be difficult to achieve a turbulent flow regime owing to the experimental dimensions and the availability of deionized water note however that lab scale tracing experiments under a laminar flow regime have been shown to provide insights into solute transport processes in natural karst systems wang et al 2020 5 2 effect of flow rate according to the experimental results the flow rate influences the btcs significantly fig 6 the dual peak effect is more obvious under a higher flow rate this result is in agreement with the experimental study by mohammadi et al 2019 under high hydraulic gradients thus large flow rate the tracing tests in the conduit network of branchwork structure generated multi peaked btcs under low hydraulic gradients thus small flow rates the network exhibited single peaked btcs for a given conduit geometry multi peaked btcs may bring us more information about the system investigated by the tracing test firstly dual peaked btc suggests the existence of flow bifurcations secondly they allow an average transport velocity to be identified for each of the two regions thirdly we can estimate the underground conduit length of different channels as proposed by wang et al 2020 5 3 application of experiment results comparing the results of the present study to those of wang et al 2020 allows qualitative deductions to be derived about the geometry of the underground karst structure from dual peaked btcs from tracing tests in karst aquifers first if the two peaks are fully separated from each other the lengths of the two conduits are likely to be significantly different according to fig 7 a length ratio close to unity leads to peak superposition thus we can deduce a large length contrast for the two conduits when the two peaks are fully separated for this kind of dual peaked btc a method has been proposed to estimate the lengths of the conduits wang et al 2020 second if the two peaks overlap each other and the early peak is smaller than the late peak the length ratio may be very small close to unity and the shorter conduit has a smaller aperture than the longer conduit h 1 h 2 this btc is exhibited by configuration 4 6 fig 7a to our best knowledge such behaviors have been very rarely reported if at all in the literature third if the two peaks overlap each other and the early peak is larger than the late peak there are two possible cases the first case is that the length ratio is small and the shorter conduit has a larger aperture than the longer conduit h 1 h 2 the btcs in fig 7b belong to this type the second case is that the conduit is connected to a waterfall or large pool field leij 2012 the above deductions are summarized in table 6 the deductions are qualitative rather than quantitative because karst structures can be highly complex if researchers want to obtain more information about the underground karst geometry further tests may be required 5 4 fitting performance of the numerical models in our application of the wsade model to fitting the experimental btcs we find some wsade model parameters do not bear the physical meaning we have assumed for example when we apply the wsade to fit the btc of 5 5 200 rpm fig 8 table 4 we find that the calibrated values of w 1 and w 2 cannot correctly represent the true tracer quantity repartition in the two conduits because the conceptual structure of the wsade is similar to the experimental model in that the wsade has two regions and the experimental model has two conduits we have expected that the wsade region 1 parameters u 1 d 1 and w 1 should represent the properties of the transport process of the shorter conduit which makes the early peak of the btc and the wsade region 2 parameters u 2 d 2 and w 2 should represent the properties of the transport process of the longer conduit which makes the late peak the calibrated value w 1 0 099 and w 2 1 w 1 0 901 w 1 is nine times smaller than w 2 and according to the experimental btc the early peak is higher than the late peak despite this peak magnitude is not sufficient to indicate the tracer plume quantity the comparison of the two peaks still indicates that the quantity of the early tracer plume cannot be nine times smaller than the late tracer plume thus the values of w 1 and w 2 are unrealistic and cannot correctly represent the true quantity repartition between the two tracer plumes in this fitting the values of d 1 and d 2 are also not realistic the calibrated value of d 2 is around 8 6 times larger than d 1 d 1 6 34 10 5 m2 s d 2 5 47 10 4 m2 s the contrast between the two values is too large the length ratio of the two conduits is around 1 13 and the cross section areas of the two conduits are the same for configuration 5 5 the properties of the two conduits cannot differ by 8 6 times thus parameters d 1 and d 2 cannot correctly represent the dispersion effect of the two conduits for the wsade model fitting the experiment of 5 5 200 rpm some parameters w 1 w 2 d 1 and d 2 of wsade do not represent the physical meanings we have expected according to the characteristic of the experimental btcs and the wsade model we explain the cause of the above problem first according to fig 6 the btcs under 20 rpm and 200 rpm exhibit a significant tailing effect for the falling limb the tailing effect has caused the falling limb to last for a relatively long time scale the tailing effect has been caused by the solute detention effect introduced in section 4 1 3 second the two region wsade consists of two parallel flowing regions governed by the ade model fig 4 it is well acknowledged that the simple ade model cannot well reproduce the btcs with the tailing effect to properly reproduce the falling limb the wsade region 2 is more widespread and has a larger size so the calibrated values of d 2 and w 2 are unrealistically large compared to the two region wsade the drmim catches better the transport process in the dual conduit structures fig 11 the drmim has a better fitting performance because the conceptual structure of the drmim is more similar to the experimental solute transport process in the dual conduit structures experimental studies have proved that solute transport in a single fracture qian et al 2011 or a single conduit anger alexander 2013 field leij 2012 zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 can exhibit some anomalous features like right skewness and tailing the dual conduit structures have two channels thus one experiment can be deemed as the combination of two anomalous transport processes as the ade cannot well characterize anomalous btcs similarly the wsade which includes two ade regions cannot well characterize the experimental btcs in this study however it is known is the mim can well characterize anomalous btcs with right skewness and tailing thus the drmim which includes two mim regions can well characterize the experimental btcs from the dual conduit structures 6 conclusions we studied the solute transport process in dual conduit structures through lab scale experiments by definition h 1 is the aperture of the shorter conduit and h 2 is the aperture of the longer conduit if h 1 h 2 and the contrast between the two apertures is low the dual conduit structures generate dual peaked btcs that exhibit a lower early peak than the late peak if h 1 h 2 and the contrast between h 1 and h 2 is large we obtain a single peaked btcs if h 1 h 2 dual peaked btcs or bump tailed btcs are observed as the flow rate increases it is more likely to observe the separation of the two tracer plumes in a previous experimental study wang et al 2020 we investigated how three factors may influence the transport process in dual conduit structures length ratio total length and connection angle the current study is a complementary work to this previous study revealing the effects of the aperture and flow rate the experimental results should help the hydrologists to better interpret the dual peaked btcs from karst aquifers we provide a guide table 6 on estimating some properties related to the geometry of the dual conduit structure according to the shape of the dual peaked btcs the experimental btcs are fitted by two numerical models the wsade model properly reproduces the bump tailed btcs and some of the dual peaked btcs but it failed to correctly reproduce the dual peaked btc obtained from configuration 4 6 under 200 rpm for the first time the drmim model is applied to characterize the anomalous transport btcs the drmim exhibited better performances than the wsade model and captured all of the symptoms of the btcs the second peak the bump and the tailing credit authorship contribution statement chaoqi wang data curation formal

parameter identifiability we check the parameter identifiability of the drmim model by plotting the parameter histogram and correlation plots from the parameter sets on the mcmc chain correlation plots reveal the interaction between the parameters rana et al 2019 wang et al 2020 histograms allow direct estimation of uncertainty relative standard deviation rsd and identifiability whether the distribution is gaussian the gaussian distribution of the posterior parameter sets is deemed essential to parameter identifiability younes et al 2016 because the gaussian distribution allows us to uniquely identify the parameter estimates from the experimental data the correlation between two data is evaluated by the correlation coefficient r given paired data x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n r is defined as 10 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the sample size x and y are the mean value for x and y respectively the parameter variability or uncertainty is represented by the relative standard deviation rsd value 11 r s d i 1 n x i x 2 n 1 x to better address parameter equifinality it is optimal to investigate as many as possible the parameter sets which can reproduce the experimental data by certain criteria however the common practice of launching mcmc calibration for once may not be enough because in our experience of applying the mcmc for optimization the different initial parameter sets may attribute to different results the starting point influences the path and the endpoint of the automatical searching algorithm different from the common practice we carry out 20 times of mcmc calibrations for this identifiability study to fully address the possible parameter space each mcmc calibration starts with different randomly generated initial parameter sets and contains 18000 iterations the last 400 iterations of the 20 mcmc chains thus 8000 parameter sets in total are used in this identifiability study the results shown in fig 17 suggest that different parameter sets can make the drmim model well reproduce the experimental btc the parameter histograms exhibit scattered distributions the multi solution phenomenon is especially severe for u m 2 and k 2 there exist two separated groups of values marked by the yellow bracket with these different parameter sets the drmim region 1 generates various btcs the purple curves in fig 17 region 2 also generates various btcs the green curves in fig 17 when the simulated btcs of the two regions are summed up the simulated btcs of the drmim model show little variance the red curves in fig 17 and all of the simulated btcs are approximate to the experimental btc due to this equifinality problem the calibrated drmim parameters may fall into a wide possible range this has caused some calibrated drmim parameters to exhibit discontinuous variations with the m value fig 12b e 
2910,a typical karst aquifer configuration is the multiple conduit structure however it remains to be investigated how the aperture distributions and the flow rate should influence the transport process in the multiple conduit structures to better understand the transport process in the multiple conduit structures 11 lab scale dual conduit structures are manufactured by varying the apertures of the two conduits h 1 and h 2 denote the aperture width of the shorter conduit and the longer conduit respectively solute transport experiments of three different flow rates are conducted on these structures as the flow rate increases the dual conduit structures are more likely to present dual peaked btcs the 11 structures make one exhaustive representation of the possible aperture combination of the dual conduit structures and the transport experiments have been conducted by three flow rates varying by 2 degrees of magnitude so the experimental results constitute a detailed material that should improve the understanding of transport processes in such structures two numerical models weighted sum advection dispersion equation wsade and dual region mobile immobile model drmim are applied to fit the experimental btcs in order to obtain some insight into the actual solute transport processes by exploring the calibrated model parameters considering the possible effect of solute detention we initially applied the drmim model this drmim better replicated the experimental btcs than the wsade this study suggests the karst community shall take the drmim as one candidate transport model for characterizing the dual peaked btcs obtained in karst aquifers keywords dual conduit structure flow rate aperture width dual peaked btc data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction artificial tracing is a useful tool for investigating karst aquifers goldscheider et al 2008a injecting a known quantity of tracer at an upstream position and monitoring the variations in the tracer concentration at a downstream location yields a breakthrough curve btc btcs can bring information on underground karst geometry wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 and effective transport parameters goldscheider and drew 2007 laboratory experiments have been widely applied to investigate the flow and transport processes through complex karst aquifers the major advantage of lab scale experiments over field experiments is their flexibility in that they allow for a flexible selection of sampling points easy implementation of different hydraulic conditions as well as detailed knowledge of the geometry of the studied media mohammadi et al 2021 according to mohammadi et al 2021 the common laboratory karst models can be categorized into three groups rock block pipe fracture network and pipe matrix coupling model for the rock block model artificial fractures or conduits can be created on a rock block to make a physical model the rock block model has supported various research works including hydraulic tomography brauchler et al 2003 2013 sharmeen et al 2012 investigation of the flow process anaya et al 2014 cherubini et al 2012 develi babadagli 2015 difrenna et al 2008 leven et al 2004 investigation of solute cherubini et al 2012 and heat transport process cherubini et al 2017 pastore et al 2015 concerning the pipe fracture network model researchers have manufactured single fracture models qian et al 2007 2011 tzelepis et al 2015 fracture networks hull et al 1987 karay hajnal 2015 and conduit networks anger alexander 2013 field leij 2012 wu et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 the experiments on these lab scale models have revealed some fundamental mechanisms controlling the flow and transport process in karst media for example qian et al 2011 found that the solute transport process in a single fracture exhibit btcs with heavy tailing field and leij 2012 found that three karst geometries may exhibit multi peaked btcs an auxiliary conduit is connected to the main conduit waterfall and pools while the effect of matrix is not considered in the pipe fracture network models several studies have focused on the effect of the transport exchange between conduits and matrix to this end they have used pipe matrix coupling models castro 2017 faulkner et al 2009 florea wicks 2001 gallegos et al 2013 li et al 2008 mohammadi et al 2019 xiao et al 2018 for example li et al 2008 have studied contaminant retention processes in the matrix of pipe matrix coupling models mohammadi et al 2019 built bench scale karst models and investigated the influence of hydraulic gradient and cave pattern on tracing test btcs the classical advection dispersion equation ade bear 1988 majdalani et al 2015 model often fails to reproduce the btcs of the tracing tests goldscheider et al 2008b hauns et al 2001 massei et al 2006 moreno tsang 1991 perrin luetscher 2008 the ade is valid for the btcs obtained in homogeneous porous media under some conditions berkowitz et al 2006 however all aquifers are heterogeneous to different degrees bakalowicz 2005 ghodrati jury 1992 levy berkowitz 2003 and among them fractured and karst aquifers are particularly heterogeneous bakalowicz 2005 heterogeneous media entail anomalous or non fickian transport behaviors which may exhibit btcs with early arrivals and late time tails or multi peaked btcs these particularities cannot be well represented by the ade model a variety of models accounting for anomalous transport have been developed mobile immobile model mim van genuchten wierenga 1976 and transient storage model tsm runkel 1998 have a similar structure one mobile region the main channel governed by ade and one immobile stagnant region the two regions exchange mass due to concentration difference the tsm has been applied to reproduce btcs from solute transport experiments in lab scale karst models dewaide et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 2021 the multi region ade model majdalani et al 2015 2018 consists of two or more ade regions flowing in parallel and these regions exchange mass due to concentration differences these multi region ade models were successfully used to model lab scale solute transport experiments field leij 2012 majdalani et al 2015 2018 wang et al 2020 the so called weighted sum ade wsade model field leij 2012 also considers several parallel ade regions while the mass exchange between the regions is not considered dual peaked btcs can be reproduced by the two region ade model wang et al 2020 or the wsade model field leij 2012 the tracing btcs can be influenced by different properties of karst aquifers via numerical simulation of solute transport process in a conceptual karst model of dual flow system i e conduit and matrix peely et al 2021 have studied the effect of six properties on the btcs including i tracing distance and karst tortuosity ii hydraulic gradient iii matrix hydraulic conductivity iv exchange flow v conduit diameter and vi conduit roughness height for example increasing tracing distance causes the peak concentration c p to decrease and the peak time t p to become longer increasing tortuosity also causes c p to decrease and t p to lengthen for another example increasing the exchange coefficient the degree of hydraulic connection between the conduit and the host matrix causes c p to increase and t p to shorten the diameter variation of a single conduit may cause btcs with strong tailing hauns et al 2001 zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 the different karst network patterns should influence the btcs shape mohammadi et al 2019 and multi peaked btcs are frequently observed in karst aquifers in a previous study wang et al 2020 we carried out solute transport experiments on different dual conduit karst configurations and investigated how the dual peaked btcs can be influenced by some properties of the dual conduit structure specifically increasing the length ratio causes the two peaks to be more separated increasing the total length causes the two peaks to be more separated and the concentration value of both peaks to be lower the connection angles between the divergence conduits and the convergence conduit also influence the btcs however the study presented by wang et al 2020 has two main limitations first we assumed an ideal situation for all the structures the two conduits have the same diameter since the objective of wang et al 2020 is to study the effect of length and connection angle of the conduits this ideal situation does not harm the previous experimental conclusions according to the field observations the different conduits usually bear different diameters it is unclear how the different conduit diameter combinations may influence the transport process thus it is important to study the structures that have different conduit diameter combinations in order to better understand the transport process in such dual conduit structures second the previous transport experiments have been conducted under a constant flow rate while in natural karst aquifers flow rate is not constant it is also unclear how the flow rate may influence the transport process the objective of this paper is to answer two research questions that arose from the one dimensional experiments reported in wang et al 2020 namely the influence of conduits aperture and flow rate on the transport process in dual conduit structures 11 bench scale physical configurations with different aperture combinations are built solute transport experiments are conducted under three different flow rates then two transport models are applied in this study the weighted sum advection dispersion equation wsade model and the dual region mobile immobile model drmim we use both models to fit the observed btcs and check how the different transport processes may influence the calibrated model parameters along with wang et al 2020 the purpose of the present paper is to enrich and complement the available experimental and modeling material on the transport process in dual conduit structures 2 experimental setup 2 1 dual conduit structures the dual conduit experimental models are made of transparent pvc boards assembled in three layers the top and bottom layers fig 1 a c are the same a single pvc board 150 25 2 cm the middle layer fig 1a c includes five boards of various sizes with a thickness of 0 5 cm the three layers are assembled fig 1d with transparent silicone the void in the middle layer serves as the space for fluid flow in this physical model we make 11 different physical configurations by varying the position of the central board marked by the red dot in fig 1b in the middle layer the apertures of the main and parallel conduits are denoted respectively by h 1 and h 2 fig 2 h 1 and h 2 are varied by 1 cm increments such that h 1 h 2 10 cm for all configurations table 1 leaving the total void volume v m 675 cm3 unchanged the various geometric configurations are labeled in the form h 1 h 2 e g configuration 4 6 stands for h 1 4 cm and h 2 6 cm for the central board in the middle layer the spacing from the longitudinal axis is denoted as m m h 2 5 cm 5 cm h 1 the 11 configurations are divided into two groups group 1 includes configurations 1 6 the shorter conduit has a smaller aperture than the longer conduit h 1 h 2 group 2 includes configurations 7 11 the shorter conduit has a larger aperture h 1 h 2 with these configurations we focus on the effect of conduit apertures while the other properties of the dual conduit structures remain constant first the lengths of the dual conduits are constant for these configurations 105 cm for the shorter conduit and 125 cm for the longer conduit second the connection angle combinations θ 1 θ 2 of the 11 configurations are considered to be the same θ 1 0 and θ 2 90 fig 2 we have applied a rather large scale for this experimental model 150 15 0 5 cm aiming at reducing the error in the model geometry which can be inevitable to a certain degree in the manufacturing process the error in the aperture of the conduits may cause especially detrimental damage to the experimental results because the flow resistance of a single conduit is highly sensitive to the aperture barnard et al 1966 to reduce the effect caused by the possible aperture error we apply as large a scale as possible for the experimental model on a large scale the influence caused by the aperture error would be relatively minor 2 2 step tracing experiments the experimental setup of solute tracing experiments is shown in fig 3 the physical model is placed on a horizontal platform to eliminate density effects the physical model is first filled with deionized water the inlet is connected to a solution tank deionized water nacl concentration c 0 0 06 mol l a peristaltic pump lead fluidtm supplies the flow rate q l s at the outlet a sensor wtw tetracon 325tm conductimeter resolution 10 6 mol l is used to measure the tracer concentration and infer the btc the outflowing water falls into a glass placed on a weighing machine mettler toledotm that allows the flow rate to be monitored the sensor and weighing machine are connected to a data logger campbell cr1000tm for automatic data sampling a step tracing test is conducted under a constant flow rate until the concentration at the outlet reaches c 0 to reduce measurement error each experiment is replicated three times the final data is obtained as the average of the three experimental btcs denoted as c t three different flow rates spanning two orders of magnitudes are used for the three flow rates the different data sampling intervals and total experimental time are shown in table 2 3 numerical modeling 3 1 transport models a weighted sum advection dispersion equation wsade model with two regions we consider applying the two region wsade model table 3 because the physical structures have two flow conduits the definition sketch of the two region wsade is shown in fig 4 two regions are assumed to flow in parallel without any exchange in both regions the ade model is assumed valid 1a c i t u i c i x d i 2 c i x 2 0 i 1 2 1b w 1 w 2 1

w 2 is a free parameter the parameter set u 1 u 2 d 1 d 2 w 1 is calibrated to fit the experimental btcs to reduce the size of the parameter space regions 1 and 2 are distinguished by imposing u 1 u 2 by definition b dual region mobile immobile drmim model the drmim model is based on the mobile immobile mim model van genuchten wierenga 1976 the mim consists of a mobile region governed by the conventional ade and an immobile region the two regions are coupled by an exchange term for the drmim model the total concentration at the outlet is the superposition of two regions of mim fig 5 the governing equations of the drmim model are 3a w m i c m i t w i m i c i m i t w m i d m i 2 c m i x 2 w m i u m i c m i x i 1 2 3b w i m i c i m i t k i c m i c i m i i 1 2 3c w i m i w m i w m i m i

mobile regions w im 1 and w im 2 are the volume fractions of the immobile regions w mim 1 and w mim 2 are the volumetric fractions of the two mim regions the total concentration at the outlet is obtained from a flux balance over the two mobile regions 4 c w m 1 u m 1 c m 1 w m 2 u m 2 c m 2 w m 1 u m 1 w m 2 u m 2 owing to equations 3c d the four fractions w m 1 w m 2 w im 1 w im 2 have three

m 2 the drmim model has more parameters and thus more flexibility than the wsade model then the drmim should be expected to better reproduce some btcs than the wsade 3 2 parameter calibration technique the model parameters are calibrated with the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method haario et al 2006 the mcmc method is a bayesian approach that evaluates the posterior distributions of parameters vrugt et al 2006 to achieve a fast convergence of the chain we first perform a manual fitting of the model response to the experimental btcs to find the initial parameter set then the metropolis hastings algorithm robert 2015 successively draws samples from the posterior distribution by forming a markov chain of the model parameter set in this work we assume the posterior probability density is of a gaussian type for each chain 10 000 iterations are executed the mean value of the last 50 sampled parameter sets is determined as the calibrated parameter value the root mean square error rmse objective function is applied to evaluate the deviation and the convergence of the mcmc chains 5 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n where x is the experimental data n is the data quantity y is the simulated data 4 results 4 1 experiment results some treatments are conducted to the concentration variations of the step tracing experiments c t first the derivative of c t to t denoted as c der t is calculated and used for the exhibition of the experiment results and model benchmarking if the injection signal is a concentration step using c der t is equivalent to performing a tracing experiment using a dirac pulse input signal majdalani et al 2015 which is more approximate to the common practice in natural aquifers second the c der t curves are normalized with pore volume 6a p v t tq v m 6b c n t c d e r t 0 c d e r t d p v t where c n is the normalized concentration pv is the injected pore volume fraction v m 675 cm3 is the volume of the physical model l3 all of the experimental btcs are exhibited in the form of c n pv because this transformation makes it convenient for us to compare the experiment btcs of different flow rates after the normalization the area below the curve of c n pv is 1 unitless 4 1 1 effect of flow rate fig 6 shows the experimental c n pv curves for the three flow rates the 11 configurations are divided into two groups for plotting for group 1 h 1 h 2 fig 6a for group 2 h 1 h 2 fig 6b for the lowest flow rate of 6 69 10 5 l s 2 rpm the curves are right skewed and the curves of 2 rpm have the lowest peak value when compared to the other two flow rates the curves of the middle flow rate 6 84 10 4 l s 20 rpm have the largest peak value and sharpest peak all of these curves of the middle flow rate are still single peaked while there is a bump on the falling limb of the 8 2 curve which indicates the existence of two separate tracer plumes the curves of the highest flow rate 6 62 10 3 l s 200 rpm have a medium peak value under this flow rate there are three types of curves 1 some curves show obvious dual peaks 5 5 4 6 9 1 2 other curves have one peak while there is an obvious bump on the falling limb 6 4 7 3 8 2 these btcs are similar to the dual peaked btcs but the two peaks are so close that they superpose 3 some configurations exhibit curves with only one peak 3 7 2 8 1 9 0 10 10 0 when compared to lowest and middle flow rates more curves of the highest flow rate exhibit dual peaked curves 4 1 2 effect of aperture the effect of aperture variation is analyzed using the curves of the highest flow rate because this is the flow rate for which the contrast between the btcs is the most pronounced the 11 btcs are divided into two groups for plotting for group 1 h 1 h 2 fig 7 a for group 2 h 1 h 2 fig 7b in fig 7a configurations 5 5 and 4 6 yield btcs with two peaks which indicates a significant difference between the travel times in the main and diverging conduit for 5 5 the early peak is larger than the later peak the btc for configuration 4 6 is rather unusual in that the early peak is slightly smaller than the late peak while dual peaked btcs are known to mostly exhibit a larger early peak than the late peak field leij 2012 florea wicks 2001 mohammadi et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the remaining configurations 3 7 2 8 1 9 0 10 exhibit single peaked btcs those btcs are similar in fig 7b the btcs of configurations 6 4 7 3 and 8 2 exhibit a single peak but a bump is visible within the falling limb these btcs appear as intermediate between the dual peaked and single peaked btcs as the configuration changes from 5 to 5 to 8 2 the btcs peak the early plume occurs increasingly earlier as the configuration changes from 8 to 2 to 10 0 the btcs peak occurs increasingly later as the configuration changes from 6 to 4 to 10 0 the late plume bump or the second peak occurs increasingly delayed among all of the configurations the btcs obtained by 5 5 and 4 6 exhibit lower peak values than the other configurations the falling limbs of these two btcs are also more delayed than the others hauns et al 2001 showed that different karst geometry may cause different steamline distributions thus different degrees of solute detention effects the solute transport processes in the experiments should also be different due to the different structure of the configurations there may be a stronger detention effect for the transport processes in configurations 5 5 and 4 6 which has caused these two btcs to be more delayed comparing group 1 to group 2 we find that configurations 4 6 and 6 4 exhibit very different btcs for 4 6 the early peak is smaller than the late peak for 6 4 there is a bump on the falling limb similarly configuration 3 7 exhibits different results from 7 to 3 etc the difference between the two groups suggests that both conduit lengths and apertures influence the transport process in this study the double peaks overlap to a large extent 5 5 4 6 in contrast with dual peaked btcs reported by field leij 2012 wang et al 2020 the present experiments exhibit only a slight separation between the two peaks this can be explained by a small contrast between the lengths of the conduits length ratio 125 105 1 19 for our dual conduit structures as discussed in wang et al 2020 the closer the length ratio to unity the closer the two peaks are 4 2 modeling results in this section we present the modeling results to the btcs of the highest flow rate 6 62 10 3 l s 200 rpm and investigate how the aperture setup may influence the model parameters the modeling results of the 2 rpm curves and the 20 rpm curves can be found in appendix a 4 2 1 wsade the wsade model can reproduce most of the btcs fig 8 the rmse values range between 2 59 10 4 and 6 36 10 4 m2 s table 4 for configuration 5 5 the dual peaked btc is well reproduced rmse 4 87 10 4 region 1 accounts for the first peak of the btc and region 2 accounts for the second one for configuration 4 6 wsade exhibits a degraded fitting performance rmse 5 69 10 4 and the wsade model fails to reproduce the double peak behavior for configurations 3 7 2 8 1 9 0 10 and 10 0 the wsade well reproduces the single peaked btcs rmse ranges between 2 59 10 4 and 3 96 10 4 for configurations 6 4 7 3 and 8 2 the fitting performances are also good rmse ranges between 2 81 10 4 and 6 36 10 4 region 1 accounts for the first peak and region 2 accounts for the bump on the falling limb for configuration 9 1 the fitting performance is degraded as the second peak is not well reproduced rmse 4 70 10 4 we examine the calibrated wsade parameters for the configurations with m 1 cm the velocity u 1 is larger than u 2 the dispersion d 1 is smaller than d 2 and the volume fraction w 1 is larger than 0 5 configuration 4 6 m 1 cm presents the smallest u 1 and the smallest u 2 among all configurations the small values of u 1 and u 2 indicate that t peak1 and t peak2 the peak time of wsade region 1 and region 2 respectively are larger than the other configurations configuration 4 6 presents the largest d 1 4 13 10 4 m2 s and the largest w 1 0 793 this is because the wsade region 1 covers most of the btc while region 2 covers only a small part of the tail for 4 6 fig 8 from configurations 3 7 to 0 10 m 2 to 5 cm u 1 ranges between 1 61 10 2 and 1 69 10 2 m s u 2 ranges between 1 28 10 2 and 1 36 10 2 m s d 1 ranges between 1 45 10 4 and 2 00 10 4 d 2 ranges between 6 34 10 4 to 8 94 10 4 m2 s w 1 shows decreasing trend on the whole it decreases from 0 609 to 0 527 then we introduce the calibrated wsade parameters for the configurations with negative m from configuration 5 5 to 8 2 m 0 1 2 3 u 1 increases from 1 77 10 2 to 1 85 10 2 from 8 to 2 to 10 0 m 3 4 5 u 1 decreases to 1 70 10 2 from 5 to 5 to 6 4 u 2 increases from 1 38 10 2 to 1 54 10 2 then from 6 to 4 to 9 1 u 2 decreases from 1 54 10 2 to 1 17 10 2 the values u 1 and u 2 reflect the variations in the arrival times of the peaks in fig 7b from 5 to 5 to 9 1 m 0 4 d 1 increases from 6 34 10 5 to 2 04 10 4 and d 2 increases from 5 47 10 4 to 1 22 10 3 w 1 the volume fraction of the faster region increases from 0 099 to 0 597 d 2 is larger than d 1 for all flow configurations larger d 2 values are needed so that wsade region 2 can generate a wider peak to reproduce the later tail of the experimental btcs further explanations are provided in section 5 3 4 2 2 drmim the drmim can well reproduce all btcs fig 10 capturing all of the features of the btcs the peaks the bumps and the tails visually the drmim exhibits better characterization for the dual peaked curves 5 5 4 6 9 1 and the bump tail curves 6 4 7 3 8 2 than the wsade fig 8 we calculate the rmse values of the two models fitting results in fig 8 and fig 10 quantitatively the rmse values of the drmim are much lower than the wsade fig 11 the calibrated drmim parameters are presented in table 4 and shown in fig 12 as shown in fig 12a u m 1 value has exhibited a relatively smaller variance than u m 2 for the single peaked btcs m 2 3 4 5 5 cm the contrasts between u m 1 and u m 2 are relatively smaller for the dual peaked btcs m 0 1 4 cm or the bump tailed btcs m 1 2 3 cm the contrasts between u m 1 and u m 2 are relatively larger as the configuration changes from 5 to 5 to 8 2 m decreases from 0 to 3 the early peak arrives increasingly earlier thus u m 1 increases from 1 74 10 2 to 1 83 10 2 m s from 8 to 2 to 10 0 m decreases from 3 to 5 the early peak arrives increasingly delayed thus u m 1 decreases from 1 83 10 2 to 1 70 10 2 m s as the configuration changes from 6 to 4 to 9 1 m decreases from 1 to 4 the late peak arrives increasingly delayed thus u m 2 decreases from 1 46 10 2 to 8 27 10 3 m s while parameters d m 1 d m 2 k 1 k 2 w im 1 w im 2 do not show continuous variations fig 12b e the variations of these parameters may be caused by parameter equifinality which means that more than one parameter set will reproduce the observations equally well concerning a particular performance measure cobelli distefano 1980 equifinality can be caused by parameters that are insensitive johnston pilgrim 1976 and or interactive ibbitt o donnell 1974 in appendix b we show that the problem of parameter equifinality does exist in the parameter calibration process as m increases from 4 to 5 w m 1 decreases from 0 675 to 0 370 w m 2 increases from 0 206 to 0 423 5 discussion 5 1 representativeness of the experiments for karst tracer tests the purpose of the present subsection is to investigate how representative of field scale configurations the present experiments are the ratio of conduit length to diameter ratio the péclet number and the reynolds number is computed from the model calibrated parameters and given in table 5 the characteristic diameter of the conduit in rectangle shape is calculated as 7 d c 2 h w h w where h is the conduit aperture w 0 005 m is the thickness of the flow channel since we know the model length is l 1 5 m the calculated values of l d c range from 158 to 225 the values of the length to diameter ratio in natural karst aquifers are found to range from 25 to 25 000 according to the summary in wang et al 2020 thus the experimental values are reasonable the péclet number is a measure of the relative importance of advection versus diffusion for a solute transport process the longitudinal dispersion d l l2t 1 can be used instead of diffusion in the calculation of the péclet number 8 p e lu d l we apply the calibrated parameters of the wsade for the calculation of this number the calibrated parameters of u 1 and u 2 are used for this u values of d 1 and d 2 are used for this d l with u 1 and d 1 the calculated pé values for the experiments range from 53 5 to 418 4 with u 2 and d 2 the calculated pé values range from 14 4 to 82 8 d 1 is always much smaller than d 2 fig 9b so the pé calculated by u 1 and d 1 are larger than that by u 2 and d 2 according to the tracing tests carried out in real karst systems the calculated pé values range from 12 to 331 summarized in wang et al 2020 most of the experimental pé values are within the range in the field tests we check the flow regime of the experiments by calculating the reynolds number 9 r e ρ u d h μ 4 ρ u a μ p 4 ρ q μ p where a l2 is the cross section area d h l is the hydraulic diameter of the pipe p l is the wetted perimeter q l3t 1 is the flow rate u lt 1 is the average flow velocity μ ml 1t 1 is the fluid dynamic viscosity and ρ ml 3 is the fluid density again the calibrated wsade parameters of u 1 and u 2 are used for this calculation according to table 5 the reynolds number of the experiments ranges from 1 to 168 while researchers have noted that re varies between 6500 and 80 000 in natural karst aquifers duran et al 2016 morales et al 2010 in summary our experimental models can be representative of the natural karst systems in terms of geometric and kinematic similarities l dc and pé while not in the dynamic similarity re the flow regime of the experiments is laminar re 2000 we are clear that the turbulent flow regime is more generally observed in natural karst conduits in practice it would be difficult to achieve a turbulent flow regime owing to the experimental dimensions and the availability of deionized water note however that lab scale tracing experiments under a laminar flow regime have been shown to provide insights into solute transport processes in natural karst systems wang et al 2020 5 2 effect of flow rate according to the experimental results the flow rate influences the btcs significantly fig 6 the dual peak effect is more obvious under a higher flow rate this result is in agreement with the experimental study by mohammadi et al 2019 under high hydraulic gradients thus large flow rate the tracing tests in the conduit network of branchwork structure generated multi peaked btcs under low hydraulic gradients thus small flow rates the network exhibited single peaked btcs for a given conduit geometry multi peaked btcs may bring us more information about the system investigated by the tracing test firstly dual peaked btc suggests the existence of flow bifurcations secondly they allow an average transport velocity to be identified for each of the two regions thirdly we can estimate the underground conduit length of different channels as proposed by wang et al 2020 5 3 application of experiment results comparing the results of the present study to those of wang et al 2020 allows qualitative deductions to be derived about the geometry of the underground karst structure from dual peaked btcs from tracing tests in karst aquifers first if the two peaks are fully separated from each other the lengths of the two conduits are likely to be significantly different according to fig 7 a length ratio close to unity leads to peak superposition thus we can deduce a large length contrast for the two conduits when the two peaks are fully separated for this kind of dual peaked btc a method has been proposed to estimate the lengths of the conduits wang et al 2020 second if the two peaks overlap each other and the early peak is smaller than the late peak the length ratio may be very small close to unity and the shorter conduit has a smaller aperture than the longer conduit h 1 h 2 this btc is exhibited by configuration 4 6 fig 7a to our best knowledge such behaviors have been very rarely reported if at all in the literature third if the two peaks overlap each other and the early peak is larger than the late peak there are two possible cases the first case is that the length ratio is small and the shorter conduit has a larger aperture than the longer conduit h 1 h 2 the btcs in fig 7b belong to this type the second case is that the conduit is connected to a waterfall or large pool field leij 2012 the above deductions are summarized in table 6 the deductions are qualitative rather than quantitative because karst structures can be highly complex if researchers want to obtain more information about the underground karst geometry further tests may be required 5 4 fitting performance of the numerical models in our application of the wsade model to fitting the experimental btcs we find some wsade model parameters do not bear the physical meaning we have assumed for example when we apply the wsade to fit the btc of 5 5 200 rpm fig 8 table 4 we find that the calibrated values of w 1 and w 2 cannot correctly represent the true tracer quantity repartition in the two conduits because the conceptual structure of the wsade is similar to the experimental model in that the wsade has two regions and the experimental model has two conduits we have expected that the wsade region 1 parameters u 1 d 1 and w 1 should represent the properties of the transport process of the shorter conduit which makes the early peak of the btc and the wsade region 2 parameters u 2 d 2 and w 2 should represent the properties of the transport process of the longer conduit which makes the late peak the calibrated value w 1 0 099 and w 2 1 w 1 0 901 w 1 is nine times smaller than w 2 and according to the experimental btc the early peak is higher than the late peak despite this peak magnitude is not sufficient to indicate the tracer plume quantity the comparison of the two peaks still indicates that the quantity of the early tracer plume cannot be nine times smaller than the late tracer plume thus the values of w 1 and w 2 are unrealistic and cannot correctly represent the true quantity repartition between the two tracer plumes in this fitting the values of d 1 and d 2 are also not realistic the calibrated value of d 2 is around 8 6 times larger than d 1 d 1 6 34 10 5 m2 s d 2 5 47 10 4 m2 s the contrast between the two values is too large the length ratio of the two conduits is around 1 13 and the cross section areas of the two conduits are the same for configuration 5 5 the properties of the two conduits cannot differ by 8 6 times thus parameters d 1 and d 2 cannot correctly represent the dispersion effect of the two conduits for the wsade model fitting the experiment of 5 5 200 rpm some parameters w 1 w 2 d 1 and d 2 of wsade do not represent the physical meanings we have expected according to the characteristic of the experimental btcs and the wsade model we explain the cause of the above problem first according to fig 6 the btcs under 20 rpm and 200 rpm exhibit a significant tailing effect for the falling limb the tailing effect has caused the falling limb to last for a relatively long time scale the tailing effect has been caused by the solute detention effect introduced in section 4 1 3 second the two region wsade consists of two parallel flowing regions governed by the ade model fig 4 it is well acknowledged that the simple ade model cannot well reproduce the btcs with the tailing effect to properly reproduce the falling limb the wsade region 2 is more widespread and has a larger size so the calibrated values of d 2 and w 2 are unrealistically large compared to the two region wsade the drmim catches better the transport process in the dual conduit structures fig 11 the drmim has a better fitting performance because the conceptual structure of the drmim is more similar to the experimental solute transport process in the dual conduit structures experimental studies have proved that solute transport in a single fracture qian et al 2011 or a single conduit anger alexander 2013 field leij 2012 zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 can exhibit some anomalous features like right skewness and tailing the dual conduit structures have two channels thus one experiment can be deemed as the combination of two anomalous transport processes as the ade cannot well characterize anomalous btcs similarly the wsade which includes two ade regions cannot well characterize the experimental btcs in this study however it is known is the mim can well characterize anomalous btcs with right skewness and tailing thus the drmim which includes two mim regions can well characterize the experimental btcs from the dual conduit structures 6 conclusions we studied the solute transport process in dual conduit structures through lab scale experiments by definition h 1 is the aperture of the shorter conduit and h 2 is the aperture of the longer conduit if h 1 h 2 and the contrast between the two apertures is low the dual conduit structures generate dual peaked btcs that exhibit a lower early peak than the late peak if h 1 h 2 and the contrast between h 1 and h 2 is large we obtain a single peaked btcs if h 1 h 2 dual peaked btcs or bump tailed btcs are observed as the flow rate increases it is more likely to observe the separation of the two tracer plumes in a previous experimental study wang et al 2020 we investigated how three factors may influence the transport process in dual conduit structures length ratio total length and connection angle the current study is a complementary work to this previous study revealing the effects of the aperture and flow rate the experimental results should help the hydrologists to better interpret the dual peaked btcs from karst aquifers we provide a guide table 6 on estimating some properties related to the geometry of the dual conduit structure according to the shape of the dual peaked btcs the experimental btcs are fitted by two numerical models the wsade model properly reproduces the bump tailed btcs and some of the dual peaked btcs but it failed to correctly reproduce the dual peaked btc obtained from configuration 4 6 under 200 rpm for the first time the drmim model is applied to characterize the anomalous transport btcs the drmim exhibited better performances than the wsade model and captured all of the symptoms of the btcs the second peak the bump and the tailing credit authorship contribution statement chaoqi wang data curation formal

parameter identifiability we check the parameter identifiability of the drmim model by plotting the parameter histogram and correlation plots from the parameter sets on the mcmc chain correlation plots reveal the interaction between the parameters rana et al 2019 wang et al 2020 histograms allow direct estimation of uncertainty relative standard deviation rsd and identifiability whether the distribution is gaussian the gaussian distribution of the posterior parameter sets is deemed essential to parameter identifiability younes et al 2016 because the gaussian distribution allows us to uniquely identify the parameter estimates from the experimental data the correlation between two data is evaluated by the correlation coefficient r given paired data x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n r is defined as 10 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the sample size x and y are the mean value for x and y respectively the parameter variability or uncertainty is represented by the relative standard deviation rsd value 11 r s d i 1 n x i x 2 n 1 x to better address parameter equifinality it is optimal to investigate as many as possible the parameter sets which can reproduce the experimental data by certain criteria however the common practice of launching mcmc calibration for once may not be enough because in our experience of applying the mcmc for optimization the different initial parameter sets may attribute to different results the starting point influences the path and the endpoint of the automatical searching algorithm different from the common practice we carry out 20 times of mcmc calibrations for this identifiability study to fully address the possible parameter space each mcmc calibration starts with different randomly generated initial parameter sets and contains 18000 iterations the last 400 iterations of the 20 mcmc chains thus 8000 parameter sets in total are used in this identifiability study the results shown in fig 17 suggest that different parameter sets can make the drmim model well reproduce the experimental btc the parameter histograms exhibit scattered distributions the multi solution phenomenon is especially severe for u m 2 and k 2 there exist two separated groups of values marked by the yellow bracket with these different parameter sets the drmim region 1 generates various btcs the purple curves in fig 17 region 2 also generates various btcs the green curves in fig 17 when the simulated btcs of the two regions are summed up the simulated btcs of the drmim model show little variance the red curves in fig 17 and all of the simulated btcs are approximate to the experimental btc due to this equifinality problem the calibrated drmim parameters may fall into a wide possible range this has caused some calibrated drmim parameters to exhibit discontinuous variations with the m value fig 12b e 
2911,large animal operations in the united states us have expanded in recent decades as a solution for meeting increasing food demand these operations can release large amounts of organic matter and nutrients into the environment potentially impacting water quality conditions of nearby waterbodies often referred to as animal feeding operations afos or cafos concentrated afos based on nomenclature in federal regulations these operations are usually clustered in space which may intensify the impacts observed however the influence of the known spatial aggregation of cafos on water quality conditions has not been evaluated this study investigates the spatial organization of cafos and its relationship to water quality conditions we hypothesized that watersheds with clustered cafos are likely to be associated with higher concentrations of total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn in the us we gathered and digitized cafo locations in 16 us states and used tp and tn concentration data to evaluate our hypothesis we calculated the flow weighted mean concentration of tn and tp from 2005 to 2014 and averaged those values per season we used the nearest neighbor index nni to determine the spatial pattern i e clustering or dispersed of cafos per watershed and its significance level additionally for states with animal number information per farm we performed a local moran s i analysis to understand if the clustering of cafos with a low or high number of animals relates to the tp and tn concentrations of each nearest water quality station overall we found that watersheds with significant clustering patterns were associated with higher tp and tn levels seasonally this finding also held principally during spring and summer seasons when manure tends to be land applied our local moran s i analysis also revealed that the clustering of smaller and medium sized farms usually less regulated is associated with elevated tp and tn concentrations this reveals that the small yet potentially unregulated farms could be highly impactful to the environment which warrants further study given the lack of information on the influence of cafo clustering and other pollutant source clustering on water quality and that most states do not regulate emitters based on this aspect our outcomes advance the knowledge of how these entities may be driving changes to the environment this

in the united states us began shifting from smaller distributed farms to larger facilities to increase the efficiency of production mallin and cahoon 2003 key et al 2017 walljasper 2018 these large and often confined facilities called animal feeding operations afos in the code of federal regulations currently represent a majority of the livestock production in the us an animal operation is defined as an afo if it confines and feeds animals for 45 days or more and does not sustain crop growth on a regular basis an afo is regulated as a cafo concentrated afo if it also meets a threshold number of animals that varies by animal type actively discharges to waters of the us wotus or is deemed so by the regulating body usepa 2004 these operations yield over 130 million tons of manure annually burkholder et al 2007 and tend to periodically apply this manure to surrounding fields as a means of waste disposal long et al 2018 although manure is composed of important nutrients such as phosphorus p and nitrogen n usepa 2004 it may also contain heavy metals pathogens antibiotics and other harmful substances that in excess may pose a risk to soil air and water quality mallin and cahoon 2003 barrett 2005 burkholder et al 2007 harun and ogneva himmelberger 2013 ebner 2017 a study recently found that significant land use change and environmental degradation occur within the typical radius of manure application near these facilities miralha et al 2021b in addition to standard operational activities accidental discharges such as cafo lagoon breaks mallin and cahoon 2003 as well as leaching and runoff of contaminants from manure applied fields into nearby water bodies sousan et al 2021 can lead to severe ecological degradation as cafos tend to cluster in space for production and logistical purposes their associated environmental impacts may also intensify clustering has become the cornerstone of efficiency and economic success in industrialized production and development porter 1998 ayres and ayres 2002 deutz and gibbs 2008 although it is argued that industrial clusters may provide environmental benefits lifset and graedel 2002 few studies in industrial ecology have investigated the relationship between the clustering of point sources and the impact on the surrounding environment kennedy 1999 lall and mengistae 2005 anh et al 2011 yoon and nadvi 2018 spatially concentrated production can potentially generate negative environmental outcomes regardless of the specific industry like many other industries cafos tend to cluster in space for economic reasons which may lead to similar drawbacks the clustering of animal agriculture may lead to cumulative adverse environmental effects because individual production facilities add animals over time whether or not they own sufficient cropland to handle the additional manure produced thurow and thompson 1998 however studies have not explored the spatial clustering of cafos and its relationship with the conditions of the surrounding environment daniels 1997 determined that for cluster zoning to be an effective method of land protection planners must delineate reasonable densities for development such that the carrying capacity of the local environment is not exceeded especially in a watershed excessive density inappropriate locations a combination of these two or unreasonable expectations about what cluster development can do are the major potential clustering misuses of a given operation daniels 1997 porter 1998 these issues may exacerbate with the expansion of cafos both in the us and worldwide principally when it comes to socio environmental impacts while watersheds with high concentrations of cafos are potentially at higher risk of degradation than others martin et al 2018 brown et al 2020 studies have yet to investigate if the spatial organization of cafos is a characteristic of higher negative environmental outcomes specifically this spatial clustering pattern has yet to be investigated in water quality studies that account for agricultural sources of pollution eutrophication driven by excess nutrients is a common result of water quality deterioration so monitoring and controlling nutrient inputs is fundamental to water resource conservation usepa 1996 cafos are major sources of nutrient pollution however their manure is typically considered a non point source of pollution when applied to nearby fields copeland 2010 rosov et al 2020 studies have previously explored the impact of cafos on water quality for instance concentrations of nitrate ammonium total nitrogen tn and other ions were higher in cafo impacted streams than in control streams where cafos were not present harden 2015 additionally overaccumulation of total phosphorus tp by manure application has increased export into surface and subsurface water bodies impacting the aquatic ecosystem withers and jarvie 2008 for instance the neuse river watershed in north carolina received approximately 41 000 metric tons of n and 16 000 metric tons of p from cafo waste alone in the 2000s glasgow and burkholder 2000 these additions of large amounts of nutrients often introduce the potential for eutrophic hypoxic conditions to surface water bodies muenich et al 2016 tullo et al 2019 miralha et al 2021a raff and meyer 2021 an impact that must be prevented and monitored to avoid severe ecological damages assessing the spatial organization of cafos and its links to water quality conditions could improve our understanding of managing and regulating these and other facilities to prevent future environmental impacts the amount of manure produced and applied in the vicinity of clustered cafos may exceed the assimilative capacity of the land to a greater extent than in systems with spatially dispersed cafos additionally the number of animals these aggregated operations hold may influence the degree of pollution in nearby waterbodies due to the amounts of manure produced and hauled hence we hypothesize that cafo clustered watersheds are likely to present higher concentrations of tp and tn than cafo dispersed basins we tested this hypothesis by examining the relationship between the spatial pattern i e clustering or dispersion of cafos in 16 states across the us and the tp and tn flow weighted mean concentrations per watershed in these states to distinguish the impact of clustering from the number of cafos present in a watershed we also investigated the linear relationship between tn and tp concentrations the number of cafos per watershed and each watershed s cafo spatial pattern we gathered the states that provided animal number information per cafo and evaluated the relationship between the spatial cluster of the number of animals per cafo and tp and tn concentrations this study brings a comprehensive evaluation of the relationship between the spatial organization of cafos and water quality provides the basis for further management of livestock production and calls for spatially explicit strategies to prevent environmental impacts associated with intensified animal agriculture and other pollution sources in the us 2 methodology 2 1 cafo locations database any afo that discharges manure or wastewater into a natural or man made ditch stream or jurisdictional waterway is defined as a cafo regardless of size copeland 2010 these operations are regulated by the environmental protection agency epa under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes and thus subjected to specific regulations defined in the clean water act usepa 2003 2018 the 2003 cafo rule stated that cafos had the duty to apply for npdes permits requiring information about the facility s location and a nutrient management plan however the 2008 revision of this rule established that a cafo operator no longer has the duty to apply for the permit if it was determined that the facility has no potential to discharge manure litter or process wastewater to waters of the us wotus rosov et al 2020 this revision complicates our ability to identify where these large animal farms are and where they are potentially land applying manure because we lack the data from the npdes permits themselves the current implementation status of the 2008 rule is summarized each year by the epa us epa 2020a some states choose to regulate all federally defined cafos through npdes some may choose only to regulate those actively discharging to wotus through npdes and some may choose to regulate more than just federally defined cafos through npdes which further complicates distinguishing facilities across states and getting data on these facilities additional rules also protect the farmer s privacy right to not disclose their location steinzor and huang 2012 these are some of the main reasons for the lack of information about the location of these operations for the entire us as well as the lack of information regarding unregulated farms i e operations that do not meet the threshold of animals required to apply for a permit or do not discharge in waterways despite these complications we were able to gather and digitize cafo locations in 16 us states using a variety of methods table 1 most of the data were available online except for three states mississippi wisconsin and oregon in which the data was provided by the state agency responsible via a public records request in this study each state data required georeferencing processing or digitizing techniques to standardize to a useable format this data handling process resulted in an arcgis point shapefile database with attributes of longitude latitude state and the number of animals if available as table 1 suggests while 9 states provided the animal number information per farm only 7 states provided the number and the type of animal contained at the facility of these 7 states swine operations dominated in ia 71 in 71 mo 63 and nc 89 while cattle operations both beef and dairy were predominant in mn 59 or 81 and wi 91 table s 1 to take advantage of the animal number information in all nine states we converted to animal units based on the definition established by the code of federal regulations 1979 in further analyses appendix a regulations are inconsistent among states rosov et al 2020 and some states provide information on more than just regulated operations which complicates understanding this compiled database states like oregon and iowa maintain a database of small afos and cafos that do not discharge into wotus oregon even has more npdes permitted facilities than federally defined cafos within the state table 1 these small afos when clustered may pose a risk to their surrounding environment especially in states where they are not required to hold permits indiana has chosen to regulate large animal farms under their state level permit rather than through npdes i e table 1 shows 0 of cafos in indiana with npdes permits yet its database includes more operations than it would if it only included facilities regulated by npdes us epa 2015 on the contrary the state of ohio dataset only includes the npdes regulated facilities which are only those actively discharging to wotus therefore our cafo database comprises large permitted and some unpermitted cafo and afo facility locations when available fig 1 note that most of the states in this study only provided the location of large operations because of that we use the terminology cafo to refer to all farms in this database 2 2 water quality data the us geological survey released the water quality concentration and streamflow data inputs used to develop the spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes sparrow models saad et al 2019 they screened approximately 5 200 streamflow and 3 300 nutrient sites sampled by 137 agencies and organizations in the us from 1999 to 2014 we evaluated these inputs seasonally and selected stations with streamflow m3 s tp mg l and tn mg l data available from 2005 to 2014 we selected this temporal range due to the intensification of animal agriculture in the us during this period von keyserlingk et al 2013 key et al 2017 walljasper 2018 mcdonald et al 2018 we matched the closest streamflow stations to each tp and tn station to calculate the seasonal average flow weighted mean concentration fwmc of tn and tp meals et al 2013 2011 richards and baker 1993 for the nearest neighbor index analysis we used the station closest to each huc8 outlet for the local moran s i analysis we chose the water quality station nearest to the individual cafo we calculated fwmc by dividing the total load over the estimated time period by the total streamflow of the same period eq 1 1 fwmc 1 n c i t i q i 1 n t i q i where c i represents the ith sample concentration in mg l t i represents the time window for the ith sample day is the time window in this study and q i is the flow registered by the station closest to the station that registered the ith sample concentration ncwqr 2005 streamflow tp and tn were matched daily from 2005 to 2014 then averaged by season 2 3 spatial clustering of cafos using the nearest neighbor index nni the nearest neighbor index nni or the average nearest neighbor analysis package in arcgis pro 2 8 calculates the division between the observed distance among the point features and the expected distance based on the total area within which the point features are located the observed distance is the average distance between each point and its nearest neighbor ebdon 1985 in this study we used the arcpy package to perform the nni calculation among cafos within each 8 digit huc huc8 fig 1 if the observed mean distance is less than the expected nni will be 1 and the cafos within the huc8 area are considered clustered i e cafo clustering if the observed mean distance is greater than the expected nni is greater than 1 and a dispersion pattern is observed among the cafos i e cafo dispersion in a certain watershed this pattern is validated based on a z score calculation converted to p value allowing us to tell if the clustering or dispersion pattern observed is significant in this study we set a significance level of 0 1 p 0 1 we also scaled the nni from most negative dispersion to most positive or zero clustering to observe the linear association between water quality and the spatial pattern detected for the analysis we only selected watersheds with more than 2 animal feeding operations to allow the distance calculation this analysis was used to evaluate if the significant clustering and dispersion of cafos display different water quality signals within the 16 states selected in this study 2 4 considering animal numbers using local moran s i index we gathered the states that provided information on the type and number of animals per cafo and calculated their corresponding animal units aus following the federal code au definition si section 1 code of federal regulations 1979 to compare animal numbers across animal types we used the au of each cafo to investigate if the clustering of total aus not just facilities influenced tp and tn concentrations to identify the local spatial patterns associated with animal numbers we applied a local indicator of spatial association lisa anselin 1995 cafos with a certain number of animals can be clustered spatial clusters or exist individually spatial outliers in this study a spatial cluster is associated with a cafo with high aus surrounded by other cafos with high aus i e high high cluster hh in contrast a spatial outlier is detected when cafos with normal or low aus surround a cafo with high aus i e high low outlier hl if a cafo with low au is in the vicinity of cafos with high aus this pattern is considered a low high outlier lh a spatial cluster can also occur when cafos with low aus surround a cafo with low aus i e a low low cluster ll we identified these patterns using the local moran s i index calculated in arcgis pro 2 8 eq 2 anselin 1995 zhang et al 2008 i i x i x σ 2 j 1 j i n w ij x j x where x i is the value of the variable x at location i x is the average value of x with the sample number of n x j is the value of the variable x at all the other locations where j i σ 2 is the variance of variable x and w ij is a spatial weight matrix which can be defined as the inverse of the distance dij among locations i and j in this study the weight w ij is determined using a 15 km fixed distance samples within 15 km are given the same weight while those outside the distance band are given weight of 0 this fixed distance was established based on studies that investigated manure hauling distances and its impact to the environment long et al 2018 furiness et al 2019 miralha et al 2021b a high positive local moran s i value implies that a certain location has similarly high or low values as its neighbors spatial cluster while a high negative i indicates that a certain location has distinct values as its neighbors spatial outlier spatial outliers are an indication of individual hotspots while spatial clusters indicate regional hotspots note that to perform this analysis we first projected the data to avoid chordal distance calculations since the area of analysis is larger than 30 degrees we performed a conditional permutation with local moran s i to avoid the assumption of normal distribution when calculating the p value in this study all the local moran s i indices were tested using 999 permutations and the significance level was set at 0 05 2 5 analysis of cafo spatial organization and water quality 2 5 1 nni we calculated the seasonal fwmc for tp and tn per huc8 fig 1 and fig 2 and compared these concentrations between watersheds that presented overall cafo clustering or cafo dispersion patterns we also compared the number of cafos per huc8 their respective tp and tn seasonal fwmc nearest the outlet of the huc8 and their nni spatial pattern detected to better distinguish if the water quality conditions were more likely a function of the number of cafos or the way cafos were spatially organized within a watershed additionally we calculated the percentage of land use types per huc8 using the 2019 national land cover database nlcd product with 30 m resolution we compared the land use percentage by spatial pattern detected to understand if there was a significant distinction in the land use characteristics between clustered and dispersed cafos basins 2 5 2 local moran s i to compare the local spatial association of aus to water quality we first detected the closest water quality station to each cafo with au information available we used each individual station to calculate the respective tp and tn seasonal fwmc for each cafo and aggregated the concentrations based on the local spatial pattern detected high high cluster hh low low cluster ll low high outlier lh high low outlier hl we performed a median difference statistic test kruskal wallis to evaluate if there was a statistically significant difference among the seasonal median of tp and tn concentrations per scenario 3 results 3 1 cafo facility spatial organization and water quality of the 443 8 digit huc watersheds cafo dispersion was detected in only 88 watersheds while 355 presented cafo clustering patterns fig 2 by excluding watersheds without significant patterns p 0 1 we had a total of 249 cafo clustering watersheds and 31 cafo dispersion watersheds subsequently available to compare to tp and tn concentrations states such as ia nc mo in and fl presented overall clustered patterns while cafo dispersion watersheds were detected in states in the western or az southern al and northern wi mn parts of the us although the number of cafos in ia basins was higher than the number of operations in the other 15 states in this study 50 of the watersheds within ia state had non significant p 0 1 clustering or dispersion patterns and were excluded from the water quality scenarios we compared both clustering and dispersion distributions to tn and tp concentrations and we found that overall tn and tp concentrations were significantly higher in watersheds where cafos were clustered than in cafo dispersion watersheds fig 3 kruskal wallis p value 0 001 the median tn and tp concentration in cafo clustered watersheds was approximately 0 5 mg l and 0 05 mg l higher than in cafo dispersed basins respectively the highest tp and tn concentrations were overall associated with cafo clustering basins median fwmc tp concentration in cafo clustered sites was above 0 1 mg l while cafo dispersed fwmc tp concentrations were below this value while there are no federal regulations for stream tp concentrations states have begun adopting tp criteria usepa 2016 and some states like wisconsin set tp criteria for streams to be 0 1 mg l wisconsin legislature nr 102 06 2020 seasonally these concentration patterns for both tp and tn also held principally during spring and summer seasons when manure is usually land applied in nearby areas figs s 1 and s 2 we compared the clustering and dispersion patterns with the number of cafos per watershed and their respective tp and tn concentrations fig 4 the results suggested that watersheds tend to exhibit clustering patterns as the number of cafos increases which is intuitive for tp the linear relationship between the number of cafos and the fwmc was significant and moderately positive in clustered watersheds r 0 3 p 0 001 while for the cafo dispersed basins this relationship was only significant at 0 1 level r 0 42 p 0 059 because cafo clustering increased with the number of cafos in a given watershed we selected watersheds with 20 cafos that were also classified as cafo clustered and cafo dispersed to have a better understanding of the relationship between spatial clustering of cafos and water quality this analysis restated what we demonstrated in fig 3 higher concentrations of tp i e 10 mg l and tn i e above 15 mg l were found in cafo clustering watersheds when compared to those classified as cafo dispersed fig s 3 however only the median tp concentration difference between the two scenarios was statistically significant at 0 05 tp kruskal wallis p 0 001 tn kruskal wallis p 0 11 we further investigated the land use configuration per watershed with less than or equal to 20 cafos as land use is also known to be a strong driver of water quality shi et al 2017 tong and chen 2002 we found that the cafo dispersed and cafo clustered watersheds yielded significantly opposite land use signatures fig 5 our results showed that watersheds with dispersion patterns had a higher percentage of cultivated crops and less percent of forested lands than clustered watersheds however the watersheds with clustered cafos facilities still exhibited higher tp and tn levels these results suggest that the spatial organization of these animal operations indeed matters for water quality regardless of land use and the number of farms in a watershed 3 2 clustering of animal numbers and water quality from the 16 states analyzed in this study only 9 had data available on animal number and type per cafo the number of aus per farm ranged between 0 06 and 50 000 with a median of 528 and a standard deviation of 1 672 aus we used the aus to perform the local spatial autocorrelation analysis local moran s i the indices of local moran s i ranged from 10 40 to 476 15 cafos with statistically significant local moran s i indices p 0 05 were displayed according to their spatial cluster category while non significant patterns were excluded and displayed in gray fig 6 among the 19 084 cafos with au information 23 5 presented non significant spatial clustering patterns approximately 54 of the cafos were categorized as ll clusters which means that these cafos have low or normal values of aus and so do their neighboring farms most of these ll cluster farms were in ia mn and west nc our analysis revealed that 13 of cafos were part of the hh cluster category i e both centroid and neighboring operations with high aus hh clusters were mostly detected in states such as wi in east nc and mo about 9 5 of the total number of cafos were detected as spatial outliers i e hl and lh outliers while we found several lh outliers in or pa eastern nc and in most hl outliers were in ia and mn spatial patterns in al were generally not significant when compared to the other 9 states in this analysis comparing the spatial cluster and outlier types with their closest station s nutrient concentrations we found that both ll i e light blue and hl i e red clusters are associated with higher concentrations of tp and tn fig 7 although farms with the largest aus and neighbors of similar high au values hh cluster light pink eventually produce large amounts of manure their surrounding tp and tn concentrations were significantly lower than other cafos with different spatial clusters and outlier classifications lh outlier cafos i e blue also displayed lower tp and tn rates the average tp concentrations for each cluster hh ll and outlier hl lh group were 0 16 0 34 0 36 and 0 16 mg l respectively the maximum tp concentration for hh and ll clusters was 4 86 mg l while for spatial outliers this concentration reached 3 9 mg l for tn the average concentration per scenario was 2 1 hh 7 2 ll 7 4 hl and 2 40 lh mg l we tested if both tp and tn distributions were significantly different per scenario and all scenarios differed at the 0 05 significance level kruskal wallis p 0 0001 although the relationship between tn tp concentrations and aus was not very clear when classified by cluster and outlier type we were able to observe that lowest tp and tn concentrations were associated with scenarios when large cafos are clustered hh and when a small cafo is surrounded by large operations lh we also evaluated the relationship between positive local moran s i indices of spatial clusters and water quality fig s 6 we fit a linear model and found that as i becomes larger hh cluster cafos tp and tn concentrations tend to be lower tp and tn are relatively higher when i is significant and closer to zero ll cluster cafos the animal type in each cafo may also play a role in the concentrations observed as the manure characteristics vary asabe 2005 as well as how the manure is managed regions where ll clusters dominated presented different animal type distributions ia had swine operations predominantly while cattle operations were more common in mn and eastern nc table s 1 the way these states regulate these operations and how they consider the animal type in their policies may play a role in the water quality outcomes observed 4 discussion while studies have mentioned that the spatial aggregation of cafos is likely to exacerbate environmental impacts thurow and thompson 1998 yang et al 2016 martin et al 2018 miralha et al 2021b we investigated this spatial component and revealed that the clustering of these operations by itself leads to stronger negative environmental outcomes specifically we found that cafo clustered watersheds were negatively impacted in terms of water quality watersheds with clustered cafos presented overall higher concentrations of tn and tp than cafo dispersed watersheds states in part of the us corn belt e g ia in mo oh responsible for major applications of n from manure and chemical fertilizers driving the largest hypoxic zone i e dead zone in the gulf of mexico scavia et al 2003 turner et al 2008 glibert 2020 were also states where cafos in general presented clustering patterns fig s 4 a previous study investigated the water quality conditions in two watersheds also included in our study the south fork basin in ia and the little cobb basin in mn kalkhoff et al 2016 they found that these two basins with growing intensified livestock agriculture presented overall lower n and p concentrations in our study we detected a random spatial organization of cafos in these basins i e neither clustering nor dispersion of cafos additionally the basin in mn presented no significant spatial cluster or outlier when aus and moran s i were considered these facilities may be sparse in space managing their manure properly or exporting it beyond the watershed boundary demonstrating the need to understand the role of spatial patterns on water quality outcomes based on the tn and tp concentration limits established by the us environmental protection agency epa per ecoregions for rivers and streams us epa 2013 as well as lakes and reservoirs us epa 2020b the highest concentrations of tn and tp found in the cafo clustering watersheds are likely to drive large algae blooms or other impacts from excess nutrients the concentrations found in this study also exceed safe drinking water limits for n and limits beginning to be set by states for p us epa 2016 seasonally this finding also held principally during spring and summer when manure is most likely to be land applied figs s 1 and s 2 the role of livestock in pollution has yet to be a major focus of nutrient reduction strategies across all 12 states of the mississippi river basin these states such as ia ms mo and mn have the authority to monitor and implement strategies to reduce nutrient pollution however they have little to no resources to implement these strategies because the subsidies to reduce nutrient pollution are held at a federal level potentially overlooking the role of cafos and manure hauling in water pollution secchi and mcdonald 2019 the results of this study point to the importance of cafos and their spatial organization therefore policymakers could use this concept to improve target strategies and management of pollution sources the usefulness of spatial aggregation of sources of pollution will depend on the purpose of the assessment as well as on the spatial resolution of the monitoring program implemented schuwirth 2020 we demonstrated that the spatial arrangement of these operations matters when it comes to water pollution schuwirth 2020 also suggested that environmental assessments must be done at a catchment scale because it is usually a manageable scale for many states secchi and mcdonald 2019 our study successfully demonstrated the efficiency of considering huc8 basins as the targeted boundary area for the assessment of the spatial arrangements of cafos and their relationship to water quality note that we did not consider other anthropogenic sources of pollution in this study which warrants further study as most total maximum daily load tmdl implementations do not consider the spatial arrangement of other emitters during their process either we did evaluate the influence of land use and confirmed that even considering this driver the spatial organization was still important for water quality outcomes previous research has established that liquid waste cafos tend to haul manure within a 15 km radius from the operation facilities centner 2012 long et al 2018 furiness et al 2019 but this distance increases when it comes to dry waste cafos such as many poultry operations ribaudo et al 2003 due to manure hauling distances and the fact most cafos tend to cluster near shared resources and facilities to avoid high transportation costs ribaudo et al 2003 operators tend to apply manure over crop n p requirements kellogg et al 2000 long et al 2018 likely leading to environmental degradation miralha et al 2021b for the clustering of enterprises to work in favor of the environment diversity should exist among the type of entities within the cluster deutz and gibbs 2008 essentially in a clustered industrial ecosystem one facility s by products or surplus should become another s raw material or energy garner and keoleian 1995 strategies incentivizing exchange between cropland owners and cafo operators should be considered to enhance nutrient recycling from these operations in the us ma et al 2022 another form of management is the concept of manuresheds or lands surrounding afos onto which manure nutrients can be redistributed which are currently implemented by the arkansas nutrient surplus program spiegal et al 2020 additional regulatory rules may help for example dairy farms in mn are required to have an adequate land base for manure application before the permit acquisition mpca 2016 we recognize that the clustering of cafos within a region is not coincidental but due to the economics of processing animals and animal products therefore while we do not suggest that altering existing spatial organizations is necessarily a feasible solution we do suggest that our findings can be used to inform strategies for specific kinds of spatial organizations the clustering of animals is a corollary to the clustering of humans in cities in cities we are able to economically and efficiently treat human waste products due to economies of scale this same approach could be applied in animal cluster cities especially as advanced technologies evolve dadrasnia et al 2021 shi et al 2017 regulatory rules and incentives and the clustering between cafos and other industries could be considered in tandem to promote environmental quality and foster the sustainability of these agricultural systems we found that not only the spatial organization of these facilities matters but also the number of animals they hold clustering of cafos was found to exist between enterprises of similar size classification in mo matisziw and hipple 2001 specifically the only operations that underwent clustering were the largest ones class ia in missouri although the clustering of these operations was previously investigated no previous study linked their spatial organization to environmental conditions besides demonstrating that clustering is common among cafos with high aus we found that the spatial pattern that has likely received less attention in the us is the clustering of cafos with low aus i e ll cluster fig 6 representing areas where many small farms aggregate in space these facilities were also associated with higher in stream nutrients this finding is important within the us context because the focus of regulatory agencies tends to be on controlling large individual operations separately ritzel 2014 this individual based regulatory approach may fail when multiple smaller entities aggregate to produce the same amount of waste as one or more large entities as demonstrated in this study the spatial autocorrelation of small cafos i e lower aus was associated with higher concentrations of tp and tn at the same time clusters of large operations i e hh were generally associated with lower tp and tn concentrations fig 7 we acknowledge that as the number of farms within a watershed area increases the water quality outcomes observed may solely be due to saturation of cafos within the region rather than the pattern however when evaluating the patterns in watersheds with similar cafo numbers and similar animal units i e 20 cafos analysis we found that the highest concentrations of tn and tp were still associated with cafo clustered basins fig s 3 additionally cafo clustered watersheds had land use signals usually associated with good water quality than cafo dispersed basins fig 5 yet they still had higher nutrient concentrations this finding indicates that the spatial organization of these facilities is likely a strong driver of water quality outcomes even if it may be muted with increasing numbers of facilities this spatial autocorrelation phenomenon is also a characteristic of water quality miralha and kim 2018 meaning that nearby water quality stations upstream and downstream of the river network tend to resemble approximately the same tp and tn concentrations this raises a concern about the pollution of nearby tributaries or main rivers closer to the ones impacted by these small cafos indicating a threat to the aquatic ecosystem and the health of nearby communities to account for the nutrient contribution from manure produced by these animal operations in watershed models modelers often rely on average manure application rates to represent manure management practices in the studied watershed area neglecting the spatial dynamics of animal agriculture and changes in management practices other than manure application and crop patterns wang and baerenklau 2015 when solely relying on application rates models have not shown much improvement when modeling observed tp and tn loads apostel et al 2021 kast et al 2021 more information on the location of these animal facilities their distance to water bodies and the number of animals they hold may improve the representation of these point and non point sources of nutrient pollution in models most importantly considering their spatial heterogeneity via metrics such as nni and local moran s i have the potential to reveal the spatial component of these sources inherent in water quality that is often neglected in models we acknowledge the limitations of this study which warrant further research first other sources of pollution e g human wastewater fertilizer applications were not accounted for which may have influenced the water quality patterns identified however it does not negate our findings since both nni and local moran s i analysis illustrated similar regional clustering patterns although these two techniques are based on different approaches second we did not fully account for the clustering of animal types although we have provided the counts of cafos per animal type in the si table 1 and broadly discuss the dominance of an animal type in states where high clustering was identified the point analysis per animal type could facilitate the elaboration of policies per type of animal we also acknowledge that a lack of water quality data in the western us e g az or principally for tn concentrations could influence observed patterns however even with these limitations we were still able to associate higher concentrations of tp with the cafo clustered watersheds in these regions fig s 5 the lack of information on the location of these operations as well as the type and number of animals they hold also may have impaired our results although efforts to identify the location of these operations are in progress chugg et al 2021 handan nader and ho 2019 more information is needed to properly manage these systems across larger scales federal and state agencies along with researchers should come together to create a database of small and large animal farms to improve environmental assessment monitoring and solutions for nutrient pollution 5 conclusion our study revealed spatial patterns of cafos are important drivers of water quality which has been previously unaccounted for in the literature with the nearest neighbor index we revealed that the spatial organization of cafos influences surrounding water quality conditions we also found that the spatial autocorrelation of these farms with respect to their animal units local moran s i analysis drove water quality outcomes our results demonstrated that although larger cafos tend to cluster over space i e hh cluster they were often associated with lower nutrient concentrations perhaps because they are often more regulated by federal and state environmental policies we observed that the clustering of cafos with low animal units i e ll cluster was associated with higher nutrient concentrations which warrants further study as these entities tend to be less regulated because of the nature of regulations being size focused these findings are likely because of the individualistic approach to regulation for these kinds of facilities in the us rather than a systems approach our results also indicated the importance of gathering more information about the location of all animal agriculture entities as well as for new regulations or incentives considering the clustering pattern of cafos and other pollution sources

2911,large animal operations in the united states us have expanded in recent decades as a solution for meeting increasing food demand these operations can release large amounts of organic matter and nutrients into the environment potentially impacting water quality conditions of nearby waterbodies often referred to as animal feeding operations afos or cafos concentrated afos based on nomenclature in federal regulations these operations are usually clustered in space which may intensify the impacts observed however the influence of the known spatial aggregation of cafos on water quality conditions has not been evaluated this study investigates the spatial organization of cafos and its relationship to water quality conditions we hypothesized that watersheds with clustered cafos are likely to be associated with higher concentrations of total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn in the us we gathered and digitized cafo locations in 16 us states and used tp and tn concentration data to evaluate our hypothesis we calculated the flow weighted mean concentration of tn and tp from 2005 to 2014 and averaged those values per season we used the nearest neighbor index nni to determine the spatial pattern i e clustering or dispersed of cafos per watershed and its significance level additionally for states with animal number information per farm we performed a local moran s i analysis to understand if the clustering of cafos with a low or high number of animals relates to the tp and tn concentrations of each nearest water quality station overall we found that watersheds with significant clustering patterns were associated with higher tp and tn levels seasonally this finding also held principally during spring and summer seasons when manure tends to be land applied our local moran s i analysis also revealed that the clustering of smaller and medium sized farms usually less regulated is associated with elevated tp and tn concentrations this reveals that the small yet potentially unregulated farms could be highly impactful to the environment which warrants further study given the lack of information on the influence of cafo clustering and other pollutant source clustering on water quality and that most states do not regulate emitters based on this aspect our outcomes advance the knowledge of how these entities may be driving changes to the environment this

in the united states us began shifting from smaller distributed farms to larger facilities to increase the efficiency of production mallin and cahoon 2003 key et al 2017 walljasper 2018 these large and often confined facilities called animal feeding operations afos in the code of federal regulations currently represent a majority of the livestock production in the us an animal operation is defined as an afo if it confines and feeds animals for 45 days or more and does not sustain crop growth on a regular basis an afo is regulated as a cafo concentrated afo if it also meets a threshold number of animals that varies by animal type actively discharges to waters of the us wotus or is deemed so by the regulating body usepa 2004 these operations yield over 130 million tons of manure annually burkholder et al 2007 and tend to periodically apply this manure to surrounding fields as a means of waste disposal long et al 2018 although manure is composed of important nutrients such as phosphorus p and nitrogen n usepa 2004 it may also contain heavy metals pathogens antibiotics and other harmful substances that in excess may pose a risk to soil air and water quality mallin and cahoon 2003 barrett 2005 burkholder et al 2007 harun and ogneva himmelberger 2013 ebner 2017 a study recently found that significant land use change and environmental degradation occur within the typical radius of manure application near these facilities miralha et al 2021b in addition to standard operational activities accidental discharges such as cafo lagoon breaks mallin and cahoon 2003 as well as leaching and runoff of contaminants from manure applied fields into nearby water bodies sousan et al 2021 can lead to severe ecological degradation as cafos tend to cluster in space for production and logistical purposes their associated environmental impacts may also intensify clustering has become the cornerstone of efficiency and economic success in industrialized production and development porter 1998 ayres and ayres 2002 deutz and gibbs 2008 although it is argued that industrial clusters may provide environmental benefits lifset and graedel 2002 few studies in industrial ecology have investigated the relationship between the clustering of point sources and the impact on the surrounding environment kennedy 1999 lall and mengistae 2005 anh et al 2011 yoon and nadvi 2018 spatially concentrated production can potentially generate negative environmental outcomes regardless of the specific industry like many other industries cafos tend to cluster in space for economic reasons which may lead to similar drawbacks the clustering of animal agriculture may lead to cumulative adverse environmental effects because individual production facilities add animals over time whether or not they own sufficient cropland to handle the additional manure produced thurow and thompson 1998 however studies have not explored the spatial clustering of cafos and its relationship with the conditions of the surrounding environment daniels 1997 determined that for cluster zoning to be an effective method of land protection planners must delineate reasonable densities for development such that the carrying capacity of the local environment is not exceeded especially in a watershed excessive density inappropriate locations a combination of these two or unreasonable expectations about what cluster development can do are the major potential clustering misuses of a given operation daniels 1997 porter 1998 these issues may exacerbate with the expansion of cafos both in the us and worldwide principally when it comes to socio environmental impacts while watersheds with high concentrations of cafos are potentially at higher risk of degradation than others martin et al 2018 brown et al 2020 studies have yet to investigate if the spatial organization of cafos is a characteristic of higher negative environmental outcomes specifically this spatial clustering pattern has yet to be investigated in water quality studies that account for agricultural sources of pollution eutrophication driven by excess nutrients is a common result of water quality deterioration so monitoring and controlling nutrient inputs is fundamental to water resource conservation usepa 1996 cafos are major sources of nutrient pollution however their manure is typically considered a non point source of pollution when applied to nearby fields copeland 2010 rosov et al 2020 studies have previously explored the impact of cafos on water quality for instance concentrations of nitrate ammonium total nitrogen tn and other ions were higher in cafo impacted streams than in control streams where cafos were not present harden 2015 additionally overaccumulation of total phosphorus tp by manure application has increased export into surface and subsurface water bodies impacting the aquatic ecosystem withers and jarvie 2008 for instance the neuse river watershed in north carolina received approximately 41 000 metric tons of n and 16 000 metric tons of p from cafo waste alone in the 2000s glasgow and burkholder 2000 these additions of large amounts of nutrients often introduce the potential for eutrophic hypoxic conditions to surface water bodies muenich et al 2016 tullo et al 2019 miralha et al 2021a raff and meyer 2021 an impact that must be prevented and monitored to avoid severe ecological damages assessing the spatial organization of cafos and its links to water quality conditions could improve our understanding of managing and regulating these and other facilities to prevent future environmental impacts the amount of manure produced and applied in the vicinity of clustered cafos may exceed the assimilative capacity of the land to a greater extent than in systems with spatially dispersed cafos additionally the number of animals these aggregated operations hold may influence the degree of pollution in nearby waterbodies due to the amounts of manure produced and hauled hence we hypothesize that cafo clustered watersheds are likely to present higher concentrations of tp and tn than cafo dispersed basins we tested this hypothesis by examining the relationship between the spatial pattern i e clustering or dispersion of cafos in 16 states across the us and the tp and tn flow weighted mean concentrations per watershed in these states to distinguish the impact of clustering from the number of cafos present in a watershed we also investigated the linear relationship between tn and tp concentrations the number of cafos per watershed and each watershed s cafo spatial pattern we gathered the states that provided animal number information per cafo and evaluated the relationship between the spatial cluster of the number of animals per cafo and tp and tn concentrations this study brings a comprehensive evaluation of the relationship between the spatial organization of cafos and water quality provides the basis for further management of livestock production and calls for spatially explicit strategies to prevent environmental impacts associated with intensified animal agriculture and other pollution sources in the us 2 methodology 2 1 cafo locations database any afo that discharges manure or wastewater into a natural or man made ditch stream or jurisdictional waterway is defined as a cafo regardless of size copeland 2010 these operations are regulated by the environmental protection agency epa under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes and thus subjected to specific regulations defined in the clean water act usepa 2003 2018 the 2003 cafo rule stated that cafos had the duty to apply for npdes permits requiring information about the facility s location and a nutrient management plan however the 2008 revision of this rule established that a cafo operator no longer has the duty to apply for the permit if it was determined that the facility has no potential to discharge manure litter or process wastewater to waters of the us wotus rosov et al 2020 this revision complicates our ability to identify where these large animal farms are and where they are potentially land applying manure because we lack the data from the npdes permits themselves the current implementation status of the 2008 rule is summarized each year by the epa us epa 2020a some states choose to regulate all federally defined cafos through npdes some may choose only to regulate those actively discharging to wotus through npdes and some may choose to regulate more than just federally defined cafos through npdes which further complicates distinguishing facilities across states and getting data on these facilities additional rules also protect the farmer s privacy right to not disclose their location steinzor and huang 2012 these are some of the main reasons for the lack of information about the location of these operations for the entire us as well as the lack of information regarding unregulated farms i e operations that do not meet the threshold of animals required to apply for a permit or do not discharge in waterways despite these complications we were able to gather and digitize cafo locations in 16 us states using a variety of methods table 1 most of the data were available online except for three states mississippi wisconsin and oregon in which the data was provided by the state agency responsible via a public records request in this study each state data required georeferencing processing or digitizing techniques to standardize to a useable format this data handling process resulted in an arcgis point shapefile database with attributes of longitude latitude state and the number of animals if available as table 1 suggests while 9 states provided the animal number information per farm only 7 states provided the number and the type of animal contained at the facility of these 7 states swine operations dominated in ia 71 in 71 mo 63 and nc 89 while cattle operations both beef and dairy were predominant in mn 59 or 81 and wi 91 table s 1 to take advantage of the animal number information in all nine states we converted to animal units based on the definition established by the code of federal regulations 1979 in further analyses appendix a regulations are inconsistent among states rosov et al 2020 and some states provide information on more than just regulated operations which complicates understanding this compiled database states like oregon and iowa maintain a database of small afos and cafos that do not discharge into wotus oregon even has more npdes permitted facilities than federally defined cafos within the state table 1 these small afos when clustered may pose a risk to their surrounding environment especially in states where they are not required to hold permits indiana has chosen to regulate large animal farms under their state level permit rather than through npdes i e table 1 shows 0 of cafos in indiana with npdes permits yet its database includes more operations than it would if it only included facilities regulated by npdes us epa 2015 on the contrary the state of ohio dataset only includes the npdes regulated facilities which are only those actively discharging to wotus therefore our cafo database comprises large permitted and some unpermitted cafo and afo facility locations when available fig 1 note that most of the states in this study only provided the location of large operations because of that we use the terminology cafo to refer to all farms in this database 2 2 water quality data the us geological survey released the water quality concentration and streamflow data inputs used to develop the spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes sparrow models saad et al 2019 they screened approximately 5 200 streamflow and 3 300 nutrient sites sampled by 137 agencies and organizations in the us from 1999 to 2014 we evaluated these inputs seasonally and selected stations with streamflow m3 s tp mg l and tn mg l data available from 2005 to 2014 we selected this temporal range due to the intensification of animal agriculture in the us during this period von keyserlingk et al 2013 key et al 2017 walljasper 2018 mcdonald et al 2018 we matched the closest streamflow stations to each tp and tn station to calculate the seasonal average flow weighted mean concentration fwmc of tn and tp meals et al 2013 2011 richards and baker 1993 for the nearest neighbor index analysis we used the station closest to each huc8 outlet for the local moran s i analysis we chose the water quality station nearest to the individual cafo we calculated fwmc by dividing the total load over the estimated time period by the total streamflow of the same period eq 1 1 fwmc 1 n c i t i q i 1 n t i q i where c i represents the ith sample concentration in mg l t i represents the time window for the ith sample day is the time window in this study and q i is the flow registered by the station closest to the station that registered the ith sample concentration ncwqr 2005 streamflow tp and tn were matched daily from 2005 to 2014 then averaged by season 2 3 spatial clustering of cafos using the nearest neighbor index nni the nearest neighbor index nni or the average nearest neighbor analysis package in arcgis pro 2 8 calculates the division between the observed distance among the point features and the expected distance based on the total area within which the point features are located the observed distance is the average distance between each point and its nearest neighbor ebdon 1985 in this study we used the arcpy package to perform the nni calculation among cafos within each 8 digit huc huc8 fig 1 if the observed mean distance is less than the expected nni will be 1 and the cafos within the huc8 area are considered clustered i e cafo clustering if the observed mean distance is greater than the expected nni is greater than 1 and a dispersion pattern is observed among the cafos i e cafo dispersion in a certain watershed this pattern is validated based on a z score calculation converted to p value allowing us to tell if the clustering or dispersion pattern observed is significant in this study we set a significance level of 0 1 p 0 1 we also scaled the nni from most negative dispersion to most positive or zero clustering to observe the linear association between water quality and the spatial pattern detected for the analysis we only selected watersheds with more than 2 animal feeding operations to allow the distance calculation this analysis was used to evaluate if the significant clustering and dispersion of cafos display different water quality signals within the 16 states selected in this study 2 4 considering animal numbers using local moran s i index we gathered the states that provided information on the type and number of animals per cafo and calculated their corresponding animal units aus following the federal code au definition si section 1 code of federal regulations 1979 to compare animal numbers across animal types we used the au of each cafo to investigate if the clustering of total aus not just facilities influenced tp and tn concentrations to identify the local spatial patterns associated with animal numbers we applied a local indicator of spatial association lisa anselin 1995 cafos with a certain number of animals can be clustered spatial clusters or exist individually spatial outliers in this study a spatial cluster is associated with a cafo with high aus surrounded by other cafos with high aus i e high high cluster hh in contrast a spatial outlier is detected when cafos with normal or low aus surround a cafo with high aus i e high low outlier hl if a cafo with low au is in the vicinity of cafos with high aus this pattern is considered a low high outlier lh a spatial cluster can also occur when cafos with low aus surround a cafo with low aus i e a low low cluster ll we identified these patterns using the local moran s i index calculated in arcgis pro 2 8 eq 2 anselin 1995 zhang et al 2008 i i x i x σ 2 j 1 j i n w ij x j x where x i is the value of the variable x at location i x is the average value of x with the sample number of n x j is the value of the variable x at all the other locations where j i σ 2 is the variance of variable x and w ij is a spatial weight matrix which can be defined as the inverse of the distance dij among locations i and j in this study the weight w ij is determined using a 15 km fixed distance samples within 15 km are given the same weight while those outside the distance band are given weight of 0 this fixed distance was established based on studies that investigated manure hauling distances and its impact to the environment long et al 2018 furiness et al 2019 miralha et al 2021b a high positive local moran s i value implies that a certain location has similarly high or low values as its neighbors spatial cluster while a high negative i indicates that a certain location has distinct values as its neighbors spatial outlier spatial outliers are an indication of individual hotspots while spatial clusters indicate regional hotspots note that to perform this analysis we first projected the data to avoid chordal distance calculations since the area of analysis is larger than 30 degrees we performed a conditional permutation with local moran s i to avoid the assumption of normal distribution when calculating the p value in this study all the local moran s i indices were tested using 999 permutations and the significance level was set at 0 05 2 5 analysis of cafo spatial organization and water quality 2 5 1 nni we calculated the seasonal fwmc for tp and tn per huc8 fig 1 and fig 2 and compared these concentrations between watersheds that presented overall cafo clustering or cafo dispersion patterns we also compared the number of cafos per huc8 their respective tp and tn seasonal fwmc nearest the outlet of the huc8 and their nni spatial pattern detected to better distinguish if the water quality conditions were more likely a function of the number of cafos or the way cafos were spatially organized within a watershed additionally we calculated the percentage of land use types per huc8 using the 2019 national land cover database nlcd product with 30 m resolution we compared the land use percentage by spatial pattern detected to understand if there was a significant distinction in the land use characteristics between clustered and dispersed cafos basins 2 5 2 local moran s i to compare the local spatial association of aus to water quality we first detected the closest water quality station to each cafo with au information available we used each individual station to calculate the respective tp and tn seasonal fwmc for each cafo and aggregated the concentrations based on the local spatial pattern detected high high cluster hh low low cluster ll low high outlier lh high low outlier hl we performed a median difference statistic test kruskal wallis to evaluate if there was a statistically significant difference among the seasonal median of tp and tn concentrations per scenario 3 results 3 1 cafo facility spatial organization and water quality of the 443 8 digit huc watersheds cafo dispersion was detected in only 88 watersheds while 355 presented cafo clustering patterns fig 2 by excluding watersheds without significant patterns p 0 1 we had a total of 249 cafo clustering watersheds and 31 cafo dispersion watersheds subsequently available to compare to tp and tn concentrations states such as ia nc mo in and fl presented overall clustered patterns while cafo dispersion watersheds were detected in states in the western or az southern al and northern wi mn parts of the us although the number of cafos in ia basins was higher than the number of operations in the other 15 states in this study 50 of the watersheds within ia state had non significant p 0 1 clustering or dispersion patterns and were excluded from the water quality scenarios we compared both clustering and dispersion distributions to tn and tp concentrations and we found that overall tn and tp concentrations were significantly higher in watersheds where cafos were clustered than in cafo dispersion watersheds fig 3 kruskal wallis p value 0 001 the median tn and tp concentration in cafo clustered watersheds was approximately 0 5 mg l and 0 05 mg l higher than in cafo dispersed basins respectively the highest tp and tn concentrations were overall associated with cafo clustering basins median fwmc tp concentration in cafo clustered sites was above 0 1 mg l while cafo dispersed fwmc tp concentrations were below this value while there are no federal regulations for stream tp concentrations states have begun adopting tp criteria usepa 2016 and some states like wisconsin set tp criteria for streams to be 0 1 mg l wisconsin legislature nr 102 06 2020 seasonally these concentration patterns for both tp and tn also held principally during spring and summer seasons when manure is usually land applied in nearby areas figs s 1 and s 2 we compared the clustering and dispersion patterns with the number of cafos per watershed and their respective tp and tn concentrations fig 4 the results suggested that watersheds tend to exhibit clustering patterns as the number of cafos increases which is intuitive for tp the linear relationship between the number of cafos and the fwmc was significant and moderately positive in clustered watersheds r 0 3 p 0 001 while for the cafo dispersed basins this relationship was only significant at 0 1 level r 0 42 p 0 059 because cafo clustering increased with the number of cafos in a given watershed we selected watersheds with 20 cafos that were also classified as cafo clustered and cafo dispersed to have a better understanding of the relationship between spatial clustering of cafos and water quality this analysis restated what we demonstrated in fig 3 higher concentrations of tp i e 10 mg l and tn i e above 15 mg l were found in cafo clustering watersheds when compared to those classified as cafo dispersed fig s 3 however only the median tp concentration difference between the two scenarios was statistically significant at 0 05 tp kruskal wallis p 0 001 tn kruskal wallis p 0 11 we further investigated the land use configuration per watershed with less than or equal to 20 cafos as land use is also known to be a strong driver of water quality shi et al 2017 tong and chen 2002 we found that the cafo dispersed and cafo clustered watersheds yielded significantly opposite land use signatures fig 5 our results showed that watersheds with dispersion patterns had a higher percentage of cultivated crops and less percent of forested lands than clustered watersheds however the watersheds with clustered cafos facilities still exhibited higher tp and tn levels these results suggest that the spatial organization of these animal operations indeed matters for water quality regardless of land use and the number of farms in a watershed 3 2 clustering of animal numbers and water quality from the 16 states analyzed in this study only 9 had data available on animal number and type per cafo the number of aus per farm ranged between 0 06 and 50 000 with a median of 528 and a standard deviation of 1 672 aus we used the aus to perform the local spatial autocorrelation analysis local moran s i the indices of local moran s i ranged from 10 40 to 476 15 cafos with statistically significant local moran s i indices p 0 05 were displayed according to their spatial cluster category while non significant patterns were excluded and displayed in gray fig 6 among the 19 084 cafos with au information 23 5 presented non significant spatial clustering patterns approximately 54 of the cafos were categorized as ll clusters which means that these cafos have low or normal values of aus and so do their neighboring farms most of these ll cluster farms were in ia mn and west nc our analysis revealed that 13 of cafos were part of the hh cluster category i e both centroid and neighboring operations with high aus hh clusters were mostly detected in states such as wi in east nc and mo about 9 5 of the total number of cafos were detected as spatial outliers i e hl and lh outliers while we found several lh outliers in or pa eastern nc and in most hl outliers were in ia and mn spatial patterns in al were generally not significant when compared to the other 9 states in this analysis comparing the spatial cluster and outlier types with their closest station s nutrient concentrations we found that both ll i e light blue and hl i e red clusters are associated with higher concentrations of tp and tn fig 7 although farms with the largest aus and neighbors of similar high au values hh cluster light pink eventually produce large amounts of manure their surrounding tp and tn concentrations were significantly lower than other cafos with different spatial clusters and outlier classifications lh outlier cafos i e blue also displayed lower tp and tn rates the average tp concentrations for each cluster hh ll and outlier hl lh group were 0 16 0 34 0 36 and 0 16 mg l respectively the maximum tp concentration for hh and ll clusters was 4 86 mg l while for spatial outliers this concentration reached 3 9 mg l for tn the average concentration per scenario was 2 1 hh 7 2 ll 7 4 hl and 2 40 lh mg l we tested if both tp and tn distributions were significantly different per scenario and all scenarios differed at the 0 05 significance level kruskal wallis p 0 0001 although the relationship between tn tp concentrations and aus was not very clear when classified by cluster and outlier type we were able to observe that lowest tp and tn concentrations were associated with scenarios when large cafos are clustered hh and when a small cafo is surrounded by large operations lh we also evaluated the relationship between positive local moran s i indices of spatial clusters and water quality fig s 6 we fit a linear model and found that as i becomes larger hh cluster cafos tp and tn concentrations tend to be lower tp and tn are relatively higher when i is significant and closer to zero ll cluster cafos the animal type in each cafo may also play a role in the concentrations observed as the manure characteristics vary asabe 2005 as well as how the manure is managed regions where ll clusters dominated presented different animal type distributions ia had swine operations predominantly while cattle operations were more common in mn and eastern nc table s 1 the way these states regulate these operations and how they consider the animal type in their policies may play a role in the water quality outcomes observed 4 discussion while studies have mentioned that the spatial aggregation of cafos is likely to exacerbate environmental impacts thurow and thompson 1998 yang et al 2016 martin et al 2018 miralha et al 2021b we investigated this spatial component and revealed that the clustering of these operations by itself leads to stronger negative environmental outcomes specifically we found that cafo clustered watersheds were negatively impacted in terms of water quality watersheds with clustered cafos presented overall higher concentrations of tn and tp than cafo dispersed watersheds states in part of the us corn belt e g ia in mo oh responsible for major applications of n from manure and chemical fertilizers driving the largest hypoxic zone i e dead zone in the gulf of mexico scavia et al 2003 turner et al 2008 glibert 2020 were also states where cafos in general presented clustering patterns fig s 4 a previous study investigated the water quality conditions in two watersheds also included in our study the south fork basin in ia and the little cobb basin in mn kalkhoff et al 2016 they found that these two basins with growing intensified livestock agriculture presented overall lower n and p concentrations in our study we detected a random spatial organization of cafos in these basins i e neither clustering nor dispersion of cafos additionally the basin in mn presented no significant spatial cluster or outlier when aus and moran s i were considered these facilities may be sparse in space managing their manure properly or exporting it beyond the watershed boundary demonstrating the need to understand the role of spatial patterns on water quality outcomes based on the tn and tp concentration limits established by the us environmental protection agency epa per ecoregions for rivers and streams us epa 2013 as well as lakes and reservoirs us epa 2020b the highest concentrations of tn and tp found in the cafo clustering watersheds are likely to drive large algae blooms or other impacts from excess nutrients the concentrations found in this study also exceed safe drinking water limits for n and limits beginning to be set by states for p us epa 2016 seasonally this finding also held principally during spring and summer when manure is most likely to be land applied figs s 1 and s 2 the role of livestock in pollution has yet to be a major focus of nutrient reduction strategies across all 12 states of the mississippi river basin these states such as ia ms mo and mn have the authority to monitor and implement strategies to reduce nutrient pollution however they have little to no resources to implement these strategies because the subsidies to reduce nutrient pollution are held at a federal level potentially overlooking the role of cafos and manure hauling in water pollution secchi and mcdonald 2019 the results of this study point to the importance of cafos and their spatial organization therefore policymakers could use this concept to improve target strategies and management of pollution sources the usefulness of spatial aggregation of sources of pollution will depend on the purpose of the assessment as well as on the spatial resolution of the monitoring program implemented schuwirth 2020 we demonstrated that the spatial arrangement of these operations matters when it comes to water pollution schuwirth 2020 also suggested that environmental assessments must be done at a catchment scale because it is usually a manageable scale for many states secchi and mcdonald 2019 our study successfully demonstrated the efficiency of considering huc8 basins as the targeted boundary area for the assessment of the spatial arrangements of cafos and their relationship to water quality note that we did not consider other anthropogenic sources of pollution in this study which warrants further study as most total maximum daily load tmdl implementations do not consider the spatial arrangement of other emitters during their process either we did evaluate the influence of land use and confirmed that even considering this driver the spatial organization was still important for water quality outcomes previous research has established that liquid waste cafos tend to haul manure within a 15 km radius from the operation facilities centner 2012 long et al 2018 furiness et al 2019 but this distance increases when it comes to dry waste cafos such as many poultry operations ribaudo et al 2003 due to manure hauling distances and the fact most cafos tend to cluster near shared resources and facilities to avoid high transportation costs ribaudo et al 2003 operators tend to apply manure over crop n p requirements kellogg et al 2000 long et al 2018 likely leading to environmental degradation miralha et al 2021b for the clustering of enterprises to work in favor of the environment diversity should exist among the type of entities within the cluster deutz and gibbs 2008 essentially in a clustered industrial ecosystem one facility s by products or surplus should become another s raw material or energy garner and keoleian 1995 strategies incentivizing exchange between cropland owners and cafo operators should be considered to enhance nutrient recycling from these operations in the us ma et al 2022 another form of management is the concept of manuresheds or lands surrounding afos onto which manure nutrients can be redistributed which are currently implemented by the arkansas nutrient surplus program spiegal et al 2020 additional regulatory rules may help for example dairy farms in mn are required to have an adequate land base for manure application before the permit acquisition mpca 2016 we recognize that the clustering of cafos within a region is not coincidental but due to the economics of processing animals and animal products therefore while we do not suggest that altering existing spatial organizations is necessarily a feasible solution we do suggest that our findings can be used to inform strategies for specific kinds of spatial organizations the clustering of animals is a corollary to the clustering of humans in cities in cities we are able to economically and efficiently treat human waste products due to economies of scale this same approach could be applied in animal cluster cities especially as advanced technologies evolve dadrasnia et al 2021 shi et al 2017 regulatory rules and incentives and the clustering between cafos and other industries could be considered in tandem to promote environmental quality and foster the sustainability of these agricultural systems we found that not only the spatial organization of these facilities matters but also the number of animals they hold clustering of cafos was found to exist between enterprises of similar size classification in mo matisziw and hipple 2001 specifically the only operations that underwent clustering were the largest ones class ia in missouri although the clustering of these operations was previously investigated no previous study linked their spatial organization to environmental conditions besides demonstrating that clustering is common among cafos with high aus we found that the spatial pattern that has likely received less attention in the us is the clustering of cafos with low aus i e ll cluster fig 6 representing areas where many small farms aggregate in space these facilities were also associated with higher in stream nutrients this finding is important within the us context because the focus of regulatory agencies tends to be on controlling large individual operations separately ritzel 2014 this individual based regulatory approach may fail when multiple smaller entities aggregate to produce the same amount of waste as one or more large entities as demonstrated in this study the spatial autocorrelation of small cafos i e lower aus was associated with higher concentrations of tp and tn at the same time clusters of large operations i e hh were generally associated with lower tp and tn concentrations fig 7 we acknowledge that as the number of farms within a watershed area increases the water quality outcomes observed may solely be due to saturation of cafos within the region rather than the pattern however when evaluating the patterns in watersheds with similar cafo numbers and similar animal units i e 20 cafos analysis we found that the highest concentrations of tn and tp were still associated with cafo clustered basins fig s 3 additionally cafo clustered watersheds had land use signals usually associated with good water quality than cafo dispersed basins fig 5 yet they still had higher nutrient concentrations this finding indicates that the spatial organization of these facilities is likely a strong driver of water quality outcomes even if it may be muted with increasing numbers of facilities this spatial autocorrelation phenomenon is also a characteristic of water quality miralha and kim 2018 meaning that nearby water quality stations upstream and downstream of the river network tend to resemble approximately the same tp and tn concentrations this raises a concern about the pollution of nearby tributaries or main rivers closer to the ones impacted by these small cafos indicating a threat to the aquatic ecosystem and the health of nearby communities to account for the nutrient contribution from manure produced by these animal operations in watershed models modelers often rely on average manure application rates to represent manure management practices in the studied watershed area neglecting the spatial dynamics of animal agriculture and changes in management practices other than manure application and crop patterns wang and baerenklau 2015 when solely relying on application rates models have not shown much improvement when modeling observed tp and tn loads apostel et al 2021 kast et al 2021 more information on the location of these animal facilities their distance to water bodies and the number of animals they hold may improve the representation of these point and non point sources of nutrient pollution in models most importantly considering their spatial heterogeneity via metrics such as nni and local moran s i have the potential to reveal the spatial component of these sources inherent in water quality that is often neglected in models we acknowledge the limitations of this study which warrant further research first other sources of pollution e g human wastewater fertilizer applications were not accounted for which may have influenced the water quality patterns identified however it does not negate our findings since both nni and local moran s i analysis illustrated similar regional clustering patterns although these two techniques are based on different approaches second we did not fully account for the clustering of animal types although we have provided the counts of cafos per animal type in the si table 1 and broadly discuss the dominance of an animal type in states where high clustering was identified the point analysis per animal type could facilitate the elaboration of policies per type of animal we also acknowledge that a lack of water quality data in the western us e g az or principally for tn concentrations could influence observed patterns however even with these limitations we were still able to associate higher concentrations of tp with the cafo clustered watersheds in these regions fig s 5 the lack of information on the location of these operations as well as the type and number of animals they hold also may have impaired our results although efforts to identify the location of these operations are in progress chugg et al 2021 handan nader and ho 2019 more information is needed to properly manage these systems across larger scales federal and state agencies along with researchers should come together to create a database of small and large animal farms to improve environmental assessment monitoring and solutions for nutrient pollution 5 conclusion our study revealed spatial patterns of cafos are important drivers of water quality which has been previously unaccounted for in the literature with the nearest neighbor index we revealed that the spatial organization of cafos influences surrounding water quality conditions we also found that the spatial autocorrelation of these farms with respect to their animal units local moran s i analysis drove water quality outcomes our results demonstrated that although larger cafos tend to cluster over space i e hh cluster they were often associated with lower nutrient concentrations perhaps because they are often more regulated by federal and state environmental policies we observed that the clustering of cafos with low animal units i e ll cluster was associated with higher nutrient concentrations which warrants further study as these entities tend to be less regulated because of the nature of regulations being size focused these findings are likely because of the individualistic approach to regulation for these kinds of facilities in the us rather than a systems approach our results also indicated the importance of gathering more information about the location of all animal agriculture entities as well as for new regulations or incentives considering the clustering pattern of cafos and other pollution sources

2912,carbon emissions from aquatic ecosystems including reservoirs play an important role in the global carbon budget while the carbon cycle in reservoirs is still far from clearly understood in this study a vertical two dimensional quality hydrodynamic model ce qual w2 was established to simulate co2 fluxes and carbon transport in the wujiangdu reservoir in southwest china verified by field measurement in 2017 thanks to overall good accuracy of multi indicator simulation of the model mean rre 23 4 mean nes 0 67 ce qual w2 is considered as a valid module to simulate carbon flux in the reservoir based on the model the average co2 flux across the air water interface of the reservoir was 4 37 mmol m 2 d 1 temporally co2 fluxes in the cold season were higher than those in the warm season indicating the important effect of seasonal temperature change on co2 flux as well as the effect of other parameters such as do chla tn tp and ph spatially co2 emission fluxes were lower in the water inlet area of the reservoir 2 74 mmol m 2 d 1 and in front of the dam 3 40 mmol m 2 d 1 but higher in the middle part of the reservoir highest 5 42 mmol m 2 d 1 at segment 54 different discharge elevation scenarios were set up to model the influences of hydrodynamics on co2 emission fluxes when the water discharge elevation increased by 30 m co2 emission increased by 39 31 and discharged downstream carbon decreased by 1 90 compared with the actual working condition finally the total mass of carbon released by the reservoir the combination of carbon diffused into the atmosphere and carbon in released water decreased by 1 85 compared with the actual working condition when the water discharge elevation decreased by 30 m no obvious change of co2 emission happened but the total mass of carbon released by the reservoir increased by 1 44 this research confirmed the validity of ce qual w2 in simulating carbon flux in reservoirs our modelling results shed light on the influence of hydrodynamics on carbon emission in reservoirs and optimizing water discharge elevation can be helpful to mitigate carbon emission from reservoirs keywords reservoir carbon cycle co2 flux ce qual w2 model 1 introduction due to the escalation of climate change the carbon cycle has received increasing attention yang et al 2022 in large waterbodies a large amount of carbon can be released across the water air interface deemer et al 2016 some studies indicate that inland aquatic ecosystems including rivers lakes reservoirs and groundwater can be large transport pathways for carbon and other dissolved organic materials playing an important role in the global biogeochemical cycle aufdenkampe et al 2011 battin et al 2009 cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 tranvik et al 2009 yang et al 2015 yang et al 2011 yang et al 2008 some researchers have explored the carbon cycle and greenhouse gas emissions from large hydropower reservoirs since rudd et al 1993 published a research on greenhouse gas emission from hydropower reservoirs this topic has attracted growing interest st louis et al 2000 found that reservoirs were an important source of greenhouse gases barros et al 2011 established a multiple regression model based on reservoir age latitude mean depth and dissolved organic carbon doc input to predict co2 and ch4 emissions they estimated the total co2 and ch4 emissions of 85 reservoirs accounting for 20 of the total global reservoir area to be 48 tg co2 c per year and 3 tg ch4 c per year tranvik et al 2009 found that co2 emissions from inland water reservoirs and lakes were close to that from ocean and organic carbon storage in global inland water sediments is even larger than that in seabed sediments the study of 153 reservoirs and 310 lakes in china revealed annual mean total emissions were 25 2 tg co2 c and 1 56 tg ch4 c li et al 2018 their results showed that china s reservoirs and lakes contribute disproportionately large proportions to national and global greenhouse gas emissions scholars have suggested that the greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs are affected by climate morales pineda et al 2014 geographical location kumar et al 2019 nakayam and pelletier 2018 water environment saidi and koschorreck 2017 structure and operation of the reservoir deemer et al 2016 kim et al 2016 ometto et al 2013 and other conditions zhang et al 2021 therefore there are spatiotemporal variations in greenhouse gas emissions between different regions and even inside the reservoir yang et al 2020a yang et al 2020b given the large spatiotemporal variations in carbon emission from reservoirs high spatial and temporal resolution data are urgently needed to minimize uncertainty while they require a large amount of sampling and measurement along with financial support and manpower furthermore it is very difficult to access some hydropower reservoirs located in deep valley and steep cliff for example in southwest china therefore numerical models have received increasing attention in the studies on carbon cycle and greenhouse gas emissions in reservoirs in the last several years some models have been explored and applied in the research of carbon cycle in reservoirs deft 3d model has been explored to evaluate the impact of water quality on co2 emissions in a subtropical reservoir southeast china the results indicated 32 of the carbon in the water could be removed by means of co2 emission and sediment burial chen et al 2019 nice bgc model was performed in 82 large reservoirs and the results showed that co2 diffusion in the water column 76 6 tg carbon per year was larger than the carbon deposition in sediment 45 0 tg carbon per year nakayam and pelletier 2018 a coupled model elcom and caedym was applied in a hydropower reservoir in the tropical amazon rainforest area and drew a conclusion of about 1 1 tg total co2 emission in 2013 with no marked difference in average co2 emission flux between winter 1395 mgc m 2 d 1 and summer 1338 mgc m 2 d 1 curtarelli et al 2016 a one day time step biogeochemical model faq dndc was operated in a reservoir located in the north part of quebec canada and the results indicated that co2 emission was very high at the beginning of the impoundment fell sharply after 3 10 years decreased gradually to about 115 gc m 2 yr 1 and then kept a steady value afterwards wang et al 2018b after damming the stratification of water temperature and other water chemistry parameters widely exists in reservoirs especially in summer duka et al 2021 yu et al 2014 and these will affect the carbon biogeochemical cycle in addition the released water from reservoir has important environmental effects on the downstream water nilsson et al 2005 zhou et al 2020 several studies have shown that the disturbance of water flow has a marked effect on the co2 emission from the reservoir butman and raymond 2011 wallin et al 2011 wang et al 2017 the internal disturbance caused by the discharge at different elevations of dam will change both organic carbon and inorganic carbon in the reservoir wang et al 2017 some studies applied water quality hydrodynamic model to simulate the influence of reservoir withdrawal scenarios on downstream water temperature and water quality bartholow et al 2001 caliskan and elci 2009 weber et al 2017 based on these studies the disturbance of changing water discharge elevation is important for co2 emission from reservoirs particularly from cascade reservoirs in southwest china where near two thirds of the country s hydroelectric resources are located liu and han 2021 su et al 2005 however few studies have analyzed the influence of the water discharge or withdrawal elevation changes on the carbon fluxes from reservoirs in the last decade water quality and hydrodynamic coupling models have developed rapidly providing a new way for studying carbon flux and co2 flux in reservoirs chen et al 2019 curtarelli et al 2016 in this study a water quality and hydrodynamic model ce qual w2 was calibrated and applied in wujiangdu hydropower reservoir in southwest china seven scenarios with different water discharge elevations were simulated to estimate the co2 flux across water air interface and carbon content in the discharged water the main aims of this study are to 1 test the validity of the model in the research on carbon flux in reservoir 2 estimate the spatiotemporal variation in co2 flux across water air interface and 3 estimate the influences of the water discharge elevation on carbon flux in reservoir 2 materials and methods 2 1

inflow w1 two main tributaries w2 and w6 reservoir areas w3 w4 w5 and w7 and the reservoir downstream w8 water samples from sites w1 w2 w6 and w7 were collected at 0 5 m from the water surface water samples from sampling sites w3 w4 w5 and w8 were collected at every 5 m vertically from water surface to bottom the sampling campaigns were conducted in january april june july august and october in

chlorophyll α chlα concentration in water 2 3 ce qual w2 model to simulate the two dimensional flow water temperature dynamic process and biogeochemical process in the reservoir ce qual w2 model was introduced into this study ce qual w2 model is composed of a tightly coupled hydrodynamics model and a water quality transport model which can be used for simulating the vertical two dimensional water flow and water quality situation cole and wells 2006 water quality computations are done after a hydrodynamic computation allowing for feedback between water quality and hydrodynamic variables based on the assumptions of homogeneity of the water bodies in the transverse direction ce qual w2 model has been used to simulate water quality and hydrodynamic processes in rivers lakes reservoirs estuaries and other water bodies noori et al 2015 torres et al 2016 see appendix a considering the total distance of 65 km from the inflow point w1 to the front of the dam w7 the whole reservoir area was vertically divided along the reservoir into 130 equally spaced segments and was horizontally divided into 76 layers evenly divided into a grid 500 meter long and 2 meter deep the width of each grid cell was the average distance from the left bank to the right bank of each grid cell after grid division the flow and water quality in each grid were regarded as homogeneous including the first and last section the first and last segments were virtual sections with length of 0 m 132 longitudinal segments were set along the reservoir area including top and bottom layers the top and bottom layers were virtual layers with height of 0 m 78 vertical layers were set from water surface to maximum depth of reservoir see appendix b field sampling and measurement provided data of water level water temperature water chemistry and algae the daily flow and water level data of the reservoir and tributaries from local river and reservoir management authorities and water quality data from field measurement were considered as the input for hydrodynamic and water quality modules due to the data limitations only two main inflow tributaries from north of the reservoir were included in the model together with the meteorological data including air temperature dewpoint temperature wind speed wind direction solar radiation and cloud cover obtained from the national meteorological data center of china https data cma cn the ce qual w2 version 4 1 was applied to simulate the hydrodynamic hydrochemistry and hydroecological processes of wujiangdu reservoir from january to october 2017 with a 10 minute step length to match the filed measurement the simulation period was from january to october 2017 in addition the chemical and biological processes in water were complex and a large number of model parameters changed with the variations in time and boundary conditions to ensure the simulation accuracy it is better to keep the simulation period consistent with field measurement period huang et al 2017 reckhow 1994 xu et al 2017 the simulations were conducted in the same period as field observation and the model acts as a data interpolation tool in this study by interpolation the model could output the flow velocity water level water temperature and water quality ph do chlα alk tic no3 n nh4 n tn po4 3 p and tp of each grid at any time the field measurement of water level and water temperature were used to validate the hydrodynamic module of ce qual w2 model the observation data from january to october in 2017 were used to calibrate the water quality module parameters three parameters were calculated to evaluate the performance of the model root mean square error rmsd relative root mean square error rre and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse smaller rmsd and rre values and larger nse values indicate better model performance in general when rre values are 30 and nse values are 0 the model performance is considered acceptable chen et al 2019 2 4 calculation of co2 partial pressure and flux the co2 diffusion fluxes across the water air interface used for calibration were calculated indirectly by using the following method co2 diffusion fluxes across the water air interface are mainly affected by two factors 1 the partial pressure difference p co2 between surface water and atmosphere 2 gas exchange coefficient which is affected by flow rate wind speed air temperature ph and other factors jonsson et al 2003 soumis et al 2008 theoretically dic in water is mainly composed of hco3 co3 2 h2co3 and co2 aq the concentration of each component in aqueous solution equilibrium is related to ph water temperature and ionic strength based on ph hco3 k h and the contents of main ions in water the indirect calculation method was used to calculate co2 partial pressure in this study telmer and veizer 1999 yao et al 2007 see appendix c 2 5 scenario setting the carbon in the reservoir goes downstream with water discharge for power generation indicating the carbon flux in the horizontal direction of the reservoir although some other factors might be involved to the best of our knowledge carbon in the released water is the dominant factor influencing the co2 flux in order to investigate the influence of different discharge elevations on co2 diffusion flux across the water air interface and carbon content in the discharged water seven scenarios were set in this research table 1 scenarios a b and c were set at 670 m 680 m and 690 m respectively to simulate the situations of decreasing water discharge elevation scenario d referred to the actual water discharge elevation 700 m in the current project operation scenarios e f and g were referred to the situations of increasing water discharge elevations which were 710 m 720 m and 730 m respectively same as filed sampling period the scenario simulation lasted from january to october 2017 with an interval of 10 min the vertical distributions of water temperature co2 tic and toc in front of the dam were further simulated to explore the influences of changing discharge elevations on carbon transportation and transformation in reservoir furthermore the vertical distribution of water temperature co2 tic and toc in front of the dam were simulated in three typical scenarios a d and g in summer august the season with the most obvious stratification in the reservoir the withdrawal module was applied to simulate the variations in hydrodynamic force and water composition in reservoir and downstream 3 results 3 1 model calibration with the field measurement the hydrodynamic modules including water balance and water level were calibrated in terms of water quality parameters water temperature do tic doc no3 n nh4 n tn po4 3 p tp and chlα were selected to calibrate and verify the module numerical range mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rre and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were calculated to testify the modules table 2 the simulated water level agreed well with the measured water level data the average simulated water level was 751 36 m slightly higher than the measured value 751 27 m the mae rmse and nes were 0 164 m 0 379 and 0 948 respectively water temperature is the most important factor to evaluate the model accuracy the simulated water temperature was largely consistent with the measured range the simulated mean value was 0 67 higher than the measured value the mae rmse ree and nes of water temperature were 0 906 1 31 7 07 and 0 912 respectively confirming that the model had obtained satisfactory results for the simulation of water temperature do is involved in almost all biological processes and chemical reactions in water and it is also an important index for the calibration of water quality module parameters the simulated values of do were basically consistent with the measured range the simulated mean value was 0 52 mg l 1 lower than the measured mean value the mae rmse rre and nes of do were 0 978 mg l 1 1 32 18 7 and 0 608 respectively indicating that the model simulated the distribution and variation of do in the water body with acceptable accuracy the co2 diffusion flux f co2 across the water air interface is the core index simulated by the model in this study the simulated f co2 values were generally consistent with the measured range the simulated mean value was 0 12 mmol m 2 d 1 higher than the measured mean value the mae rmse rre nes of f co2 were 2 94 mmol m 2 d 1 6 50 30 0 and 0 884 respectively suggesting that the model reached the accuracy requirements from the perspectives of the rre and nes as a whole the mean rre of all variables was 23 4 most rre were not larger than 30 with the exceptions of nh4 n tp and chlα nes of all variables were more than 0 and the mean nes was 0 67 3 2 spatiotemporal distribution of co2 there were substantial spatiotemporal variations in co2 diffusion fluxes across the water air interface fig 2 a four peaks occurred in january 17 85 mmol m 2 d 1 february 18 37 mmol m 2 d 1 april 20 18 mmol m 2 d 1 and october 16 26 mmol m 2 d 1 the mean daily co2 diffusion flux in the cold season january february and october was 7 62 mmol m 2 d 1 which was much higher than that in the warm season june july and august 1 86 mmol m 2 d 1 january april july and october were selected as the representative months of winter spring summer and autumn to draw the daily mean co2 diffusion fluxes in different seasons fig 2 b co2 diffusion flux showed obvious seasonal changes with the largest emissions in autumn followed by winter and spring and the smallest value in summer during the simulation period the daily mean co2 diffusion flux across water air interface also showed obvious variation at different locations of the reservoir fig 2 c co2 diffusion fluxes increased from segment 2 2 74 mmol m 2 d 1 the upstream of reservoir to segment 54 5 42 mmol m 2 d 1 then decreased to segment 120 2 85 mmol m 2 d 1 and finally rose again gradually to segment 131 3 40 mmol m 2 d 1 near the dam in the meantime from upstream to downstream the average water flow decreased with some fluctuations fig 2 d correlation analysis indicated a significantly positive correlation between the co2 diffusion flux and water flow r 0 570 p 0 01 3 3 scenario simulations the simulated co2 emissions in different scenarios are shown in fig 3 there was no large difference between scenarios a b c and d however as for scenarios e f and g once the discharge elevations grew above 700 m the co2 diffusion fluxes increased dramatically with the increasing discharge elevations the simulated co2 diffusion fluxes in front of the dam in all scenarios were displayed in fig 4 a scenario d the actual engineering situation emitted the minimum diffusion flux 3 400 mmol m 2 d 1 when the water discharge elevations were below 700 m the co2 diffusion fluxes changed slightly 3 486 3 501 mmol m 2 d 1 when the water discharge elevations were above 700 m the co2 diffusion fluxes increased with the enhancing water discharge elevations with the increases of discharge elevation in 10 m 20 m and 30 m the co2 diffusion fluxes rose by 2 96 10 27 and 28 66 respectively three typical scenarios a d and g were taken to calculate the daily mean co2 diffusion fluxes in front of dam during the simulation period fig 4 b co2 diffusion fluxes in these three typical scenarios were largely the same from january to may while the obvious differences started from june in scenario d the maximum daily mean flux 11 26 mmol m 2 d 1 appeared in jday 52 while the minimum value 4 933 mmol m 2 d 1 occurred in jday 154 in scenario a with the water discharge elevation of 670 m the maximum daily mean flux 13 59 mmol m 2 d 1 appeared in jday 185 and the minimum 5 584 mmol m 2 d 1 value occurred in jday 154 in scenario g with the water discharge elevation of 730 m the maximum daily mean flux 19 08 mmol m 2 d 1 appeared in jday 171 while the minimum 4 691 mmol m 2 d 1 value occurred in jday 154 different from scenario d in scenario g the peak values of co2 flux increased markedly from may to september and appeared early to evaluate the effect of water discharge elevations on co2 diffusion fluxes across air water interface of the reservoir the total co2 diffusion emissions in different scenarios were compared fig 4 c a similar pattern to co2 emissions in front of the dam was observed when the water discharge elevations were lower than 700 m the total co2 diffusion emissions were relatively stable varying between 1776 3 t and 1804 2 t when the discharge elevations increased by 10 m 20 m and 30 m the total diffusion emissions from the whole reservoir area rose by 4 94 15 79 and 39 31 respectively scenarios a d and g were selected to analyze the daily mean co2 diffusion flux across air water interface of reservoir fig 4 d from january to mid may the diffusion trends of co2 flux in the three scenarios were consistent since the rainy season jday greater than 130 the trends of co2 flux in the three scenarios started to differ compared with scenario d in scenario a co2 diffusion fluxes were similar with the exceptions of maximum and minimum values in scenario g co2 diffusion fluxes increased markedly particularly around jdays 160 210 and 250 to analyse the effect of water discharge elevations on the mass of carbon released from reservoir tic and toc of the discharged water and total mass of carbon released by the reservoir which included carbon diffused into the atmosphere co2 and carbon in released water tic and toc were analyzed fig 5 with the increasing water discharge elevations the tic content deceased markedly in the three typical scenarios scenarios a d and g tic contents decreased in the order scenario a 25 20 mgc l 1 scenario d 24 88 mgc l 1 scenario g 24 36 mgc l 1 when the water discharge elevations were lower than 700 m the concentrations of toc in released water decreased with the increase in water discharge elevations when the water discharge elevation increased to 700 m or higher the concentrations of toc in released water increased with the rising water discharge elevations the highest content of toc appeared in scenario a 1 674 mgc l 1 3 88 higher than the lowest content of toc in scenario d 1 611 mgc l 1 with the rising water discharge elevations the total mass of carbon released by the reservoir declined fig 5 c the largest amount of carbon released appeared in scenario a 4 036 105 t while the smallest amount of carbon released occurred in scenario g 3 905 105 t in terms of the composition of total mass of carbon released by the reservoir tic in the discharged water took an absolute majority 93 72 followed by toc in the discharged water 6 14 and co2 gas diffusing from the reservoir s surface 0 13 there were clear stratifications of water temperature in front of the dam fig 6 a the thermocline formed from water surface to 10 m depth where the water temperature decreased rapidly in addition the water temperature decreased dramatically in the bottom of the reservoir altitudes from 630 m to 610 m in shallow water surface 40 m co2 concentrations increased with the rising water discharge elevations at the bottom of the reservoir co2 concentrations decreased sharply nearly close to 0 in scenarios g fig 6 b the concentrations of toc and tic varied very much with the change of water depths in different scenarios fig 6 c and d time series of water temperature and vertical distribution of do also changed greatly which could help understand the variation in carbon flux from the reservoir fig 6 e and f 4 discussion 4 1 modelling of carbon flux in reservoirs carbon emission from aquatic ecosystems plays an important role in the global carbon cycle yang and flower 2012b yang et al 2020c however there are still quite few modelling studies on co2 in reservoirs he et al 2019a to the best of our knowledge this study made the first attempt to apply ce qual w2 model in the wujiangdu reservoir southwest china the statistical results confirmed the validity of the model table 2 the rre values of water temperature do tic doc no3 n tn and po4 3 p were all 30 7 07 24 8 and the nes values were larger than 0 0 139 0 912 co2 fluxes which were derived from the indirect calculation method based on temperature alk and ph were thought to be slightly overestimated hunt et al 2011 resulting in the relatively large error of f co2 rre 30 0 nes 0 884 the simulation errors of several parameters including nh4 n rre 41 9 nes 0 685 tp rre 39 5 nes 0 322 and chlα rre 31 8 nes 0 925 were relatively larger the model s homogeneity assumption and the limitations of sediment module lateral inflows and precipitation might cause the relatively large rres chen et al 2019 considering the overall accuracy of multi indicator simulation of the model mean rre 23 4 mean nes 0 67 and referring to published work rre 23 63 nes 0 11 chen et al 2019 nes 0 79 0 69 nakayam and pelletier 2018 the performance of the model was considered acceptable in the current study compared with other reservoirs in china the simulated co2 emissions across the water air interface from wujiangdu reservoir is relatively smaller table 3 this is probably due to shorter water retention time in wujiangdu reservoir wang et al 2017 4 2 spatiotemporal variation in co2 in reservoirs previous studies showed that the greenhouse gas fluxes varied between different areas and seasons due to the influence of meteorological hydrodynamic and ecological factors carpenter et al 2001 curtarelli et al 2016 li et al 2020 pacheco et al 2015 roland et al 2010 in the cold season from january to march and october the decomposition of algal debris in the reservoir and the lack of photosynthesis were the main reason for the large greenhouse gas emission from reservoir to air when the rainy season started from may to june a large amount of organic matter and nutrients were brought from the basin to water causing rising co2 emission from the reservoir in summer july and august higher water temperature and stronger sunshine promoted photosynthesis and algae growth with the consequence of co2 absorption and oxygen release carpenter et al 2001 in this period the daily mean co2 emission flux dropped down to the lowest value during the study period due to large variation in daily weather especially wind speed inflow water temperature and reservoir carbon storage co2 flux fluctuated with large peaks and valleys despite the large fluctuation the results are comparable with published results chen 2019 li 2018 peng et al 2013 wang et al 2018a the flow status can also complicate the spatiotemporal variation in co2 flux strong flow disturbance and large water flow can accelerate co2 release from water to air butman and raymond 2011 wallin et al 2011 wang et al 2017 the increasing co2 fluxes from segment 2 to segment 54 in longitudinal space was accompanied by the gradual decrease of inflow water flow fig 2 c and 2 d segment 32 was the confluence of tributaries and the confluence of carbon and nutrients caused a sudden increase in co2 flux at the site data measured from the sampling site w2 behind segment 54 the water flow kept relatively stable due to the combination of deposition photosynthesis and mineralization the co2 flux gradually decreased in the longitudinal space in front of the dam however due to the disturbance of water releasing co2 flux increased slightly 4 3 the impact of water discharge elevation on carbon flux in reservoir the results of scenario simulations reveal that the change of discharge elevation profoundly affects the hydrodynamic pattern inside the reservoir disrupts the original vertical stratification of water temperature and material and changes the dynamic process of co2 flux in the reservoir both vertically and horizontally li 2015 the reservoir co2 flux grew with the rising water discharge elevations in wujiangdu reservoir fig 4 a and c when the water elevation reached a certain height the closer to the surface the larger co2 diffusion flux across the water air interface and the larger flux increment as for the time series fig 4 b and d from january to may the co2 fluxes of the three typical scenarios were similar indicating the little impact of discharge elevation on co2 emission in the first five months since june the rainy season with the increasing discharge and water discharge the effects of different discharge elevations appeared despite the rising temperature which was favorable for algae growth in the period higher water discharge elevation induced more surface disturbance in the reservoir mainly because of variation in retention time retention times of different scenarios were 31 2d 30 5d 30 3d 25 22 5d 21 3d and 18 1d respectively causing unfavorable condition for algal growth in that case co2 diffusion fluxes across the water air interface have been promoted liu et al 2019 long et al 2011 there were also differences in the time of storage the calculated concentrations of tic and toc in the released water fig 5 a and b showed that the lower tic concentrations were mainly from the shallow water discharge depth the lowest toc concentrations in released water appeared in water discharge elevations between 700 and 710 m in the total mass of carbon in the released water co2 only accounted for a small fraction 0 13 clearly the shallower discharge depth the larger vertical co2 emission flux fig 4 c the less horizontal amount of carbon released downstream which dominated the calculation of carbon flux in this case when less carbon was released more carbon was trapped in the reservoir fig 5 c increasing water elevation can raise the outflow position and reduce the disturbance to the deeper layer and this makes reservoirs similar to natural lakes with larger carbon sequestration in water li et al 2013 wen et al 2017 the investigation of water temperature in dam front showed that in the summer significant stratification period the higher water discharge elevation the lower water temperature in the reservoir indicating that more heat has been lost by the rise of water discharge positions fig 6 a he et al 2018 he et al 2019b yang et al 2013 furthermore the differences in discharge water temperature a d g supported this fig 6 e and fig e 2 in appendix according to the vertical distribution of co2 concentration in different scenarios fig 6 b the co2 concentration in surface water increased with the water discharge elevation which confirmed the previous findings of higher flux with shallower water discharge elevation fig 4 a and b co2 in water can migrate from the steady flow zone reservoir areas vertically away from the discharge positions to the violent flow disturbance zone reservoir areas vertically near the discharge positions which means co2 concentrations are much higher near the locations of water discharge in this case the co2 diffusion emission from water surface increased under the shallower water discharge situation approaching the bottom of the reservoir the co2 concentration showed a decreasing trend in all scenarios the vertical profiles of do varied between different scenarios indicating that water discharge affected o2 fig 6 f and there were varying oxidizing environments for co2 generation in deep water in scenario a do at deep layer was significantly higher than other scenarios in scenario g do in shallow layer was significantly lower than other scenarios the vertical distribution of tic was similar to that of co2 fig 6 c and 6 d for the transformation from inorganic carbon to organic carbon algae metabolism plays an important role especially in shallow water yang and flower 2012a the disturbance of water flow directly affects algae photosynthesis changing the content of tic and toc in the water for example in scenario a in the deepest water discharge location the water flow had little disturbance therefore the highest concentration of toc and the lowest concentration of tic appeared in the shallow water area of the reservoir as for scenario g high concentrations of tic and toc in shallow water were mainly due to the migration of carbon to the violent disturbance zone 4 4 limitation and future research similar to most modelling studies there are several limitations in this study this study has not yet included the sediment module tributary inflow and precipitation which might cause the calculation uncertainties of carbon flux in the reservoir the field sampling and measurement were conducted for ten months in the current study the number of measurement sites and frequency of field sampling can cause a certain level of uncertainty of the results in the future studies further improving the spatial and temporal resolution can improve the model accuracy and reduce the uncertainty of the results and long period field observation and data simulation can further improve our understanding of carbon flux variation in the entire year with the possibility to capture more temporal changes of co2 flux the co2 partial pressure was determined from the indirect calculation which was involved with ph alkalinity temperature ion strength and other important factors and the error of each factor might bring a certain level of uncertainty in the co2 partial pressure in the future high quality data are still needed to improve the accuracy of the partial pressure of co2 although the model has been widely used globally particularly in southwest china and the yangtze river basin he et al 2022 li et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 more localization of the model should be made to tailor it more suitable for the carbon research in southwest china with minimal uncertainty the addition of sediment module will enable the study to cover more greenhouse gases especially methane and more comprehensive inflow such as precipitation and slope concentration will complement the water and co2 inflow of the reservoir and further analyze the carbon source and sink in the reservoir including in the mid reservoir our research focused on co2 in water and across the water air interface while other greenhouse gases particularly methane and carbon cycle at the reservoir sediment can also be explored in future studies 5 conclusions to explore the carbon flux in reservoir a water quality hydrodynamic model ce qual w2 was calibrated and verified with field observation and applied to simulate the transportation and transformation of carbon in a river hydropower reservoir wujiangdu reservoir southwest of china the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 because of overall good accuracy of multi indicator simulation of the model mean rre 23 4 mean nes 0 67 ce qual w2 is considered as a valid module to research carbon flux in the reservoir 2 co2 diffusion flux across the air water interface showed a clear spatiotemporal heterogeneity temporally co2 emissions in the warm season were much smaller than that in the cold season spatially co2 flux had a marked variation along the reservoir which was positively correlated with water flow 3 higher discharge elevation enhanced co2 emissions from reservoir when water discharge elevations increased by 10 m 20 m and 30 m co2 diffusion flux increased by 4 94 15 79 and 39 31 respectively meanwhile higher discharge elevation reduced the carbon released downstream increasing discharge elevation by 30 m would reduce 1 85 of total carbon released although higher discharge elevation increased co2 emission across the water air interface it enhanced carbon sequestration in reservoir water therefore reservoir water discharge elevation needs to be properly controlled to cut carbon emissions and increase carbon sequestration credit authorship contribution statement xiaoling wu conceptualization methodology funding

2912,carbon emissions from aquatic ecosystems including reservoirs play an important role in the global carbon budget while the carbon cycle in reservoirs is still far from clearly understood in this study a vertical two dimensional quality hydrodynamic model ce qual w2 was established to simulate co2 fluxes and carbon transport in the wujiangdu reservoir in southwest china verified by field measurement in 2017 thanks to overall good accuracy of multi indicator simulation of the model mean rre 23 4 mean nes 0 67 ce qual w2 is considered as a valid module to simulate carbon flux in the reservoir based on the model the average co2 flux across the air water interface of the reservoir was 4 37 mmol m 2 d 1 temporally co2 fluxes in the cold season were higher than those in the warm season indicating the important effect of seasonal temperature change on co2 flux as well as the effect of other parameters such as do chla tn tp and ph spatially co2 emission fluxes were lower in the water inlet area of the reservoir 2 74 mmol m 2 d 1 and in front of the dam 3 40 mmol m 2 d 1 but higher in the middle part of the reservoir highest 5 42 mmol m 2 d 1 at segment 54 different discharge elevation scenarios were set up to model the influences of hydrodynamics on co2 emission fluxes when the water discharge elevation increased by 30 m co2 emission increased by 39 31 and discharged downstream carbon decreased by 1 90 compared with the actual working condition finally the total mass of carbon released by the reservoir the combination of carbon diffused into the atmosphere and carbon in released water decreased by 1 85 compared with the actual working condition when the water discharge elevation decreased by 30 m no obvious change of co2 emission happened but the total mass of carbon released by the reservoir increased by 1 44 this research confirmed the validity of ce qual w2 in simulating carbon flux in reservoirs our modelling results shed light on the influence of hydrodynamics on carbon emission in reservoirs and optimizing water discharge elevation can be helpful to mitigate carbon emission from reservoirs keywords reservoir carbon cycle co2 flux ce qual w2

yang et al 2011 yang et al 2008 some researchers have explored the carbon cycle and greenhouse gas emissions from large hydropower reservoirs since rudd et al 1993 published a research on greenhouse gas emission from hydropower reservoirs this topic has attracted growing interest st louis et al 2000 found that reservoirs were an important source of greenhouse gases barros et al 2011 established a multiple regression model based on reservoir age latitude mean depth and dissolved organic carbon doc input to predict co2 and ch4 emissions they estimated the total co2 and ch4 emissions of 85 reservoirs accounting for 20 of the total global reservoir area to be 48 tg co2 c per year and 3 tg ch4 c per year tranvik et al 2009 found that co2 emissions from inland water reservoirs and lakes were close to that from ocean and organic carbon storage in global inland water sediments is even larger than that in seabed sediments the study of 153 reservoirs and 310 lakes in china revealed annual mean total emissions were 25 2 tg co2 c and 1 56 tg ch4 c li et al 2018 their results showed that china s reservoirs and lakes contribute disproportionately large proportions to national and global greenhouse gas emissions scholars have suggested that the greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs are affected by climate morales pineda et al 2014 geographical location kumar et al 2019 nakayam and pelletier 2018 water environment saidi and koschorreck 2017 structure and operation of the reservoir deemer et al 2016 kim et al 2016 ometto et al 2013 and other conditions zhang et al 2021 therefore there are spatiotemporal variations in greenhouse gas emissions between different regions and even inside the reservoir yang et al 2020a yang et al 2020b given the large spatiotemporal variations in carbon emission from reservoirs high spatial and temporal resolution data are urgently needed to minimize uncertainty while they require a large amount of sampling and measurement along with financial support and manpower furthermore it is very difficult to access some hydropower reservoirs located in deep valley and steep cliff for example in southwest china therefore numerical models have received increasing attention in the studies on carbon cycle and greenhouse gas emissions in reservoirs in the last several years some models have been explored and applied in the research of carbon cycle in reservoirs deft 3d model has been explored to evaluate the impact of water quality on co2 emissions in a subtropical reservoir southeast china the results indicated 32 of the carbon in the water could be removed by means of co2 emission and sediment burial chen et al 2019 nice bgc model was performed in 82 large reservoirs and the results showed that co2 diffusion in the water column 76 6 tg carbon per year was larger than the carbon deposition in sediment 45 0 tg carbon per year nakayam and pelletier 2018 a coupled model elcom and caedym was applied in a hydropower reservoir in the tropical amazon rainforest area and drew a conclusion of about 1 1 tg total co2 emission in 2013 with no marked difference in average co2 emission flux between winter 1395 mgc m 2 d 1 and summer 1338 mgc m 2 d 1 curtarelli et al 2016 a one day time step biogeochemical model faq dndc was operated in a reservoir located in the north part of quebec canada and the results indicated that co2 emission was very high at the beginning of the impoundment fell sharply after 3 10 years decreased gradually to about 115 gc m 2 yr 1 and then kept a steady value afterwards wang et al 2018b after damming the stratification of water temperature and other water chemistry parameters widely exists in reservoirs especially in summer duka et al 2021 yu et al 2014 and these will affect the carbon biogeochemical cycle in addition the released water from reservoir has important environmental effects on the downstream water nilsson et al 2005 zhou et al 2020 several studies have shown that the disturbance of water flow has a marked effect on the co2 emission from the reservoir butman and raymond 2011 wallin et al 2011 wang et al 2017 the internal disturbance caused by the discharge at different elevations of dam will change both organic carbon and inorganic carbon in the reservoir wang et al 2017 some studies applied water quality hydrodynamic model to simulate the influence of reservoir withdrawal scenarios on downstream water temperature and water quality bartholow et al 2001 caliskan and elci 2009 weber et al 2017 based on these studies the disturbance of changing water discharge elevation is important for co2 emission from reservoirs particularly from cascade reservoirs in southwest china where near two thirds of the country s hydroelectric resources are located liu and han 2021 su et al 2005 however few studies have analyzed the influence of the water discharge or withdrawal elevation changes on the carbon fluxes from reservoirs in the last decade water quality and hydrodynamic coupling models have developed rapidly providing a new way for studying carbon flux and co2 flux in reservoirs chen et al 2019 curtarelli et al 2016 in this study a water quality and hydrodynamic model ce qual w2 was calibrated and applied in wujiangdu hydropower reservoir in southwest china seven scenarios with different water discharge elevations were simulated to estimate the co2 flux across water air interface and carbon content in the discharged water the main aims of this study are to 1 test the validity of the model in the research on carbon flux in reservoir 2 estimate the spatiotemporal variation in co2 flux across water air interface and 3 estimate the influences of the water discharge elevation on carbon flux in reservoir 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in wujiangdu reservoir with an area of 48 km2 one of the largest reservoirs in the mainstream of wujiang river yunnan guizhou plateau southwest china fig 1 affected

inflow w1 two main tributaries w2 and w6 reservoir areas w3 w4 w5 and w7 and the reservoir downstream w8 water samples from sites w1 w2 w6 and w7 were collected at 0 5 m from the water surface water samples from sampling sites w3 w4 w5 and w8 were collected at every 5 m vertically from water surface to bottom the sampling campaigns were conducted in january april june july august and october in 2017 an automated multiparameter profiler model ysi exo was used to measure water temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes and ion chromatography diones ics90 were used to determine total dissolved solids tds salinity dissolved organic carbon doc alkalinity alk nitrogen element in no3 form no3 n nitrogen element in no2 form no2 n

chlorophyll α chlα concentration in water 2 3 ce qual w2 model to simulate the two dimensional flow water temperature dynamic process and biogeochemical process in the reservoir ce qual w2 model was introduced into this study ce qual w2 model is composed of a tightly coupled hydrodynamics model and a water quality transport model which can be used for simulating the vertical two dimensional water flow and water quality situation cole and wells 2006 water quality computations are done after a hydrodynamic computation allowing for feedback between water quality and hydrodynamic variables based on the assumptions of homogeneity of the water bodies in the transverse direction ce qual w2 model has been used to simulate water quality and hydrodynamic processes in rivers lakes reservoirs estuaries and other water bodies noori et al 2015 torres et al 2016 see appendix a considering the total distance of 65 km from the inflow point w1 to the front of the dam w7 the whole reservoir area was vertically divided along the reservoir into 130 equally spaced segments and was horizontally divided into 76 layers evenly divided into a grid 500 meter long and 2 meter deep the width of each grid cell was the average distance from the left bank to the right bank of each grid cell after grid division the flow and water quality in each grid were regarded as homogeneous including the first and last section the first and last segments were virtual sections with length of 0 m 132 longitudinal segments were set along the reservoir area including top and bottom layers the top and bottom layers were virtual layers with height of 0 m 78 vertical layers were set from water surface to maximum depth of reservoir see appendix b field sampling and measurement provided data of water level water temperature water chemistry and algae the daily flow and water level data of the reservoir and tributaries from local river and reservoir management authorities and water quality data from field measurement were considered as the input for hydrodynamic and water quality modules due to the data limitations only two main inflow tributaries from north of the reservoir were included in the model together with the meteorological data including air temperature dewpoint temperature wind speed wind direction solar radiation and cloud cover obtained from the national meteorological data center of china https data cma cn the ce qual w2 version 4 1 was applied to simulate the hydrodynamic hydrochemistry and hydroecological processes of wujiangdu reservoir from january to october 2017 with a 10 minute step length to match the filed measurement the simulation period was from january to october 2017 in addition the chemical and biological processes in water were complex and a large number of model parameters changed with the variations in time and boundary conditions to ensure the simulation accuracy it is better to keep the simulation period consistent with field measurement period huang et al 2017 reckhow 1994 xu et al 2017 the simulations were conducted in the same period as field observation and the model acts as a data interpolation tool in this study by interpolation the model could output the flow velocity water level water temperature and water quality ph do chlα alk tic no3 n nh4 n tn po4 3 p and tp of each grid at any time the field measurement of water level and water temperature were used to validate the hydrodynamic module of ce qual w2 model the observation data from january to october in 2017 were used to calibrate the water quality module parameters three parameters were calculated to evaluate the performance of the model root mean square error rmsd relative root mean square error rre and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse smaller rmsd and rre values and larger nse values indicate better model performance in general when rre values are 30 and nse values are 0 the model performance is considered acceptable chen et al 2019 2 4 calculation of co2 partial pressure and flux the co2 diffusion fluxes across the water air interface used for calibration were calculated indirectly by using the following method co2 diffusion fluxes across the water air interface are mainly affected by two factors 1 the partial pressure difference p co2 between surface water and atmosphere 2 gas exchange coefficient which is affected by flow rate wind speed air temperature ph and other factors jonsson et al 2003 soumis et al 2008 theoretically dic in water is mainly composed of hco3 co3 2 h2co3 and co2 aq the concentration of each component in aqueous solution equilibrium is related to ph water temperature and ionic strength based on ph hco3 k h and the contents of main ions in water the indirect calculation method was used to calculate co2 partial pressure in this study telmer and veizer 1999 yao et al 2007 see appendix c 2 5 scenario setting the carbon in the reservoir goes downstream with water discharge for power generation indicating the carbon flux in the horizontal direction of the reservoir although some other factors might be involved to the best of our knowledge carbon in the released water is the dominant factor influencing the co2 flux in order to investigate the influence of different discharge elevations on co2 diffusion flux across the water air interface and carbon content in the discharged water seven scenarios were set in this research table 1 scenarios a b and c were set at 670 m 680 m and 690 m respectively to simulate the situations of decreasing water discharge elevation scenario d referred to the actual water discharge elevation 700 m in the current project operation scenarios e f and g were referred to the situations of increasing water discharge elevations which were 710 m 720 m and 730 m respectively same as filed sampling period the scenario simulation lasted from january to october 2017 with an interval of 10 min the vertical distributions of water temperature co2 tic and toc in front of the dam were further simulated to explore the influences of changing discharge elevations on carbon transportation and transformation in reservoir furthermore the vertical distribution of water temperature co2 tic and toc in front of the dam were simulated in three typical scenarios a d and g in summer august the season with the most obvious stratification in the reservoir the withdrawal module was applied to simulate the variations in hydrodynamic force and water composition in reservoir and downstream 3 results 3 1 model calibration with the field measurement the hydrodynamic modules including water balance and water level were calibrated in terms of water quality parameters water temperature do tic doc no3 n nh4 n tn po4 3 p tp and chlα were selected to calibrate and verify the module numerical range mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rre and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were calculated to testify the modules table 2 the simulated water level agreed well with the measured water level data the average simulated water level was 751 36 m slightly higher than the measured value 751 27 m the mae rmse and nes were 0 164 m 0 379 and 0 948 respectively water temperature is the most important factor to evaluate the model accuracy the simulated water temperature was largely consistent with the measured range the simulated mean value was 0 67 higher than the measured value the mae rmse ree and nes of water temperature were 0 906 1 31 7 07 and 0 912 respectively confirming that the model had obtained satisfactory results for the simulation of water temperature do is involved in almost all biological processes and chemical reactions in water and it is also an important index for the calibration of water quality module parameters the simulated values of do were basically consistent with the measured range the simulated mean value was 0 52 mg l 1 lower than the measured mean value the mae rmse rre and nes of do were 0 978 mg l 1 1 32 18 7 and 0 608 respectively indicating that the model simulated the distribution and variation of do in the water body with acceptable accuracy the co2 diffusion flux f co2 across the water air interface is the core index simulated by the model in this study the simulated f co2 values were generally consistent with the measured range the simulated mean value was 0 12 mmol m 2 d 1 higher than the measured mean value the mae rmse rre nes of f co2 were 2 94 mmol m 2 d 1 6 50 30 0 and 0 884 respectively suggesting that the model reached the accuracy requirements from the perspectives of the rre and nes as a whole the mean rre of all variables was 23 4 most rre were not larger than 30 with the exceptions of nh4 n tp and chlα nes of all variables were more than 0 and the mean nes was 0 67 3 2 spatiotemporal distribution of co2 there were substantial spatiotemporal variations in co2 diffusion fluxes across the water air interface fig 2 a four peaks occurred in january 17 85 mmol m 2 d 1 february 18 37 mmol m 2 d 1 april 20 18 mmol m 2 d 1 and october 16 26 mmol m 2 d 1 the mean daily co2 diffusion flux in the cold season january february and october was 7 62 mmol m 2 d 1 which was much higher than that in the warm season june july and august 1 86 mmol m 2 d 1 january april july and october were selected as the representative months of winter spring summer and autumn to draw the daily mean co2 diffusion fluxes in different seasons fig 2 b co2 diffusion flux showed obvious seasonal changes with the largest emissions in autumn followed by winter and spring and the smallest value in summer during the simulation period the daily mean co2 diffusion flux across water air interface also showed obvious variation at different locations of the reservoir fig 2 c co2 diffusion fluxes increased from segment 2 2 74 mmol m 2 d 1 the upstream of reservoir to segment 54 5 42 mmol m 2 d 1 then decreased to segment 120 2 85 mmol m 2 d 1 and finally rose again gradually to segment 131 3 40 mmol m 2 d 1 near the dam in the meantime from upstream to downstream the average water flow decreased with some fluctuations fig 2 d correlation analysis indicated a significantly positive correlation between the co2 diffusion flux and water flow r 0 570 p 0 01 3 3 scenario simulations the simulated co2 emissions in different scenarios are shown in fig 3 there was no large difference between scenarios a b c and d however as for scenarios e f and g once the discharge elevations grew above 700 m the co2 diffusion fluxes increased dramatically with the increasing discharge elevations the simulated co2 diffusion fluxes in front of the dam in all scenarios were displayed in fig 4 a scenario d the actual engineering situation emitted the minimum diffusion flux 3 400 mmol m 2 d 1 when the water discharge elevations were below 700 m the co2 diffusion fluxes changed slightly 3 486 3 501 mmol m 2 d 1 when the water discharge elevations were above 700 m the co2 diffusion fluxes increased with the enhancing water discharge elevations with the increases of discharge elevation in 10 m 20 m and 30 m the co2 diffusion fluxes rose by 2 96 10 27 and 28 66 respectively three typical scenarios a d and g were taken to calculate the daily mean co2 diffusion fluxes in front of dam during the simulation period fig 4 b co2 diffusion fluxes in these three typical scenarios were largely the same from january to may while the obvious differences started from june in scenario d the maximum daily mean flux 11 26 mmol m 2 d 1 appeared in jday 52 while the minimum value 4 933 mmol m 2 d 1 occurred in jday 154 in scenario a with the water discharge elevation of 670 m the maximum daily mean flux 13 59 mmol m 2 d 1 appeared in jday 185 and the minimum 5 584 mmol m 2 d 1 value occurred in jday 154 in scenario g with the water discharge elevation of 730 m the maximum daily mean flux 19 08 mmol m 2 d 1 appeared in jday 171 while the minimum 4 691 mmol m 2 d 1 value occurred in jday 154 different from scenario d in scenario g the peak values of co2 flux increased markedly from may to september and appeared early to evaluate the effect of water discharge elevations on co2 diffusion fluxes across air water interface of the reservoir the total co2 diffusion emissions in different scenarios were compared fig 4 c a similar pattern to co2 emissions in front of the dam was observed when the water discharge elevations were lower than 700 m the total co2 diffusion emissions were relatively stable varying between 1776 3 t and 1804 2 t when the discharge elevations increased by 10 m 20 m and 30 m the total diffusion emissions from the whole reservoir area rose by 4 94 15 79 and 39 31 respectively scenarios a d and g were selected to analyze the daily mean co2 diffusion flux across air water interface of reservoir fig 4 d from january to mid may the diffusion trends of co2 flux in the three scenarios were consistent since the rainy season jday greater than 130 the trends of co2 flux in the three scenarios started to differ compared with scenario d in scenario a co2 diffusion fluxes were similar with the exceptions of maximum and minimum values in scenario g co2 diffusion fluxes increased markedly particularly around jdays 160 210 and 250 to analyse the effect of water discharge elevations on the mass of carbon released from reservoir tic and toc of the discharged water and total mass of carbon released by the reservoir which included carbon diffused into the atmosphere co2 and carbon in released water tic and toc were analyzed fig 5 with the increasing water discharge elevations the tic content deceased markedly in the three typical scenarios scenarios a d and g tic contents decreased in the order scenario a 25 20 mgc l 1 scenario d 24 88 mgc l 1 scenario g 24 36 mgc l 1 when the water discharge elevations were lower than 700 m the concentrations of toc in released water decreased with the increase in water discharge elevations when the water discharge elevation increased to 700 m or higher the concentrations of toc in released water increased with the rising water discharge elevations the highest content of toc appeared in scenario a 1 674 mgc l 1 3 88 higher than the lowest content of toc in scenario d 1 611 mgc l 1 with the rising water discharge elevations the total mass of carbon released by the reservoir declined fig 5 c the largest amount of carbon released appeared in scenario a 4 036 105 t while the smallest amount of carbon released occurred in scenario g 3 905 105 t in terms of the composition of total mass of carbon released by the reservoir tic in the discharged water took an absolute majority 93 72 followed by toc in the discharged water 6 14 and co2 gas diffusing from the reservoir s surface 0 13 there were clear stratifications of water temperature in front of the dam fig 6 a the thermocline formed from water surface to 10 m depth where the water temperature decreased rapidly in addition the water temperature decreased dramatically in the bottom of the reservoir altitudes from 630 m to 610 m in shallow water surface 40 m co2 concentrations increased with the rising water discharge elevations at the bottom of the reservoir co2 concentrations decreased sharply nearly close to 0 in scenarios g fig 6 b the concentrations of toc and tic varied very much with the change of water depths in different scenarios fig 6 c and d time series of water temperature and vertical distribution of do also changed greatly which could help understand the variation in carbon flux from the reservoir fig 6 e and f 4 discussion 4 1 modelling of carbon flux in reservoirs carbon emission from aquatic ecosystems plays an important role in the global carbon cycle yang and flower 2012b yang et al 2020c however there are still quite few modelling studies on co2 in reservoirs he et al 2019a to the best of our knowledge this study made the first attempt to apply ce qual w2 model in the wujiangdu reservoir southwest china the statistical results confirmed the validity of the model table 2 the rre values of water temperature do tic doc no3 n tn and po4 3 p were all 30 7 07 24 8 and the nes values were larger than 0 0 139 0 912 co2 fluxes which were derived from the indirect calculation method based on temperature alk and ph were thought to be slightly overestimated hunt et al 2011 resulting in the relatively large error of f co2 rre 30 0 nes 0 884 the simulation errors of several parameters including nh4 n rre 41 9 nes 0 685 tp rre 39 5 nes 0 322 and chlα rre 31 8 nes 0 925 were relatively larger the model s homogeneity assumption and the limitations of sediment module lateral inflows and precipitation might cause the relatively large rres chen et al 2019 considering the overall accuracy of multi indicator simulation of the model mean rre 23 4 mean nes 0 67 and referring to published work rre 23 63 nes 0 11 chen et al 2019 nes 0 79 0 69 nakayam and pelletier 2018 the performance of the model was considered acceptable in the current study compared with other reservoirs in china the simulated co2 emissions across the water air interface from wujiangdu reservoir is relatively smaller table 3 this is probably due to shorter water retention time in wujiangdu reservoir wang et al 2017 4 2 spatiotemporal variation in co2 in reservoirs previous studies showed that the greenhouse gas fluxes varied between different areas and seasons due to the influence of meteorological hydrodynamic and ecological factors carpenter et al 2001 curtarelli et al 2016 li et al 2020 pacheco et al 2015 roland et al 2010 in the cold season from january to march and october the decomposition of algal debris in the reservoir and the lack of photosynthesis were the main reason for the large greenhouse gas emission from reservoir to air when the rainy season started from may to june a large amount of organic matter and nutrients were brought from the basin to water causing rising co2 emission from the reservoir in summer july and august higher water temperature and stronger sunshine promoted photosynthesis and algae growth with the consequence of co2 absorption and oxygen release carpenter et al 2001 in this period the daily mean co2 emission flux dropped down to the lowest value during the study period due to large variation in daily weather especially wind speed inflow water temperature and reservoir carbon storage co2 flux fluctuated with large peaks and valleys despite the large fluctuation the results are comparable with published results chen 2019 li 2018 peng et al 2013 wang et al 2018a the flow status can also complicate the spatiotemporal variation in co2 flux strong flow disturbance and large water flow can accelerate co2 release from water to air butman and raymond 2011 wallin et al 2011 wang et al 2017 the increasing co2 fluxes from segment 2 to segment 54 in longitudinal space was accompanied by the gradual decrease of inflow water flow fig 2 c and 2 d segment 32 was the confluence of tributaries and the confluence of carbon and nutrients caused a sudden increase in co2 flux at the site data measured from the sampling site w2 behind segment 54 the water flow kept relatively stable due to the combination of deposition photosynthesis and mineralization the co2 flux gradually decreased in the longitudinal space in front of the dam however due to the disturbance of water releasing co2 flux increased slightly 4 3 the impact of water discharge elevation on carbon flux in reservoir the results of scenario simulations reveal that the change of discharge elevation profoundly affects the hydrodynamic pattern inside the reservoir disrupts the original vertical stratification of water temperature and material and changes the dynamic process of co2 flux in the reservoir both vertically and horizontally li 2015 the reservoir co2 flux grew with the rising water discharge elevations in wujiangdu reservoir fig 4 a and c when the water elevation reached a certain height the closer to the surface the larger co2 diffusion flux across the water air interface and the larger flux increment as for the time series fig 4 b and d from january to may the co2 fluxes of the three typical scenarios were similar indicating the little impact of discharge elevation on co2 emission in the first five months since june the rainy season with the increasing discharge and water discharge the effects of different discharge elevations appeared despite the rising temperature which was favorable for algae growth in the period higher water discharge elevation induced more surface disturbance in the reservoir mainly because of variation in retention time retention times of different scenarios were 31 2d 30 5d 30 3d 25 22 5d 21 3d and 18 1d respectively causing unfavorable condition for algal growth in that case co2 diffusion fluxes across the water air interface have been promoted liu et al 2019 long et al 2011 there were also differences in the time of storage the calculated concentrations of tic and toc in the released water fig 5 a and b showed that the lower tic concentrations were mainly from the shallow water discharge depth the lowest toc concentrations in released water appeared in water discharge elevations between 700 and 710 m in the total mass of carbon in the released water co2 only accounted for a small fraction 0 13 clearly the shallower discharge depth the larger vertical co2 emission flux fig 4 c the less horizontal amount of carbon released downstream which dominated the calculation of carbon flux in this case when less carbon was released more carbon was trapped in the reservoir fig 5 c increasing water elevation can raise the outflow position and reduce the disturbance to the deeper layer and this makes reservoirs similar to natural lakes with larger carbon sequestration in water li et al 2013 wen et al 2017 the investigation of water temperature in dam front showed that in the summer significant stratification period the higher water discharge elevation the lower water temperature in the reservoir indicating that more heat has been lost by the rise of water discharge positions fig 6 a he et al 2018 he et al 2019b yang et al 2013 furthermore the differences in discharge water temperature a d g supported this fig 6 e and fig e 2 in appendix according to the vertical distribution of co2 concentration in different scenarios fig 6 b the co2 concentration in surface water increased with the water discharge elevation which confirmed the previous findings of higher flux with shallower water discharge elevation fig 4 a and b co2 in water can migrate from the steady flow zone reservoir areas vertically away from the discharge positions to the violent flow disturbance zone reservoir areas vertically near the discharge positions which means co2 concentrations are much higher near the locations of water discharge in this case the co2 diffusion emission from water surface increased under the shallower water discharge situation approaching the bottom of the reservoir the co2 concentration showed a decreasing trend in all scenarios the vertical profiles of do varied between different scenarios indicating that water discharge affected o2 fig 6 f and there were varying oxidizing environments for co2 generation in deep water in scenario a do at deep layer was significantly higher than other scenarios in scenario g do in shallow layer was significantly lower than other scenarios the vertical distribution of tic was similar to that of co2 fig 6 c and 6 d for the transformation from inorganic carbon to organic carbon algae metabolism plays an important role especially in shallow water yang and flower 2012a the disturbance of water flow directly affects algae photosynthesis changing the content of tic and toc in the water for example in scenario a in the deepest water discharge location the water flow had little disturbance therefore the highest concentration of toc and the lowest concentration of tic appeared in the shallow water area of the reservoir as for scenario g high concentrations of tic and toc in shallow water were mainly due to the migration of carbon to the violent disturbance zone 4 4 limitation and future research similar to most modelling studies there are several limitations in this study this study has not yet included the sediment module tributary inflow and precipitation which might cause the calculation uncertainties of carbon flux in the reservoir the field sampling and measurement were conducted for ten months in the current study the number of measurement sites and frequency of field sampling can cause a certain level of uncertainty of the results in the future studies further improving the spatial and temporal resolution can improve the model accuracy and reduce the uncertainty of the results and long period field observation and data simulation can further improve our understanding of carbon flux variation in the entire year with the possibility to capture more temporal changes of co2 flux the co2 partial pressure was determined from the indirect calculation which was involved with ph alkalinity temperature ion strength and other important factors and the error of each factor might bring a certain level of uncertainty in the co2 partial pressure in the future high quality data are still needed to improve the accuracy of the partial pressure of co2 although the model has been widely used globally particularly in southwest china and the yangtze river basin he et al 2022 li et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 more localization of the model should be made to tailor it more suitable for the carbon research in southwest china with minimal uncertainty the addition of sediment module will enable the study to cover more greenhouse gases especially methane and more comprehensive inflow such as precipitation and slope concentration will complement the water and co2 inflow of the reservoir and further analyze the carbon source and sink in the reservoir including in the mid reservoir our research focused on co2 in water and across the water air interface while other greenhouse gases particularly methane and carbon cycle at the reservoir sediment can also be explored in future studies 5 conclusions to explore the carbon flux in reservoir a water quality hydrodynamic model ce qual w2 was calibrated and verified with field observation and applied to simulate the transportation and transformation of carbon in a river hydropower reservoir wujiangdu reservoir southwest of china the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 because of overall good accuracy of multi indicator simulation of the model mean rre 23 4 mean nes 0 67 ce qual w2 is considered as a valid module to research carbon flux in the reservoir 2 co2 diffusion flux across the air water interface showed a clear spatiotemporal heterogeneity temporally co2 emissions in the warm season were much smaller than that in the cold season spatially co2 flux had a marked variation along the reservoir which was positively correlated with water flow 3 higher discharge elevation enhanced co2 emissions from reservoir when water discharge elevations increased by 10 m 20 m and 30 m co2 diffusion flux increased by 4 94 15 79 and 39 31 respectively meanwhile higher discharge elevation reduced the carbon released downstream increasing discharge elevation by 30 m would reduce 1 85 of total carbon released although higher discharge elevation increased co2 emission across the water air interface it enhanced carbon sequestration in reservoir water therefore reservoir water discharge elevation needs to be properly controlled to cut carbon emissions and increase carbon sequestration credit authorship contribution statement xiaoling wu conceptualization methodology funding

2913,there has been an increase in the intensity of rainfall extreme events these events have a high contribution to hazards in urban areas such as flash flooding and landslides which lead to social economic and environmental damage sub hourly rainfall information has a critical role in the assessment of such natural disasters however precipitation gauge networks in developing countries still lack high quality data this study presents a new automatic quality control procedure a qcp for sub hourly rainfall data in brazil analysing 7 years 2014 2020 of tipping bucket rain gauge tbrg data from over 3 000 gauges per year provided by cemaden s brazilian national centre for monitoring and early warnings of natural disasters rain gauge network as a case study the a qcp developed separately examines each year through a series of single gauge tests in which each station was considered independently going through procedures to assess possible equipment malfunctions through data analysis like long rainless periods or with constant tips due to clogging spurious rainfall peaks and long periods of missing data then nearest neighbour analysis was performed through spatial outlier detection using local moran s index the performance of the method was evaluated through a confusion matrix which compared the procedures results with a reference dataset created using visual and independent analyses after the application of the proposed a qcp to the whole database the results show that the procedure was able to correctly identify 78 6 of faulty rain gauges for the whole period with less than 8 of functioning rain gauges removed from the final high quality database it was also noted that the best performing filters were the first ones applied showing that the procedure works best on the identification of gross errors with diminished efficiency in finding malfunctions after the sequential removal of poor quality rain gauges abbreviations tbrg tipping bucket

quality control rainfall event spatial outlier sub hourly rainfall data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction changes in both the magnitude and variability of rainfall have been reported in different regions of the world due to global warming induced by climate change ipcc 2013 panthou et al 2018 alterations in extreme precipitation events and consequent increases to the intensity and frequency of hazards triggered by them have resulted in damage to infrastructure lives homes and ecosystems lewis et al 2019 lee et al 2021 the brazilian atlas of natural disasters ceped ufsc 2013 provides information on the records of the incidence of such hazards in brazil from 1990 to 2012 the statistics presented in the document show that the deadliest disasters are indeed those associated with high intensity rainfall events e g flash floods occurring within minutes or a few hours of excessive rainfall which were responsible for 58 of deaths in brazil in the study period the assessment of precipitation data plays an important role for water resources management flood forecasting and operational warning decision making systems because rainfall is one of the key climatic variables affecting both spatial and temporal patterns of water availability weldegerima et al 2018 liu et al 2018 debbage shepherd 2019 tiwari et al 2020 in brazil most of the studies to evaluate the impact caused by extreme events have been carried out using daily rainfall data due to the lack of sub daily rainfall data e g loureiro et al 2014 sena 2016 cardoso et al 2020 however even though the daily resolution is still widely used to study rainfall it is not suitable for assessing changes in extreme events as most are shorter than 24hr barbero et al 2019 additionally sub daily rainfall data provides better model performances over daily scales for flood simulations since the peak inundation value is more sensitive to the temporal resolution of the storm input bruni et al 2015 huang et al 2019 hou et al 2020 and data at higher resolution e g hourly scale possesses different statistical characteristics and patterns of spatiotemporal variability compared with daily aggregations trenberth zhang 2018 however although the number of worldwide studies analysing hourly or sub hourly extreme rainfall events has been increasing over the past years in brazil we still struggle with a general lack of adequate high resolution rainfall time series over longer periods as highlighted in several previous studies e g lewis et al 2018 2019 2021 barbero et al 2019 li et al 2020 bonaccorso et al 2020 haacke paton 2021 fowler et al 2021 the collection of sub daily precipitation data through rain gauges is mostly an automatic process which makes it difficult to identify instrument defects and changes in the environment therefore rainfall records can contain anomalously high and low values as well as missing data robertson 2015 tipping bucket rain gauges tbrg the most popular and widespread type of rain gauge employed worldwide molini et al 2005 liu et al 2018 also suffer from mechanical and electrical problems that may occasionally cause failures to tip during an event incorrect data provided by the malfunctioning of equipment end up passing unnoticed in the raw dataset and flawed rainfall observations used in applications such as calibration of hydrological models can lead to poor out of sample model simulations that consequently contribute to poor streamflow forecasts robertson 2015 liu et al 2018 therefore some procedures to identify those uncertainties controlling the quality of the data are indispensable green et al 2012 qi et al 2016 quality control procedures qcp are designed to exclude inaccurate measurements vos et al 2019 and although they are a necessity and a responsibility of meteorological services that store distribute and use these data llabrés brustenga et al 2019 to date only a few approaches for rainfall data quality assessment and control are available these procedures may vary according to different aspects of the records and can consist of i comparisons with auxiliary data including radar images satellite images and synoptic maps e g qi et al 2016 afonso et al 2020 ii pre set dynamic thresholds to exclude unlikely values e g jørgensen et al 1998 estévez et al 2011 lewis et al 2018 or iii internal consistency between neighbouring stations and or in time green et al 2011 wijngaard et al 2003 chen li 2016 serrano notivoli et al 2017 while many advances have been made in automatic quality control procedures a qcp for large daily datasets of climate observations existing procedures are difficult to apply to sub daily rainfall records lewis et al 2021 in brazil most rainfall procedures for quality assessment have been carried out on a basin or regional scale to provide quality controlled data to a specific aim for instance medium to large scale basins have relatively recently been treated to hydrological procedures in brazil sugahara et al 2012 silva and reboita 2014 delahaye et al 2015 murara et al 2019 besides these studies also focus on daily rather than sub daily data as reported in most international scientific publications e g hamada et al 2011 green et al 2012 serrano notivoli et al 2017 llabrés brustenga et al 2019 in the past years global databases of quality controlled rainfall derived from research papers have indicated a lack of knowledge of qcp and data availability on a sub hourly basis in brazil e g blenkinsop et al 2018 lewis et al 2018 morbidelli et al 2020 however after 2011 due to a major landslide that occurred in rio de janeiro netto et al 2013 causing more than 30 000 people to lose housing and over 900 human life losses the brazilian national centre for monitoring and early warnings of natural disasters cemaden was created by the brazilian government horita et al 2017 thereafter a continuous rainfall monitoring network was established in 2013 to support its natural disasters risk management in over 500 different risk areas in brazil with over 1500 rain gauges installed in 2014 the network is the largest high temporal resolution rainfall monitoring network installed in south america freitas et al 2020 made up of a tbrg system with sub hourly rainfall records albeit that these data have not yet undergone any quality control procedure most of the existing procedures for quality control found in the literature on sub hourly or even sub daily rainfall data rely on some previously quality controlled database for instance blenkinsop et al 2017 assembled a qcp using data from three sources of which two had already undergone quality assessment additionally some procedures lack important steps such as multiple rain gauge tests which compare gauges with neighbours offering further advantages compared to single gauge tests blenkinsop et al 2017 this approach was implemented by lewis et al 2018 however their checks varied along with the seasonality specificities of the study area and the clear differentiation between seasons which makes the replication of the methodology difficult for regions with different characteristics finally papers built on complex methodologies such as lewis et al 2021 which had 25 time series checks to flag suspicious data using 5 calculated climate indices based on quality controlled daily precipitation and several thresholds based on percentile values are difficult to be replicated in countries with data scarcity or constantly changing datasets like brazil the cemaden network for example continues to increase the number of stations yearly with new stations installed every year and old or faulty ones deactivated therefore a simpler independent procedure is still required to ensure the quality of these rain gauges for further use and maintenance issues this paper proposes a new simple and customisable a qcp for sub hourly rainfall data considering as a reference the cemaden network in brazil with automatic detection of measurement errors and equipment malfunctions in tbrg unlike the aforementioned procedures the proposed methodology does not need any supplementary quality controlled database this is the first a qcp applied on a bigger scale in south america which can be easily replicable to other countries of this region compared to the previous qcp available in the literature additionally this study also presents the first brazilian quality controlled reference dataset built on a visual inspection of the cemaden rainfall data using a seven year period 2014 2020 this paper is organised as follows section 2 outlines the study area the sub hourly database and the built reference dataset section 3 describes the methodology developed to apply the a qcp divided into a single gauge tests with threshold values that can be adapted according to the user requirements and b spatial outlier detection using local indicators of autocorrelation with calculated rainfall properties 1 1 the use of such properties represents to the author s knowledge an innovative approach since the neighbouring checks are usually performed considering only the accumulated rainfall totals as input the use of such properties represents to the author s knowledge an innovative approach since the neighbouring checks are usually performed considering only the accumulated rainfall totals section 4 assesses the methodology validation performed through a confusion matrix and sections 5 and 6 present the results of the manual and automatic operations and the summary and concluding remarks of the study respectively 2 data 2 1 study area this study was carried out for the whole of brazil the largest country in south america with an area of approximately 8 5 m km2 between the coordinates 5 16 n 33 45 s and 34 47 w 73 59 w the brazilian territory comprises twelve köppen s climate types with a wide range of weather conditions alvares et al 2014 as shown in fig 1 a for instance the rainfall is very heterogeneous presenting an annual depth of less than 400 mm in the dry zone bsh located on the inland area of the brazilian northeast and values higher than 3 000 mm in the tropical zone af more specifically in the northeastern portion of the amazon rainforest alvares et al 2014 the distribution of annual rainfall is illustrated in fig 1 b another important feature of rainfall is the long term monthly average rainfall distribution according to reboita et al 2010 the rainfall behaviour in brazil can be clustered into five groups most rainfall regimes present precipitation maxima in the summer and minima in the winter seasons with some exceptions for instance in the south of brazil close to paraguay the monthly rainfall is almost homogeneous throughout the year also in the further north region and the northeast coast area the highest precipitation indices happen in the first semester of the year the brazilian topography is also very heterogeneous as can be seen in fig 1 c with elevations ranging from sea level to almost 3 000 m at the neblina peak in the north of brazil the elevation has a high orographic influence on the geographic distribution of rainfall cândido and nunes 2008 found significant heterogeneity in the rainfall totals of the mantiqueira mountains which reached in the summer gradients of over 150 mm when compared to areas with equivalent latitudes but contrasting altitudes similarly in são paulo the topographic effect is accentuated in mountainous areas such as the serra do mar serra dos agudos and serra do botucatu where pluviometric indices tend to be higher compared with more flat areas prado et al 2006 2 2 sub hourly rainfall database a sub hourly rainfall dataset for the period 1 january 2014 31 december 2020 obtained from the cemaden rainfall monitoring network was used in this study with a total of 22 777 annual time series obtained from an average of 3 000 stations per year from 1 897 in 2014 up to 3 832 in 2018 the total number of rain gauges varies every year due to the installation of new stations and the deactivation of older and flawed tbrg during the studied period currently the network has over 3 500 rain gauges distributed throughout most of the national territory the temporal resolution of the sub hourly rainfall data monitored by cemaden is available at a 10 min time step when it rains and 60 min over non rain periods i e zero values are stored the network is currently distributed throughout nearly all the national territory however most of the gauges are located in large and medium sized cities since its main purpose is alerting against natural disasters triggered by rainfall which includes flooding flash floods debris flows and landslides the distribution of the rain gauges used in this study for the first year of implementation of the cemaden s network 2014 is illustrated in fig 1 d and their distribution for the last year of the study period 2020 is illustrated in fig 1 e it is noticeable that most of the rainfall stations are in the most populated areas especially in the southeast region and along the brazilian coast these areas are usually associated with steep slopes surrounding large urban centres which are more prone to disasters large areas to the north of the country such as the amazon are sparsely populated and not well covered by the cemaden network the world meteorological organization wmo 1996 recommends installing weather stations and rain gauges in open flat terrain free of any obstruction at least 10 times the height of the instrument to ensure proper wind flow which might affect measurements the cemaden network was conceived to monitor landslides and flash floods that take place in urban settlements in unstable steep slope areas to allow monitoring of local rainfall conditions many of those rain gauges are installed on public building rooftops of occupied areas conventional weather stations on the other hand are usually located in downtown valley areas in short grass open locations where rainfall rates are much lower the in situ rainfall monitoring network operated by cemaden although still somewhat unevenly distributed throughout the country is expanding year by year and represents an advance for understanding sub daily rainfall extremes in tropical regions 2 3 reference dataset the quality control procedures despite being quasi automated in some instances still rely heavily on a final manual inspection or a previous manual identification of errors as model training lewis et al 2018 moreover the manual inspection serves as a resource for creating a reference dataset in the absence of other independent high quality data sources blenkinsop et al 2017 in this study the reference database consisted of the same cemaden tbrg used for the automatic qcp but assembled through a reference visual inspection ref vi following the procedures described below first a computational routine selected only rain gauges with less than 60 days of missing data in the annual series during each calendar year considered in this study subsequently the total monthly rainfall data and the sub hourly records were analysed on a spreadsheet along with its 5 nearest stations this first process resulted in two lists of rainfall gauges obtained by visual inspection 1 high quality hq rain gauges and 2 poor quality pq rain gauges and their main inconsistencies the main disparities of the pq rain gauges in relation to their surroundings were 1 long periods with null values while the rain gauges nearby are recording rainfall 2 a sudden peak too high to happen under 10 min higher than previous records the measurements of the neighbouring gauges or the rainfall regime set at 40 mm and 3 constant rainfall records with 0 2 mm for a long period probably indicating gauge clogging while the neighbouring tbrgs present more heterogeneous records for high temporal resolutions e g 10 min the correlation between gauges has a significant decrease over long interstation distances van leth et al 2021 1 with the correlation coefficient r decreasing to about 0 16 when the gauges are further than 25 km apart sinclair pegram 2005 thus neighbouring stations distant more than 50 km from the analysed tbrg with large differences of altitude between them were discarded from this comparison after the visual inspection of the dataset the records for every year were analysed by two different researchers as a sort of double blind experiment to avoid biased results afterwards a third check was performed to identify and solve disagreements between the results this allowed the identification of systematic errors such as missing values or a long rainless period in this third check the records of the possibly faulty gauge were compared with a close by gauge from another reliable rainfall monitoring network from the national water agency state water agencies and the national institute of meteorology however since there was still no other sub hourly dataset freely available in brazil at the time the analysis was performed with daily and monthly records of these reference stations which had to be within at least the same city as the analysed gauge from cemaden after all the checks have been performed we created a unique list of hq and pq gauges to be used as a reference dataset for the methodology validation of the automatic quality control procedure left side of fig 2 3 methods 3 1 automatic quality control procedures a series of procedures were used to automatically quality control a qcp the cemaden sub hourly rainfall data based on the rain gauges measurements and neighbouring gauge behaviour without the need of any quality controlled reference database which is an important feature due to the lack of such a type of reference data in some regions such as brazil fig 2 shows a flowchart illustrating the steps of the a qcp as well as the validation used in this study the a qcp is presented in a darker shade of blue the ref vi is shown in a medium shade of blue previously described in section 2 3 and the methodology validation i e confusion matrix is exhibited in a light shade of blue all automatic procedures proposed in this study allow the user to customise the thresholds according to the application of the final quality controlled dataset the proposed a qcp consists of the following 2 stages described in detail below a single rain gauge tests considering each gauge s annual time series independently and b multiple rain gauge tests which compare each station with its neighbours using spatial analysis to identify measurement errors through spatial outlier detection 3 1 1 single gauge tests some kinds of error e g missing data zero rainfall etc may interfere with the statistical and spatial analysis to identify such errors single gauge tests were first performed to identify suspicious values before the next steps of the a qcp the possibly faulty gauges for a specific civil year were thereafter flagged and classified as poor quality and therefore excluded from further analysis i e in each step only the unflagged gauges from the previous step were analysed for the single gauge tests we first aggregated the sub hourly records in daily values so rain gauges with more than 60 days missing records in each calendar year were flagged and thus excluded from subsequent analyses then to the sub hourly records a moving window of 35 consecutive days was applied to analyse if the annual time series had only records of 0 2 mm during this pre defined period the rain gauge was considered faulty if the mean value of the records for this moving window varied from 0 201 to 0 199 and the standard deviation was less than 0 0001 the third step of the single gauge tests checked the sub hourly maximum records over the year and excluded for further analysis gauges in which a peak found in its annual time series exceeded the threshold of 40 mm in 10 min lastly a moving window was again used to check the 0 values over consecutive days in the daily records considering a threshold of 200 rainless days in a row the thresholds used in the single gauge tests were chosen based on the analysis of a confusion matrix along with the results from the ref vi these errors can appear on the sub hourly records as shown in fig 3 these thresholds were initially observed during the assembly of the reference dataset through visual inspection ref vi we have analysed the overall annual time series values for each filter number of days with a specific behaviour or a maximum value in 10 min to try and separate the pq gauges from the hq gauges through a threshold line thereafter all of the filters went through a confusion matrix analysis using the ref vi as a reference to adjust the thresholds in order to avoid the misclassification of hq gauges by examining the mean values for the false negatives absence of malfunction indication in each threshold thus picking the one with the least amount of misclassified high quality gauges yet maintaining a high value for accuracy the ratio of true correct predictions to the total number of accounts and recall the rate of correct predictions on the presence of indication of malfunction since the single gauge tests were performed only to minimize the errors in the spatial analysis not to remove a large number of functioning gauges 3 1 2 spatial analysis the spatial analysis was implemented for each calendar year separately with the application of the local moran s index a local spatial autocorrelation statistic that identifies local clusters or outliers anselin 1995 this analysis considered the rainfall events of the studied sub hourly database records as explained in detail in the next subitems of this section 3 1 3 definition of rainfall events and their properties rainfall is generally noted as single events or storms with beginning and end defined by rainless intervals of a nominated duration minimum inter event time mit carbone et al 2014 since rainfall event characteristics including depth and intensity are defined in relation to the length of the rain event their values are dependent upon the value of the adopted mit dunkerley 2008 in this study the rainfall events were delineated to be examined independently using the mit values of 1 6 and 24 h with a minimum rainfall depth of 5 mm per event ziegler et al 2006 considering these two criteria rainfall events were calculated for every analysed year then considering each event on every annual time series the following rainfall properties were computed yearly rainfall number of rainfall events per year and mean rainfall depth which were used as input to the spatial analysis 3 1 4 cluster and spatial outlier analysis the cluster and spatial outlier analysis was performed through the local moran s index moran s i a local indicator of spatial association lisa statistic based on spatial autocorrelation anselin 2010 the local moran s i has previously been used to investigate precipitation patterns e g narashid et al 2017 darand et al 2017 and can be expressed as anselin 1995 1 i i x i x s i 2 j w ij x j x where x i and x j are the values of variable x at location i and location j respectively x is the overall mean value of x combined population of x i and x j wij is the weights matrix for the adjacent spaces and s i 2 is the second moment variance of the distribution of these values in the data calculated with n as the number of observations through the equation 2 s i 2 j x j x 2 n 1 x 2 additionally the z score for the statistics of moran s i can be computed as abdulhafedh 2017 3 z i i e i v i where e i is the expected value of i and v i is the variance of i as shown in equation 4 4 v i e i 2 e 2 i a positive i i value indicates a spatial clustering of similar values surrounding the unit space i which can be high high hh or low low ll clusters a negative i i value indicates a spatial clustering of non similar values surrounding the unit i spatial outliers which can be high low hl or low high lh additionally when i i is close to zero it indicates randomness according to the chosen significance value thus the index classification is non significant du et al 2017 the moran s i was implemented only for the unflagged gauges in the previous steps moreover rain gauges presenting less than 200 mm of annual rainfall were not used in the analysis since this value was considered anomalous to the overall behaviour of rainfall in brazil the input variable x was each rainfall property calculated for the three mits and all of the studied period i e 7 years similar to the single gauge tests only the unflagged gauges of each moran s i analysis i e each combination of property and mit went through the next combination of property and mit the spatial weights matrix wij is defined as the formal expression of the structure of spatial dependence between observations anselin 1988 the columns with nonzero elements in a given row of this matrix indicate the relevant neighbours for the observation that corresponds to the row that is the elements of the gauge s neighbourhood anselin 1995 for this paper this relationship was based on each rain gauge s 5 nearest neighbours created through the k nearest neighbours algorithm knn and the moran s i was performed with a significance level of p 0 05 based on 999 permutations impact of permutation number has a neglectable influence on the results at the end of this analysis clustered hh and ll and non significant rain gauges were classified as hq due to the spatial clustering characteristics expected on the studied variables or the absence of proof of measurement errors furthermore the stations pointed as spatial outliers according to the chosen significance level were classified as pq rain gauges 3 2 model performance evaluation the performance of the proposed methodology was evaluated through a confusion matrix using the results of the a qcp and the reference dataset previously assembled i e the ref vi in the field of machine learning a confusion matrix is used for measuring the performance of classification algorithms the matrix is a special kind of contingency table with two dimensions actual and predicted and identical sets of classes in both dimensions stehman 1997 in binary classification the algorithm attempts to detect the presence of a relevant feature if it is detected the sample is labelled as positive and if otherwise negative suárez garcía et al 2020 the feature used in this paper is the presence of some kind of error that could indicate a faulty gauge therefore flagged gauges containing spurious behaviour are classified as positive by the algorithm the confusion matrix provides the following four outcomes in which the first two are correct predictions and the last two are errors 1 true positives where the model correctly predicts the positive class i e the pq rain gauge 2 true negatives where the model correctly predicts the negative class i e the hq rain gauge 3 false positives where the model incorrectly classifies a pq station as a functioning rain gauge based on the thresholds or the spatial analysis and 4 false negatives where the model incorrectly predicts the negative class i e the hq rain gauges however firstly the confusion matrix was used to calibrate the procedure of the single gauge tests i e to choose the best thresholds and afterwards to choose the best properties for identifying spatial outliers spatial analysis secondly this tool was used to verify the overall performance of the whole procedure and evaluate the final classification of the rain gauges the goal of the a qcp is to flag as many pq rain gauges as possible without incorrectly flagging hq stations therefore in order to evaluate the results and efficiency of the method after the computation of the number of gauges on each outcome classification three metrics regarding those values were calculated 1 precision to verify the number of false positives 2 accuracy to evaluate the ability of the method to correctly classify the rain gauge and 3 recall sensitivity to check if the method is correctly flagging a good amount of pq rain gauges 4 results and discussions 4 1 reference dataset built on visual inspection ref vi the tbrg problems were identified in the ref vi by observing the raw data of the rain gauges per year the analysed gauges have been previously submitted to the assessment of missing days which removed gauges with more than 60 days missing data from the visual inspection as they were automatically flagged as pq gauges table 1 presents the final number of hq and pq rain gauges identified from the ref vi and the number of gauges automatically flagged as pq after the application of the first a qcp i e stations with more than 60 days of missing data the percentage of hq gauges in relation to the total amount of rain gauges per year ranges from less than 20 in 2014 to almost 38 in 2020 despite showing improvements between the first and last analysed year the number of hq rain gauges did not present a linear growth since the classification involves many criteria besides the increase in the number of gauges each year on average 30 of the rain gauges were classified as hq in the ref vi the results show a high number of problematic rain gauges identified in the visual inspection since this is the first study regarding quality control of sub hourly rainfall data carried out and published in brazil there is still no reference number or indicator to compare with the presented results however it is noticeable that there is a high number of malfunctioning gauges an average of 68 6 per year thus agencies and meteorological services should be persuaded to improve the maintenance of these measuring devices to evaluate the quality of the monitoring network it is also important to note its distribution in both space and time since a well distributed consistent series of data is important for most hydrology related studies chen li 2016 schroeer et al 2018 thus the rain gauges were verified to assess their available years table 2 shows the number of hq gauges per monitoring period after the ref vi whose yearly distributions can be found in the supplementary material there is a notable decrease in the number of rain gauges with complete years of data available as the length of the time series increases for instance the number of rain gauges with only 1 year of data is more than 400 times the number of stations containing 7 years of data 4 2 automatic quality control procedures a qcp 4 2 1 single gauge tests the findings of the single gauge tests are shown in fig 4 where it is possible to observe a larger number of possibly faulty gauges identified from the first adopted procedures for instance the assessment of missing days flagged 1206 gauges as pq in 2014 which corresponds to 63 6 of the analysed gauges for that year during the following years this percentage tends to decrease flagging 50 1 i e 1634 gauges in 2015 and from 35 0 to 40 2 in the following years the higher number of pq gauges in the early years may have to do with the implementation of the network which was still at the beginning approximately 657 34 6 and 1360 42 2 rain gauges were considered unflagged in 2014 and 2015 respectively these two first years presented the highest number of faulty gauges in the series in the following five years the percentage of unflagged gauges was higher ranging from 1640 49 5 in 2016 to 1833 in 2020 51 9 this means that approximately half of the gauges met the conditions to be considered as hq gauges by the procedure in the analysed period this step of the methodology plays an important role in the whole procedure because if an hq gauge is surrounded by pq gauges the local moran s i may wrongly identify the hq gauge as an outlier 4 2 2 spatial analysis this procedure aimed to identify anomalous values and clusters using the local moran s i the number of spatial outliers according to the mit and rainfall properties for each year is shown in the heatmap presented on fig 5 a heatmap is a data matrix that enables visualizing values in the cells by the use of a colour gradient this gives a good overview of the largest and smallest values in the matrix rows and or columns of the matrix are often clustered so that users can interpret sets of rows or columns rather than individual ones metsalu vilo 2015 the number of rainfall events first chart used as input had found the majority of spatial outliers especially for the mit of 1440 min for instance 43 spatial outliers were found in 2020 and over 20 spatial outliers were found in most of the remaining years except for 2014 for the second analysis using the mean rainfall depth as input the mit of 60 min was more efficient finding up to 46 spatial outliers in 2020 and a mean of 20 spatial outliers in the remaining years in the last property used the yearly rainfall the first mit has found the highest rate of merely 11 spatial outliers for 2016 decreasing as the mit increases with no outliers found in 2015 2019 and 2020 for the mit of 1440 min this behaviour was most likely due to the sequential nature of removing pq gauges in each round of the analysis table 3 shows the number of hq and pq rain gauges obtained from the whole a qcp similar to the information of the ref vi presented in table 1 the percentage of hq gauges identified in relation to the total amount of rain gauges per year ranged from 31 2 2014 to more than 50 in 2019 and 2020 in comparison to the ref vi a higher number of gauges were pointed out as hq 4 3 confusion matrix fig 6 presents a graphical representation of the number of pq rain gauges classified by the a qcp and the rate of misclassified faulty stations for each step of the procedure the stacked bar charts show the correctly flagged data in red and the rate of misclassification or false negatives in orange since the procedure was sequentially adopted each filter analyses only the remaining gauges from the previous step and therefore the results shown are proportional to the number of gauges analysed in each step for the panel in 2014 the first 4 filters had an insignificant amount of misclassification however for the same year the rainfall events for 360 min had a misclassification rate of more than 60 showing a decrease in the efficiency of the filters for that year nonetheless this percentage stacked bar chart can lead to biased results for instance in 2018 the yearly rainfall for the mit of 60 min shows that 100 of the classified faulty gauges were false negatives which corresponds to merely 2 rain gauges among almost 4000 analysed that year the matrices presented in fig 7 show on average that the a qcp correctly predicted 93 9 of the hq rain gauges from the ref vi for all years for 2019 for instance the a qcp correctly predicted 95 9 of the hq gauges classified from ref vi misclassifying less than 5 of the gauges as pq on the a qcp proposed by lewis et al 2021 built on rule based quality checks the procedure had a mean true negative rate of 99 6 however regarding the removal of faulty stations their procedure had a false negative rate of 29 a higher misclassification rate than the a qcp proposed here which has misclassified 20 5 of the pq gauges similar results were found by llabrés brustenga et al 2019 with a qc proposed for catalonia on the automatic steps of the procedure it had a true positive rate of 83 a slightly higher value compared with this study s findings 79 5 however in the cited paper the rate of false positives reached up to 10 contrasting with 6 1 on this study s proposed a qcp the results obtained from fig 7 also show that the percentage of false negatives is smaller than the false negatives in all studied years this means that the proposed procedure is more focused on removing faulty rain gauges whilst being cautious not to wrongly flag functioning stations besides that no spatial patterns for misclassification were identified as can be seen in the supplementary material the annual scores calculated through the confusion matrix accuracy precision and recall for the entire a qcp are presented in table 4 the procedure presented a mean accuracy of 84 1 for all years while the values of precision ranged from 94 08 2020 to 98 58 2016 showing a very good rate on the identification of the positive class pq gauges with less than 6 of falsely flagged hq stations in the worst year for this metric 2020 lastly the recall score shows that the a qcp procedure correctly classified on average 92 30 of all the malfunctioning rain gauges with the best values identified for 2014 82 80 and 2016 82 53 5 conclusions in this study a pioneering automatic quality control procedure a qcp for sub hourly precipitation was presented for brazil the methodology is completely automatic without the need for a previously quality controlled reference database the automatic procedure improves the overall quality of the sub hourly database by flagging and removing possible faulty gauges using filters and spatial analysis a quality controlled reference database assembled through visual inspection ref vi was performed to understand the behaviour measurement errors from tipping bucket rain gauges tbrgs in sub hourly records providing insights about the types of filters that could be adopted to automatically identify the errors and serving as the reference dataset to be used for the validation of the proposed a qcp the best results regarding the correct classification of rain gauges as high quality through the a qcp were found in 2019 i e five years since the implementation of the network while the highest number of false negatives were identified in 2014 i e the first year of network implementation although presenting a higher number of false negatives 2014 exhibited one of the best results along with 2016 at correctly classifying actually faulty gauges i e true negatives a decrease in the efficiency of the filters was observed as the faulty rain gauges were removed from the analysis the best performing filter was the identification of the number of missing data days flagging more rain gauges with the lowest number of misclassifications conversely the least effective filter was the moran s index applied using the yearly rainfall as input which for instance presented a mean of 68 6 of false negatives for the first mit 60 min and found no spatial outliers for 2019 and 2020 when the last mit 1440 min was considered showing that after the removal of gross errors the spatial analysis has difficulty in finding subtler issues regarding the cluster and spatial outlier analysis using moran s index to identify problematic gauges the best results were for the input of the number of rainfall events and mean rainfall depth with different rates for the multiple minimum inter event time mit durations a smaller number of spatial outliers were identified using the yearly rainfall showing that the use of properties of the events delineated from different mit durations as inputs provided better results than the aggregation of rainfall which is more widely used to quality control rain gauges after the application of the proposed a qcp to the whole database the results show that 92 6 of the stations in the final high quality hq dataset are correctly indicated from the scores generated on the confusion matrix it was noticed that the procedure had flagged many poor quality pq gauges without removing too many hq gauges with the rate of false positives bigger than the false negatives this behaviour is preferable to the opposite since it is much easier to remove faulty rain gauges than to retrieve misclassified functioning stations in the single gauge tests the density of the network does not interfere with the performance of the methodology however on the spatial analysis which considers 5 nearest neighbours regions in which the rain gauges are more sparsely distributed the results are less reliable since the comparison occurs with gauges that can be too distant from each other therefore the spatial outlier identified may not reflect an error but simply a difference between afar stations based on our experience we recommend that the following adjustments are performed to improve the results of the a qcp in further studies 1 apply the single gauge tests and spatial analysis in smaller regions since more homogeneous average zones may aid the adjustments of thresholds and parameters 2 decrease the temporal scale to a monthly application rather than yearly analysis which may reduce the loss of data and increase the number of high quality rain gauges per period 3 reduce the strictness of the spatial analysis since the rain gauges identified as spatial outliers by the moran s i for any rainfall property or mit were automatically classified as poor quality therefore a possible linear combination of the best properties and mits can be further performed as an interesting next step to better identify the anomalous values credit authorship contribution statement marcela a meira conceptualization data curation methodology software formal

2913,there has been an increase in the intensity of rainfall extreme events these events have a high contribution to hazards in urban areas such as flash flooding and landslides which lead to social economic and environmental damage sub hourly rainfall information has a critical role in the assessment of such natural disasters however precipitation gauge networks in developing countries still lack high quality data this study presents a new automatic quality control procedure a qcp for sub hourly rainfall data in brazil analysing 7 years 2014 2020 of tipping bucket rain gauge tbrg data from over 3 000 gauges per year provided by cemaden s brazilian national centre for monitoring and early warnings of natural disasters rain gauge network as a case study the a qcp developed separately examines each year through a series of single gauge tests in which each station was considered independently going through procedures to assess possible equipment malfunctions through data analysis like long rainless periods or with constant tips due to clogging spurious rainfall peaks and long periods of missing data then nearest neighbour analysis was performed through spatial outlier detection using local moran s index the performance of the method was evaluated through a confusion matrix which compared the procedures results with a reference dataset created using visual and independent analyses after the application of the proposed a qcp to the whole database the results show that the procedure was able to correctly identify 78 6 of faulty rain gauges for the whole period with less than 8 of functioning rain gauges removed from the final high quality database it was also noted that the best performing filters were the first ones applied showing that the procedure works best on the identification of gross errors with diminished efficiency in finding malfunctions after the sequential removal of poor quality rain gauges abbreviations tbrg tipping bucket

quality control rainfall event spatial outlier sub hourly rainfall data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction changes in both the magnitude and variability of rainfall have been reported in different regions of the world due to global warming induced by climate change ipcc 2013 panthou et al 2018 alterations in extreme precipitation events and consequent increases to the intensity and frequency of hazards triggered by them have resulted in damage to infrastructure lives homes and ecosystems lewis et al 2019 lee et al 2021 the brazilian atlas of natural disasters ceped ufsc 2013 provides information on the records of the incidence of such hazards in brazil from 1990 to 2012 the statistics presented in the document show that the deadliest disasters are indeed those associated with high intensity rainfall events e g flash floods occurring within minutes or a few hours of excessive rainfall which were responsible for 58 of deaths in brazil in the study period the assessment of precipitation data plays an important role for water resources management flood forecasting and operational warning decision making systems because rainfall is one of the key climatic variables affecting both spatial and temporal patterns of water availability weldegerima et al 2018 liu et al 2018 debbage shepherd 2019 tiwari et al 2020 in brazil most of the studies to evaluate the impact caused by extreme events have been carried out using daily rainfall data due to the lack of sub daily rainfall data e g loureiro et al 2014 sena 2016 cardoso et al 2020 however even though the daily resolution is still widely used to study rainfall it is not suitable for assessing changes in extreme events as most are shorter than 24hr barbero et al 2019 additionally sub daily rainfall data provides better model performances over daily scales for flood simulations since the peak inundation value is more sensitive to the temporal resolution of the storm input bruni et al 2015 huang et al 2019 hou et al 2020 and data at higher resolution e g hourly scale possesses different statistical characteristics and patterns of spatiotemporal variability compared with daily aggregations trenberth zhang 2018 however although the number of worldwide studies analysing hourly or sub hourly extreme rainfall events has been increasing over the past years in brazil we still struggle with a general lack of adequate high resolution rainfall time series over longer periods as highlighted in several previous studies e g lewis et al 2018 2019 2021 barbero et al 2019 li et al 2020 bonaccorso et al 2020 haacke paton 2021 fowler et al 2021 the collection of sub daily precipitation data through rain gauges is mostly an automatic process which makes it difficult to identify instrument defects and changes in the environment therefore rainfall records can contain anomalously high and low values as well as missing data robertson 2015 tipping bucket rain gauges tbrg the most popular and widespread type of rain gauge employed worldwide molini et al 2005 liu et al 2018 also suffer from mechanical and electrical problems that may occasionally cause failures to tip during an event incorrect data provided by the malfunctioning of equipment end up passing unnoticed in the raw dataset and flawed rainfall observations used in applications such as calibration of hydrological models can lead to poor out of sample model simulations that consequently contribute to poor streamflow forecasts robertson 2015 liu et al 2018 therefore some procedures to identify those uncertainties controlling the quality of the data are indispensable green et al 2012 qi et al 2016 quality control procedures qcp are designed to exclude inaccurate measurements vos et al 2019 and although they are a necessity and a responsibility of meteorological services that store distribute and use these data llabrés brustenga et al 2019 to date only a few approaches for rainfall data quality assessment and control are available these procedures may vary according to different aspects of the records and can consist of i comparisons with auxiliary data including radar images satellite images and synoptic maps e g qi et al 2016 afonso et al 2020 ii pre set dynamic thresholds to exclude unlikely values e g jørgensen et al 1998 estévez et al 2011 lewis et al 2018 or iii internal consistency between neighbouring stations and or in time green et al 2011 wijngaard et al 2003 chen li 2016 serrano notivoli et al 2017 while many advances have been made in automatic quality control procedures a qcp for large daily datasets of climate observations existing procedures are difficult to apply to sub daily rainfall records lewis et al 2021 in brazil most rainfall procedures for quality assessment have been carried out on a basin or regional scale to provide quality controlled data to a specific aim for instance medium to large scale basins have relatively recently been treated to hydrological procedures in brazil sugahara et al 2012 silva and reboita 2014 delahaye et al 2015 murara et al 2019 besides these studies also focus on daily rather than sub daily data as reported in most international scientific publications e g hamada et al 2011 green et al 2012 serrano notivoli et al 2017 llabrés brustenga et al 2019 in the past years global databases of quality controlled rainfall derived from research papers have indicated a lack of knowledge of qcp and data availability on a sub hourly basis in brazil e g blenkinsop et al 2018 lewis et al 2018 morbidelli et al 2020 however after 2011 due to a major landslide that occurred in rio de janeiro netto et al 2013 causing more than 30 000 people to lose housing and over 900 human life losses the brazilian national centre for monitoring and early warnings of natural disasters cemaden was created by the brazilian government horita et al 2017 thereafter a continuous rainfall monitoring network was established in 2013 to support its natural disasters risk management in over 500 different risk areas in brazil with over 1500 rain gauges installed in 2014 the network is the largest high temporal resolution rainfall monitoring network installed in south america freitas et al 2020 made up of a tbrg system with sub hourly rainfall records albeit that these data have not yet undergone any quality control procedure most of the existing procedures for quality control found in the literature on sub hourly or even sub daily rainfall data rely on some previously quality controlled database for instance blenkinsop et al 2017 assembled a qcp using data from three sources of which two had already undergone quality assessment additionally some procedures lack important steps such as multiple rain gauge tests which compare gauges with neighbours offering further advantages compared to single gauge tests blenkinsop et al 2017 this approach was implemented by lewis et al 2018 however their checks varied along with the seasonality specificities of the study area and the clear differentiation between seasons which makes the replication of the methodology difficult for regions with different characteristics finally papers built on complex methodologies such as lewis et al 2021 which had 25 time series checks to flag suspicious data using 5 calculated climate indices based on quality controlled daily precipitation and several thresholds based on percentile values are difficult to be replicated in countries with data scarcity or constantly changing datasets like brazil the cemaden network for example continues to increase the number of stations yearly with new stations installed every year and old or faulty ones deactivated therefore a simpler independent procedure is still required to ensure the quality of these rain gauges for further use and maintenance issues this paper proposes a new simple and customisable a qcp for sub hourly rainfall data considering as a reference the cemaden network in brazil with automatic detection of measurement errors and equipment malfunctions in tbrg unlike the aforementioned procedures the proposed methodology does not need any supplementary quality controlled database this is the first a qcp applied on a bigger scale in south america which can be easily replicable to other countries of this region compared to the previous qcp available in the literature additionally this study also presents the first brazilian quality controlled reference dataset built on a visual inspection of the cemaden rainfall data using a seven year period 2014 2020 this paper is organised as follows section 2 outlines the study area the sub hourly database and the built reference dataset section 3 describes the methodology developed to apply the a qcp divided into a single gauge tests with threshold values that can be adapted according to the user requirements and b spatial outlier detection using local indicators of autocorrelation with calculated rainfall properties 1 1 the use of such properties represents to the author s knowledge an innovative approach since the neighbouring checks are usually performed considering only the accumulated rainfall totals as input the use of such properties represents to the author s knowledge an innovative approach since the neighbouring checks are usually performed considering only the accumulated rainfall totals section 4 assesses the methodology validation performed through a confusion matrix and sections 5 and 6 present the results of the manual and automatic operations and the summary and concluding remarks of the study respectively 2 data 2 1 study area this study was carried out for the whole of brazil the largest country in south america with an area of approximately 8 5 m km2 between the coordinates 5 16 n 33 45 s and 34 47 w 73 59 w the brazilian territory comprises twelve köppen s climate types with a wide range of weather conditions alvares et al 2014 as shown in fig 1 a for instance the rainfall is very heterogeneous presenting an annual depth of less than 400 mm in the dry zone bsh located on the inland area of the brazilian northeast and values higher than 3 000 mm in the tropical zone af more specifically in the northeastern portion of the amazon rainforest alvares et al 2014 the distribution of annual rainfall is illustrated in fig 1 b another important feature of rainfall is the long term monthly average rainfall distribution according to reboita et al 2010 the rainfall behaviour in brazil can be clustered into five groups most rainfall regimes present precipitation maxima in the summer and minima in the winter seasons with some exceptions for instance in the south of brazil close to paraguay the monthly rainfall is almost homogeneous throughout the year also in the further north region and the northeast coast area the highest precipitation indices happen in the first semester of the year the brazilian topography is also very heterogeneous as can be seen in fig 1 c with elevations ranging from sea level to almost 3 000 m at the neblina peak in the north of brazil the elevation has a high orographic influence on the geographic distribution of rainfall cândido and nunes 2008 found significant heterogeneity in the rainfall totals of the mantiqueira mountains which reached in the summer gradients of over 150 mm when compared to areas with equivalent latitudes but contrasting altitudes similarly in são paulo the topographic effect is accentuated in mountainous areas such as the serra do mar serra dos agudos and serra do botucatu where pluviometric indices tend to be higher compared with more flat areas prado et al 2006 2 2 sub hourly rainfall database a sub hourly rainfall dataset for the period 1 january 2014 31 december 2020 obtained from the cemaden rainfall monitoring network was used in this study with a total of 22 777 annual time series obtained from an average of 3 000 stations per year from 1 897 in 2014 up to 3 832 in 2018 the total number of rain gauges varies every year due to the installation of new stations and the deactivation of older and flawed tbrg during the studied period currently the network has over 3 500 rain gauges distributed throughout most of the national territory the temporal resolution of the sub hourly rainfall data monitored by cemaden is available at a 10 min time step when it rains and 60 min over non rain periods i e zero values are stored the network is currently distributed throughout nearly all the national territory however most of the gauges are located in large and medium sized cities since its main purpose is alerting against natural disasters triggered by rainfall which includes flooding flash floods debris flows and landslides the distribution of the rain gauges used in this study for the first year of implementation of the cemaden s network 2014 is illustrated in fig 1 d and their distribution for the last year of the study period 2020 is illustrated in fig 1 e it is noticeable that most of the rainfall stations are in the most populated areas especially in the southeast region and along the brazilian coast these areas are usually associated with steep slopes surrounding large urban centres which are more prone to disasters large areas to the north of the country such as the amazon are sparsely populated and not well covered by the cemaden network the world meteorological organization wmo 1996 recommends installing weather stations and rain gauges in open flat terrain free of any obstruction at least 10 times the height of the instrument to ensure proper wind flow which might affect measurements the cemaden network was conceived to monitor landslides and flash floods that take place in urban settlements in unstable steep slope areas to allow monitoring of local rainfall conditions many of those rain gauges are installed on public building rooftops of occupied areas conventional weather stations on the other hand are usually located in downtown valley areas in short grass open locations where rainfall rates are much lower the in situ rainfall monitoring network operated by cemaden although still somewhat unevenly distributed throughout the country is expanding year by year and represents an advance for understanding sub daily rainfall extremes in tropical regions 2 3 reference dataset the quality control procedures despite being quasi automated in some instances still rely heavily on a final manual inspection or a previous manual identification of errors as model training lewis et al 2018 moreover the manual inspection serves as a resource for creating a reference dataset in the absence of other independent high quality data sources blenkinsop et al 2017 in this study the reference database consisted of the same cemaden tbrg used for the automatic qcp but assembled through a reference visual inspection ref vi following the procedures described below first a computational routine selected only rain gauges with less than 60 days of missing data in the annual series during each calendar year considered in this study subsequently the total monthly rainfall data and the sub hourly records were analysed on a spreadsheet along with its 5 nearest stations this first process resulted in two lists of rainfall gauges obtained by visual inspection 1 high quality hq rain gauges and 2 poor quality pq rain gauges and their main inconsistencies the main disparities of the pq rain gauges in relation to their surroundings were 1 long periods with null values while the rain gauges nearby are recording rainfall 2 a sudden peak too high to happen under 10 min higher than previous records the measurements of the neighbouring gauges or the rainfall regime set at 40 mm and 3 constant rainfall records with 0 2 mm for a long period probably indicating gauge clogging while the neighbouring tbrgs present more heterogeneous records for high temporal resolutions e g 10 min the correlation between gauges has a significant decrease over long interstation distances van leth et al 2021 1 with the correlation coefficient r decreasing to about 0 16 when the gauges are further than 25 km apart sinclair pegram 2005 thus neighbouring stations distant more than 50 km from the analysed tbrg with large differences of altitude between them were discarded from this comparison after the visual inspection of the dataset the records for every year were analysed by two different researchers as a sort of double blind experiment to avoid biased results afterwards a third check was performed to identify and solve disagreements between the results this allowed the identification of systematic errors such as missing values or a long rainless period in this third check the records of the possibly faulty gauge were compared with a close by gauge from another reliable rainfall monitoring network from the national water agency state water agencies and the national institute of meteorology however since there was still no other sub hourly dataset freely available in brazil at the time the analysis was performed with daily and monthly records of these reference stations which had to be within at least the same city as the analysed gauge from cemaden after all the checks have been performed we created a unique list of hq and pq gauges to be used as a reference dataset for the methodology validation of the automatic quality control procedure left side of fig 2 3 methods 3 1 automatic quality control procedures a series of procedures were used to automatically quality control a qcp the cemaden sub hourly rainfall data based on the rain gauges measurements and neighbouring gauge behaviour without the need of any quality controlled reference database which is an important feature due to the lack of such a type of reference data in some regions such as brazil fig 2 shows a flowchart illustrating the steps of the a qcp as well as the validation used in this study the a qcp is presented in a darker shade of blue the ref vi is shown in a medium shade of blue previously described in section 2 3 and the methodology validation i e confusion matrix is exhibited in a light shade of blue all automatic procedures proposed in this study allow the user to customise the thresholds according to the application of the final quality controlled dataset the proposed a qcp consists of the following 2 stages described in detail below a single rain gauge tests considering each gauge s annual time series independently and b multiple rain gauge tests which compare each station with its neighbours using spatial analysis to identify measurement errors through spatial outlier detection 3 1 1 single gauge tests some kinds of error e g missing data zero rainfall etc may interfere with the statistical and spatial analysis to identify such errors single gauge tests were first performed to identify suspicious values before the next steps of the a qcp the possibly faulty gauges for a specific civil year were thereafter flagged and classified as poor quality and therefore excluded from further analysis i e in each step only the unflagged gauges from the previous step were analysed for the single gauge tests we first aggregated the sub hourly records in daily values so rain gauges with more than 60 days missing records in each calendar year were flagged and thus excluded from subsequent analyses then to the sub hourly records a moving window of 35 consecutive days was applied to analyse if the annual time series had only records of 0 2 mm during this pre defined period the rain gauge was considered faulty if the mean value of the records for this moving window varied from 0 201 to 0 199 and the standard deviation was less than 0 0001 the third step of the single gauge tests checked the sub hourly maximum records over the year and excluded for further analysis gauges in which a peak found in its annual time series exceeded the threshold of 40 mm in 10 min lastly a moving window was again used to check the 0 values over consecutive days in the daily records considering a threshold of 200 rainless days in a row the thresholds used in the single gauge tests were chosen based on the analysis of a confusion matrix along with the results from the ref vi these errors can appear on the sub hourly records as shown in fig 3 these thresholds were initially observed during the assembly of the reference dataset through visual inspection ref vi we have analysed the overall annual time series values for each filter number of days with a specific behaviour or a maximum value in 10 min to try and separate the pq gauges from the hq gauges through a threshold line thereafter all of the filters went through a confusion matrix analysis using the ref vi as a reference to adjust the thresholds in order to avoid the misclassification of hq gauges by examining the mean values for the false negatives absence of malfunction indication in each threshold thus picking the one with the least amount of misclassified high quality gauges yet maintaining a high value for accuracy the ratio of true correct predictions to the total number of accounts and recall the rate of correct predictions on the presence of indication of malfunction since the single gauge tests were performed only to minimize the errors in the spatial analysis not to remove a large number of functioning gauges 3 1 2 spatial analysis the spatial analysis was implemented for each calendar year separately with the application of the local moran s index a local spatial autocorrelation statistic that identifies local clusters or outliers anselin 1995 this analysis considered the rainfall events of the studied sub hourly database records as explained in detail in the next subitems of this section 3 1 3 definition of rainfall events and their properties rainfall is generally noted as single events or storms with beginning and end defined by rainless intervals of a nominated duration minimum inter event time mit carbone et al 2014 since rainfall event characteristics including depth and intensity are defined in relation to the length of the rain event their values are dependent upon the value of the adopted mit dunkerley 2008 in this study the rainfall events were delineated to be examined independently using the mit values of 1 6 and 24 h with a minimum rainfall depth of 5 mm per event ziegler et al 2006 considering these two criteria rainfall events were calculated for every analysed year then considering each event on every annual time series the following rainfall properties were computed yearly rainfall number of rainfall events per year and mean rainfall depth which were used as input to the spatial analysis 3 1 4 cluster and spatial outlier analysis the cluster and spatial outlier analysis was performed through the local moran s index moran s i a local indicator of spatial association lisa statistic based on spatial autocorrelation anselin 2010 the local moran s i has previously been used to investigate precipitation patterns e g narashid et al 2017 darand et al 2017 and can be expressed as anselin 1995 1 i i x i x s i 2 j w ij x j x where x i and x j are the values of variable x at location i and location j respectively x is the overall mean value of x combined population of x i and x j wij is the weights matrix for the adjacent spaces and s i 2 is the second moment variance of the distribution of these values in the data calculated with n as the number of observations through the equation 2 s i 2 j x j x 2 n 1 x 2 additionally the z score for the statistics of moran s i can be computed as abdulhafedh 2017 3 z i i e i v i where e i is the expected value of i and v i is the variance of i as shown in equation 4 4 v i e i 2 e 2 i a positive i i value indicates a spatial clustering of similar values surrounding the unit space i which can be high high hh or low low ll clusters a negative i i value indicates a spatial clustering of non similar values surrounding the unit i spatial outliers which can be high low hl or low high lh additionally when i i is close to zero it indicates randomness according to the chosen significance value thus the index classification is non significant du et al 2017 the moran s i was implemented only for the unflagged gauges in the previous steps moreover rain gauges presenting less than 200 mm of annual rainfall were not used in the analysis since this value was considered anomalous to the overall behaviour of rainfall in brazil the input variable x was each rainfall property calculated for the three mits and all of the studied period i e 7 years similar to the single gauge tests only the unflagged gauges of each moran s i analysis i e each combination of property and mit went through the next combination of property and mit the spatial weights matrix wij is defined as the formal expression of the structure of spatial dependence between observations anselin 1988 the columns with nonzero elements in a given row of this matrix indicate the relevant neighbours for the observation that corresponds to the row that is the elements of the gauge s neighbourhood anselin 1995 for this paper this relationship was based on each rain gauge s 5 nearest neighbours created through the k nearest neighbours algorithm knn and the moran s i was performed with a significance level of p 0 05 based on 999 permutations impact of permutation number has a neglectable influence on the results at the end of this analysis clustered hh and ll and non significant rain gauges were classified as hq due to the spatial clustering characteristics expected on the studied variables or the absence of proof of measurement errors furthermore the stations pointed as spatial outliers according to the chosen significance level were classified as pq rain gauges 3 2 model performance evaluation the performance of the proposed methodology was evaluated through a confusion matrix using the results of the a qcp and the reference dataset previously assembled i e the ref vi in the field of machine learning a confusion matrix is used for measuring the performance of classification algorithms the matrix is a special kind of contingency table with two dimensions actual and predicted and identical sets of classes in both dimensions stehman 1997 in binary classification the algorithm attempts to detect the presence of a relevant feature if it is detected the sample is labelled as positive and if otherwise negative suárez garcía et al 2020 the feature used in this paper is the presence of some kind of error that could indicate a faulty gauge therefore flagged gauges containing spurious behaviour are classified as positive by the algorithm the confusion matrix provides the following four outcomes in which the first two are correct predictions and the last two are errors 1 true positives where the model correctly predicts the positive class i e the pq rain gauge 2 true negatives where the model correctly predicts the negative class i e the hq rain gauge 3 false positives where the model incorrectly classifies a pq station as a functioning rain gauge based on the thresholds or the spatial analysis and 4 false negatives where the model incorrectly predicts the negative class i e the hq rain gauges however firstly the confusion matrix was used to calibrate the procedure of the single gauge tests i e to choose the best thresholds and afterwards to choose the best properties for identifying spatial outliers spatial analysis secondly this tool was used to verify the overall performance of the whole procedure and evaluate the final classification of the rain gauges the goal of the a qcp is to flag as many pq rain gauges as possible without incorrectly flagging hq stations therefore in order to evaluate the results and efficiency of the method after the computation of the number of gauges on each outcome classification three metrics regarding those values were calculated 1 precision to verify the number of false positives 2 accuracy to evaluate the ability of the method to correctly classify the rain gauge and 3 recall sensitivity to check if the method is correctly flagging a good amount of pq rain gauges 4 results and discussions 4 1 reference dataset built on visual inspection ref vi the tbrg problems were identified in the ref vi by observing the raw data of the rain gauges per year the analysed gauges have been previously submitted to the assessment of missing days which removed gauges with more than 60 days missing data from the visual inspection as they were automatically flagged as pq gauges table 1 presents the final number of hq and pq rain gauges identified from the ref vi and the number of gauges automatically flagged as pq after the application of the first a qcp i e stations with more than 60 days of missing data the percentage of hq gauges in relation to the total amount of rain gauges per year ranges from less than 20 in 2014 to almost 38 in 2020 despite showing improvements between the first and last analysed year the number of hq rain gauges did not present a linear growth since the classification involves many criteria besides the increase in the number of gauges each year on average 30 of the rain gauges were classified as hq in the ref vi the results show a high number of problematic rain gauges identified in the visual inspection since this is the first study regarding quality control of sub hourly rainfall data carried out and published in brazil there is still no reference number or indicator to compare with the presented results however it is noticeable that there is a high number of malfunctioning gauges an average of 68 6 per year thus agencies and meteorological services should be persuaded to improve the maintenance of these measuring devices to evaluate the quality of the monitoring network it is also important to note its distribution in both space and time since a well distributed consistent series of data is important for most hydrology related studies chen li 2016 schroeer et al 2018 thus the rain gauges were verified to assess their available years table 2 shows the number of hq gauges per monitoring period after the ref vi whose yearly distributions can be found in the supplementary material there is a notable decrease in the number of rain gauges with complete years of data available as the length of the time series increases for instance the number of rain gauges with only 1 year of data is more than 400 times the number of stations containing 7 years of data 4 2 automatic quality control procedures a qcp 4 2 1 single gauge tests the findings of the single gauge tests are shown in fig 4 where it is possible to observe a larger number of possibly faulty gauges identified from the first adopted procedures for instance the assessment of missing days flagged 1206 gauges as pq in 2014 which corresponds to 63 6 of the analysed gauges for that year during the following years this percentage tends to decrease flagging 50 1 i e 1634 gauges in 2015 and from 35 0 to 40 2 in the following years the higher number of pq gauges in the early years may have to do with the implementation of the network which was still at the beginning approximately 657 34 6 and 1360 42 2 rain gauges were considered unflagged in 2014 and 2015 respectively these two first years presented the highest number of faulty gauges in the series in the following five years the percentage of unflagged gauges was higher ranging from 1640 49 5 in 2016 to 1833 in 2020 51 9 this means that approximately half of the gauges met the conditions to be considered as hq gauges by the procedure in the analysed period this step of the methodology plays an important role in the whole procedure because if an hq gauge is surrounded by pq gauges the local moran s i may wrongly identify the hq gauge as an outlier 4 2 2 spatial analysis this procedure aimed to identify anomalous values and clusters using the local moran s i the number of spatial outliers according to the mit and rainfall properties for each year is shown in the heatmap presented on fig 5 a heatmap is a data matrix that enables visualizing values in the cells by the use of a colour gradient this gives a good overview of the largest and smallest values in the matrix rows and or columns of the matrix are often clustered so that users can interpret sets of rows or columns rather than individual ones metsalu vilo 2015 the number of rainfall events first chart used as input had found the majority of spatial outliers especially for the mit of 1440 min for instance 43 spatial outliers were found in 2020 and over 20 spatial outliers were found in most of the remaining years except for 2014 for the second analysis using the mean rainfall depth as input the mit of 60 min was more efficient finding up to 46 spatial outliers in 2020 and a mean of 20 spatial outliers in the remaining years in the last property used the yearly rainfall the first mit has found the highest rate of merely 11 spatial outliers for 2016 decreasing as the mit increases with no outliers found in 2015 2019 and 2020 for the mit of 1440 min this behaviour was most likely due to the sequential nature of removing pq gauges in each round of the analysis table 3 shows the number of hq and pq rain gauges obtained from the whole a qcp similar to the information of the ref vi presented in table 1 the percentage of hq gauges identified in relation to the total amount of rain gauges per year ranged from 31 2 2014 to more than 50 in 2019 and 2020 in comparison to the ref vi a higher number of gauges were pointed out as hq 4 3 confusion matrix fig 6 presents a graphical representation of the number of pq rain gauges classified by the a qcp and the rate of misclassified faulty stations for each step of the procedure the stacked bar charts show the correctly flagged data in red and the rate of misclassification or false negatives in orange since the procedure was sequentially adopted each filter analyses only the remaining gauges from the previous step and therefore the results shown are proportional to the number of gauges analysed in each step for the panel in 2014 the first 4 filters had an insignificant amount of misclassification however for the same year the rainfall events for 360 min had a misclassification rate of more than 60 showing a decrease in the efficiency of the filters for that year nonetheless this percentage stacked bar chart can lead to biased results for instance in 2018 the yearly rainfall for the mit of 60 min shows that 100 of the classified faulty gauges were false negatives which corresponds to merely 2 rain gauges among almost 4000 analysed that year the matrices presented in fig 7 show on average that the a qcp correctly predicted 93 9 of the hq rain gauges from the ref vi for all years for 2019 for instance the a qcp correctly predicted 95 9 of the hq gauges classified from ref vi misclassifying less than 5 of the gauges as pq on the a qcp proposed by lewis et al 2021 built on rule based quality checks the procedure had a mean true negative rate of 99 6 however regarding the removal of faulty stations their procedure had a false negative rate of 29 a higher misclassification rate than the a qcp proposed here which has misclassified 20 5 of the pq gauges similar results were found by llabrés brustenga et al 2019 with a qc proposed for catalonia on the automatic steps of the procedure it had a true positive rate of 83 a slightly higher value compared with this study s findings 79 5 however in the cited paper the rate of false positives reached up to 10 contrasting with 6 1 on this study s proposed a qcp the results obtained from fig 7 also show that the percentage of false negatives is smaller than the false negatives in all studied years this means that the proposed procedure is more focused on removing faulty rain gauges whilst being cautious not to wrongly flag functioning stations besides that no spatial patterns for misclassification were identified as can be seen in the supplementary material the annual scores calculated through the confusion matrix accuracy precision and recall for the entire a qcp are presented in table 4 the procedure presented a mean accuracy of 84 1 for all years while the values of precision ranged from 94 08 2020 to 98 58 2016 showing a very good rate on the identification of the positive class pq gauges with less than 6 of falsely flagged hq stations in the worst year for this metric 2020 lastly the recall score shows that the a qcp procedure correctly classified on average 92 30 of all the malfunctioning rain gauges with the best values identified for 2014 82 80 and 2016 82 53 5 conclusions in this study a pioneering automatic quality control procedure a qcp for sub hourly precipitation was presented for brazil the methodology is completely automatic without the need for a previously quality controlled reference database the automatic procedure improves the overall quality of the sub hourly database by flagging and removing possible faulty gauges using filters and spatial analysis a quality controlled reference database assembled through visual inspection ref vi was performed to understand the behaviour measurement errors from tipping bucket rain gauges tbrgs in sub hourly records providing insights about the types of filters that could be adopted to automatically identify the errors and serving as the reference dataset to be used for the validation of the proposed a qcp the best results regarding the correct classification of rain gauges as high quality through the a qcp were found in 2019 i e five years since the implementation of the network while the highest number of false negatives were identified in 2014 i e the first year of network implementation although presenting a higher number of false negatives 2014 exhibited one of the best results along with 2016 at correctly classifying actually faulty gauges i e true negatives a decrease in the efficiency of the filters was observed as the faulty rain gauges were removed from the analysis the best performing filter was the identification of the number of missing data days flagging more rain gauges with the lowest number of misclassifications conversely the least effective filter was the moran s index applied using the yearly rainfall as input which for instance presented a mean of 68 6 of false negatives for the first mit 60 min and found no spatial outliers for 2019 and 2020 when the last mit 1440 min was considered showing that after the removal of gross errors the spatial analysis has difficulty in finding subtler issues regarding the cluster and spatial outlier analysis using moran s index to identify problematic gauges the best results were for the input of the number of rainfall events and mean rainfall depth with different rates for the multiple minimum inter event time mit durations a smaller number of spatial outliers were identified using the yearly rainfall showing that the use of properties of the events delineated from different mit durations as inputs provided better results than the aggregation of rainfall which is more widely used to quality control rain gauges after the application of the proposed a qcp to the whole database the results show that 92 6 of the stations in the final high quality hq dataset are correctly indicated from the scores generated on the confusion matrix it was noticed that the procedure had flagged many poor quality pq gauges without removing too many hq gauges with the rate of false positives bigger than the false negatives this behaviour is preferable to the opposite since it is much easier to remove faulty rain gauges than to retrieve misclassified functioning stations in the single gauge tests the density of the network does not interfere with the performance of the methodology however on the spatial analysis which considers 5 nearest neighbours regions in which the rain gauges are more sparsely distributed the results are less reliable since the comparison occurs with gauges that can be too distant from each other therefore the spatial outlier identified may not reflect an error but simply a difference between afar stations based on our experience we recommend that the following adjustments are performed to improve the results of the a qcp in further studies 1 apply the single gauge tests and spatial analysis in smaller regions since more homogeneous average zones may aid the adjustments of thresholds and parameters 2 decrease the temporal scale to a monthly application rather than yearly analysis which may reduce the loss of data and increase the number of high quality rain gauges per period 3 reduce the strictness of the spatial analysis since the rain gauges identified as spatial outliers by the moran s i for any rainfall property or mit were automatically classified as poor quality therefore a possible linear combination of the best properties and mits can be further performed as an interesting next step to better identify the anomalous values credit authorship contribution statement marcela a meira conceptualization data curation methodology software formal

2914,in the process of urbanization development human activities have a great impact on rivers because of social and economic demands which directly or indirectly lead to changes in the structure and function of river networks thus making hydrological patterns tend to be chaotic and ecological environment deteriorates in order to clarify the hydrological connectivity change mechanism of plain urban river network the main urban area of changzhou was taken as the study area the longitudinal functional connectivity comprehensive index lfcci was defined the results of temporal and spatial variation analysis of lfcci in the study area showed that the average lfcci in the main urban area was 1 34 among them the average lfcci in flood season may to august were higher than those in non flood season the maximum and minimum values of lfcci were 1 7 may and 0 63 december respectively indicating that the scheduling of stations in flood season was more complex meanwhile the average lfcci of jiuli station was the highest 2 95 and wujin station was the lowest 0 30 however further analysis showed that weicun zaogang and xiaohe sluices were important stations that affect the lfcci in the study area the evaluation method solved the problem of hydrological connectivity evaluation under the background of complex dispatching rules and it provided important technical support for river network connection project and water environment improvement keywords hydrological connectivity longitudinal functional connectivity river networks sluice human activities abbreviations lfcci longitudinal functional connectivity comprehensive index hfi hydrologic flow index hci hydrologic continuity index sc structural connectivity fc functional connectivity data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction connectivity as a key term in hydrology geomorphology environment ecology and flood also had an important impact on the connection between water systems sediment migration energy flow and biological migration deng et al 2018 gao et al 2021 lexartza artza and wainwright 2009 hydrological connectivity was closely related to the transport of matter energy and organisms as well as the physical chemical and biological processes of river systems therefore the study of hydrological connectivity had attracted more and more attention bracken and croke 2007 with more and more researches on hydrological connectivity scholars had unified the concept of hydrological connectivity and divided it into two types structural connectivity sc and functional connectivity fc bracken et al 2013 rinderer et al 2018 song et al 2019a b turnbull and wainwright 2019 voutsa et al 2021 sc was used to refer to the spatial patterns in the landscape such as the physical structure of a river network or flow paths fc refer to degree of dynamic change of these spatial patterns such as flow changes in different river connections turnbull et al 2008 at the same time sc was regarded as static connectivity fc as dynamic connectivity among them functional connectivity embodied the essence of hydrological connectivity in addition river network as an important component module of hydrological connectivity lynch et al 2019 w song et al 2019a b could be divided into three types longitudinal connectivity from upstream to downstream lateral connectivity from riparian to channel and vertical connectivity from surface to subsurface covino 2017 shao et al 2019 at its most general longitudinal functional connectivity had been widely studied in the world in relation to the connectivity and role of river networks liu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 however due to the frequent occurrence of flood disasters various flood control measures e g dams and sluices had been introduced into the river network obstructing the assessment of longitudinal functional connectivity buddendorf et al 2017 li et al 2018 for the aforementioned reasons it was difficult to quantify the longitudinal functional connectivity of urban river network with multi sluice flood control system in previous studies researches on longitudinal functional connectivity considered sluices based on floodgates distance water level biological species or sediment for example the dendritic connectivity index dci blanchet and tedesco 2021 longitudinal functional connectivity index lfci deng et al 2018 longitudinal continuity lc deng 2019 and river channel connectivity index rcci li et al 2018 and relative connectivity index rci turnbull and wainwright 2019 were proposed to quantify the longitudinal functional connectivity in fact we cannot obtain the dynamic changes of the hydrological connectivity of the river network through these methods such as the connectivity changes were caused by dam and gate operation in addition the quantification of hydrological connectivity was restricted by the difficulty of obtaining hydrological data the nonlinear variation of hydrological and the complexity of hydrological scheduling rules the purpose of this paper is to establish a new quantitative method of longitudinal functional connectivity which can be used as a tool for quantifying hydrological connectivity with multi sluice flood control system in addition an example was provided to illustrate the process of using the evaluation method it was helpful to improve hydrological control and water environment improvement project 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the changzhou city 31 15 32 07 n 119 13 120 20 e is located in the yangtze river delta in the southern jiangsu province of china with a total area of 4375 km2 this study takes the urban area of the city as the research area fig 1 including the wujin xinbei tianning and zhonglou districts it is characterized by humid seasonal climate with an average annual rainfall of 1092 mm in order to meet the development needs the river had been artificially modified and occupied resulting in a downward trend of water area at the same time impervious areas had been increased by urbanization to suffer devastating floods in changzhou city a large number of dams and sluices were constructed to solve the problem of flooding 2 2 data the daily mean water level data and historical discharge data were collected at key hydrological stations in the urban river network area from 2018 to 2019 the station were main nodes of river network flood control system and had long term continuous data the spatial distribution and specific information was displayed in fig 1 and table 1 meanwhile the daily precipitation were acquired through the changzhou hydrological bureau from 2018 to 2019 3 methodology from the concept and mechanism of hydrological connectivity it can be seen that the fluidity and continuity of water system are the basic conditions for the existence of rivers and the most important elements of hydrological connectivity buddendorf et al 2017 garbin et al 2019 lu et al 2020 therefore the establishment of longitudinal functional connectivity index of river network mainly considered the flow rate and the passing rate of artificial structures among them the flow rate reflected the fluidity of water flow and the passing rate of artificial structures reflected the continuity of water flow however in practice the flow rate was rarely used to calibrate the state of water flow and the flow rate was generally used to express the flow capacity of water system meanwhile the flow data was easier to obtain and could be divided into different types according to statistical characteristics therefore in order to quantify hydrological functional connectivity with multi sluice flood control system it was necessary to establish flow passing probability assessment methods based on the scheduling rules of water conservancy and flood control projects the flow was depicted in fig 2 3 1 hydrologic flow index hfi the fluidity of river was an important indicator of hydrological longitudinal functional connectivity it was impossible to evaluate the flow state of the river network if only the upstream inflow was considered therefore the relative relationship between the measured discharge of river section and the planned discharge of river channel was the key to be considered consequently the coordination and collocation between the two are comprehensively considered to reflect the fluidity of water flow by reason of the foregoing in this paper the ratio between the actual flow and the ecological flow of the cross section was defined as the hydrologic flow index hfi it was worth noting that q 90 pastor et al 2014 and p iii curve griffis and stedinger 2007 ragno et al 2019 song and pang 2019 method were used to calculate the ecological flow of the sluice the p iii curve function is 1 ψ p 3 x 1 β γ α x τ β α 1 e x p x τ β defined for α 0 x τ β 0 and γ α being a complete gamma function the parameters α β and τ are functions of the first three moments μ x σ x γ x griffs and stedinger 2007 2 α 4 γ x 2 3 β σ x γ x 2 4 τ μ x 2 σ x γ x 5 q e ψ p 3 x x 90 6 hfi q m q e where q m is the realtime flow m3 s where q e is the ecological flow m3 s it is clear that when q m is less than q e when water flow is lower than the minimum flow to maintain the ecosystem the normal ecological demand cannot be maintained and it indicates that the state of hydrological connectivity is extremely bad 3 2 hydrologic continuity index hci in terms of rivers the continuity of flow was the basis of the hydrological longitudinal functional connectivity river network was controlled by a large number of sluices in order to prevent floods and environmental degradation and the construction of a large number of sites and complex scheduling rules brought uncertainties for the continuity of water flow at present the water level difference between sluice stations was mainly used to represent the continuity of water flow this method was not suitable for river network area with complex scheduling rules therefore it was necessary to develop a new method to quantify the change of plain river network connectivity in multi dam area from what had been discussed above the sluices were regulated by specific dispatch rules to ensure that the water level did not exceed the local warning level in specific sluice scheduling rules the warning water level was the key to affect the opening or closing of sluice the probability of the occurrence of the warning water level represented the cumulative probability of sluice opening lu et al 2020 therefore from the sluice scheduling rules in the study area the cumulative probability of safe interval defined water level was considered as sluice passing probability namely hydrologic continuity index hci this paper introduced a probability distribution function f x for quantification of continuous indices and f x was primarily examined by kolmogorov smirnov ks method lu et al 2020 ragno et al 2019 the formula of hydrologic continuous indices was defined as follows 7 h c i x f x d x where 0 hci 1 x is water level m the river is not interrupted the strongest when hci 1 and is interrupted when hci 0 8 d max z f z 1 z f z 2 z where d is the ks test statistic z 1 and z 2 are two samples f z 1 z and f z 2 z are the unknown statistical distributions of z 1 and z 2 respectively the null hypothesis h 0 is f z 1 z f z 2 z h 0 is rejected when the p value of the test is equal to or exceeds the selected α l e v e l of significance 3 3 longitudinal functional connectivity comprehensive index lfcci it was known from the above analysis that the main connotation of connectivity was the fluidity and continuity of water flow as a result longitudinal functional connectivity comprehensive index lfcci was defined as the product of hfi and hci the lfcci was used to characterize the connectivity level of hydrological function the traditional hydrological functional connectivity assessment methods mainly include graph theory hydrological connectivity function water level difference etc the above methods cannot accurately represent the real time state and actual flow scheduling scenarios this paper attempts to overcome the challenges highlighted above using the methodology described to make the model suitable for the evaluation of hydrologic connectivity of complex scheduling rules and more consistent with the actual situation of hydrologic connectivity the formula was written as shown below 9 l f c c i h f i h c i where the bigger the lfcci the better the longitudinal functional connectivity 4 results and discussion 4 1 regulation of sluice in study area according to the flood control operation in changzhou city weicun wujingang xiaohe yapu zaogang jiuli huangnianqiao caoqiao and changzhou 3 stations in the urban area were the main reference stations for flood control operation in order to obtain a scientific and reasonable lfcci the above stations were selected as the calculation section of hfi and hci in this paper in addition due to the special status of the yangtze river diversion gate weicun wujingang and xiaohe sluices and the taihu lake flood discharge gate yapu and zaogang sluices in order to ensure the water quantity and water environment of urban rivers they will be opened or closed when the warning water level is not reached therefore the passing rate of the sluice should be analyzed according to the actual water level of the upstream and downstream of the sluice on the basis of considering the flood control regulation in summary after analyzing the scheduling rules of each sluice station we obtained the warning line of water level of sluice gates opening closing the detailed results were described in table 1 4 2 hci of main urban area in this section hourly water level data of each sluice station from 2018 to 2019 were used to calculate the opening and closing probability of the sluice station by using the hci formula during this time the sluice scheduling rules of the above stations were employed to obtain the continuous index of each station and the study area huangnianqiao caoqiao jiuli the water level was normal distribution and the probability distribution function can be used to calculate the sluice passing rate hci of the station we knowed that the water level of the highest probability distribution of caoqiao and huangnianqiao was between 3 3 m and 3 5 m for an in depth analysis and the probability distribution of gate opening tended to be consistent it indicated that the sluice gate passing rate of these two stations is high the hci of caoqiao and huangnianqiao reached 0 9 as seen in fig 4 which proved the above analysis is correct the probability distribution of jiuli water level showed that the frequency of the highest water level of the station was between 3 6 m and 3 8 m which was higher than the average water level of caoqiao and huangnianqiao stations the main reason was that the jiuli station was located in the beijing hangzhou canal in order to ensure the normal shipping and other functions of the beijing hangzhou canal the water level of the river and the sluice passing rate will be appropriately increased in addition fig 4 further demonstrated that the hci of jiuli water level station reached 0 99 which proved that jiuli station was always open weicun xiaohe zaogang weicun xiaohe and zaogang sluices were the main control hubs along the yangtze river which undertaken the flood discharge and drainage tasks in urban areas therefore according to the scheduling rules in table 1 changzhou 3 was an important basis for the opening of the sluice the normal distribution curve indicated that the highest frequency water level in changzhou 3 was 3 6 m 3 7 m and the probability of sluice closing was high with the cumulative probability reaching 0 9549 fig 3 the actual sluice opening probability obtained from the analysis of the water level difference between the inside and outside sluice indicated that the sluice gate opening frequency along the yangtze river was relatively low and the hci of weicun xiaohe and zaogang sluices were only 0 2203 0 2463 0 1777 fig 4 at the same time we knowed that the closure of the upstream sluice may lead to the lack of ecological flow in the downstream during the dry season which was projected to worsen for some ecosystems in practical management the sluice along the yangtze river should make full use of the tidal phenomenon of the yangtze river to ensure the downstream flow wujin and yapu station wujin and yapu station were important hubs for the water flowing from changzhou city to taihu lake their opening closing time and frequency had an important impact on the water level and environment of taihu lake by analyzing the hourly water level of wujin and yapu station in 2018 2019 the normal distribution curve and probability distribution graph were obtained fig 3 the high frequency water level of wujin station and yapu station were 3 55 m and 3 5 m respectively and the water level of wujin station was 0 05 m higher than that of yapu station at different frequencies the results showed that the opening frequency of wujin station was higher than yapu station nevertheless the opening frequency of yapu station was higher than wujin station indicating that the opening frequency of yapu station was higher in actual operation resulting in the comprehensive opening frequency of yapu station reaching 0 1715 fig 4 therefore the high water level of wujin station may be due to the river blockage caused by the low frequency of opening the gate in addition the above analysis results were consistent with the regulation of the hub around taihu lake it was that yapu station was preferentially opened main urban area through the analysis of probability distribution map of main urban area we got hydrological continuous index of main stations according to the hci the hci of different sluice stations varied greatly for example the hci of jiuli station was 0 993 as a result hci of zaogang and wujin station was only 0 178 and 0 152 the hci of the main urban area was 0 469 which was in the middle level in the actual management the scheduling rules of each sluice station should be considered comprehensively the primary role of current scheduling rules was flood control with little consideration for ecological improvement therefore it was suggested that on the basis of flood control the management department should increase the dispatching of sluice gate and dam for the improvement of ecological environment of river network 4 3 hfi of main urban area multi year flow frequency curves of each station were obtained from p iii curve method as shown in fig 5 then ecological flows of each section were obtained based on 90 frequency it can be seen from table 2 that the ecological flow of huangnianqiao and jiuli station was relatively high indicating that the flow of this station was relatively stable the ecological discharge and average discharge of caoqiao wujin and yapu stations were relatively low indicating that the cross section discharge of these stations was low the difference between the ecological flow and the average flow of weicun zaogang and xiaohe was large indicating that the flow fluctuation of this station was more severe caoqiao as can be seen from fig 6 the hfi was the highest in march reaching 3 93 however the hfi in november and december was 0 we found that the caoqiao river was dredged by the xinmeng river project in that month to result in no flow in this section of the river compared with non flood season the highest hfi in flood season was 3 4 august and the lowest was 2 07 the mean hfi in flood season was 2 66 and the mean hfi in non flood season was 2 01 it indicated that the flow in flood season was more stable and the fluctuation of flow in non flood season was more severe as can be seen from fig 6 the rainfall in flood season was significantly higher than that in non flood season the average monthly rainfall in february march and april was low but the hfi of caoqiao station was high the main reason was that there were more gate pumping stations in the main urban area and the influence of artificial control was greater for example if the rainfall in flood season was large in order to protect the urban area from the impact of flood the management department would take measures such as closing the sluice gate and pumping station for drainage resulting in low hfi in flood season and high hfi in non flood season at the same time the above measures were also the main reason for the more stable hfi in flood season huangniaoqiao fig 6 showed that the monthly maximum hfi was 2 24 may and the minimum hfi was 1 33 july in the huangnianqiao station the average hfi in flood season was 1 84 and that in non flood season was 1 74 the results shown that the flow of the huangnianqiao was relatively stable at the same time it indicated that the flow regulation frequency of this station was high for example the rainfall in august was high and the total rainfall in that month reached 211 5 mm but the hfi was low the rainfall during october was low at 11 25 mm but the hfi remained the same as in august the above analysis shown that the station can reduce the flow of the area by means of sluice closing or drainage in wet season and improve the flow of the area by sluice opening or increasing water diversion in dry season so as to ensure the water demand jiuli as can be seen from fig 6 the highest hfi of jiuli station was 5 53 june the lowest hfi was 0 95 september the hfi in flood season was 4 02 and the hfi in non flood season was 2 45 the large difference in hfi of jiuli station indicated that the monthly average flow of this station fluctuates greatly it should be noted that the hfi of september is 1 indicating that the monthly flow cannot meet the ecological flow standard jiuli station was located in the upper reaches of the beijing hangzhou canal and its main function was to monitor the inflow of upstream water therefore in the process of monitoring the inflow of upstream water we should actively deal with the situation of flood peak and insufficient inflow and coordinate other stations to transfer appropriate amount of water to meet the ecological needs of the beijing hangzhou canal weicun zaogang and xiaohe the monthly average hci of weicun and zaogang showed the same trend for example it gradually increased from january to may and showed synchronous fluctuation in other months the highest hfi was 6 6 09 november the lowest hfi was 1 13 2 22 january in non flood season the highest hfi was 5 23 and 5 80 in may respectively the lowest values were 2 19 and 1 98 in june in flood season compared with non flood season the fluctuation of hfi in flood season was small both weicun and zaogang stations were important sluices in the study area therefore the above results indicated that weicun and zaogang sluices were synchronized in water diversion management further analysis shown that the hfi of weicun and zaogang sluices were closely related to the hfi and rainfall of the downstream stations fig 6 showed that the rainfall fluctuation was basically consistent with the hfi of weicun and zaogang stations for example the rainfall in august was high 211 5 mm but the hfi was low the rainfall in november was low 59 15 mm and the hfi was high based on the above analysis it can be seen that the dispatching of weicun and zaogang sluices was related to the water supply guarantee and flood safety of the downstream river therefore the dispatching of the above two stations should be paid attention xiaohe station was one of the three major sluice in the study area weicun zaogang and xiaohe sluices fig 6 were seen that the hfi of in december january and february were 1 it was proved that the diversion flow was lower than the ecological base flow and cannot effectively replenish the downstream river in non flood season in the future management ecological flow of water system should be coordinated and scientific scheduling should be carried out to improve the ecological environment of the study area yapu and wujin fig 6 showed that the difference of monthly average hfi between yapu and wujin sluice was large the mean hfi of wujin station in flood season and non flood season were 1 76 and 2 05 respectively and those of yapu station in flood season and non flood season were 6 25 and 3 03 respectively wujin station had a good control over the flow fluctuation in flood season and non flood season but yapu station had a higher flow fluctuation in flood season and a larger flow fluctuation in non flood season therefore other stations upstream of yapu station should cooperate with the station to schedule the flow to relieve the flow pressure of yapu station and reduce the fluctuation of hfi main urban area according to the comprehensive flow index in the main urban area of changzhou city fig 6 the mean flow index in flood season was higher than that in non flood season which was 3 48 and 2 54 respectively moreover the flow of the river network in the study area was highest in may and lowest in december the hfi in january and december were both close to 1 indicating that the flow in that month had the risk of being lower than the ecological base flow and should be paid more attention in general the hfi of water body in flood season was slightly higher than that in non flood season with an annual average flow index of 2 85 and a standard deviation of 0 76 indicating a reasonable amplitude it can be concluded that from the above discussion and fig 6 the results of the hfi showed significant spatial and temporal deviation for example the highest hfi of huangnianqiao station was 2 24 may and the lowest was only 1 33 july the highest hfi of yapu station was 13 48 september and the lowest was only 1 22 march according to eq 6 hfi was mainly affected by flow rate therefore the main factor for the spatio temporal difference of hfi in fig 6 was the amount of rainfall that was affected by climate and human activities the hfi value increased significantly when there was more rainfall meanwhile hfi values of different stations were mainly affected by scheduling rules 4 4 lfcci of main urban area by analyzing the flow and water level of important hydrological stations in the main urban area the hfi and hci of each station were obtained and the lfcci formula was further used to obtain the lfcci of each station in different months in the main urban area figs 7 and 8 lfcci in different months in the main urban area showed fig 7 that the standard deviation in flood season and non flood season was 1 19 and 0 92 respectively the dispersion degree of lfcci in flood season was higher than that in non flood season indicating that flood season had a greater impact on the gate station although the lfcci in flood season was more dispersed the average value of the lfcci in this period was higher than that in non flood season reaching 1 63 while it was only 1 19 in non flood season it may be caused by increased flow during the flood season and the opening of floodgates in addition significance level p 0 1 indicated the scheduling relevance of each site was not high fig 8 showed that the lfcci of caoqiao and jiuli stations was relatively discrete and the main factor causing the fluctuation of lfcci of this station was flow the fluctuation of lfcci of other sluice stations was small especially that of wujin station indicating that the flow of wujin station was relatively stable however through the analysis of lfcci it can be seen that the connectivity of wujin station was low only 0 3 the main reason was the low hci of this station in general the lfcci of dispatching sluices along the yangtze river and taihu lake were all 1 which affected the lfcci of the main urban area in conclusion the lfcci was proposed by integrating the hfi and hci of each sluice station in different months the comprehensive index can effectively represent the regulation state and hydrological functional connectivity level of the station the traditional hydrological function connectivity assessment method mainly used the water level difference between the sluice and the spatial position of the sluices however it cannot evaluate the opening state and flow level of the sluice from the research results the lfcci of the main urban area reached 1 34 showing moderate connectivity the lfcci of each station varies greatly which was mainly caused that the station in the upstream and downstream areas were closed the above results indicate that although the comprehensive index of the sluice station is high the external clean water source cannot be obtained and the internal polluted water cannot be discharged in time which may lead to the deterioration of the ecological environment therefore in order to improve the ecological environment of the river network the overall functional connectivity level of the main urban area should be further improved meanwhile sluices along the yangtze river and taihu lake should be considered 5 conclusion in order to clarify the hydrological connectivity in the study area under the background of complex dispatching rules a longitudinal functional connectivity comprehensive index lfcci for plain urban river network was established the lfcci was used to analyze the spatio temporal variations of hydrological connectivity in changzhou city furthermore the related conclusion was drawn as follows 1 there were significant differences in hci among different stations among which the hci of jiuli station reached 0 993 wujin station was 0 152 the hci of the study area was 0 469 indicated the flow passing rate was limited 2 the average hfi in flood season may to august was higher than in non flood season which was 3 48 and 2 54 respectively meanwhile the hfi of different sluices varied greatly the lowest hfi was the 1 33 huangnianqiao station and the highest hfi was 13 48 yapu station the main factors of hfi temporal and spatial variation were climate and human activities 3 the standard deviation and mean value of lfcci in flood season were higher than those in non flood season in addition lfcci was lower at stations along the yangtze river weicun xiaohe and zaogang stations and taihu lake wujin and yapu stations finally the significance level indicated that lfcci of sluices was affected more by human activities than climate in conclusion hfi and hci were taken as key parameters for hydrological functional connectivity assessment lfcci can be used as a management model to quantify the hydrological functional connectivity in plain urban river networks however this work did not provide the classification standard of lfcci we will devote ourselves to studying the connectivity level of different sluices based on the evaluation results of lfcci in the future and provide reference for management data availability statement the original contributions presented in

2914,in the process of urbanization development human activities have a great impact on rivers because of social and economic demands which directly or indirectly lead to changes in the structure and function of river networks thus making hydrological patterns tend to be chaotic and ecological environment deteriorates in order to clarify the hydrological connectivity change mechanism of plain urban river network the main urban area of changzhou was taken as the study area the longitudinal functional connectivity comprehensive index lfcci was defined the results of temporal and spatial variation analysis of lfcci in the study area showed that the average lfcci in the main urban area was 1 34 among them the average lfcci in flood season may to august were higher than those in non flood season the maximum and minimum values of lfcci were 1 7 may and 0 63 december respectively indicating that the scheduling of stations in flood season was more complex meanwhile the average lfcci of jiuli station was the highest 2 95 and wujin station was the lowest 0 30 however further analysis showed that weicun zaogang and xiaohe sluices were important stations that affect the lfcci in the study area the evaluation method solved the problem of hydrological connectivity evaluation under the background of complex dispatching rules and it provided important technical support for river network connection project and water environment improvement keywords hydrological connectivity longitudinal functional connectivity river networks sluice human activities abbreviations lfcci

do not have permission to share data 1 introduction connectivity as a key term in hydrology geomorphology environment ecology and flood also had an important impact on the connection between water systems sediment migration energy flow and biological migration deng et al 2018 gao et al 2021 lexartza artza and wainwright 2009 hydrological connectivity was closely related to the transport of matter energy and organisms as well as the physical chemical and biological processes of river systems therefore the study of hydrological connectivity had attracted more and more attention bracken and croke 2007 with more and more researches on hydrological connectivity scholars had unified the concept of hydrological connectivity and divided it into two types structural connectivity sc and functional connectivity fc bracken et al 2013 rinderer et al 2018 song et al 2019a b turnbull and wainwright 2019 voutsa et al 2021 sc was used to refer to the spatial patterns in the landscape such as the physical structure of a river network or flow paths fc refer to degree of dynamic change of these spatial patterns such as flow changes in different river connections turnbull et al 2008 at the same time sc was regarded as static connectivity fc as dynamic connectivity among them functional connectivity embodied the essence of hydrological connectivity in addition river network as an important component module of hydrological connectivity lynch et al 2019 w song et al 2019a b could be divided into three types longitudinal connectivity from upstream to downstream lateral connectivity from riparian to channel and vertical connectivity from surface to subsurface covino 2017 shao et al 2019 at its most general longitudinal functional connectivity had been widely studied in the world in relation to the connectivity and role of river networks liu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 however due to the frequent occurrence of flood disasters various flood control measures e g dams and sluices had been introduced into the river network obstructing the assessment of longitudinal functional connectivity buddendorf et al 2017 li et al 2018 for the aforementioned reasons it was difficult to quantify the longitudinal functional connectivity of urban river network with multi sluice flood control system in previous studies researches on longitudinal functional connectivity considered sluices based on floodgates distance water level biological species or sediment for example the dendritic connectivity index dci blanchet and tedesco 2021 longitudinal functional connectivity index lfci deng et al 2018 longitudinal continuity lc deng 2019 and river channel connectivity index rcci li et al 2018 and relative connectivity index rci turnbull and wainwright 2019 were proposed to quantify the longitudinal functional connectivity in fact we cannot obtain the dynamic changes of the hydrological connectivity of the river network through these methods such as the connectivity changes were caused by dam and gate operation in addition the quantification of hydrological connectivity was restricted by the difficulty of obtaining hydrological data the nonlinear variation of hydrological and the complexity of hydrological scheduling rules the purpose of this paper is to establish a new quantitative method of longitudinal functional connectivity which can be used as a tool for quantifying hydrological connectivity with multi sluice flood control system in addition an example was provided to illustrate the process of using the evaluation method it was helpful to improve hydrological control and water environment improvement project 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the changzhou city 31 15 32 07 n 119 13 120 20 e is located in the yangtze river delta in the southern jiangsu province of china with a total area of 4375 km2 this study takes the urban area of the city as the research area fig 1 including the wujin xinbei tianning and zhonglou districts it is characterized by humid seasonal climate with an average annual rainfall of 1092 mm in order to meet the development needs the river had been artificially modified and occupied resulting in a downward trend of water area at the same time impervious areas had been increased by urbanization to suffer devastating floods in changzhou city a large number of dams and sluices were constructed to solve the problem of flooding 2 2 data the daily mean water level data and historical discharge data were collected at key hydrological stations in the urban river network area from 2018 to 2019 the station were main nodes of river network flood control system and had long term continuous data the spatial distribution and specific information was displayed in fig 1 and table 1 meanwhile the daily precipitation were acquired through the changzhou hydrological bureau from 2018 to 2019 3 methodology from the concept and mechanism of hydrological connectivity it can be seen that the fluidity and continuity of water system are the basic conditions for the existence of rivers and the most important elements of hydrological connectivity buddendorf et al 2017 garbin et al 2019 lu et al 2020 therefore the establishment of longitudinal functional connectivity index of river network mainly considered the flow rate and the passing rate of artificial structures among them the flow rate reflected the fluidity of water flow and the passing rate of artificial structures reflected the continuity of water flow however in practice the flow rate was rarely used to calibrate the state of water flow and the flow rate was generally used to express the flow capacity of water system meanwhile the flow data was easier to obtain and could be divided into different types according to statistical characteristics therefore in order to quantify hydrological functional connectivity with multi sluice flood control system it was necessary to establish flow passing probability assessment methods based on the scheduling rules of water conservancy and flood control projects the flow was depicted in fig 2 3 1 hydrologic flow index hfi the fluidity of river was an important indicator of hydrological longitudinal functional connectivity it was impossible to evaluate the flow state of the river network if only the upstream inflow was considered therefore the relative relationship between the measured discharge of river section and the planned discharge of river channel was the key to be considered consequently the coordination and collocation between the two are comprehensively considered to reflect the fluidity of water flow by reason of the foregoing in this paper the ratio between the actual flow and the ecological flow of the cross section was defined as the hydrologic flow index hfi it was worth noting that q 90 pastor et al 2014 and p iii curve griffis and stedinger 2007 ragno et al 2019 song and pang 2019 method were used to calculate the ecological flow of the sluice the p iii curve function is 1 ψ p 3 x 1 β γ α x τ β α 1 e x p x τ β defined for α 0 x τ β 0 and γ α being a complete gamma function the parameters α β and τ are functions of the first three moments μ x σ x γ x griffs and stedinger 2007 2 α 4 γ x 2 3 β σ x γ x 2 4 τ μ x 2 σ x γ x 5 q e ψ p 3 x x 90 6 hfi q m q e where q m is the realtime flow m3 s where q e is the ecological flow m3 s it is clear that when q m is less than q e when water flow is lower than the minimum flow to maintain the ecosystem the normal ecological demand cannot be maintained and it indicates that the state of hydrological connectivity is extremely bad 3 2 hydrologic continuity index hci in terms of rivers the continuity of flow was the basis of the hydrological longitudinal functional connectivity river network was controlled by a large number of sluices in order to prevent floods and environmental degradation and the construction of a large number of sites and complex scheduling rules brought uncertainties for the continuity of water flow at present the water level difference between sluice stations was mainly used to represent the continuity of water flow this method was not suitable for river network area with complex scheduling rules therefore it was necessary to develop a new method to quantify the change of plain river network connectivity in multi dam area from what had been discussed above the sluices were regulated by specific dispatch rules to ensure that the water level did not exceed the local warning level in specific sluice scheduling rules the warning water level was the key to affect the opening or closing of sluice the probability of the occurrence of the warning water level represented the cumulative probability of sluice opening lu et al 2020 therefore from the sluice scheduling rules in the study area the cumulative probability of safe interval defined water level was considered as sluice passing probability namely hydrologic continuity index hci this paper introduced a probability distribution function f x for quantification of continuous indices and f x was primarily examined by kolmogorov smirnov ks method lu et al 2020 ragno et al 2019 the formula of hydrologic continuous indices was defined as follows 7 h c i x f x d x where 0 hci 1 x is water level m the river is not interrupted the strongest when hci 1 and is interrupted when hci 0 8 d max z f z 1 z f z 2 z where d is the ks test statistic z 1 and z 2 are two samples f z 1 z and f z 2 z are the unknown statistical distributions of z 1 and z 2 respectively the null hypothesis h 0 is f z 1 z f z 2 z h 0 is rejected when the p value of the test is equal to or exceeds the selected α l e v e l of significance 3 3 longitudinal functional connectivity comprehensive index lfcci it was known from the above analysis that the main connotation of connectivity was the fluidity and continuity of water flow as a result longitudinal functional connectivity comprehensive index lfcci was defined as the product of hfi and hci the lfcci was used to characterize the connectivity level of hydrological function the traditional hydrological functional connectivity assessment methods mainly include graph theory hydrological connectivity function water level difference etc the above methods cannot accurately represent the real time state and actual flow scheduling scenarios this paper attempts to overcome the challenges highlighted above using the methodology described to make the model suitable for the evaluation of hydrologic connectivity of complex scheduling rules and more consistent with the actual situation of hydrologic connectivity the formula was written as shown below 9 l f c c i h f i h c i where the bigger the lfcci the better the longitudinal functional connectivity 4 results and discussion 4 1 regulation of sluice in study area according to the flood control operation in changzhou city weicun wujingang xiaohe yapu zaogang jiuli huangnianqiao caoqiao and changzhou 3 stations in the urban area were the main reference stations for flood control operation in order to obtain a scientific and reasonable lfcci the above stations were selected as the calculation section of hfi and hci in this paper in addition due to the special status of the yangtze river diversion gate weicun wujingang and xiaohe sluices and the taihu lake flood discharge gate yapu and zaogang sluices in order to ensure the water quantity and water environment of urban rivers they will be opened or closed when the warning water level is not reached therefore the passing rate of the sluice should be analyzed according to the actual water level of the upstream and downstream of the sluice on the basis of considering the flood control regulation in summary after analyzing the scheduling rules of each sluice station we obtained the warning line of water level of sluice gates opening closing the detailed results were described in table 1 4 2 hci of main urban area in this section hourly water level data of each sluice station from 2018 to 2019 were used to calculate the opening and closing probability of the sluice station by using the hci formula during this time the sluice scheduling rules of the above stations were employed to obtain the continuous index of each station and the study area huangnianqiao caoqiao jiuli the water level was normal distribution and the probability distribution function can be used to calculate the sluice passing rate hci of the station we knowed that the water level of the highest probability distribution of caoqiao and huangnianqiao was between 3 3 m and 3 5 m for an in depth analysis and the probability distribution of gate opening tended to be consistent it indicated that the sluice gate passing rate of these two stations is high the hci of caoqiao and huangnianqiao reached 0 9 as seen in fig 4 which proved the above analysis is correct the probability distribution of jiuli water level showed that the frequency of the highest water level of the station was between 3 6 m and 3 8 m which was higher than the average water level of caoqiao and huangnianqiao stations the main reason was that the jiuli station was located in the beijing hangzhou canal in order to ensure the normal shipping and other functions of the beijing hangzhou canal the water level of the river and the sluice passing rate will be appropriately increased in addition fig 4 further demonstrated that the hci of jiuli water level station reached 0 99 which proved that jiuli station was always open weicun xiaohe zaogang weicun xiaohe and zaogang sluices were the main control hubs along the yangtze river which undertaken the flood discharge and drainage tasks in urban areas therefore according to the scheduling rules in table 1 changzhou 3 was an important basis for the opening of the sluice the normal distribution curve indicated that the highest frequency water level in changzhou 3 was 3 6 m 3 7 m and the probability of sluice closing was high with the cumulative probability reaching 0 9549 fig 3 the actual sluice opening probability obtained from the analysis of the water level difference between the inside and outside sluice indicated that the sluice gate opening frequency along the yangtze river was relatively low and the hci of weicun xiaohe and zaogang sluices were only 0 2203 0 2463 0 1777 fig 4 at the same time we knowed that the closure of the upstream sluice may lead to the lack of ecological flow in the downstream during the dry season which was projected to worsen for some ecosystems in practical management the sluice along the yangtze river should make full use of the tidal phenomenon of the yangtze river to ensure the downstream flow wujin and yapu station wujin and yapu station were important hubs for the water flowing from changzhou city to taihu lake their opening closing time and frequency had an important impact on the water level and environment of taihu lake by analyzing the hourly water level of wujin and yapu station in 2018 2019 the normal distribution curve and probability distribution graph were obtained fig 3 the high frequency water level of wujin station and yapu station were 3 55 m and 3 5 m respectively and the water level of wujin station was 0 05 m higher than that of yapu station at different frequencies the results showed that the opening frequency of wujin station was higher than yapu station nevertheless the opening frequency of yapu station was higher than wujin station indicating that the opening frequency of yapu station was higher in actual operation resulting in the comprehensive opening frequency of yapu station reaching 0 1715 fig 4 therefore the high water level of wujin station may be due to the river blockage caused by the low frequency of opening the gate in addition the above analysis results were consistent with the regulation of the hub around taihu lake it was that yapu station was preferentially opened main urban area through the analysis of probability distribution map of main urban area we got hydrological continuous index of main stations according to the hci the hci of different sluice stations varied greatly for example the hci of jiuli station was 0 993 as a result hci of zaogang and wujin station was only 0 178 and 0 152 the hci of the main urban area was 0 469 which was in the middle level in the actual management the scheduling rules of each sluice station should be considered comprehensively the primary role of current scheduling rules was flood control with little consideration for ecological improvement therefore it was suggested that on the basis of flood control the management department should increase the dispatching of sluice gate and dam for the improvement of ecological environment of river network 4 3 hfi of main urban area multi year flow frequency curves of each station were obtained from p iii curve method as shown in fig 5 then ecological flows of each section were obtained based on 90 frequency it can be seen from table 2 that the ecological flow of huangnianqiao and jiuli station was relatively high indicating that the flow of this station was relatively stable the ecological discharge and average discharge of caoqiao wujin and yapu stations were relatively low indicating that the cross section discharge of these stations was low the difference between the ecological flow and the average flow of weicun zaogang and xiaohe was large indicating that the flow fluctuation of this station was more severe caoqiao as can be seen from fig 6 the hfi was the highest in march reaching 3 93 however the hfi in november and december was 0 we found that the caoqiao river was dredged by the xinmeng river project in that month to result in no flow in this section of the river compared with non flood season the highest hfi in flood season was 3 4 august and the lowest was 2 07 the mean hfi in flood season was 2 66 and the mean hfi in non flood season was 2 01 it indicated that the flow in flood season was more stable and the fluctuation of flow in non flood season was more severe as can be seen from fig 6 the rainfall in flood season was significantly higher than that in non flood season the average monthly rainfall in february march and april was low but the hfi of caoqiao station was high the main reason was that there were more gate pumping stations in the main urban area and the influence of artificial control was greater for example if the rainfall in flood season was large in order to protect the urban area from the impact of flood the management department would take measures such as closing the sluice gate and pumping station for drainage resulting in low hfi in flood season and high hfi in non flood season at the same time the above measures were also the main reason for the more stable hfi in flood season huangniaoqiao fig 6 showed that the monthly maximum hfi was 2 24 may and the minimum hfi was 1 33 july in the huangnianqiao station the average hfi in flood season was 1 84 and that in non flood season was 1 74 the results shown that the flow of the huangnianqiao was relatively stable at the same time it indicated that the flow regulation frequency of this station was high for example the rainfall in august was high and the total rainfall in that month reached 211 5 mm but the hfi was low the rainfall during october was low at 11 25 mm but the hfi remained the same as in august the above analysis shown that the station can reduce the flow of the area by means of sluice closing or drainage in wet season and improve the flow of the area by sluice opening or increasing water diversion in dry season so as to ensure the water demand jiuli as can be seen from fig 6 the highest hfi of jiuli station was 5 53 june the lowest hfi was 0 95 september the hfi in flood season was 4 02 and the hfi in non flood season was 2 45 the large difference in hfi of jiuli station indicated that the monthly average flow of this station fluctuates greatly it should be noted that the hfi of september is 1 indicating that the monthly flow cannot meet the ecological flow standard jiuli station was located in the upper reaches of the beijing hangzhou canal and its main function was to monitor the inflow of upstream water therefore in the process of monitoring the inflow of upstream water we should actively deal with the situation of flood peak and insufficient inflow and coordinate other stations to transfer appropriate amount of water to meet the ecological needs of the beijing hangzhou canal weicun zaogang and xiaohe the monthly average hci of weicun and zaogang showed the same trend for example it gradually increased from january to may and showed synchronous fluctuation in other months the highest hfi was 6 6 09 november the lowest hfi was 1 13 2 22 january in non flood season the highest hfi was 5 23 and 5 80 in may respectively the lowest values were 2 19 and 1 98 in june in flood season compared with non flood season the fluctuation of hfi in flood season was small both weicun and zaogang stations were important sluices in the study area therefore the above results indicated that weicun and zaogang sluices were synchronized in water diversion management further analysis shown that the hfi of weicun and zaogang sluices were closely related to the hfi and rainfall of the downstream stations fig 6 showed that the rainfall fluctuation was basically consistent with the hfi of weicun and zaogang stations for example the rainfall in august was high 211 5 mm but the hfi was low the rainfall in november was low 59 15 mm and the hfi was high based on the above analysis it can be seen that the dispatching of weicun and zaogang sluices was related to the water supply guarantee and flood safety of the downstream river therefore the dispatching of the above two stations should be paid attention xiaohe station was one of the three major sluice in the study area weicun zaogang and xiaohe sluices fig 6 were seen that the hfi of in december january and february were 1 it was proved that the diversion flow was lower than the ecological base flow and cannot effectively replenish the downstream river in non flood season in the future management ecological flow of water system should be coordinated and scientific scheduling should be carried out to improve the ecological environment of the study area yapu and wujin fig 6 showed that the difference of monthly average hfi between yapu and wujin sluice was large the mean hfi of wujin station in flood season and non flood season were 1 76 and 2 05 respectively and those of yapu station in flood season and non flood season were 6 25 and 3 03 respectively wujin station had a good control over the flow fluctuation in flood season and non flood season but yapu station had a higher flow fluctuation in flood season and a larger flow fluctuation in non flood season therefore other stations upstream of yapu station should cooperate with the station to schedule the flow to relieve the flow pressure of yapu station and reduce the fluctuation of hfi main urban area according to the comprehensive flow index in the main urban area of changzhou city fig 6 the mean flow index in flood season was higher than that in non flood season which was 3 48 and 2 54 respectively moreover the flow of the river network in the study area was highest in may and lowest in december the hfi in january and december were both close to 1 indicating that the flow in that month had the risk of being lower than the ecological base flow and should be paid more attention in general the hfi of water body in flood season was slightly higher than that in non flood season with an annual average flow index of 2 85 and a standard deviation of 0 76 indicating a reasonable amplitude it can be concluded that from the above discussion and fig 6 the results of the hfi showed significant spatial and temporal deviation for example the highest hfi of huangnianqiao station was 2 24 may and the lowest was only 1 33 july the highest hfi of yapu station was 13 48 september and the lowest was only 1 22 march according to eq 6 hfi was mainly affected by flow rate therefore the main factor for the spatio temporal difference of hfi in fig 6 was the amount of rainfall that was affected by climate and human activities the hfi value increased significantly when there was more rainfall meanwhile hfi values of different stations were mainly affected by scheduling rules 4 4 lfcci of main urban area by analyzing the flow and water level of important hydrological stations in the main urban area the hfi and hci of each station were obtained and the lfcci formula was further used to obtain the lfcci of each station in different months in the main urban area figs 7 and 8 lfcci in different months in the main urban area showed fig 7 that the standard deviation in flood season and non flood season was 1 19 and 0 92 respectively the dispersion degree of lfcci in flood season was higher than that in non flood season indicating that flood season had a greater impact on the gate station although the lfcci in flood season was more dispersed the average value of the lfcci in this period was higher than that in non flood season reaching 1 63 while it was only 1 19 in non flood season it may be caused by increased flow during the flood season and the opening of floodgates in addition significance level p 0 1 indicated the scheduling relevance of each site was not high fig 8 showed that the lfcci of caoqiao and jiuli stations was relatively discrete and the main factor causing the fluctuation of lfcci of this station was flow the fluctuation of lfcci of other sluice stations was small especially that of wujin station indicating that the flow of wujin station was relatively stable however through the analysis of lfcci it can be seen that the connectivity of wujin station was low only 0 3 the main reason was the low hci of this station in general the lfcci of dispatching sluices along the yangtze river and taihu lake were all 1 which affected the lfcci of the main urban area in conclusion the lfcci was proposed by integrating the hfi and hci of each sluice station in different months the comprehensive index can effectively represent the regulation state and hydrological functional connectivity level of the station the traditional hydrological function connectivity assessment method mainly used the water level difference between the sluice and the spatial position of the sluices however it cannot evaluate the opening state and flow level of the sluice from the research results the lfcci of the main urban area reached 1 34 showing moderate connectivity the lfcci of each station varies greatly which was mainly caused that the station in the upstream and downstream areas were closed the above results indicate that although the comprehensive index of the sluice station is high the external clean water source cannot be obtained and the internal polluted water cannot be discharged in time which may lead to the deterioration of the ecological environment therefore in order to improve the ecological environment of the river network the overall functional connectivity level of the main urban area should be further improved meanwhile sluices along the yangtze river and taihu lake should be considered 5 conclusion in order to clarify the hydrological connectivity in the study area under the background of complex dispatching rules a longitudinal functional connectivity comprehensive index lfcci for plain urban river network was established the lfcci was used to analyze the spatio temporal variations of hydrological connectivity in changzhou city furthermore the related conclusion was drawn as follows 1 there were significant differences in hci among different stations among which the hci of jiuli station reached 0 993 wujin station was 0 152 the hci of the study area was 0 469 indicated the flow passing rate was limited 2 the average hfi in flood season may to august was higher than in non flood season which was 3 48 and 2 54 respectively meanwhile the hfi of different sluices varied greatly the lowest hfi was the 1 33 huangnianqiao station and the highest hfi was 13 48 yapu station the main factors of hfi temporal and spatial variation were climate and human activities 3 the standard deviation and mean value of lfcci in flood season were higher than those in non flood season in addition lfcci was lower at stations along the yangtze river weicun xiaohe and zaogang stations and taihu lake wujin and yapu stations finally the significance level indicated that lfcci of sluices was affected more by human activities than climate in conclusion hfi and hci were taken as key parameters for hydrological functional connectivity assessment lfcci can be used as a management model to quantify the hydrological functional connectivity in plain urban river networks however this work did not provide the classification standard of lfcci we will devote ourselves to studying the connectivity level of different sluices based on the evaluation results of lfcci in the future and provide reference for management data availability statement the original contributions presented in
