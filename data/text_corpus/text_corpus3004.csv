15020,aflatoxins are highly carcinogenic metabolites produced by some aspergillus species and are the most prevalent mycotoxins although aflatoxins are commonly synthesized during fungal colonization in preharvest maize cereals and nuts they can be transported by rainfall to surface water and are a common toxin found in wastewater from some food industries here the occurrence of aflatoxins in bodies of water is reviewed for the first time along with the decontamination methods aflatoxins have been detected in surface wastewater and drinking water including tap and bottled water the specific sources of water contamination remain unclear which is an important gap that must be addressed in future research two main kinds of decontamination methods have been reported including degradation and adsorption the best degradation rates were observed using gamma and uv irradiations oxidoreductases and ozone while the best adsorption abilities were observed with minerals polyvinyl alcohol durian peel and activated carbon synthetic polymers could be used as membranes in pipes to remove aflatoxins in water flows although most decontamination methods were screened using afb1 the other commonly found aflatoxins were not used in the screenings overall the occurrence of aflatoxins in water could be a significant emerging public health concern largely ignored by local and international legislation numerous advances have been reported for the decontamination of aflatoxins in water however there is still a long way to go to put them into practice keywords mycotoxins organic contaminants aspergillus degradation adsorption data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction aflatoxins are the most predominantly occurring mycotoxins udomkun et al 2017 and are produced by some aspergillus species mainly a flavus and a parasiticus caceres et al 2020 although there are more than 20 different forms of naturally occurring aflatoxins afb1 is the most common and toxic ji and xie 2020 aflatoxins are mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds that have been implicated as causative agents in human hepatic and extrahepatic carcinogenesis kumar et al 2017 aflatoxins form deoxyribonucleic acid dna adducts with guanine inducing the formation of cancerous cells benkerroum 2020 aspergillus species are highly ubiquitous fungi that can easily spread by spores and colonize a variety of hosts krijgsheld et al 2013 fig 1 food contamination caused by aflatoxins commonly occurs in cereals nuts beans and fruits as well as in edible oils krska et al 2022 high relative humidity and the presence of water during storage play a key role in the appearance of aflatoxins in postharvest products rushing and selim 2019 an increase in aflatoxins has been observed during the last few years likely due to climatic change which has stimulated the appearance of new combinations of mycotoxins host plants geographical areas and has enhanced the ability of aspergillus species to produce aflatoxins gruber dorninger et al 2019 moretti et al 2019 although aflatoxins are accumulated in aspergillus infected plant tissues they are easily dispersed in soil and water systems through aqueous carriers such as rainfall juraschek et al 2022 contamination can occur in water storage transportation and wastewater from the food supply chains al gabr et al 2014 picardo et al 2020 yan and persaud 2019 although the concentrations of aflatoxins in water are usually low the long term consumption of contaminated water can still become a significant threat to human health picardo et al 2019 the presence of mycotoxins in food and feed has been extensively studied and yet relatively little is known about their environmental fate and their occurrence in water systems here the occurrence of aflatoxins in water and the developed decontamination strategies are reviewed the risks of aflatoxins presence in drinking water and the efficacy of the different methods to remove them are discussed throughout the manuscript this is the first review to our knowledge that summarizes the current state of literature on aflatoxins in water 2 occurrence and risks of aflatoxins in water 2 1 stability of aflatoxins in water aflatoxins show relatively high stability in aqueous solutions oliveira et al 2018 it has been indicated that afb1 and afb2 showed higher stability compared to afg1 and afg2 diaz et al 2012 the degradation rate of afb1 in water in a 5 ng l solution at room temperature was 31 3 after 24 h while the degradation of afb2 was 40 9 under the same conditions some authors have reported that afb1 rapidly degrades into afb2 and afg2 with half lives of a few days accinelli et al 2008 fig 2 it has been indicated that afb1 is the natural aflatoxin with the highest toxicity followed by afg1 afb2 and afg2 tahir et al 2018 in fact afb1 is the only aflatoxin that has been classified as a human carcinogen by the international agency for research on cancer as an important comparison of the carcinogenic activity of aflatoxins butler et al 1969 indicated that 2 mg afb1 and afg1 produced liver tumors in 19 and 6 out of 30 rats respectively while no liver tumors were detected when supplying afb2 afb1 poisoning can cause not only liver and kidney damage in humans and animals but can also cause testicular malformations lin et al 2022 afm1 and afm2 are typical dehydration products of afb1 and afb2 in aqueous medium and following digestion by mammals campagnollo et al 2016 flores flores et al 2015 afm1 and afm2 show less toxicity than their precursors tahir et al 2018 however the levels of afm1 in milk have been restricted since it shows relevant toxicity these reports suggest that toxicity rapidly decreases as the most common aflatoxin afb1 degrades to less toxic ones however some findings suggest that these compounds can remain for months murugesan et al 2021 afb1 degraded to afb2 in mud with afb1 undetected after 4 days however afb2 was still present after 77 days this relatively long degradation time gives these compounds a chance to be transported to drinking water sources it also indicates that the standard transportation and storage periods of drinking water less than one week are insufficient to guarantee the complete degradation of aflatoxins 2 2 legislated levels of aflatoxin in water according to the u s food and drug administration the maximum allowable aflatoxin levels are 300 μg kg for finishing cattle swine and poultry and 20 μg kg for all other animals the european union usa and brazil have established maximum levels for aflatoxin in fish feed at 10 20 and 50 μg kg gomes et al 2022 whereas the european commission has recommended a limit for afm1 of only 0 050 μg kg in milk kunter et al 2017 the european union has set maximum permitted levels for afb1 in nuts dried fruits cereals and spices that range from 2 to 12 µg kg while the maximum permitted level for afb1 in infant foods is set at 0 1 µg kg yu et al 2013 although the maximum levels of aflatoxins in some food products including maize cereals nuts and fish are well established in all countries specifications have not been made for drinking or bathing water thus it seems that the presence of aflatoxins in some food products is considered a relevant safety problem but the same considerations have not been made for water wastewater from the agricultural and food industries is probably contaminating surface water systems which at the same time may be a source of aflatoxins in municipal and drinking water however no ordinances have been developed to regulate aflatoxins levels in different water systems it must be noted that contamination of fish with aflatoxins is a safety issue considered by most commissions and this is caused by the ingestion of both aflatoxin contaminated feed and water manjengwa et al 2019 indicating that the legislation is relatively inconsistent and contradictory when ignoring the potential presence of aflatoxins in water bodies given that aflatoxin levels in water are not yet regulated drinking water producers must refer to the general aflatoxin guidance levels generally food safety commissions designate limits on the levels of afb1 but largely ignore the other aflatoxins even if they also pose considerable toxicity with the exception of the legislation from the european commission which includes afb1 afb2 afg1 afg2 and afm1 european commission food safety 2022 the general maximum levels for afb1 are stricter in the european union 4 μg kg than in other countries such as china 50 μg kg japan 10 μg kg and the usa 20 μg kg considering that the direct toxic effects of afb1 are commonly observed at more than 200 μg kg yang et al 2022 the maximum limits established in all countries seem to guarantee the safety of the consumed products however the effects of continued exposure to low aflatoxin concentrations in humans need further exploration for example animal experiments show that piglets with chronic aflatoxin exposure of 70 and 140 μg kg are more prone to diarrheal disease experience more severe symptoms and are more likely to die than piglets without such exposure williams et al 2004 the levels of aflatoxins in maize in haiti were reported to be up to 20 μg kg and have been associated with the high rates of cancer in the country schwartzbord et al 2013 these reports suggest that the continuous consumption of aflatoxins from water sources may be a potential threat to human health picardo et al 2019 2 3 occurrence and concentrations of aflatoxins in water although the presence of aflatoxins in water and food products has often been related to developing african countries tantaoui elaraki et al 2018 several reports have demonstrated that aflatoxins are also present in water sources from developed countries such as spain picardo et al 2020 portugal viegas et al 2014 and the united kingdom paterson et al 1997 table 1 suggesting that this is a worldwide problem unfortunately only a few reports regarding the occurrence of aflatoxins in water bodies can be found in the literature suggesting that unknown hazardous situations may be happening in several countries extensive screenings would be required to obtain a complete overview of the occurrence and concentrations of aflatoxins as mentioned in the previous section aflatoxins maximum levels in water have not yet been regulated however aflatoxins have been found in surface water manjengwa et al 2019 wastewater fandohan et al 2005 and drinking water mata et al 2015 fig 3 this indicates that the development of standardized analysis methods for the determination of aflatoxins in water as well as the designation of maximum safe levels are important gaps that must be urgently reconsidered by the local and international food safety commissions 2 3 1 aflatoxins in surface water systems the transportation of aflatoxins can lead to water contamination madden and stahr 1993 it has been indicated that aflatoxins can be transported from contaminated plants and soil to groundwater juraschek et al 2022 although leaching risks from soils into deep sitting groundwater are considered low exceptions may be expected for well structured soils with preferential flow paths or after heavy rains aflatoxins have been detected in surface water for example aflatoxins have been detected in the ter river in spain and in lake chivero in zimbabwe manjengwa et al 2019 picardo et al 2020 nevertheless the higher concentration of afb1 in the ter river 0 26 0 39 μg l compared to lake chivero 0 005 0 003 μg l may be due to the fact that samples from the ter river were collected from an urbanized area whereas samples from lake chivero were collected from a natural environment al gabr et al 2013 also reported the presence of aflatoxins in xiamen s rivers and lakes although only three studies regarding the occurrence of aflatoxins in surface water have been reported these three reports suggest that the occurrence of aflatoxins in the surface water is common and this contamination may be especially common when the water bodies are located near urbanized industrial or agricultural areas it must be noted that although surface water is not directly ingested it is sometimes used for bathing clothes washing and other recreational activities thus the presence of aflatoxins in surface water bodies may also pose an important safety hazard in addition to the possibility of aflatoxins being transported by rainfall and deposited in water bodies some reports have examined the inoculation of aflatoxin producing strains in water al gabr et al 2012 banu et al 2016 for example oliveira et al 2018 described the inoculation of fungi and its growth in untreated surface water detecting afb1 and afb2 at concentrations up to 35 ng l after the inoculation aflatoxigenic a flavus strains could grow in paddies and aflatoxin accumulation was negatively correlated with the concentration of co2 in the paddies mousa et al 2016 similarly afb2 and afg1 were detected in rice paddies in vietnam at 1 0 2 2 and 3 1 μg l respectively phan et al 2021 it has been indicated that summer warming promoted cyanobacterial algal bloom and created the optimal conditions for the growth of molds and fungi al gabr et al 2014 although the ability of aspergillus to colonize algae may partially explain the presence of aflatoxins in surface water no related study has been published to date although aflatoxins were the most common mycotoxins found in bottled water the genera cladosporium fusarium and penicillium were the fungi more frequently detected mata et al 2015 that last report together with the low concentrations of aflatoxins after inoculation of aspergillus in water suggest that the presence of aspergillus in water must not be the main source of contamination but that contamination occurs when aflatoxins are dragged from plants however further research is necessary to identify the aflatoxin sources and how they arrive to surface water systems 2 3 2 aflatoxins in wastewater it has been reported that wastewater from the food industry is an important source of aflatoxins magan and aldred 2007 viegas et al 2014 identified several aspergillus strains in two portuguese wastewater treatment plants fandohan et al 2005 indicated that the amount of aflatoxins was significantly reduced during maize processing and these aflatoxin residues were accumulated in the wastewater which could contain aflatoxin concentrations as high as 1 42 0 06 μg l it must be noted that this concentration is higher than that detected in surface water systems and is near the maximum legislated levels of the european union 4 μg l paterson et al 1997 detected afb2 and afg2 at 0 2 1 8 and 0 1 0 3 μg l respectively in cold water storage tanks in the united kingdom while kadaifciler and demirel 2017 detected aflatoxins in cold water tanks in turkey it has been indicated that water contamination in fish farms is usually produced by the addition of contaminated feed to water mwihia et al 2018 the contamination of water with aflatoxins seems to increase aflatoxins accumulation in fish and these pose important hazards to human health afb1 was detected in catfish at 31 38 0 29 μg kg in cameroon which is higher than the maximum legislated levels tsafack takadong et al 2020 in contrast with humans wherein afb1 is transformed into afm1 and the latter is accumulated in breast milk and urine afb1 seems to remain stable in fish bedoya serna et al 2018 this is an important problem due to the toxicity of afb1 being much higher than that of afm1 although all studies were carried out in fish farms wild fish from contaminated surface water may also be an important source of aflatoxins although wastewater aflatoxins are not directly ingested by humans they can have very different environmental fates contaminating surface water soil and diverse organisms if wastewater is not properly decontaminated this is also an important gap in the local and international policies which do not consider the potential presence of aflatoxins in wastewater and their release into the environment food industries related to commonly contaminated products such as maize nuts and cereals must be an important source of aflatoxin contaminated wastewater to prevent the spread of aflatoxins it is necessary to standardize analysis methods and removal procedures for aflatoxins in wastewater 2 3 3 aflatoxins in drinking water surprisingly mata et al 2015 reported the presence of afb1 afb2 afg1 and afg2 in commercial bottled water in portugal at 0 22 0 70 0 18 0 42 0 42 0 60 and 0 16 0 48 μg l similarly trung et al 2020 reported the presence of afb1 afb2 and afg2 in bottled water in vietnam afb1 afm1 afg1 and afg2 were detected in 50 9 9 and 46 respectively of drinking water samples analyzed in south africa however the concentrations only ranged from 0 to 3 18 ng l mhlongo et al 2020 aflatoxins were detected in hand dug wells in nigeria shittu et al 2022 and in municipal and tap water in china nigeria and turkey al gabr et al 2013 amadi ikpa et al 2021 kadaifciler and demirel 2018 zhang et al 1995 in all cases aflatoxins were detected under the maximum limits the concentrations of aflatoxins in drinking water were in the ng l scale which is lower than those detected in wastewater and surface water bodies in the μg l scale although the previous reports were related to the presence of aflatoxins in drinking water for human consumption some studies have confirmed the presence of aflatoxins in animal farms for example diab et al 2021 reported the occurrence of afb1 at 7 97 μg l concentration in camel farm dwellings in egypt while khalid et al 2018 reported the presence of aflatoxins in animal drinking water in pakistani farms continuous consumption of aflatoxins from drinking water can result in the accumulation of aflatoxins in animal products such as meat and milk posing a potential health risk consequently the presence of aflatoxins in drinking water on farms should also be controlled the presence of aflatoxins in wastewater and surface water bodies can potentially be considered a safety hazard but the presence of aflatoxins in drinking water is a direct safety hazard since this water is meant to be ingested the presence of aflatoxins in bottled and tap water mata et al 2015 mhlongo et al 2020 indicates that aflatoxins occur in drinking water and that in some areas people are continuously ingesting aflatoxins infected water further research is necessary to identify and control aflatoxin contaminated drinking water bodies and understand the effects they are producing on human health it must be noted that the amounts of aflatoxins reported in bottled water are lower than the general limits mata et al 2015 but higher than the aflatoxin limits established for milk 0 050 μg kg it has been speculated that a person consumes more than 800 l of drinking water per year while the average worldwide consumption of maize is only 18 8 kg per capita per year considering that the concentrations of aflatoxins in bottled water were higher than 0 16 μg l a person who consumes 2 l of water per day ingests more than of 0 32 μg aflatoxins only from drinking water mata et al 2015 given that daily intakes of aflatoxins ranging from 0 127 to 0 195 μg per day were found to be directly related to the presence of primary liver cancer in china yu et al 1998 it can be concluded that the ingestion of aflatoxins from water may be a significant cause of cancer and in some areas may be higher than the ingestion of aflatoxins from food products in fact zhang et al 1995 related the presence of afb1 in drinking water to the high ratio of stomach cancer in zanhuang county china although aflatoxins were detected in different drinking water systems the source of these aflatoxins remains unexplored as indicated in section 3 2 1 aspergillus strains have been reported to colonize water and synthesize aflatoxins in aqueous solutions thus the presence of aspergillus strains contaminating water storage transportation and filling systems is the most likely source however it is also possible that the surface water is contaminated with aflatoxins and the residues end up in drinking water and thus in humans for example picardo et al 2020 identified aflatoxins in the surface water of the river ter which is used as the drinking water catchment area for the barcelona metropolitan area it must be noted that water potabilization process involves several filtration and decantation steps followed by oxidation with chloride unfortunately no study regarding the stability of aflatoxins in the presence of chloride and degradation products has been reported to date which is an important gap that must be addressed in future studies as indicated below some oxidizing agents allow for high degradation rates but sometimes these result in degradation products that show high toxicity levels 3 strategies for the removal of aflatoxins from water 3 1 degradation of aflatoxins with external irradiation although most mycotoxins are easily degraded when heated aflatoxins show high thermal stability wu et al 2022 for this reason several research groups have developed alternative methods for the decontamination of aflatoxins from water the methods for the removal of aflatoxins in water can be divided into 2 groups guo et al 2021 including degradation sections 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 and adsorption section 3 4 techniques gamma and uv irradiations visible light microwaves ultrasound pulsed electric fields and high hydrostatic pressure have been used to degrade aflatoxins in aqueous solution supplementary material table s1 although dried aflatoxins are extremely radioresistant the oxidative radicals that originate from radiolysis in solution make aflatoxins highly sensitive to irradiation samuel et al 2022 fig 4 methods using gamma and uv irradiation achieved in some cases some of the highest degradation rates observed throughout the reports mutluer and erkoc 1987 patel et al 1989 the higher the potential of the irradiation the higher the degradation rate mutluer and erkoc 1987 the degradation rates of afb1 using uv light were slightly lower 70 98 compared to those obtained after the application of gamma irradiation 100 which may be due to gamma rays higher intensity moreau et al 2013 studied the degradation of afb1 after the application of pulsing light observing degradation rates of 29 9 and 92 7 after 1 and 8 flashes respectively while the application of ultrasound 20 khz degraded afb1 by up to 96 5 after 50 min liu et al 2019 in general the degradation rates following application of visible light were lower than those observed with gamma and uv irradiations and visible light degradation required the addition of metals for example mao et al 2018 employed wo3 nanowires for the degradation of afb1 observing 92 4 degradation after 120 min zhang et al 2022a degraded afb1 by 98 9 after 80 min using tio2 uio 67 although the application of visible light implies an important advantage over gamma and uv irradiations given that visible light can be natural and does not involve the use of special lamps the addition of metals to water may result in contamination and some of the metals used such as u 67 are radioactive and too expensive for large scale use the degradation rates using microwaves were low 74 degradation rate after 30 min and required heating 140 ºc zhang et al 2021b an important advantage of gamma irradiation uv and visible light based techniques over microwaves is that they do not require heating when considering commercial use the heating of large quantities of water may involve the use of special equipment the use of microwaves and ultrasound shows some important advantages over gamma irradiation as exposure to the latter one can increase cancer risk in humans which may be dangerous when using large scale water deposits in fact the experiments with gamma irradiation were carried out in μl scale interestingly the application of uv could be performed using 100 ml solutions zhang et al 2021b which suggests that uv can be applied at full scale in a safe manner the application of high hydrostatic pressure and pulsed electric fields to large volumes of water is hampered by significant technological obstacles limiting its practical application in fact these methods were carried out using only 1 ml solutions although the methods using a uv ultrasound and microwaves required treatment of 30 100 min liu et al 2009 2010 patras et al 2017 zhang et al 2021b the use of uv radiation using leds reduced the application time to only 156 s stanley et al 2020 leds can be a suitable option not only for reducing application times but also for controlling the wavelength and intensity of irradiation thereby allowing the optimization of degradation conditions although the degradation rate with ultrasound treatment was 96 5 when using 200 mg l afb1 the degradation rate decreased to only 85 1 when using 10 mg l afb1 liu et al 2019 although most degradation methods used afb1 at a concentration of mg l the concentrations found in surface water wastewater and drinking water were in the μg l or ng l range this is an important limitation in all studies it has been shown that degradation is facilitated by the conversion of aflatoxins into their corresponding radicals calado et al 2014 and as a result it is expected that higher concentrations of aflatoxins may allow for higher degradation rates although the degradation rates for afb1 and afg1 were 100 after applying 20 kgy the degradation rates for afb2 and afg2 were only 9 2 and 35 6 mutluer and erkoc 1987 similarly patras et al 2017 indicated that uv irradiation degraded afg1 afb2 and afb1 by 67 22 29 77 and 98 25 respectively thus gamma and uv follow a similar trend wherein afb1 degrades faster than afg1 and afb2 stanley et al 2020 indicated that uv irradiation degraded afm1 to a greater extent 84 1 95 than afb1 70 0 27 these results support the indication that irradiation can successfully degrade some aflatoxins while others remain stable for this reason gamma and uv irradiation can be used for the selective removal of some aflatoxins unfortunately the screenings with visible light ultrasound and microwaves employed only afb1 and not other aflatoxins this important gap must be addressed in future work in contrast with uv and gamma irradiations pulsed electric fields did not efficiently degrade afb1 30 degradation pallares et al 2021 however afb2 and afg1 were degraded by 75 and 84 respectively after the application of a pulsed electric field when applying high hydrostatic pressure the highest degradation rates were observed for afb2 61 afg1 87 and afg2 85 suggesting that high hydrostatic pressure can be a suitable complement for gamma and uv irradiations to achieve the degradation of all types of aflatoxins 3 2 degradation of aflatoxins using microorganisms and enzymes some research groups examined the degradation of aflatoxins using microorganisms including bacteria and yeasts and enzymes isolated from different microorganisms supplementary material table s2 although the application of non aflatoxigenic aspergillus strains is arising as a suitable method for the decontamination of crops and food products ismail et al 2018 this method has never been explored for the decontamination of water in fact filamentous fungi have never been used for aflatoxin decontamination in water which is an important gap that must be addressed in future research in general the degradation rates obtained when using microorganisms were lower than those observed when using gamma and uv irradiations patel et al 1989 patras et al 2017 although the addition of environmental microorganisms to water is inexpensive and may involve easy procedures the posterior removal of the microorganisms from water before drinking water consumption may be an important limitation it must be taken into account that some microorganisms used may be harmful or toxigenic by producing other toxins of health significance for example pseudomonas species adebo et al 2016 staphylococcus species and e coli elaasser and el kassas 2011 which were used in some methods are food borne pathogens and can cause illness this problem can be solved using enzymes whose activity rapidly decreases after a few hours and can be easily degraded and inactivated however the expression and purification of the enzymes involve additional steps and costs the addition of microorganisms could have applications in treating surface water and wastewater that are not going to be directly consumed before the application of microorganisms their potential toxicity to humans and the environment must be evaluated although higher degradation rates were generally observed with yeasts than with bacteria the efficacy was highly dependent on the specific strains moustafa et al 2017 studied the degradation of afb2 with the yeasts kluyveromyces lactis cbs 2359 and saccharomyces cerevisiae atcc 9763 97 5 degradation rate after 72 h bacterial strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg l rhamnosus lc705 nocardia asteroides ifm 8 and pseudomonas putida 12 3 degraded afb1 by 68 8 67 5 95 and 69 3 respectively arai et al 1967 el nezami et al 1998 elaasser and el kassas 2011 adebo et al 2016 reported that staphylococcus sp vgf2 degraded afb1 by 100 which is the highest degradation rate achieved among all reports most bacterial strains provided degradation rates lower than 60 elsanhoty et al 2016 halttunen et al 2008 although in most cases the cells were applied a few studies involved the use of culture supernatants fig 5 the degradation effect was attributed to the degrading enzymes that were secreted by the microorganisms for example elaasser and el kassas 2011 indicated that culture supernatants of p putida and e coli reduced afb1 concentration by 76 2 and 62 5 respectively while the application of cells was less effective 69 3 and 58 8 respectively wang et al 2017b indicated that the supernatant of the microbial consortium tadc7 was able to degrade afb1 to a greater extent than cell pellets and cell extract similarly enzymes generally showed higher degradation rates compared to microorganisms for example loi et al 2016 indicated that the lac2 laccase from pleurotus pulmonarius could degrade afb1 and afm1 by 90 and 100 respectively while guo et al 2020 reported that the cota laccase from bacillus licheniformis degraded afb1 by 96 the greater ability of supernatants and recombinant enzymes to degrade aflatoxins compared to cells may be due to the difficulty of certain microorganisms to grow and proliferate in the absence of nutrients in aqueous medium this limits the practical application of microorganisms some of the methods were carried out in 25 100 ml solutions elsanhoty et al 2016 garcia bejar et al 2020 suggesting that they can be implemented at full scale however most methods involved the control of ph using buffers to achieve optimal reaction conditions this is an important limitation for full scale applications changes in the ph of surface water may have negative impacts on ecosystems although the methods using irradiation were applied for less than 1 h the methods involving microorganisms required several hours for example watanakij et al 2020 applied bacillus subtilis bcc 42 005 for 2 h while elsanhoty et al 2016 and halttunen et al 2008 used different combinations of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus for 5 h as in the case of the microorganisms the enzymatic reactions were extended for several hours for example the ery4 laccase from pleurotus eryngii was applied for 3 d loi et al 2018 while the peroxidase from a rusticana and the cota laccase from b licheniformis were applied for 8 and 12 h respectively guo et al 2020 sibaja et al 2019 these long degradation times may involve long degradation processes limiting the amount of decontaminated water which is an important disadvantage compared to the irradiation methods as in the case of irradiation all screenings using microorganisms were carried out using concentrations ranging from 0 1 mg l to 2 g l elaasser and el kassas 2011 elsanhoty et al 2016 which are higher than the concentrations of aflatoxins commonly found in water excluding the β glucanase from p norvegensis cell wall utama et al 2021 the rest of the enzymes were oxidoreductases mainly laccases and peroxidases which may involve the formation of radicals as in the case of external gamma and uv irradiations for this reason aflatoxins degradation rates may be dependent on the concentrations used further research is necessary to confirm that the reported microorganisms and enzymes are able to degrade aflatoxins at μg l and ng l scales all screenings were performed using microbial concentrations between 1 106 and 1 5 1010 cells ml which are bacterial concentrations easily produced in culture and for this reason the preparation procedures may not involve complex steps an important handicap when using the bacterial strains is that they showed optimal degradation activities at 37 40 ºc which suggests that the application of bacteria may require heating to achieve high degradation rates in contrast degradation using yeasts k lactis cbs 2359 s cerevisiae atcc 9763 was carried out at 30 ºc moustafa et al 2017 the strict control of the temperature during the treatments involves the use of thermostatic water tanks that may increase the costs limiting the practical use of microorganisms and enzymes the reported results using enzymes suggest that some enzymes degrade several aflatoxins this is an important advantage compared to gamma and uv irradiations which could only be used to degrade afb1 for example the peroxidase from aspergillus parasiticus nrrl 2999 was used to degrade afb1 and afg1 doyle and marth 1978 the peroxidase from a rusticana and the lac2 laccase from p pulmonarius was used to degrade afb1 and afm1 sibaja et al 2019 and the β glucanase from pichia norvegensis cell wall was used to degrade afb1 and afb2 utama et al 2021 3 3 degradation of aflatoxins by chemical treatments three different types of chemical agents have been used for the degradation of aflatoxins including acids oxidizing chemicals and plant extracts supplementary material table s3 the main problem posed by chemical treatments is that combining substances with water alters water s composition it must be noted that the addition of acids involves water acidification and is thus not suitable for surface or drinking water the addition of chemical compounds to surface water may alter the ecosystem showing important negative consequences for the environment in addition to human health risks apart from these critical points some chemicals could degrade aflatoxins achieving high degradation rates and could be used for the degradation of afb1 and afb2 this is an important advantage compared to gamma and uv irradiations which could only be used to degrade afb1 for example citric acid degraded afb1 by 80 rushing and selim 2016 while aiko et al 2015 indicated that 1 m lactic acid degraded afb1 by 85 1 other organic acids such as acetic acid ascorbic acid and formic acid only allowed degradation rates under 50 rushing and selim 2016 along with the lack of efficient degradation some acids required concentrations that were too high for practical use doyle et al 1982 for example pons et al 1972 used 6 n sulfuric acid for the degradation of afb1 and afm1 regarding the oxidizing agents various research groups have studied the degradation ability of ozone luo et al 2013 although ozone degraded afb1 and afg1 by 100 it did not efficiently degrade afb2 29 6 17 4 or afg2 53 9 42 1 agriopoulou et al 2016 ozone has been proposed as an efficient reagent to reduce the concentrations of foodborne pathogens and toxins in water due to its ability to degrade to o2 morrison et al 2022 ozone agriopoulou et al 2016 and gamma irradiation mutluer and erkoc 1987 were the only methods that allowed the complete degradation of afb1 and afg1 it has been indicated that the double bond of the terminal furan ring and the lactone ring of afb1 are the main toxicological groups in the structure and its toxicity decreases when these groups are modified mao et al 2018 wang et al 2011 as it can be seen in fig 2 these functional groups were modified in most degradation products despite these results only a few studies regarding the toxicity of the degradation products can be found in the literature afbo which is a degradation product obtained using ozone and ultrasound has been reported to show more reactivity and toxicity than afb1 do and choi 2007 although the methods based on ozone and ultrasound treatments showed high degradation rates liu et al 2019 luo et al 2013 they must be discarded as suitable alternatives for the removal of afb1 due to the high toxicity of afbo some degradation products such as afm1 and afp1 showed slightly less toxicity than afb1 however these are also considered a threat to human health wu et al 2009 interestingly some degradation products show very low toxicity and can be considered safe for example 3a 8a dihydro 6 methoxyfuro 2 3 b benzofuran 4 ol was detected as the main degradation product when using the cota laccase from b licheniformis and this compound did not reduce the viability of l 02 cells guo et al 2020 after treatment with 100 μm afb1 the apoptosis rate of l 02 cells reached 41 whereas 3a 8a dihydro 6 methoxyfuro 2 3 b benzofuran 4 ol did not significantly induce apoptosis in l 02 cells compared to the control treatment afb2a which was obtained as the main degradation product after the application of uv and gamma irradiations and organic acids aiko et al 2015 rushing and selim 2018 did not have any mutagenic effect and showed 200 times less hepatotoxicity compared to afb1 shen and singh 2021 these results suggest that not all degradation products show low toxicity for this reason it is necessary to identify and evaluate the toxicity of the degradation products to guarantee the absence of toxicity after the application of the degradation methods this is an important disadvantage compared to the absorption methods which allow the removal of the aflatoxins some methods involved the use of natural nontoxic compounds for example loi et al 2016 studied the degradation of afb1 and afm1 after treatment with oxidizing chemicals acetosyringone 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid abts and syringaldehyde all these oxidizing agents allowed the degradation of afm1 by 100 while the degradation rates for afb1 ranged from 70 to 90 acetosyringone and syringaldehyde are especially interesting since these compounds are natural and nontoxic and for this reason might be a suitable alternative for aflatoxin degradation acetosyringone and syringaldehyde were applied at only 10 mm some specific plant extracts allowed high degradation rates for example the application of corymbia citriodora leaf extract degraded afb1 and afb2 by 95 21 and 95 95 after 3 d iram et al 2015 ocimum basilicum leaf extract degraded afb1 and afb2 by 90 4 and 88 6 while trachyspermum ammi seed extract degraded afb1 and afb2 by 92 8 and 91 9 iram et al 2016a 2016b a possible effect of natural compounds on water is that they change its sensory attributes however no study regarding the effects of natural substances on water sensory attributes was reported to date chemical treatments were extended between 1 and 5 days which is much longer than the irradiation methods and the treatments using microorganisms and enzymes these long treatment periods may have limitations for practical use making them unsuitable for the decontamination process aflatoxins concentrations were in the μg l range which suggests that these methods can be used for the concentrations commonly observed in surface and drinking water bodies except for ozone which was applied in 50 ml solutions agriopoulou et al 2016 the rest of the methods were applied only in μl scale solutions this is probably because natural compounds and plant extracts are usually expensive which is another important limitation for full scale use 3 4 adsorption of aflatoxins some methods were based on the use of adsorbents to remove aflatoxins from aqueous solutions supplementary material table s4 the efficacy of the adsorbents was measured according to the adsorption capacity amount of aflatoxin adsorbed per gram of adsorbent and the removal efficiency percent of aflatoxin removed from the aqueous solution in the screenings minerals biosorbents synthetic polymers and carbon based adsorbents were used an important fact that must be considered is that the adsorption techniques allow the removal of the aflatoxins while the degradation of the aflatoxins produces other compounds that sometimes also pose some toxicity pons et al 1972 although the compounds can be adsorbed and thus removed from water the fate of these adsorbents is also questionable even if the aflatoxins can be desorbed from the clays they must be degraded in a subsequent step to avoid contaminating the environment again the adsorbents used in the studies were cheap and their large scale use is possible additionally the used adsorbents will not contaminate water and the adsorption was achieved in only a few hours unfortunately all studies focused on the adsorption of afb1 and thus the ability of these minerals to adsorb other aflatoxins remains unexplored some of the highest removal and adsorption capacities were observed when using minerals such as bentonite montmorillonite and silica phillips et al 1988 wang et al 2019a the results obtained when using minerals varied according to their composition gallo and masoero 2010 reported that magnesium and calcium bentonites removed afb1 by 92 and 90 respectively while sodium bentonite only removed afb1 by 50 rasheed et al 2020 studied the combination of bentonite and orange peel removing 97 afb1 from aqueous solutions li et al 2022 reported the synthesis of flower like mesoporous magnesium silicate composites from sepiolite that were able to adsorb afb1 by 100 although several research groups used clays to adsorb aflatoxins only a few reports predicted the sorption mechanism mousivand et al 2022 kang et al 2016 indicated that a strong calcium bridging linkage co 2 ca2 osi 4 is involved in afb1 smectite adsorption fig 6 thus it seems that the two keto groups in positions 11 and 14 play a key role in the interactions with the clays deng et al 2010 for this reason the presence of metals in the clay may play an important role in the adsorption behavior some of the adsorption capacities when using minerals were 100 times higher than the adsorption capacities obtained with other adsorbents demonstrating the high adsorption potential of mineral clays for the decontamination of aflatoxins commercial montmorillonites novasil saz 1 and swy 2 had adsorption capacities of 200 200 and 300 mg g respectively jaynes and zartman 2011 jaynes et al 2007 whereas carnitine and chlorine amended montmorillonites showed adsorption capacities of 118 7 mg g wang et al 2017a 2019b calcium aminosilicate and smectites showed adsorption capacities of 103 and 134 28 262 35 mg g respectively alam et al 2015 arvide et al 2008 deng et al 2012 grant and phillips 1998 the ph of water to be purified was found to play a key role in the adsorption capacity aluminum iron pillared montmorillonite showed higher adsorption capacity at alkaline ph values than at acid ph values zeng et al 2013 while smectite was able to adsorb afb1 to a greater extent at ph 7 than at ph 3 barrientos velazquez et al 2016 this suggests that the ph can modify the mineral structure and thus alter mineral aflatoxin interactions as it has been indicated throughout the review changes in ph can affect natural ecosystems and the addition of chemicals to adjust the ph may change the composition of drinking water which is an important limitation for practical use in a few cases sorbents based on plant tissues were employed karmanov et al 2020 screened the adsorption capacity of lignin from different sources observing the highest removal efficiencies when using the lignin from althaea officinalis 80 2 and rhododendron tomentosum 79 6 the highest removal efficiency was detected when using durian durio zibthinus peel 98 4 showing an adsorption capacity of 13 mg g at ph 7 which is 10 to 40 times lower than some adsorption capacities observed with minerals adunphatcharaphon et al 2020 to illustrate montmorillonites were used at concentrations ranging from 10 to 600 mg l jaynes et al 2007 wang et al 2020 whereas durian peel had to be used at 5 g l concentration to achieve efficient removal unfortunately the potential ability of other fruit peels to adsorb aflatoxins remains unexplored it must be noted that fruit peels are commonly discarded and for this reason could be suitable for the low cost removal of aflatoxins apart from plant sources some research groups used yeast cells for their aflatoxin adsorption abilities goncalves et al 2015 luo et al 2020 in general the adsorption capacity observed with yeast cells was too low to be considered an actual alternative for example the binding abilities of eighteen s cerevisiae strains were tested in vitro and were able to remove afb1 by 10 40 shetty et al 2007 an important limitation of mineral clays and biosorbents is that they cannot be easily molded which limits their application in water flows for this reason the adsorption of aflatoxins using these materials must be carried out in water tanks to overcome this limitation some research groups have explored the filtration of aflatoxins in pipes using synthetic polymers as membranes fig 7 chattopadhyay 2016 in this regard zhang et al 2021a used a nanofiltration membrane functionalized by catechol amine to remove 90 afb1 whereas li et al 2018b employed a multifunctional membrane based on a polydopamine intermediate layer to remove 71 afb1 this is an interesting approach to simplifying aflatoxin decontamination from a technical point of view after reaching their adsorption capacity limit old membranes can be replaced by new ones in contrast with minerals and fruit peels synthetic polymers can be easily molded into different shapes and sizes although minerals and durian peel showed interesting adsorption parameters these adsorbents were mixed with the solution and thus subsequent filtration procedures are necessary to remove them from water even though polyvinyl alcohol pva had the highest removal efficiency among synthetic polymers 97 5 removal efficacy towards afb1 taha et al 2017 this material has never been employed as a pipe membrane which is an important gap that must be addressed in future research unfortunately studies regarding the adsorption capacity of synthetic polymers are lacking li et al 2021 developed a hybrid sponge of melamine foam and metal organic framework that was used to adsorb afb1 by 90 and showed an adsorption capacity of 15 8 mg g this adsorption capacity is significantly lower than that observed for some mineral clays 100 mg g as far as we know this is the only report that has examined the adsorption capacity of a synthetic polymer this is an important parameter for understanding the maximum adsorption capacity of membranes and by extension their applicability carbon based adsorbents showed generally high adsorption efficiencies perez gomez et al 2022 zahoor and khan 2018 although the methods using minerals biosorbents and synthetic polymers required several hours the methods using carbon based adsorbents were applied for only a few minutes this is an important advantage to reduce the time of the decontamination process for example cortes et al 2019 reported the use of carbon xerogel microspheres functionalized and non functionalized with phosphoric acid for 15 min for the adsorption of 100 afb1 when applied for 1 h a porous carbon material made from fe doped zif 8 eliminated afb1 by 99 88 zhang et al 2022b the adsorption capacity of activated carbon was estimated to be 200 mg g jaynes et al 2007 which is comparable to that of mineral clays activated carbon is frequently used to decontaminate organic compounds from water thus activated carbon based filters which are already installed in numerous industries and residential areas may be a suitable method for preventing aflatoxin contamination however the efficacy of activated carbon to decontaminate in flow systems remains unexplored which is an important gap that must be filled in future studies it would be interesting to explore the adsorption behavior of activated carbon towards other aflatoxins besides afb1 an important feature to ensure the reutilization of the adsorbents is their ability to desorb aflatoxins the desorption capacities of lignin karmanov et al 2020 durian peel adunphatcharaphon et al 2020 synthetic polymers li et al 2018b and different mineral clays phillips et al 1988 wang et al 2019a were evaluated for example afb1 was first adsorbed onto durian peel at ph 3 and could be desorbed by washing with a buffer at ph 7 adunphatcharaphon et al 2020 desorption of afb1 from a polymeric sandwich structured membrane could be performed using acetate buffer at ph 5 with a removal efficiency of 61 8 after five cycles wu et al 2020 this is an important advantage of mineral clays biosorbents and synthetic polymers over activated carbon where aflatoxins cannot be easily desorbed and thus carbon based adsorbents cannot be reutilized 4 conclusions and perspectives although the reported results suggest that people are regularly ingesting low concentrations of aflatoxins from water the consequences of this situation are unclear unfortunately legislation has largely ignored this issue and there are no maximum limits for aflatoxins in water it is critical to standardize analysis and removal methods to control the release of aflatoxin contaminated wastewater into the environment even though some approaches demonstrate high decontamination rates there is still work to be done to translate these findings into viable commercial techniques none of the reported degradation techniques were implemented at full scale certain degradation products showed high toxicity some methods required the addition of metals and salts or the regulation of ph rendering them impractical using synthetic polymers and activated carbon based membranes appears to be a suitable technique to decontaminate water flows although some methods efficiently adsorb afb1 there is no information regarding their adsorption ability for other aflatoxins the presence of aflatoxins in water is a potential concern to human health that local and international safety commissions are disregarding additionally epidemiological data comparing the effects of aflatoxin infected water and food are insufficient further research is needed to understand the occurrence and consequences of aflatoxins in water sources on human health as well as to determine whether immediate actions are required declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

15020,aflatoxins are highly carcinogenic metabolites produced by some aspergillus species and are the most prevalent mycotoxins although aflatoxins are commonly synthesized during fungal colonization in preharvest maize cereals and nuts they can be transported by rainfall to surface water and are a common toxin found in wastewater from some food industries here the occurrence of aflatoxins in bodies of water is reviewed for the first time along with the decontamination methods aflatoxins have been detected in surface wastewater and drinking water including tap and bottled water the specific sources of water contamination remain unclear which is an important gap that must be addressed in future research two main kinds of decontamination methods have been reported including degradation and adsorption the best degradation rates were observed using gamma and uv irradiations oxidoreductases and ozone while the best adsorption abilities were observed with minerals polyvinyl alcohol durian peel and activated carbon synthetic polymers could be used as membranes in pipes to remove aflatoxins in water flows although most decontamination methods were screened using afb1 the other commonly found aflatoxins were not used in the screenings overall the occurrence of aflatoxins in water could be a significant emerging public health concern largely ignored by local and international legislation numerous advances have been reported for the decontamination of aflatoxins in water however there is still a long way to go to put them into practice keywords mycotoxins organic contaminants aspergillus degradation adsorption data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction aflatoxins are the most predominantly occurring mycotoxins udomkun et al 2017 and are produced by some aspergillus species mainly a flavus and a parasiticus caceres et al 2020 although there are more than 20 different forms of naturally occurring aflatoxins afb1 is the most common and toxic ji and xie 2020 aflatoxins are mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds that have been implicated as causative agents in human hepatic and extrahepatic carcinogenesis kumar et al 2017 aflatoxins form deoxyribonucleic acid dna adducts with guanine inducing the formation of cancerous cells benkerroum 2020 aspergillus species are highly ubiquitous fungi that can easily spread by spores and colonize a variety of hosts krijgsheld et al 2013 fig 1 food contamination caused by aflatoxins commonly occurs in cereals nuts beans and fruits as well as in edible oils krska et al 2022 high relative humidity and the presence of water during storage play a key role in the appearance of aflatoxins in postharvest products rushing and selim 2019 an increase in aflatoxins has been observed during the last few years likely due to climatic change which has stimulated the appearance of new combinations of mycotoxins host plants geographical areas and has enhanced the ability of aspergillus species to produce aflatoxins gruber dorninger et al 2019 moretti et al 2019 although aflatoxins are accumulated in aspergillus infected plant tissues they are easily dispersed in soil and water systems through aqueous carriers such as rainfall juraschek et al 2022 contamination can occur in water storage transportation and wastewater from the food supply chains al gabr et al 2014 picardo et al 2020 yan and persaud 2019 although the concentrations of aflatoxins in water are usually low the long term consumption of contaminated water can still become a significant threat to human health picardo et al 2019 the presence of mycotoxins in food and feed has been extensively studied and yet relatively little is known about their environmental fate and their occurrence in water systems here the occurrence of aflatoxins in water and the developed decontamination strategies are reviewed the risks of aflatoxins presence in drinking water and the efficacy of the different methods to remove them are discussed throughout the manuscript this is the first review to our knowledge that summarizes the current state of literature on aflatoxins in water 2 occurrence and risks of aflatoxins in water 2 1 stability of aflatoxins in water aflatoxins show relatively high stability in aqueous solutions oliveira et al 2018 it has been indicated that afb1 and afb2 showed higher stability compared to afg1 and afg2 diaz et al 2012 the degradation rate of afb1 in water in a 5 ng l solution at room temperature was 31 3 after 24 h while the degradation of afb2 was 40 9 under the same conditions some authors have reported that afb1 rapidly degrades into afb2 and afg2 with half lives of a few days accinelli et al 2008 fig 2 it has been indicated that afb1 is the natural aflatoxin with the highest toxicity followed by afg1 afb2 and afg2 tahir et al 2018 in fact afb1 is the only aflatoxin that has been classified as a human carcinogen by the international agency for research on cancer as an important comparison of the carcinogenic activity of aflatoxins butler et al 1969 indicated that 2 mg afb1 and afg1 produced liver tumors in 19 and 6 out of 30 rats respectively while no liver tumors were detected when supplying afb2 afb1 poisoning can cause not only liver and kidney damage in humans and animals but can also cause testicular malformations lin et al 2022 afm1 and afm2 are typical dehydration products of afb1 and afb2 in aqueous medium and following digestion by mammals campagnollo et al 2016 flores flores et al 2015 afm1 and afm2 show less toxicity than their precursors tahir et al 2018 however the levels of afm1 in milk have been restricted since it shows relevant toxicity these reports suggest that toxicity rapidly decreases as the most common aflatoxin afb1 degrades to less toxic ones however some findings suggest that these compounds can remain for months murugesan et al 2021 afb1 degraded to afb2 in mud with afb1 undetected after 4 days however afb2 was still present after 77 days this relatively long degradation time gives these compounds a chance to be transported to drinking water sources it also indicates that the standard transportation and storage periods of drinking water less than one week are insufficient to guarantee the complete degradation of aflatoxins 2 2 legislated levels of aflatoxin in water according to the u s food and drug administration the maximum allowable aflatoxin levels are 300 μg kg for finishing cattle swine and poultry and 20 μg kg for all other animals the european union usa and brazil have established maximum levels for aflatoxin in fish feed at 10 20 and 50 μg kg gomes et al 2022 whereas the european commission has recommended a limit for afm1 of only 0 050 μg kg in milk kunter et al 2017 the european union has set maximum permitted levels for afb1 in nuts dried fruits cereals and spices that range from 2 to 12 µg kg while the maximum permitted level for afb1 in infant foods is set at 0 1 µg kg yu et al 2013 although the maximum levels of aflatoxins in some food products including maize cereals nuts and fish are well established in all countries specifications have not been made for drinking or bathing water thus it seems that the presence of aflatoxins in some food products is considered a relevant safety problem but the same considerations have not been made for water wastewater from the agricultural and food industries is probably contaminating surface water systems which at the same time may be a source of aflatoxins in municipal and drinking water however no ordinances have been developed to regulate aflatoxins levels in different water systems it must be noted that contamination of fish with aflatoxins is a safety issue considered by most commissions and this is caused by the ingestion of both aflatoxin contaminated feed and water manjengwa et al 2019 indicating that the legislation is relatively inconsistent and contradictory when ignoring the potential presence of aflatoxins in water bodies given that aflatoxin levels in water are not yet regulated drinking water producers must refer to the general aflatoxin guidance levels generally food safety commissions designate limits on the levels of afb1 but largely ignore the other aflatoxins even if they also pose considerable toxicity with the exception of the legislation from the european commission which includes afb1 afb2 afg1 afg2 and afm1 european commission food safety 2022 the general maximum levels for afb1 are stricter in the european union 4 μg kg than in other countries such as china 50 μg kg japan 10 μg kg and the usa 20 μg kg considering that the direct toxic effects of afb1 are commonly observed at more than 200 μg kg yang et al 2022 the maximum limits established in all countries seem to guarantee the safety of the consumed products however the effects of continued exposure to low aflatoxin concentrations in humans need further exploration for example animal experiments show that piglets with chronic aflatoxin exposure of 70 and 140 μg kg are more prone to diarrheal disease experience more severe symptoms and are more likely to die than piglets without such exposure williams et al 2004 the levels of aflatoxins in maize in haiti were reported to be up to 20 μg kg and have been associated with the high rates of cancer in the country schwartzbord et al 2013 these reports suggest that the continuous consumption of aflatoxins from water sources may be a potential threat to human health picardo et al 2019 2 3 occurrence and concentrations of aflatoxins in water although the presence of aflatoxins in water and food products has often been related to developing african countries tantaoui elaraki et al 2018 several reports have demonstrated that aflatoxins are also present in water sources from developed countries such as spain picardo et al 2020 portugal viegas et al 2014 and the united kingdom paterson et al 1997 table 1 suggesting that this is a worldwide problem unfortunately only a few reports regarding the occurrence of aflatoxins in water bodies can be found in the literature suggesting that unknown hazardous situations may be happening in several countries extensive screenings would be required to obtain a complete overview of the occurrence and concentrations of aflatoxins as mentioned in the previous section aflatoxins maximum levels in water have not yet been regulated however aflatoxins have been found in surface water manjengwa et al 2019 wastewater fandohan et al 2005 and drinking water mata et al 2015 fig 3 this indicates that the development of standardized analysis methods for the determination of aflatoxins in water as well as the designation of maximum safe levels are important gaps that must be urgently reconsidered by the local and international food safety commissions 2 3 1 aflatoxins in surface water systems the transportation of aflatoxins can lead to water contamination madden and stahr 1993 it has been indicated that aflatoxins can be transported from contaminated plants and soil to groundwater juraschek et al 2022 although leaching risks from soils into deep sitting groundwater are considered low exceptions may be expected for well structured soils with preferential flow paths or after heavy rains aflatoxins have been detected in surface water for example aflatoxins have been detected in the ter river in spain and in lake chivero in zimbabwe manjengwa et al 2019 picardo et al 2020 nevertheless the higher concentration of afb1 in the ter river 0 26 0 39 μg l compared to lake chivero 0 005 0 003 μg l may be due to the fact that samples from the ter river were collected from an urbanized area whereas samples from lake chivero were collected from a natural environment al gabr et al 2013 also reported the presence of aflatoxins in xiamen s rivers and lakes although only three studies regarding the occurrence of aflatoxins in surface water have been reported these three reports suggest that the occurrence of aflatoxins in the surface water is common and this contamination may be especially common when the water bodies are located near urbanized industrial or agricultural areas it must be noted that although surface water is not directly ingested it is sometimes used for bathing clothes washing and other recreational activities thus the presence of aflatoxins in surface water bodies may also pose an important safety hazard in addition to the possibility of aflatoxins being transported by rainfall and deposited in water bodies some reports have examined the inoculation of aflatoxin producing strains in water al gabr et al 2012 banu et al 2016 for example oliveira et al 2018 described the inoculation of fungi and its growth in untreated surface water detecting afb1 and afb2 at concentrations up to 35 ng l after the inoculation aflatoxigenic a flavus strains could grow in paddies and aflatoxin accumulation was negatively correlated with the concentration of co2 in the paddies mousa et al 2016 similarly afb2 and afg1 were detected in rice paddies in vietnam at 1 0 2 2 and 3 1 μg l respectively phan et al 2021 it has been indicated that summer warming promoted cyanobacterial algal bloom and created the optimal conditions for the growth of molds and fungi al gabr et al 2014 although the ability of aspergillus to colonize algae may partially explain the presence of aflatoxins in surface water no related study has been published to date although aflatoxins were the most common mycotoxins found in bottled water the genera cladosporium fusarium and penicillium were the fungi more frequently detected mata et al 2015 that last report together with the low concentrations of aflatoxins after inoculation of aspergillus in water suggest that the presence of aspergillus in water must not be the main source of contamination but that contamination occurs when aflatoxins are dragged from plants however further research is necessary to identify the aflatoxin sources and how they arrive to surface water systems 2 3 2 aflatoxins in wastewater it has been reported that wastewater from the food industry is an important source of aflatoxins magan and aldred 2007 viegas et al 2014 identified several aspergillus strains in two portuguese wastewater treatment plants fandohan et al 2005 indicated that the amount of aflatoxins was significantly reduced during maize processing and these aflatoxin residues were accumulated in the wastewater which could contain aflatoxin concentrations as high as 1 42 0 06 μg l it must be noted that this concentration is higher than that detected in surface water systems and is near the maximum legislated levels of the european union 4 μg l paterson et al 1997 detected afb2 and afg2 at 0 2 1 8 and 0 1 0 3 μg l respectively in cold water storage tanks in the united kingdom while kadaifciler and demirel 2017 detected aflatoxins in cold water tanks in turkey it has been indicated that water contamination in fish farms is usually produced by the addition of contaminated feed to water mwihia et al 2018 the contamination of water with aflatoxins seems to increase aflatoxins accumulation in fish and these pose important hazards to human health afb1 was detected in catfish at 31 38 0 29 μg kg in cameroon which is higher than the maximum legislated levels tsafack takadong et al 2020 in contrast with humans wherein afb1 is transformed into afm1 and the latter is accumulated in breast milk and urine afb1 seems to remain stable in fish bedoya serna et al 2018 this is an important problem due to the toxicity of afb1 being much higher than that of afm1 although all studies were carried out in fish farms wild fish from contaminated surface water may also be an important source of aflatoxins although wastewater aflatoxins are not directly ingested by humans they can have very different environmental fates contaminating surface water soil and diverse organisms if wastewater is not properly decontaminated this is also an important gap in the local and international policies which do not consider the potential presence of aflatoxins in wastewater and their release into the environment food industries related to commonly contaminated products such as maize nuts and cereals must be an important source of aflatoxin contaminated wastewater to prevent the spread of aflatoxins it is necessary to standardize analysis methods and removal procedures for aflatoxins in wastewater 2 3 3 aflatoxins in drinking water surprisingly mata et al 2015 reported the presence of afb1 afb2 afg1 and afg2 in commercial bottled water in portugal at 0 22 0 70 0 18 0 42 0 42 0 60 and 0 16 0 48 μg l similarly trung et al 2020 reported the presence of afb1 afb2 and afg2 in bottled water in vietnam afb1 afm1 afg1 and afg2 were detected in 50 9 9 and 46 respectively of drinking water samples analyzed in south africa however the concentrations only ranged from 0 to 3 18 ng l mhlongo et al 2020 aflatoxins were detected in hand dug wells in nigeria shittu et al 2022 and in municipal and tap water in china nigeria and turkey al gabr et al 2013 amadi ikpa et al 2021 kadaifciler and demirel 2018 zhang et al 1995 in all cases aflatoxins were detected under the maximum limits the concentrations of aflatoxins in drinking water were in the ng l scale which is lower than those detected in wastewater and surface water bodies in the μg l scale although the previous reports were related to the presence of aflatoxins in drinking water for human consumption some studies have confirmed the presence of aflatoxins in animal farms for example diab et al 2021 reported the occurrence of afb1 at 7 97 μg l concentration in camel farm dwellings in egypt while khalid et al 2018 reported the presence of aflatoxins in animal drinking water in pakistani farms continuous consumption of aflatoxins from drinking water can result in the accumulation of aflatoxins in animal products such as meat and milk posing a potential health risk consequently the presence of aflatoxins in drinking water on farms should also be controlled the presence of aflatoxins in wastewater and surface water bodies can potentially be considered a safety hazard but the presence of aflatoxins in drinking water is a direct safety hazard since this water is meant to be ingested the presence of aflatoxins in bottled and tap water mata et al 2015 mhlongo et al 2020 indicates that aflatoxins occur in drinking water and that in some areas people are continuously ingesting aflatoxins infected water further research is necessary to identify and control aflatoxin contaminated drinking water bodies and understand the effects they are producing on human health it must be noted that the amounts of aflatoxins reported in bottled water are lower than the general limits mata et al 2015 but higher than the aflatoxin limits established for milk 0 050 μg kg it has been speculated that a person consumes more than 800 l of drinking water per year while the average worldwide consumption of maize is only 18 8 kg per capita per year considering that the concentrations of aflatoxins in bottled water were higher than 0 16 μg l a person who consumes 2 l of water per day ingests more than of 0 32 μg aflatoxins only from drinking water mata et al 2015 given that daily intakes of aflatoxins ranging from 0 127 to 0 195 μg per day were found to be directly related to the presence of primary liver cancer in china yu et al 1998 it can be concluded that the ingestion of aflatoxins from water may be a significant cause of cancer and in some areas may be higher than the ingestion of aflatoxins from food products in fact zhang et al 1995 related the presence of afb1 in drinking water to the high ratio of stomach cancer in zanhuang county china although aflatoxins were detected in different drinking water systems the source of these aflatoxins remains unexplored as indicated in section 3 2 1 aspergillus strains have been reported to colonize water and synthesize aflatoxins in aqueous solutions thus the presence of aspergillus strains contaminating water storage transportation and filling systems is the most likely source however it is also possible that the surface water is contaminated with aflatoxins and the residues end up in drinking water and thus in humans for example picardo et al 2020 identified aflatoxins in the surface water of the river ter which is used as the drinking water catchment area for the barcelona metropolitan area it must be noted that water potabilization process involves several filtration and decantation steps followed by oxidation with chloride unfortunately no study regarding the stability of aflatoxins in the presence of chloride and degradation products has been reported to date which is an important gap that must be addressed in future studies as indicated below some oxidizing agents allow for high degradation rates but sometimes these result in degradation products that show high toxicity levels 3 strategies for the removal of aflatoxins from water 3 1 degradation of aflatoxins with external irradiation although most mycotoxins are easily degraded when heated aflatoxins show high thermal stability wu et al 2022 for this reason several research groups have developed alternative methods for the decontamination of aflatoxins from water the methods for the removal of aflatoxins in water can be divided into 2 groups guo et al 2021 including degradation sections 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 and adsorption section 3 4 techniques gamma and uv irradiations visible light microwaves ultrasound pulsed electric fields and high hydrostatic pressure have been used to degrade aflatoxins in aqueous solution supplementary material table s1 although dried aflatoxins are extremely radioresistant the oxidative radicals that originate from radiolysis in solution make aflatoxins highly sensitive to irradiation samuel et al 2022 fig 4 methods using gamma and uv irradiation achieved in some cases some of the highest degradation rates observed throughout the reports mutluer and erkoc 1987 patel et al 1989 the higher the potential of the irradiation the higher the degradation rate mutluer and erkoc 1987 the degradation rates of afb1 using uv light were slightly lower 70 98 compared to those obtained after the application of gamma irradiation 100 which may be due to gamma rays higher intensity moreau et al 2013 studied the degradation of afb1 after the application of pulsing light observing degradation rates of 29 9 and 92 7 after 1 and 8 flashes respectively while the application of ultrasound 20 khz degraded afb1 by up to 96 5 after 50 min liu et al 2019 in general the degradation rates following application of visible light were lower than those observed with gamma and uv irradiations and visible light degradation required the addition of metals for example mao et al 2018 employed wo3 nanowires for the degradation of afb1 observing 92 4 degradation after 120 min zhang et al 2022a degraded afb1 by 98 9 after 80 min using tio2 uio 67 although the application of visible light implies an important advantage over gamma and uv irradiations given that visible light can be natural and does not involve the use of special lamps the addition of metals to water may result in contamination and some of the metals used such as u 67 are radioactive and too expensive for large scale use the degradation rates using microwaves were low 74 degradation rate after 30 min and required heating 140 ºc zhang et al 2021b an important advantage of gamma irradiation uv and visible light based techniques over microwaves is that they do not require heating when considering commercial use the heating of large quantities of water may involve the use of special equipment the use of microwaves and ultrasound shows some important advantages over gamma irradiation as exposure to the latter one can increase cancer risk in humans which may be dangerous when using large scale water deposits in fact the experiments with gamma irradiation were carried out in μl scale interestingly the application of uv could be performed using 100 ml solutions zhang et al 2021b which suggests that uv can be applied at full scale in a safe manner the application of high hydrostatic pressure and pulsed electric fields to large volumes of water is hampered by significant technological obstacles limiting its practical application in fact these methods were carried out using only 1 ml solutions although the methods using a uv ultrasound and microwaves required treatment of 30 100 min liu et al 2009 2010 patras et al 2017 zhang et al 2021b the use of uv radiation using leds reduced the application time to only 156 s stanley et al 2020 leds can be a suitable option not only for reducing application times but also for controlling the wavelength and intensity of irradiation thereby allowing the optimization of degradation conditions although the degradation rate with ultrasound treatment was 96 5 when using 200 mg l afb1 the degradation rate decreased to only 85 1 when using 10 mg l afb1 liu et al 2019 although most degradation methods used afb1 at a concentration of mg l the concentrations found in surface water wastewater and drinking water were in the μg l or ng l range this is an important limitation in all studies it has been shown that degradation is facilitated by the conversion of aflatoxins into their corresponding radicals calado et al 2014 and as a result it is expected that higher concentrations of aflatoxins may allow for higher degradation rates although the degradation rates for afb1 and afg1 were 100 after applying 20 kgy the degradation rates for afb2 and afg2 were only 9 2 and 35 6 mutluer and erkoc 1987 similarly patras et al 2017 indicated that uv irradiation degraded afg1 afb2 and afb1 by 67 22 29 77 and 98 25 respectively thus gamma and uv follow a similar trend wherein afb1 degrades faster than afg1 and afb2 stanley et al 2020 indicated that uv irradiation degraded afm1 to a greater extent 84 1 95 than afb1 70 0 27 these results support the indication that irradiation can successfully degrade some aflatoxins while others remain stable for this reason gamma and uv irradiation can be used for the selective removal of some aflatoxins unfortunately the screenings with visible light ultrasound and microwaves employed only afb1 and not other aflatoxins this important gap must be addressed in future work in contrast with uv and gamma irradiations pulsed electric fields did not efficiently degrade afb1 30 degradation pallares et al 2021 however afb2 and afg1 were degraded by 75 and 84 respectively after the application of a pulsed electric field when applying high hydrostatic pressure the highest degradation rates were observed for afb2 61 afg1 87 and afg2 85 suggesting that high hydrostatic pressure can be a suitable complement for gamma and uv irradiations to achieve the degradation of all types of aflatoxins 3 2 degradation of aflatoxins using microorganisms and enzymes some research groups examined the degradation of aflatoxins using microorganisms including bacteria and yeasts and enzymes isolated from different microorganisms supplementary material table s2 although the application of non aflatoxigenic aspergillus strains is arising as a suitable method for the decontamination of crops and food products ismail et al 2018 this method has never been explored for the decontamination of water in fact filamentous fungi have never been used for aflatoxin decontamination in water which is an important gap that must be addressed in future research in general the degradation rates obtained when using microorganisms were lower than those observed when using gamma and uv irradiations patel et al 1989 patras et al 2017 although the addition of environmental microorganisms to water is inexpensive and may involve easy procedures the posterior removal of the microorganisms from water before drinking water consumption may be an important limitation it must be taken into account that some microorganisms used may be harmful or toxigenic by producing other toxins of health significance for example pseudomonas species adebo et al 2016 staphylococcus species and e coli elaasser and el kassas 2011 which were used in some methods are food borne pathogens and can cause illness this problem can be solved using enzymes whose activity rapidly decreases after a few hours and can be easily degraded and inactivated however the expression and purification of the enzymes involve additional steps and costs the addition of microorganisms could have applications in treating surface water and wastewater that are not going to be directly consumed before the application of microorganisms their potential toxicity to humans and the environment must be evaluated although higher degradation rates were generally observed with yeasts than with bacteria the efficacy was highly dependent on the specific strains moustafa et al 2017 studied the degradation of afb2 with the yeasts kluyveromyces lactis cbs 2359 and saccharomyces cerevisiae atcc 9763 97 5 degradation rate after 72 h bacterial strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg l rhamnosus lc705 nocardia asteroides ifm 8 and pseudomonas putida 12 3 degraded afb1 by 68 8 67 5 95 and 69 3 respectively arai et al 1967 el nezami et al 1998 elaasser and el kassas 2011 adebo et al 2016 reported that staphylococcus sp vgf2 degraded afb1 by 100 which is the highest degradation rate achieved among all reports most bacterial strains provided degradation rates lower than 60 elsanhoty et al 2016 halttunen et al 2008 although in most cases the cells were applied a few studies involved the use of culture supernatants fig 5 the degradation effect was attributed to the degrading enzymes that were secreted by the microorganisms for example elaasser and el kassas 2011 indicated that culture supernatants of p putida and e coli reduced afb1 concentration by 76 2 and 62 5 respectively while the application of cells was less effective 69 3 and 58 8 respectively wang et al 2017b indicated that the supernatant of the microbial consortium tadc7 was able to degrade afb1 to a greater extent than cell pellets and cell extract similarly enzymes generally showed higher degradation rates compared to microorganisms for example loi et al 2016 indicated that the lac2 laccase from pleurotus pulmonarius could degrade afb1 and afm1 by 90 and 100 respectively while guo et al 2020 reported that the cota laccase from bacillus licheniformis degraded afb1 by 96 the greater ability of supernatants and recombinant enzymes to degrade aflatoxins compared to cells may be due to the difficulty of certain microorganisms to grow and proliferate in the absence of nutrients in aqueous medium this limits the practical application of microorganisms some of the methods were carried out in 25 100 ml solutions elsanhoty et al 2016 garcia bejar et al 2020 suggesting that they can be implemented at full scale however most methods involved the control of ph using buffers to achieve optimal reaction conditions this is an important limitation for full scale applications changes in the ph of surface water may have negative impacts on ecosystems although the methods using irradiation were applied for less than 1 h the methods involving microorganisms required several hours for example watanakij et al 2020 applied bacillus subtilis bcc 42 005 for 2 h while elsanhoty et al 2016 and halttunen et al 2008 used different combinations of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus for 5 h as in the case of the microorganisms the enzymatic reactions were extended for several hours for example the ery4 laccase from pleurotus eryngii was applied for 3 d loi et al 2018 while the peroxidase from a rusticana and the cota laccase from b licheniformis were applied for 8 and 12 h respectively guo et al 2020 sibaja et al 2019 these long degradation times may involve long degradation processes limiting the amount of decontaminated water which is an important disadvantage compared to the irradiation methods as in the case of irradiation all screenings using microorganisms were carried out using concentrations ranging from 0 1 mg l to 2 g l elaasser and el kassas 2011 elsanhoty et al 2016 which are higher than the concentrations of aflatoxins commonly found in water excluding the β glucanase from p norvegensis cell wall utama et al 2021 the rest of the enzymes were oxidoreductases mainly laccases and peroxidases which may involve the formation of radicals as in the case of external gamma and uv irradiations for this reason aflatoxins degradation rates may be dependent on the concentrations used further research is necessary to confirm that the reported microorganisms and enzymes are able to degrade aflatoxins at μg l and ng l scales all screenings were performed using microbial concentrations between 1 106 and 1 5 1010 cells ml which are bacterial concentrations easily produced in culture and for this reason the preparation procedures may not involve complex steps an important handicap when using the bacterial strains is that they showed optimal degradation activities at 37 40 ºc which suggests that the application of bacteria may require heating to achieve high degradation rates in contrast degradation using yeasts k lactis cbs 2359 s cerevisiae atcc 9763 was carried out at 30 ºc moustafa et al 2017 the strict control of the temperature during the treatments involves the use of thermostatic water tanks that may increase the costs limiting the practical use of microorganisms and enzymes the reported results using enzymes suggest that some enzymes degrade several aflatoxins this is an important advantage compared to gamma and uv irradiations which could only be used to degrade afb1 for example the peroxidase from aspergillus parasiticus nrrl 2999 was used to degrade afb1 and afg1 doyle and marth 1978 the peroxidase from a rusticana and the lac2 laccase from p pulmonarius was used to degrade afb1 and afm1 sibaja et al 2019 and the β glucanase from pichia norvegensis cell wall was used to degrade afb1 and afb2 utama et al 2021 3 3 degradation of aflatoxins by chemical treatments three different types of chemical agents have been used for the degradation of aflatoxins including acids oxidizing chemicals and plant extracts supplementary material table s3 the main problem posed by chemical treatments is that combining substances with water alters water s composition it must be noted that the addition of acids involves water acidification and is thus not suitable for surface or drinking water the addition of chemical compounds to surface water may alter the ecosystem showing important negative consequences for the environment in addition to human health risks apart from these critical points some chemicals could degrade aflatoxins achieving high degradation rates and could be used for the degradation of afb1 and afb2 this is an important advantage compared to gamma and uv irradiations which could only be used to degrade afb1 for example citric acid degraded afb1 by 80 rushing and selim 2016 while aiko et al 2015 indicated that 1 m lactic acid degraded afb1 by 85 1 other organic acids such as acetic acid ascorbic acid and formic acid only allowed degradation rates under 50 rushing and selim 2016 along with the lack of efficient degradation some acids required concentrations that were too high for practical use doyle et al 1982 for example pons et al 1972 used 6 n sulfuric acid for the degradation of afb1 and afm1 regarding the oxidizing agents various research groups have studied the degradation ability of ozone luo et al 2013 although ozone degraded afb1 and afg1 by 100 it did not efficiently degrade afb2 29 6 17 4 or afg2 53 9 42 1 agriopoulou et al 2016 ozone has been proposed as an efficient reagent to reduce the concentrations of foodborne pathogens and toxins in water due to its ability to degrade to o2 morrison et al 2022 ozone agriopoulou et al 2016 and gamma irradiation mutluer and erkoc 1987 were the only methods that allowed the complete degradation of afb1 and afg1 it has been indicated that the double bond of the terminal furan ring and the lactone ring of afb1 are the main toxicological groups in the structure and its toxicity decreases when these groups are modified mao et al 2018 wang et al 2011 as it can be seen in fig 2 these functional groups were modified in most degradation products despite these results only a few studies regarding the toxicity of the degradation products can be found in the literature afbo which is a degradation product obtained using ozone and ultrasound has been reported to show more reactivity and toxicity than afb1 do and choi 2007 although the methods based on ozone and ultrasound treatments showed high degradation rates liu et al 2019 luo et al 2013 they must be discarded as suitable alternatives for the removal of afb1 due to the high toxicity of afbo some degradation products such as afm1 and afp1 showed slightly less toxicity than afb1 however these are also considered a threat to human health wu et al 2009 interestingly some degradation products show very low toxicity and can be considered safe for example 3a 8a dihydro 6 methoxyfuro 2 3 b benzofuran 4 ol was detected as the main degradation product when using the cota laccase from b licheniformis and this compound did not reduce the viability of l 02 cells guo et al 2020 after treatment with 100 μm afb1 the apoptosis rate of l 02 cells reached 41 whereas 3a 8a dihydro 6 methoxyfuro 2 3 b benzofuran 4 ol did not significantly induce apoptosis in l 02 cells compared to the control treatment afb2a which was obtained as the main degradation product after the application of uv and gamma irradiations and organic acids aiko et al 2015 rushing and selim 2018 did not have any mutagenic effect and showed 200 times less hepatotoxicity compared to afb1 shen and singh 2021 these results suggest that not all degradation products show low toxicity for this reason it is necessary to identify and evaluate the toxicity of the degradation products to guarantee the absence of toxicity after the application of the degradation methods this is an important disadvantage compared to the absorption methods which allow the removal of the aflatoxins some methods involved the use of natural nontoxic compounds for example loi et al 2016 studied the degradation of afb1 and afm1 after treatment with oxidizing chemicals acetosyringone 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid abts and syringaldehyde all these oxidizing agents allowed the degradation of afm1 by 100 while the degradation rates for afb1 ranged from 70 to 90 acetosyringone and syringaldehyde are especially interesting since these compounds are natural and nontoxic and for this reason might be a suitable alternative for aflatoxin degradation acetosyringone and syringaldehyde were applied at only 10 mm some specific plant extracts allowed high degradation rates for example the application of corymbia citriodora leaf extract degraded afb1 and afb2 by 95 21 and 95 95 after 3 d iram et al 2015 ocimum basilicum leaf extract degraded afb1 and afb2 by 90 4 and 88 6 while trachyspermum ammi seed extract degraded afb1 and afb2 by 92 8 and 91 9 iram et al 2016a 2016b a possible effect of natural compounds on water is that they change its sensory attributes however no study regarding the effects of natural substances on water sensory attributes was reported to date chemical treatments were extended between 1 and 5 days which is much longer than the irradiation methods and the treatments using microorganisms and enzymes these long treatment periods may have limitations for practical use making them unsuitable for the decontamination process aflatoxins concentrations were in the μg l range which suggests that these methods can be used for the concentrations commonly observed in surface and drinking water bodies except for ozone which was applied in 50 ml solutions agriopoulou et al 2016 the rest of the methods were applied only in μl scale solutions this is probably because natural compounds and plant extracts are usually expensive which is another important limitation for full scale use 3 4 adsorption of aflatoxins some methods were based on the use of adsorbents to remove aflatoxins from aqueous solutions supplementary material table s4 the efficacy of the adsorbents was measured according to the adsorption capacity amount of aflatoxin adsorbed per gram of adsorbent and the removal efficiency percent of aflatoxin removed from the aqueous solution in the screenings minerals biosorbents synthetic polymers and carbon based adsorbents were used an important fact that must be considered is that the adsorption techniques allow the removal of the aflatoxins while the degradation of the aflatoxins produces other compounds that sometimes also pose some toxicity pons et al 1972 although the compounds can be adsorbed and thus removed from water the fate of these adsorbents is also questionable even if the aflatoxins can be desorbed from the clays they must be degraded in a subsequent step to avoid contaminating the environment again the adsorbents used in the studies were cheap and their large scale use is possible additionally the used adsorbents will not contaminate water and the adsorption was achieved in only a few hours unfortunately all studies focused on the adsorption of afb1 and thus the ability of these minerals to adsorb other aflatoxins remains unexplored some of the highest removal and adsorption capacities were observed when using minerals such as bentonite montmorillonite and silica phillips et al 1988 wang et al 2019a the results obtained when using minerals varied according to their composition gallo and masoero 2010 reported that magnesium and calcium bentonites removed afb1 by 92 and 90 respectively while sodium bentonite only removed afb1 by 50 rasheed et al 2020 studied the combination of bentonite and orange peel removing 97 afb1 from aqueous solutions li et al 2022 reported the synthesis of flower like mesoporous magnesium silicate composites from sepiolite that were able to adsorb afb1 by 100 although several research groups used clays to adsorb aflatoxins only a few reports predicted the sorption mechanism mousivand et al 2022 kang et al 2016 indicated that a strong calcium bridging linkage co 2 ca2 osi 4 is involved in afb1 smectite adsorption fig 6 thus it seems that the two keto groups in positions 11 and 14 play a key role in the interactions with the clays deng et al 2010 for this reason the presence of metals in the clay may play an important role in the adsorption behavior some of the adsorption capacities when using minerals were 100 times higher than the adsorption capacities obtained with other adsorbents demonstrating the high adsorption potential of mineral clays for the decontamination of aflatoxins commercial montmorillonites novasil saz 1 and swy 2 had adsorption capacities of 200 200 and 300 mg g respectively jaynes and zartman 2011 jaynes et al 2007 whereas carnitine and chlorine amended montmorillonites showed adsorption capacities of 118 7 mg g wang et al 2017a 2019b calcium aminosilicate and smectites showed adsorption capacities of 103 and 134 28 262 35 mg g respectively alam et al 2015 arvide et al 2008 deng et al 2012 grant and phillips 1998 the ph of water to be purified was found to play a key role in the adsorption capacity aluminum iron pillared montmorillonite showed higher adsorption capacity at alkaline ph values than at acid ph values zeng et al 2013 while smectite was able to adsorb afb1 to a greater extent at ph 7 than at ph 3 barrientos velazquez et al 2016 this suggests that the ph can modify the mineral structure and thus alter mineral aflatoxin interactions as it has been indicated throughout the review changes in ph can affect natural ecosystems and the addition of chemicals to adjust the ph may change the composition of drinking water which is an important limitation for practical use in a few cases sorbents based on plant tissues were employed karmanov et al 2020 screened the adsorption capacity of lignin from different sources observing the highest removal efficiencies when using the lignin from althaea officinalis 80 2 and rhododendron tomentosum 79 6 the highest removal efficiency was detected when using durian durio zibthinus peel 98 4 showing an adsorption capacity of 13 mg g at ph 7 which is 10 to 40 times lower than some adsorption capacities observed with minerals adunphatcharaphon et al 2020 to illustrate montmorillonites were used at concentrations ranging from 10 to 600 mg l jaynes et al 2007 wang et al 2020 whereas durian peel had to be used at 5 g l concentration to achieve efficient removal unfortunately the potential ability of other fruit peels to adsorb aflatoxins remains unexplored it must be noted that fruit peels are commonly discarded and for this reason could be suitable for the low cost removal of aflatoxins apart from plant sources some research groups used yeast cells for their aflatoxin adsorption abilities goncalves et al 2015 luo et al 2020 in general the adsorption capacity observed with yeast cells was too low to be considered an actual alternative for example the binding abilities of eighteen s cerevisiae strains were tested in vitro and were able to remove afb1 by 10 40 shetty et al 2007 an important limitation of mineral clays and biosorbents is that they cannot be easily molded which limits their application in water flows for this reason the adsorption of aflatoxins using these materials must be carried out in water tanks to overcome this limitation some research groups have explored the filtration of aflatoxins in pipes using synthetic polymers as membranes fig 7 chattopadhyay 2016 in this regard zhang et al 2021a used a nanofiltration membrane functionalized by catechol amine to remove 90 afb1 whereas li et al 2018b employed a multifunctional membrane based on a polydopamine intermediate layer to remove 71 afb1 this is an interesting approach to simplifying aflatoxin decontamination from a technical point of view after reaching their adsorption capacity limit old membranes can be replaced by new ones in contrast with minerals and fruit peels synthetic polymers can be easily molded into different shapes and sizes although minerals and durian peel showed interesting adsorption parameters these adsorbents were mixed with the solution and thus subsequent filtration procedures are necessary to remove them from water even though polyvinyl alcohol pva had the highest removal efficiency among synthetic polymers 97 5 removal efficacy towards afb1 taha et al 2017 this material has never been employed as a pipe membrane which is an important gap that must be addressed in future research unfortunately studies regarding the adsorption capacity of synthetic polymers are lacking li et al 2021 developed a hybrid sponge of melamine foam and metal organic framework that was used to adsorb afb1 by 90 and showed an adsorption capacity of 15 8 mg g this adsorption capacity is significantly lower than that observed for some mineral clays 100 mg g as far as we know this is the only report that has examined the adsorption capacity of a synthetic polymer this is an important parameter for understanding the maximum adsorption capacity of membranes and by extension their applicability carbon based adsorbents showed generally high adsorption efficiencies perez gomez et al 2022 zahoor and khan 2018 although the methods using minerals biosorbents and synthetic polymers required several hours the methods using carbon based adsorbents were applied for only a few minutes this is an important advantage to reduce the time of the decontamination process for example cortes et al 2019 reported the use of carbon xerogel microspheres functionalized and non functionalized with phosphoric acid for 15 min for the adsorption of 100 afb1 when applied for 1 h a porous carbon material made from fe doped zif 8 eliminated afb1 by 99 88 zhang et al 2022b the adsorption capacity of activated carbon was estimated to be 200 mg g jaynes et al 2007 which is comparable to that of mineral clays activated carbon is frequently used to decontaminate organic compounds from water thus activated carbon based filters which are already installed in numerous industries and residential areas may be a suitable method for preventing aflatoxin contamination however the efficacy of activated carbon to decontaminate in flow systems remains unexplored which is an important gap that must be filled in future studies it would be interesting to explore the adsorption behavior of activated carbon towards other aflatoxins besides afb1 an important feature to ensure the reutilization of the adsorbents is their ability to desorb aflatoxins the desorption capacities of lignin karmanov et al 2020 durian peel adunphatcharaphon et al 2020 synthetic polymers li et al 2018b and different mineral clays phillips et al 1988 wang et al 2019a were evaluated for example afb1 was first adsorbed onto durian peel at ph 3 and could be desorbed by washing with a buffer at ph 7 adunphatcharaphon et al 2020 desorption of afb1 from a polymeric sandwich structured membrane could be performed using acetate buffer at ph 5 with a removal efficiency of 61 8 after five cycles wu et al 2020 this is an important advantage of mineral clays biosorbents and synthetic polymers over activated carbon where aflatoxins cannot be easily desorbed and thus carbon based adsorbents cannot be reutilized 4 conclusions and perspectives although the reported results suggest that people are regularly ingesting low concentrations of aflatoxins from water the consequences of this situation are unclear unfortunately legislation has largely ignored this issue and there are no maximum limits for aflatoxins in water it is critical to standardize analysis and removal methods to control the release of aflatoxin contaminated wastewater into the environment even though some approaches demonstrate high decontamination rates there is still work to be done to translate these findings into viable commercial techniques none of the reported degradation techniques were implemented at full scale certain degradation products showed high toxicity some methods required the addition of metals and salts or the regulation of ph rendering them impractical using synthetic polymers and activated carbon based membranes appears to be a suitable technique to decontaminate water flows although some methods efficiently adsorb afb1 there is no information regarding their adsorption ability for other aflatoxins the presence of aflatoxins in water is a potential concern to human health that local and international safety commissions are disregarding additionally epidemiological data comparing the effects of aflatoxin infected water and food are insufficient further research is needed to understand the occurrence and consequences of aflatoxins in water sources on human health as well as to determine whether immediate actions are required declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

15021,the fact that 94 of microplastics mps ubiquitous in the environment are subject to natural weathering makes the aging study currently a research hotspot this review summarized the physicochemical characteristics of mps undergoing natural and artificial aging and evaluated current analytical methods used in aging studies besides the differences in photoaging and aging induced by advanced oxidation processes aops were discussed leading to a conclusion that aops composed of oxidant and ultraviolet uv irradiation can better facilitate the alteration of mps compared to uv irradiation alone in addition the environmental behavior of aged mps was outlined and their adsorption properties for organics and metals were highlighted as a result of combined effects of hydrophobic π π diffusion and hydrogen bond interaction furthermore the mechanisms of photoaging and aops initiated aging were analyzed mainly the role of reactive oxygen species ros and environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs finally the applications of two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos and three dimensional fluorescence spectra using excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac were discussed for the aging process analysis this overview plays an important role in explaining the aging characteristics of mps and provides a theoretical foundation for further investigations into their toxicity and removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords physicochemical characteristics aops adsorption capacity ros 2d cos eem parafac data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastics have been applied worldwide in various fields since mass production in the 1940s including packaging construction automotive and electronics industries browne et al 2011 the most commonly found mps are polyethylene pe polystyrene ps polypropylene pp polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene terephthalate pet polyester pes and nylon polyamide pa table 1 after use up to 79 of plastic products are discarded into the environment zaman and newman 2021 with a diameter of less than 5 mm defined as microplastics mps kokalj et al 2018 due to their small size mps can migrate between terrestrial environments water bodies and the atmosphere lim 2021 during their migration mps might be subjected to natural processes such as ultraviolet uv irradiation wilkinson et al 2017 mechanical abrasion song et al 2017 hydrolysis and biodegradation miri et al 2022 which is also referred to as aging these processes can alter mps physiochemical properties such as color morphology size crystallinity and hydrophobicity fig 1 and release plastic additives potentially hazardous to environmental health shi et al 2021 for instance khaled et al 2018 showed that photoaging promoted the release of brominated flame retardant decabromodiphenyl ether bde 209 from ps into water bodies and the atmosphere it is noteworthy that aged mps are more likely to adsorb persistent organic pollutants pops pivokonsky et al 2018 and heavy metals jambeck et al 2015 due to the increased specific surface area ssa this could result in severe repercussions for organisms by triggering physiological responses after ingestion ebrahimi et al 2022 thus there is a clarion call to understand the aging behaviors of mps investigate the long term characteristics and further achieve possible elimination by greatly accelerating the aging process photoaging is the most common type of mps aging and is divided into direct and indirect photoaging lin et al 2020 direct photoaging refers to the process in which intermolecular bonds on the surface with lower binding energy are broken after uv irradiation with wavelengths of 290 400 nm ren et al 2021a indirect photoaging refers to free radical sensitized photoaging mainly utilizing the chromophores or chromophoric moieties in the polymer to absorb photons under light to break the ch bond zvekic et al 2022 the aging of mps can also be divided into natural and artificial aging natural aging refers to the prolonged exposure of mps to sunlight or simulated sunlight liu et al 2020a an identical experiment conducted in the laboratory referred to artificial aging is usually accelerated to produce a measurable change in mps for a relatively short duration sun et al 2020 the environment in which the aging treatment is performed includes air ultrapure water seawater and freshwater charged minerals present in seawater and freshwater can be adsorbed onto mps and microorganisms may form biofilms on the surface potentially influencing their environmental behavior rummel et al 2017 sharma et al 2021 these theories suggest that the aqueous environment can have an effect on the aging of mps however the specific effect has not yet been generalized in artificial aging apart from photoaging exposed to xenon lamps led and mercury lamps there are increasing reports of aging induced by advanced oxidation processes aops li et al 2018 aops are efficient approaches to degrade organic pollutants by producing a large number of reactive oxygen species ros to attack their internal structure an et al 2010 li and hu 2018 which are significant in efficiently determining the characteristics of aged mps and explaining the formation pathway of secondary mps currently heat activated persulfate fenton photo fenton o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 uv cl2 etc are mainly used for aging mps the indirect photoaging mechanism of polyolefin mps including pe ps and pp kapelewska et al 2021 has been shown to be the reactive species formed during photooxidation causing the cleavage of cc bonds in the main chain zou et al 2020 however less effort has been made to investigate the mechanisms of aops induced aging of mps to understand why it is employed to simulate natural aging especially since few studies have addressed the changes in all properties of aged mps treated with aops regarding the adsorption properties of aged mps one or a few specific pollutants selected as adsorbates are usually repeated in many studies although more possible active adsorbates should be considered for example it can be seen that the adsorption of ciprofloxacin cip appears in more than 20 publications searched with cip and microplastics as keywords in the web of science reflecting the importance of relevant reviews moreover the knowledge of aging pathways and products in current studies is limited and a combination of analytical approaches should be adopted to understand the aging process of mps as a consequence there is an urgent need to review the current research status and methodologies on the aging of mps to develop appropriate analytical capacities and explanatory approaches for the aging induced by aops the objective of this review is to reveal the current understanding of the aging behavior of mps and also to summarize the affecting factors several challenges related to the mechanisms and pathways of aging induced by aops are discussed and recommendations for further research efforts are provided 2 characteristics of mps undergoing aging processes 2 1 size and morphology the morphology of mps is mainly characterized by scanning electron microscope sem and stereomicroscope studies have presented that o2 or oxidants attack the surface of mps particles during aging wagner et al 2022 causing the originally smooth surface to become rough and form cracks and potholes for instance liu et al 2022 found a certain degree of embrittlement and disintegration on the surface of aged pvc mps after being treated with heat and uv radiation in addition to pvc ding et al 2020 and wu et al 2021a studied the aging of ps in a hot water bath at 75 and the photoaging of pp uv365 100 w m2 in seawater respectively and confirmed that aging led to the fragmentation of mps especially the particle size of pp was decreased by 92 2 after 12 days d of uv exposure furthermore liu et al 2019 found that the average particle size of pe was decreased from an initial diameter of 45 µm to 9 µm and 17 µm after heat activated persulfate and fenton treatment for 30 d respectively confirming that fragmentation is also a main characteristic of aging induced by aops and the size changes of mps during aging under different conditions natural aging artificial photoaging and aops induced aging are discussed table 2 summarizes the alterations of physiochemical characteristics of mps under natural aging artificial light irradiation and aops it can be observed that when ps were naturally aged for 540 d the average particle size was decreased from 50 µm to 33 µm liu et al 2021a while in another report wang et al 2021 it was decreased from 33 µm to 12 5 µm after ps underwent artificial photoaging 500 w xenon lamp for 180 h h confirming artificial aging is usually accelerated and thus becomes the mainstream of current research on aging study furthermore the study by liu et al 2020b shows that the average particle size of ps was decreased from 50 μm to 20 μm after photo fenton treatment 500 w mercury lamp for 108 h suggesting that aops composed of oxidation and light irradiation have the potential to achieve a high collection of aged mps with low oxidants consumption liu et al 2021b however the result that the average particle size of ps was reduced from 150 µm to 52 µm under a 1000 w xenon lamp for 150 d zhu et al 2020a indicates a much lower fragmentation efficiency this could be related to the divergence in particle size of selected mps and the calculation method also has an impact on the data presented ahmed et al 2021 further standardization is needed in the calculation of particle size energy loss and cost when comparing aging efficiency color difference describes the color change of mps during aging which can be determined by the following equation 1 δ e δ l 2 δ a 2 δ b 2 where l a and b are color values it is generally accepted that δ e of mps increases after aging as light o2 or oxidants have access to the inner layer and produce chromophores normally associated with the absorption of uv light syranidou et al 2019 huang et al 2021 observed that the color of ps was changed from white to yellow after prolonged exposure to uv light likewise luo et al 2020a 2020b found that the overall δ e of yellow raw pe plastic masterbatch and commercial pe was increased significantly at the beginning of light irradiation with a xenon lamp at 1200 w m2 color change may also occur during the aging of mps in systems without light exposure for example kelkar et al 2019 found that transparent pp was darkened after chlorine treatment 2 2 physicochemical characteristics the bet brunauer emmett teller test is commonly used to analyze the ssa of mps with a nitrogen physisorption analyzer differences in ssa are usually due to the structural change of the particle surface and many researchers have acknowledged that aging could lead to an increase in the ssa of mps huang et al 2021 due to the fragmentation and formation of cracks on the surface for example liu et al 2021 uncovered that aged ps under aops uv h2o2 uv cl2 had higher bet ssa than pristine ps liu et al 2019 further revealed a significant negative correlation between bet ssa and particle size as aging progressed where the smaller the particle size the larger the bet ssa rozman et al 2021 in addition the presence of microorganisms in natural aquatic environment provides the opportunity for biofilm formation which is likely to increase the ssa of mps water contact angle is an expression of the hydrophobicity of a compound zenkin et al 2014 and the larger the contact angle the stronger the hydrophobicity schwierz et al 2012 when pvc mps were exposed to a xenon lamp at 500 w m2 for 96 h the contact angle was decreased from 145 8 to 102 9 indicating a higher affinity for water wang et al 2020 which is due to the oxidation of water insoluble groups forming oxygen containing functional groups moreover different types of mps such as ps and pe exhibited different degrees of contact angle reduction even after the same heat activated persulfate treatment liu et al 2019 the probable reason is that pe is more fragile sun et al 2020 and its structure is more easily damaged tan et al 2020 several studies have demonstrated that the crystallinity of mps may increase with the aging time as shown in table 2 mainly due to the preferential degradation of amorphous polymers and chain scission reaction suggesting that crystallinity can be regarded as an indicator of chain scission in mps duan et al 2021 for instance mao et al 2020 unearthed that the crystallinity of ps after aging under uv irradiation in different matrices air seawater pure water was increased through x ray diffraction xrd and it is believed that more brittle plastics have a higher crystallinity which makes them more susceptible to aging harvey 2005 in the literature there is another method for calculating crystallinity the percentage of crystalline content x is obtained using the following equation neubauer et al 2017 2 x 100 1 a a a b 1 233 1 a a a b 100 where aa and ab are the absorbance of the crystalline and amorphous regions and can be determined from the bands at 1474 and 1464 cm 1 or 730 and 720 cm 1 for pe and the bands at 841 and 1167 cm 1 for pp stark and matuana 2004 liu et al 2021a uncovered that the crystallinity of pe was increased from 60 to 85 after natural aging for 540 d however kabanov et al 2009 performed thermal aging on a copolymer formed from pe and undecanoic acid and unearthed that the decrease in crystallinity might be due to the breakdown of the crystal structure by introducing pe another report exploring the aging of pp over 12 d with a mercury lamp showed the crystallinity was decreased from 64 to 56 sun et al 2021 thus not all aging processes lead to an increase in crystallinity which is related to the material composition and different processing methods of mps the thermal properties of mps mainly include glass transition temperature tg measured by differential scanning calorimetry dsc and melting point tm by thermogravimetric analysis tga the possible reason for the lower tg of aged mps mao et al 2020 zou et al 2020 is that the molecular weight reduction caused by mps degradation during aging results in less hindered backbone bond rotation these facts suggest that aged mps may reach the glassy state more easily since they require less thermal energy tm often appears together with crystallinity because in general more crystalline substances require higher tm to break down gogolewski et al 1993 and some reports mammo et al 2020 su et al 2021 showed that tm of aged mps was increased with thermal properties mainly due to increased crystallinity however the change of tm is sometimes insignificant and only serves as a reference 2 3 carbonyl index carbonyl index ci obtained by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrum has been defined to represent the aging degree of mps as evidenced by the phenomenon of positive correlation between ci and exposure time zhang et al 2021 ci is calculated as the ratio of the absorbance of the carbonyl peak including ketone carboxylic acid and ester and the methylene reference peak where a1712 cm 1 a2914 cm 1 is usually for pe feng et al 2022 and a1730 cm 1 a1452 cm 1 for ps wang et al 2021 other reference peaks such as 1463 cm 1 728 cm 1 and 1375 cm 1 for pe and 2851 cm 1 for ps are also accepted godoy et al 2020 it was reported that ci of ps was increased from 0 054 to 0 201 0 235 and 0 493 upon exposure to uv cl2 uv h2o and uv h2o2 respectively liu et al 2021 showing that aops composed of oxidizing agent and uv irradiation contribute to the formation of oxygen containing functional groups such as c o thereby promoting the surface polarity of aged mps chamas et al 2020 and low ci under uv cl2 is due to that cl2 radical converting from cl2 has an inhibitory effect wu et al 2016 furthermore the relationship between ci and aging time can be linear or exponential depending on the type of mps subjected to the aging treatment for instance in the study of miranda et al 2021 ci of pe was linearly related to the exposure time in a rooftop experiment while ci of unplasticized pvc was increased sequentially likewise liu et al 2019 unearthed that ci of ps was altered exponentially with time during fenton treatment and a model using principal component analysis pca theory has been applied to analyze the ftir spectra of aged mps the utilization of ci with pca was compared and summarized that ci had the following disadvantages in characterizing the ftir spectra of mps 1 it is limited to a specific region of the infrared spectrum and 2 it relies on a constant reference peak pca has advantages such as capturing alterations in the full ftir spectra and detecting multiple mps simultaneously without the requirement of reference peaks in the study of zvekic et al 2022 the average acceleration factor acf was defined to represent the intensity difference between processes embodied in the weathering rate slope the acf of uvb 22 w m2 natural was modeled to be 4 5 for pp and 6 9 for ps these values are within a reasonable range as uv340 26 w m2 irradiation is 4 times natural solar radiation müller et al 2018 and uv254 30 w irradiation is 16 8 33 6 times natural weathering vockenberg et al 2020 implying the potential application of pca to compare the efficiency of different aging methods 2 4 o c ratio the oxygen carbon o c atom ratio obtained by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps is frequently employed to indicate the aging degree for showing the introduction of oxygen elements into mps and thus generally increases during aging as shown in table 2 o c ratio of ps was increased from 0 04 to 0 22 after 60 d of uva irradiation and from 0 04 to 0 62 directly after o3 h2o exposure for only 3 h rummel et al 2019 liu et al 2019 implying highly accelerated aging induced by ozone based aops has potential to mineralize mps into co2 like ftir xps spectra can also present the distribution of carbon oxygen groups by peak division lang et al 2020 for instance ding et al 2022 uncovered that c o and co were generated in ps after natural aging in air and ultrapure water and liu et al 2021 determined the percentage of oxygen introduced into ps under uv h2o and uv h2o2 for 96 h was 13 2 and 14 2 respectively suggesting that the addition of h2o2 under uv exposure promotes the oxidation of mps li et al 2020 besides liu et al 2019 found that o c ratio of ps during the heat activated persulfate and fenton treatment was positively correlated with ci although both parameters as a function of alteration time were exponential likewise ren et al 2021a reported a negative linear correlation between zeta potential mv and o c ratio of ps after the uva persulfate treatment these results contribute to understanding the aging characteristics of mps however currently no other literature confirms the feasibility of a linear model between ci or zeta potential as a function of the o c ratio more data are required to assess whether this is an isolated case or a general rule 3 adsorption properties of aged mps 3 1 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps understanding the interactions between mps and pollutants has become popular since it is an important aspect in assessing the impact of mps on global pollutant distribution the effect of aging on the adsorption behavior of mps for pollutants have been widely reported table 3 with the lagergren equation applied to fit the adsorption kinetics over time vockenberg et al 2020 3 d q t d t k 1 q e q t 4 d q t d t k 2 q e q t 2 eqs 3 and 4 are the pseudo first order kinetics model pfom and pseudo second order model psom respectively where q e is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and q t is the adsorption capacity at a given time t and k1 and k2 are the rate constants of the pfom and psom kinetic models which are usually determined from experimental data currently these two models are frequently used to analyze the adsorption properties of mps for pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps especially after light irradiation and aops based treatments as shown in table 3 for instance the adsorption of aged isotactic pp for triclosan tcs is better fitted with pfom wu et al 2020a due to the higher r2 of the fitting curve psom is ideal for the adsorption of aged pvc for tetracycline tc and cip and the adsorption of pristine aged ps for propranolol prp sulfamethoxazole smx amlodipine aml and atorvastatin atv fan et al 2021 huang et al 2021 liu et al 2020b suggesting that these adsorption processes involve two or more stages as a result of a combined effect of diffusion physisorption and chemisorption the isotherm models of henry langmuir and freundlich are usually employed for the adsorption of ppcps onto mps which are expressed as follows fan et al 2021 respectively 5 q e k d c e 6 q e q m a x b c e 1 b c e 7 q e k f c e n where ce is the equilibrium concentration kd is partition coefficient and b and qmax are the langmuir constants which are related to the adsorption bonding energy and the maximum sorption capacity kf is the capacity affinity parameter of freundlich model and n dimensionless is the exponential parameter adsorption isotherm can reflect the adsorption capacity and mechanism and the selection is mainly based on r2 of the fitting curve for instance henry model fits the adsorption of tylosin tartrate tyl sulfamethazine smt and erythromycin ery well on aged ps mps with r2 0 970 indicating that monolayer adsorption dominates ding et al 2020 the result that both the langmuir and freundlich models are well fitted for the adsorption of hydrophilic compounds on pristine aged ps mps suggests that in addition to electrostatic interactions lin et al 2021 π π bond interactions in ps play a relatively important role xu et al 2018 moreover adsorption isotherm is also related to the properties of the organics and several studies have demonstrated that the adsorption of tetrabromobisphenol a alkylbenzene and perfluorooctanesulfonamide fits well with linear model zhou et al 2020 wang et al 2015 wu et al 2001 implying that hydrophobic interaction is the main mechanism leading to the adsorption of hydrophobic compounds guo et al 2012 the affinity of pristine mps for ppcps is highly correlated to their log kow values e g the adsorption capacity of pristine ps for atv log know 6 4 is greater than aml log know 2 1 liu et al 2020b since log kow is positively correlated with the partition coefficient as summarized in table 3 the adsorption of aged mps for ppcps is usually enhanced for two main reasons first the active adsorption sites are increased due to the fragmentation of aged mps second the oxygen containing functional groups formed on the surface of aged mp promote electrostatic interaction as well as hydrogen bonding sun et al 2021 nevertheless not all aged mps enhance adsorption affinity for organic pollutants as shown in fig 2 some studies showed that the maximum adsorption capacity qmax of aged ps for bpa and btex weakened müller et al 2018 liu et al 2020a and the adsorption for pahs phenanthrene phe naphthalene nap and pyrene pyr was decreased ding et al 2020 this is due to a combined effect of the surface oxygen groups crystallinity and ssa of aged ps resulting in a decrease in the hydrophobicity thereby reducing the electrostatic interaction furthermore a linear correlation between qe of cip y mg kg based on psom o c ratio x1 and average size x2 µm was developed in the regression analysis for aged ps and pe by liu et al 2019 the result that r2 was 0 856 for pe indicates that qe does not fit well with the linear model applying o c ratio and average size suggesting that the process may be affected by other factors such as the cracks generated and surface charges gao et al 2022 apart from mps and the chemicals themselves the aquatic environment condition in which the adsorption experiment is performed also has an influence on the adsorption properties for example liu et al 2021 uncovered that salinity promoted the sorption of bpa by aged ps mps since na and cl could enhance the polar interactions of the neutral chemicals with water likewise the study by vockenberg et al 2020 concluded that nacl at higher concentrations in water resulted in greater adsorption of diphenylamine dpa onto pe mps it is clear that salinity affects the adsorption capacity of mps and further influences the distribution of organic pollutants in the aquatic environment 3 2 heavy metals like ppcps pfom and psom are also employed to fit the adsorption s of mps for heavy metals and isotherm models include henry langmuir and freundlich as well studies have shown that the adsorption of cr6 on aged pe and pp fits well with pfom liu et al 2021a while psom is ideal for the adsorption of cu2 onto aged pet and pa mps bao et al 2021 suggesting that the adsorption of heavy metals also involve two or more stages and it was revealed that the freundlich model had the best fitting function r2 0 977 for the adsorption of pb2 cu2 cd2 ni2 and zn2 on pristine aged ps mao et al 2020 indicating that the adsorption is multi layered and mainly dominated by electrostatic interactions since negatively charged ps can directly absorb positively charged metal ions wang et al 2021 and the adsorption capacities of different metal ions on pristine aged mps are related to the physiochemical properties of the metal ions themselves qu et al 2020 the enhanced adsorption capacity of aged ps is due to the formation of more oxygen containing functional groups promoting the accumulation of negative charges on the surface accompanied by increased ssa the fact that aged pet and pa mps exhibit improved adsorption properties for cu2 suggests a similar mechanism mainly due to the rough and wrinkled surface providing more adsorption active sites bao et al 2021 all these results confirm that the effects of aging on the adsorption capacity of mps are closely correlated to their structural changes besides it is generally accepted that the natural aging of mps usually occurs under complex conditions and their aging properties can be affected by dissolved organic matter dom salinity and microorganism in the natural aquatic environment tu et al 2020 for example liu et al 2021a the adsorption capacity of naturally aged pp mps for co2 had no significant change and the adsorption of cr6 weakened after exposure to sunlight for 18 months this could be attributed to biofilms forming as a coating to retard the transfer of pollutants from aquatic system to mps however the presence of biofilms originating from microbial colonization can promote the aging of mps by changing the hydrophobicity and surface charge and interacting with heavy metals through complexation thereby affecting the adsorption capacity for instance the adsorption of cu2 on biodegradable poly lactic acid with microbial colonization was significantly enhanced sun et al 2022 considering the obvious deficiencies in simulating the adsorption in nature with artificially aged mps aops induced aging can be performed in simulated seawater or simulated freshwater to increase the environmental relevance 4 aging mechanism numerous studies have confirmed that the indirect photoaging of mps is highly related to the free radicals generated godoy et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 also referred to as environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs vejerano et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 after ps phenol formaldehyde resin pf pe and pvc were irradiated with simulated natural light 50 w xenon lamp wavelength 300 nm for 15 d it was unearthed that epfrs were mainly formed on the surface of pf and ps mps due to the cleavage of chemical bonds and detected by electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy zhu et al 2020a during aging the absorption of photons breaks the c h bond of the main chain thereby forming the first epfr tertiary alkyl radical p zhu et al 2020b which then reacts with o2 dissolved o2 to form poo radical 2 and poo interacts with h2 or h in water to form pooh since the dissociation energies of pooh p ooh and pooh are 175 8 kj mol 293 0 kj mol and 376 7 kj mol respectively liu et al 2021b pooh is more easily cleaved to form alkoxy radical po radial 3 and oh tian et al 2019 oh further reacts with po in the presence of o2 to form o2 and then loses electrons to form h2o2 on the one hand the produced oh attacks the main chain resulting in chain scission zhao et al 2021 hu et al 2021 it can be concluded that oh is the main factor leading to the indirect photoaging of mps the difference between the aging of common polyolefin mps and pvc is that the latter involves the cleavage of ccl also referred to as dechlorination miao et al 2020 when pvc mps pcln are exposed to light uv or sunlight or aops long chains of pcln break ccl fractures due to high photon energy and the first type of efpr pcln 1 is formed then h is extracted and produces another efpr pcccln 1 xing et al 2022 along with the rupture of ccl the intermediates converted from efprs react with o2 dissolved o2 to form epoxy groups which are decomposed and rearranged to generate oh bonds subsequently oh resulting from the process attacks oh bonds and c o bonds are formed on pvc chains kelkar et al 2019 throughout the aging process attack of oh on the backbone cleavage of ccl and extraction of h continue to occur fig 4 there are more approaches for aging induced by aops compared to indirect photoaging due to the wide variety of aops the mechanism of aops functioning on mps is mainly free radical initiated oxidation where the initiators include oh o2 h2o2 and other free radicals such as so4 cl and clo reactive chlorine species rcs generated from the attack of specific oxidants like s2o8 2 and cl2 resulting in chain cleavage and the formation of surface oxygen containing functional groups since oh is non selective with a high redox potential 2 8 v wang et al 2021 and leads to the formation of other ros chen et al 2020 to some extent it is considered the main factor for aops induced aging of mps although the current reaction system of aops for the aging of mps is relatively simple the fact that an electro fenton like system achieved 75 of pvc dechlorination in 6 h miao et al 2020 suggests that accelerated aops are a new idea for the efficient removal of mps as proposed in fig 5 where the low molecular products formed by chain scission and oxidation of mps wu et al 2021a mao et al 2020 are potentially mineralized into co2 and h2o2 under the continuous attack of ros and rcs 5 emerging techniques for aging process analysis 5 1 application of 2d cos ftir due to the large molecular weight of mps and lots of free radicals involved in their aging the specific product distribution is not yet clear jeon et al 2021 for technical flaws some researchers have adopted two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos combined with ftir spectra to roughly analyze the conversion pathways and products of mps by univariate analysis as the spectrum alteration has a certain relationship with aging time priyanka and saravanakumar 2022 the coordinates on the synchronous φ x1 x2 and asynchronous ψ x1 x2 maps are generated from the dynamic spectra ỹ x t showing the variations of ftir spectra y x t as a function of wavenumber x and aging time t as follows according to the hilbert noda transform method chen et al 2019 8 φ x 1 x 2 1 t m a x t m i n t m i n t m a x y x 1 t y x 2 t d t 9 ψ x 1 x 2 1 t m a x t m i n t m i n t m a x y x 1 t z x 2 t d t where z x 2 t 1 π t m i n t m a x y x 2 t 1 t t d t is the hilbert transform of the signal ỹ x t and t is the integral variable t m a x and t m i n represent the minimum and maximum aging time respectively the value of φ x 1 x 2 represents the simultaneous or coincidental changes of spectral intensity variations at x 1 and x 2 during the interval between t min and t max and the intensity of ψ x 1 x 2 represents the sequential order of spectral intensity variation at x 1 and x 2 the rules are as follows 1 if φ x1 x2 0 ψ x1 x2 0 the intensity change occurs at x1 before x2 2 if φ x1 x2 0 ψ x1 x2 0 the intensity change occurs at x1 after x2 3 if φ x1 x2 0 the above rules are reversed sun et al 2021 since the ftir spectrum itself can reveal the specific group to which the peak is ascribed the application of 2d cos to further obtain the alteration order of these groups is the main reason for implantation priyanka and saravanakumar 2022 for example seven positive automatic peaks appearing along the diagonal on the synchronous map of ps in the study of mao et al 2020 indicated that all corresponding groups were increased with aging time the asynchronous correlation spectrum suggested that ch2 on ps formed unstable epoxides co and alcohols coh which were then oxidized to form carbonyl groups c o and oc o after chain scission occurred ding et al 2020 also applied ftir 2d cos to perform a similar investigation of the thermal aging 75 c pathways of ps highlighting the c c cleavage on the benzene ring of ps in the initial phase it is obvious that 2d cos does have certain merits for the current study on the aging pathways of mps ding et al 2022 however given that only ftir is currently associated with 2d cos the application of this approach in aops induced aging of mps is limited as the distribution order of active species resulting from the added oxidant that contributes to the spectral signal cannot be provided 5 2 highlights of eem parafac analysis in addition to 2d cos ftir excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac has been employed to analyze the three dimensional fluorescence spectra of mps solution during aging yan et al 2021 to obtain the leachate or products released from mps thereby inferring possible aging pathways generally this analysis can express the ratio of various components in the solution such as aromatic proteins and soluble microbial by product like wang et al 2009 yuan et al 2022 observed that the red shift of eem peaks became significant with exposure time revealing that photoaging may promote the release of low molecular soluble organics photoluminescence pl was defined to indicate the formation of aromatic organic intermediates in the study of liu et al 2021a the strongest pl signal in the first 48 h of photo fenton aging of ps was probably emitted from soluble organic molecules with benzene rings lucas and porter 1988 and the subsequent decrease could be attributed to the opening of the benzene ring these results suggest that changes in mps during aging reflected in eem peak information warrant future application by researchers shi et al 2021 although only a few publications have documented eem as an analytical approach for the aging characteristics of mps 6 factors affecting aging processes as discussed earlier oh plays a significant role in the aging of mps briefly all factors affecting the production of oh could influence aging efficiency for instance hco3 and co3 2 are scavengers of oh vione et al 2009 although the effects on photoaging and aops initiated aging are yet known the formation of ho2 is reduced at lower ph leading to a decrease in oh production halliwell and gutteridge 1984 suggesting aops induced aging treatment like uv h2o2 may be more effective at high ph rosenfeldt et al 2006 furthermore natural organic matter nom can quench oh with little stimulation in oh formation guan et al 2013 thereby retarding the aging process grebel et al 2011 besides the nom surface contains abundant oxygen containing functional groups that integrate with mps through hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions and further influence the aging efficiency by occupying the active sites or photon shielding effect wammer et al 2013 wu et al 2021b considering that nom is ubiquitous in the aqueous system and is frequently used to simulate natural environments yin et al 2015 it is necessary to study the aging of mps under its siege low molecular natural organic acids such as oxalate affect the photoaging of mps by promoting oh production wang et al 2020 halide ions influence the photoaging of mps through the formation of reactive halogenated radicals rhs resulting from the interaction between cl br oh and nom lang et al 2022 such as chlorine radical cl bromine radical br bichloride radical cl2 dibromo radical br2 and chlorobromo radical clbr parker et al 2016 and wu et al 2021a uncovered that cl in seawater can be transformed into cl2 and inhibit the formation of o2 as evidenced by the result that the photoaging efficiency of pp in ultrapure water was significantly higher than that in estuarine and coastal seawater in addition the particle size of mps also affects aging as small sized mps have larger ssa and thus more active sites for example the dechlorination efficiency of pvc with a particle size of 2 µm was higher than that of 150 µm during photoaging wang et al 2020 on the one hand biofilms formed by microorganism colonization on the surface of mps improved their hydrophobicity by the attack on weaker components in the microplastic structure wu et al 2022 such as unsaturated double bonds branched chains and hydrocarbon groups at the end of the main chain and on the other hand they inhibit aging by blocking the exposure of mps to light or aops moreover the chemical additives in mps such as dyes plasticizers stabilizers antioxidants etc might be readily released during aging since they are physically bound to the polymer meng et al 2021 it was reported that additives might drive the initial photooxidation degradation of pe under uv irradiation al harraq et al 2022 however they might slow down the aging process by reducing the surface area of mps exposed to uv or aops luo et al 2020a possible factors affecting the aging of mps are summarized in table 4 7 conclusions and perspectives understanding the aging effects of mps is theoretically fundamental and critical for studying the spatial distribution of environmental pollution as 94 of massive discarded mps are aged and interact actively with inorganic organic contaminants this comprehensive review summarized the aging characteristics of mps in terms of the physiochemical properties environmental behavior mechanisms and affecting factors and evaluated the limitations of the analytical methods for mps in current studies generally the order of aging efficiency was aops composed of oxidation and uv irradiation uv irradiation alone natural aging which is reflected in increased carbonyl index o c atom ratio and ssa the formation of oxygen containing functional groups altered the hydrophobicity and surface charge of aged mps and further affected their adsorption capacities for ppcps and heavy metals by a combined effect of hydrophobic electrostatic π π diffusion and hydrogen bond interaction in addition the aging mechanisms regarding the contribution of epfrs and ros were elucidated all factors affecting the formation of oh and o2 were considered to affect the aging efficiency such as nom ph halogen ions etc finally the pros and cons of two emerging approaches 2d cos ftir and eem parafac for the study of aging pathways and leachate were discussed the investigation of the accelerated aging induced by aops is significant in explaining the formation pathways of secondary mps and enables mineralization more knowledge regarding the overall toxicity of aops is necessary to evaluate the potential risks to human health and ecosystems and more studies on environmental behavior other than the adsorption of aged mps are needed to understand the effect of aging suggestions for future work on the aging of mps are as follows 1 although the gap between laboratory simulation and actual conditions has been reduced by using simulated natural environments such as synthetic seawater most of the mps used by researchers are commercial mps with stable properties natural mps can be employed for the aging analysis to increase environmental relevance in future research 2 more accelerated aging experiments by aops can be carried out to verify the linear and non linear simulations of the relationship between different parameters e g ic vs o c contact angle vs o c and zeta potential vs ci to advance our understanding of aging characteristics 3 studying the intermediate and final products of mps is important for understanding the toxicity of the aging process although some studies have applied 2d cos to analyze the possible aging pathways the identification and toxicity study of the specific products are worthy of further investigation 4 studies show that biofilms can act as a barrier to mps thereby reducing adsorption for pollutants however biofilms can also act as carriers of pollutants to increase adsorption hence specific information about biofilms including microbial species growth rates and effect on microplastic structures should be studied thoroughly 5 mps are mainly separated by traditional methods such as coagulation sedimentation and filtration in water treatment however they continue to exist unless they are eliminated thus the application of aops for the removal of mps is also a topic worthy of research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

15021,the fact that 94 of microplastics mps ubiquitous in the environment are subject to natural weathering makes the aging study currently a research hotspot this review summarized the physicochemical characteristics of mps undergoing natural and artificial aging and evaluated current analytical methods used in aging studies besides the differences in photoaging and aging induced by advanced oxidation processes aops were discussed leading to a conclusion that aops composed of oxidant and ultraviolet uv irradiation can better facilitate the alteration of mps compared to uv irradiation alone in addition the environmental behavior of aged mps was outlined and their adsorption properties for organics and metals were highlighted as a result of combined effects of hydrophobic π π diffusion and hydrogen bond interaction furthermore the mechanisms of photoaging and aops initiated aging were analyzed mainly the role of reactive oxygen species ros and environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs finally the applications of two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos and three dimensional fluorescence spectra using excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac were discussed for the aging process analysis this overview plays an important role in explaining the aging characteristics of mps and provides a theoretical foundation for further investigations into their toxicity and removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords physicochemical characteristics aops adsorption capacity ros 2d cos eem parafac data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastics have been applied worldwide in various fields since mass production in the 1940s including packaging construction automotive and electronics industries browne et al 2011 the most commonly found mps are polyethylene pe polystyrene ps polypropylene pp polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene terephthalate pet polyester pes and nylon polyamide pa table 1 after use up to 79 of plastic products are discarded into the environment zaman and newman 2021 with a diameter of less than 5 mm defined as microplastics mps kokalj et al 2018 due to their small size mps can migrate between terrestrial environments water bodies and the atmosphere lim 2021 during their migration mps might be subjected to natural processes such as ultraviolet uv irradiation wilkinson et al 2017 mechanical abrasion song et al 2017 hydrolysis and biodegradation miri et al 2022 which is also referred to as aging these processes can alter mps physiochemical properties such as color morphology size crystallinity and hydrophobicity fig 1 and release plastic additives potentially hazardous to environmental health shi et al 2021 for instance khaled et al 2018 showed that photoaging promoted the release of brominated flame retardant decabromodiphenyl ether bde 209 from ps into water bodies and the atmosphere it is noteworthy that aged mps are more likely to adsorb persistent organic pollutants pops pivokonsky et al 2018 and heavy metals jambeck et al 2015 due to the increased specific surface area ssa this could result in severe repercussions for organisms by triggering physiological responses after ingestion ebrahimi et al 2022 thus there is a clarion call to understand the aging behaviors of mps investigate the long term characteristics and further achieve possible elimination by greatly accelerating the aging process photoaging is the most common type of mps aging and is divided into direct and indirect photoaging lin et al 2020 direct photoaging refers to the process in which intermolecular bonds on the surface with lower binding energy are broken after uv irradiation with wavelengths of 290 400 nm ren et al 2021a indirect photoaging refers to free radical sensitized photoaging mainly utilizing the chromophores or chromophoric moieties in the polymer to absorb photons under light to break the ch bond zvekic et al 2022 the aging of mps can also be divided into natural and artificial aging natural aging refers to the prolonged exposure of mps to sunlight or simulated sunlight liu et al 2020a an identical experiment conducted in the laboratory referred to artificial aging is usually accelerated to produce a measurable change in mps for a relatively short duration sun et al 2020 the environment in which the aging treatment is performed includes air ultrapure water seawater and freshwater charged minerals present in seawater and freshwater can be adsorbed onto mps and microorganisms may form biofilms on the surface potentially influencing their environmental behavior rummel et al 2017 sharma et al 2021 these theories suggest that the aqueous environment can have an effect on the aging of mps however the specific effect has not yet been generalized in artificial aging apart from photoaging exposed to xenon lamps led and mercury lamps there are increasing reports of aging induced by advanced oxidation processes aops li et al 2018 aops are efficient approaches to degrade organic pollutants by producing a large number of reactive oxygen species ros to attack their internal structure an et al 2010 li and hu 2018 which are significant in efficiently determining the characteristics of aged mps and explaining the formation pathway of secondary mps currently heat activated persulfate fenton photo fenton o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 uv cl2 etc are mainly used for aging mps the indirect photoaging mechanism of polyolefin mps including pe ps and pp kapelewska et al 2021 has been shown to be the reactive species formed during photooxidation causing the cleavage of cc bonds in the main chain zou et al 2020 however less effort has been made to investigate the mechanisms of aops induced aging of mps to understand why it is employed to simulate natural aging especially since few studies have addressed the changes in all properties of aged mps treated with aops regarding the adsorption properties of aged mps one or a few specific pollutants selected as adsorbates are usually repeated in many studies although more possible active adsorbates should be considered for example it can be seen that the adsorption of ciprofloxacin cip appears in more than 20 publications searched with cip and microplastics as keywords in the web of science reflecting the importance of relevant reviews moreover the knowledge of aging pathways and products in current studies is limited and a combination of analytical approaches should be adopted to understand the aging process of mps as a consequence there is an urgent need to review the current research status and methodologies on the aging of mps to develop appropriate analytical capacities and explanatory approaches for the aging induced by aops the objective of this review is to reveal the current understanding of the aging behavior of mps and also to summarize the affecting factors several challenges related to the mechanisms and pathways of aging induced by aops are discussed and recommendations for further research efforts are provided 2 characteristics of mps undergoing aging processes 2 1 size and morphology the morphology of mps is mainly characterized by scanning electron microscope sem and stereomicroscope studies have presented that o2 or oxidants attack the surface of mps particles during aging wagner et al 2022 causing the originally smooth surface to become rough and form cracks and potholes for instance liu et al 2022 found a certain degree of embrittlement and disintegration on the surface of aged pvc mps after being treated with heat and uv radiation in addition to pvc ding et al 2020 and wu et al 2021a studied the aging of ps in a hot water bath at 75 and the photoaging of pp uv365 100 w m2 in seawater respectively and confirmed that aging led to the fragmentation of mps especially the particle size of pp was decreased by 92 2 after 12 days d of uv exposure furthermore liu et al 2019 found that the average particle size of pe was decreased from an initial diameter of 45 µm to 9 µm and 17 µm after heat activated persulfate and fenton treatment for 30 d respectively confirming that fragmentation is also a main characteristic of aging induced by aops and the size changes of mps during aging under different conditions natural aging artificial photoaging and aops induced aging are discussed table 2 summarizes the alterations of physiochemical characteristics of mps under natural aging artificial light irradiation and aops it can be observed that when ps were naturally aged for 540 d the average particle size was decreased from 50 µm to 33 µm liu et al 2021a while in another report wang et al 2021 it was decreased from 33 µm to 12 5 µm after ps underwent artificial photoaging 500 w xenon lamp for 180 h h confirming artificial aging is usually accelerated and thus becomes the mainstream of current research on aging study furthermore the study by liu et al 2020b shows that the average particle size of ps was decreased from 50 μm to 20 μm after photo fenton treatment 500 w mercury lamp for 108 h suggesting that aops composed of oxidation and light irradiation have the potential to achieve a high collection of aged mps with low oxidants consumption liu et al 2021b however the result that the average particle size of ps was reduced from 150 µm to 52 µm under a 1000 w xenon lamp for 150 d zhu et al 2020a indicates a much lower fragmentation efficiency this could be related to the divergence in particle size of selected mps and the calculation method also has an impact on the data presented ahmed et al 2021 further standardization is needed in the calculation of particle size energy loss and cost when comparing aging efficiency color difference describes the color change of mps during aging which can be determined by the following equation 1 δ e δ l 2 δ a 2 δ b 2 where l a and b are color values it is generally accepted that δ e of mps increases after aging as light o2 or oxidants have access to the inner layer and produce chromophores normally associated with the absorption of uv light syranidou et al 2019 huang et al 2021 observed that the color of ps was changed from white to yellow after prolonged exposure to uv light likewise luo et al 2020a 2020b found that the overall δ e of yellow raw pe plastic masterbatch and commercial pe was increased significantly at the beginning of light irradiation with a xenon lamp at 1200 w m2 color change may also occur during the aging of mps in systems without light exposure for example kelkar et al 2019 found that transparent pp was darkened after chlorine treatment 2 2 physicochemical characteristics the bet brunauer emmett teller test is commonly used to analyze the ssa of mps with a nitrogen physisorption analyzer differences in ssa are usually due to the structural change of the particle surface and many researchers have acknowledged that aging could lead to an increase in the ssa of mps huang et al 2021 due to the fragmentation and formation of cracks on the surface for example liu et al 2021 uncovered that aged ps under aops uv h2o2 uv cl2 had higher bet ssa than pristine ps liu et al 2019 further revealed a significant negative correlation between bet ssa and particle size as aging progressed where the smaller the particle size the larger the bet ssa rozman et al 2021 in addition the presence of microorganisms in natural aquatic environment provides the opportunity for biofilm formation which is likely to increase the ssa of mps water contact angle is an expression of the hydrophobicity of a compound zenkin et al 2014 and the larger the contact angle the stronger the hydrophobicity schwierz et al 2012 when pvc mps were exposed to a xenon lamp at 500 w m2 for 96 h the contact angle was decreased from 145 8 to 102 9 indicating a higher affinity for water wang et al 2020 which is due to the oxidation of water insoluble groups forming oxygen containing functional groups moreover different types of mps such as ps and pe exhibited different degrees of contact angle reduction even after the same heat activated persulfate treatment liu et al 2019 the probable reason is that pe is more fragile sun et al 2020 and its structure is more easily damaged tan et al 2020 several studies have demonstrated that the crystallinity of mps may increase with the aging time as shown in table 2 mainly due to the preferential degradation of amorphous polymers and chain scission reaction suggesting that crystallinity can be regarded as an indicator of chain scission in mps duan et al 2021 for instance mao et al 2020 unearthed that the crystallinity of ps after aging under uv irradiation in different matrices air seawater pure water was increased through x ray diffraction xrd and it is believed that more brittle plastics have a higher crystallinity which makes them more susceptible to aging harvey 2005 in the literature there is another method for calculating crystallinity the percentage of crystalline content x is obtained using the following equation neubauer et al 2017 2 x 100 1 a a a b 1 233 1 a a a b 100 where aa and ab are the absorbance of the crystalline and amorphous regions and can be determined from the bands at 1474 and 1464 cm 1 or 730 and 720 cm 1 for pe and the bands at 841 and 1167 cm 1 for pp stark and matuana 2004 liu et al 2021a uncovered that the crystallinity of pe was increased from 60 to 85 after natural aging for 540 d however kabanov et al 2009 performed thermal aging on a copolymer formed from pe and undecanoic acid and unearthed that the decrease in crystallinity might be due to the breakdown of the crystal structure by introducing pe another report exploring the aging of pp over 12 d with a mercury lamp showed the crystallinity was decreased from 64 to 56 sun et al 2021 thus not all aging processes lead to an increase in crystallinity which is related to the material composition and different processing methods of mps the thermal properties of mps mainly include glass transition temperature tg measured by differential scanning calorimetry dsc and melting point tm by thermogravimetric analysis tga the possible reason for the lower tg of aged mps mao et al 2020 zou et al 2020 is that the molecular weight reduction caused by mps degradation during aging results in less hindered backbone bond rotation these facts suggest that aged mps may reach the glassy state more easily since they require less thermal energy tm often appears together with crystallinity because in general more crystalline substances require higher tm to break down gogolewski et al 1993 and some reports mammo et al 2020 su et al 2021 showed that tm of aged mps was increased with thermal properties mainly due to increased crystallinity however the change of tm is sometimes insignificant and only serves as a reference 2 3 carbonyl index carbonyl index ci obtained by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrum has been defined to represent the aging degree of mps as evidenced by the phenomenon of positive correlation between ci and exposure time zhang et al 2021 ci is calculated as the ratio of the absorbance of the carbonyl peak including ketone carboxylic acid and ester and the methylene reference peak where a1712 cm 1 a2914 cm 1 is usually for pe feng et al 2022 and a1730 cm 1 a1452 cm 1 for ps wang et al 2021 other reference peaks such as 1463 cm 1 728 cm 1 and 1375 cm 1 for pe and 2851 cm 1 for ps are also accepted godoy et al 2020 it was reported that ci of ps was increased from 0 054 to 0 201 0 235 and 0 493 upon exposure to uv cl2 uv h2o and uv h2o2 respectively liu et al 2021 showing that aops composed of oxidizing agent and uv irradiation contribute to the formation of oxygen containing functional groups such as c o thereby promoting the surface polarity of aged mps chamas et al 2020 and low ci under uv cl2 is due to that cl2 radical converting from cl2 has an inhibitory effect wu et al 2016 furthermore the relationship between ci and aging time can be linear or exponential depending on the type of mps subjected to the aging treatment for instance in the study of miranda et al 2021 ci of pe was linearly related to the exposure time in a rooftop experiment while ci of unplasticized pvc was increased sequentially likewise liu et al 2019 unearthed that ci of ps was altered exponentially with time during fenton treatment and a model using principal component analysis pca theory has been applied to analyze the ftir spectra of aged mps the utilization of ci with pca was compared and summarized that ci had the following disadvantages in characterizing the ftir spectra of mps 1 it is limited to a specific region of the infrared spectrum and 2 it relies on a constant reference peak pca has advantages such as capturing alterations in the full ftir spectra and detecting multiple mps simultaneously without the requirement of reference peaks in the study of zvekic et al 2022 the average acceleration factor acf was defined to represent the intensity difference between processes embodied in the weathering rate slope the acf of uvb 22 w m2 natural was modeled to be 4 5 for pp and 6 9 for ps these values are within a reasonable range as uv340 26 w m2 irradiation is 4 times natural solar radiation müller et al 2018 and uv254 30 w irradiation is 16 8 33 6 times natural weathering vockenberg et al 2020 implying the potential application of pca to compare the efficiency of different aging methods 2 4 o c ratio the oxygen carbon o c atom ratio obtained by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps is frequently employed to indicate the aging degree for showing the introduction of oxygen elements into mps and thus generally increases during aging as shown in table 2 o c ratio of ps was increased from 0 04 to 0 22 after 60 d of uva irradiation and from 0 04 to 0 62 directly after o3 h2o exposure for only 3 h rummel et al 2019 liu et al 2019 implying highly accelerated aging induced by ozone based aops has potential to mineralize mps into co2 like ftir xps spectra can also present the distribution of carbon oxygen groups by peak division lang et al 2020 for instance ding et al 2022 uncovered that c o and co were generated in ps after natural aging in air and ultrapure water and liu et al 2021 determined the percentage of oxygen introduced into ps under uv h2o and uv h2o2 for 96 h was 13 2 and 14 2 respectively suggesting that the addition of h2o2 under uv exposure promotes the oxidation of mps li et al 2020 besides liu et al 2019 found that o c ratio of ps during the heat activated persulfate and fenton treatment was positively correlated with ci although both parameters as a function of alteration time were exponential likewise ren et al 2021a reported a negative linear correlation between zeta potential mv and o c ratio of ps after the uva persulfate treatment these results contribute to understanding the aging characteristics of mps however currently no other literature confirms the feasibility of a linear model between ci or zeta potential as a function of the o c ratio more data are required to assess whether this is an isolated case or a general rule 3 adsorption properties of aged mps 3 1 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps understanding the interactions between mps and pollutants has become popular since it is an important aspect in assessing the impact of mps on global pollutant distribution the effect of aging on the adsorption behavior of mps for pollutants have been widely reported table 3 with the lagergren equation applied to fit the adsorption kinetics over time vockenberg et al 2020 3 d q t d t k 1 q e q t 4 d q t d t k 2 q e q t 2 eqs 3 and 4 are the pseudo first order kinetics model pfom and pseudo second order model psom respectively where q e is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and q t is the adsorption capacity at a given time t and k1 and k2 are the rate constants of the pfom and psom kinetic models which are usually determined from experimental data currently these two models are frequently used to analyze the adsorption properties of mps for pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps especially after light irradiation and aops based treatments as shown in table 3 for instance the adsorption of aged isotactic pp for triclosan tcs is better fitted with pfom wu et al 2020a due to the higher r2 of the fitting curve psom is ideal for the adsorption of aged pvc for tetracycline tc and cip and the adsorption of pristine aged ps for propranolol prp sulfamethoxazole smx amlodipine aml and atorvastatin atv fan et al 2021 huang et al 2021 liu et al 2020b suggesting that these adsorption processes involve two or more stages as a result of a combined effect of diffusion physisorption and chemisorption the isotherm models of henry langmuir and freundlich are usually employed for the adsorption of ppcps onto mps which are expressed as follows fan et al 2021 respectively 5 q e k d c e 6 q e q m a x b c e 1 b c e 7 q e k f c e n where ce is the equilibrium concentration kd is partition coefficient and b and qmax are the langmuir constants which are related to the adsorption bonding energy and the maximum sorption capacity kf is the capacity affinity parameter of freundlich model and n dimensionless is the exponential parameter adsorption isotherm can reflect the adsorption capacity and mechanism and the selection is mainly based on r2 of the fitting curve for instance henry model fits the adsorption of tylosin tartrate tyl sulfamethazine smt and erythromycin ery well on aged ps mps with r2 0 970 indicating that monolayer adsorption dominates ding et al 2020 the result that both the langmuir and freundlich models are well fitted for the adsorption of hydrophilic compounds on pristine aged ps mps suggests that in addition to electrostatic interactions lin et al 2021 π π bond interactions in ps play a relatively important role xu et al 2018 moreover adsorption isotherm is also related to the properties of the organics and several studies have demonstrated that the adsorption of tetrabromobisphenol a alkylbenzene and perfluorooctanesulfonamide fits well with linear model zhou et al 2020 wang et al 2015 wu et al 2001 implying that hydrophobic interaction is the main mechanism leading to the adsorption of hydrophobic compounds guo et al 2012 the affinity of pristine mps for ppcps is highly correlated to their log kow values e g the adsorption capacity of pristine ps for atv log know 6 4 is greater than aml log know 2 1 liu et al 2020b since log kow is positively correlated with the partition coefficient as summarized in table 3 the adsorption of aged mps for ppcps is usually enhanced for two main reasons first the active adsorption sites are increased due to the fragmentation of aged mps second the oxygen containing functional groups formed on the surface of aged mp promote electrostatic interaction as well as hydrogen bonding sun et al 2021 nevertheless not all aged mps enhance adsorption affinity for organic pollutants as shown in fig 2 some studies showed that the maximum adsorption capacity qmax of aged ps for bpa and btex weakened müller et al 2018 liu et al 2020a and the adsorption for pahs phenanthrene phe naphthalene nap and pyrene pyr was decreased ding et al 2020 this is due to a combined effect of the surface oxygen groups crystallinity and ssa of aged ps resulting in a decrease in the hydrophobicity thereby reducing the electrostatic interaction furthermore a linear correlation between qe of cip y mg kg based on psom o c ratio x1 and average size x2 µm was developed in the regression analysis for aged ps and pe by liu et al 2019 the result that r2 was 0 856 for pe indicates that qe does not fit well with the linear model applying o c ratio and average size suggesting that the process may be affected by other factors such as the cracks generated and surface charges gao et al 2022 apart from mps and the chemicals themselves the aquatic environment condition in which the adsorption experiment is performed also has an influence on the adsorption properties for example liu et al 2021 uncovered that salinity promoted the sorption of bpa by aged ps mps since na and cl could enhance the polar interactions of the neutral chemicals with water likewise the study by vockenberg et al 2020 concluded that nacl at higher concentrations in water resulted in greater adsorption of diphenylamine dpa onto pe mps it is clear that salinity affects the adsorption capacity of mps and further influences the distribution of organic pollutants in the aquatic environment 3 2 heavy metals like ppcps pfom and psom are also employed to fit the adsorption s of mps for heavy metals and isotherm models include henry langmuir and freundlich as well studies have shown that the adsorption of cr6 on aged pe and pp fits well with pfom liu et al 2021a while psom is ideal for the adsorption of cu2 onto aged pet and pa mps bao et al 2021 suggesting that the adsorption of heavy metals also involve two or more stages and it was revealed that the freundlich model had the best fitting function r2 0 977 for the adsorption of pb2 cu2 cd2 ni2 and zn2 on pristine aged ps mao et al 2020 indicating that the adsorption is multi layered and mainly dominated by electrostatic interactions since negatively charged ps can directly absorb positively charged metal ions wang et al 2021 and the adsorption capacities of different metal ions on pristine aged mps are related to the physiochemical properties of the metal ions themselves qu et al 2020 the enhanced adsorption capacity of aged ps is due to the formation of more oxygen containing functional groups promoting the accumulation of negative charges on the surface accompanied by increased ssa the fact that aged pet and pa mps exhibit improved adsorption properties for cu2 suggests a similar mechanism mainly due to the rough and wrinkled surface providing more adsorption active sites bao et al 2021 all these results confirm that the effects of aging on the adsorption capacity of mps are closely correlated to their structural changes besides it is generally accepted that the natural aging of mps usually occurs under complex conditions and their aging properties can be affected by dissolved organic matter dom salinity and microorganism in the natural aquatic environment tu et al 2020 for example liu et al 2021a the adsorption capacity of naturally aged pp mps for co2 had no significant change and the adsorption of cr6 weakened after exposure to sunlight for 18 months this could be attributed to biofilms forming as a coating to retard the transfer of pollutants from aquatic system to mps however the presence of biofilms originating from microbial colonization can promote the aging of mps by changing the hydrophobicity and surface charge and interacting with heavy metals through complexation thereby affecting the adsorption capacity for instance the adsorption of cu2 on biodegradable poly lactic acid with microbial colonization was significantly enhanced sun et al 2022 considering the obvious deficiencies in simulating the adsorption in nature with artificially aged mps aops induced aging can be performed in simulated seawater or simulated freshwater to increase the environmental relevance 4 aging mechanism numerous studies have confirmed that the indirect photoaging of mps is highly related to the free radicals generated godoy et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 also referred to as environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs vejerano et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 after ps phenol formaldehyde resin pf pe and pvc were irradiated with simulated natural light 50 w xenon lamp wavelength 300 nm for 15 d it was unearthed that epfrs were mainly formed on the surface of pf and ps mps due to the cleavage of chemical bonds and detected by electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy zhu et al 2020a during aging the absorption of photons breaks the c h bond of the main chain thereby forming the first epfr tertiary alkyl radical p zhu et al 2020b which then reacts with o2 dissolved o2 to form poo radical 2 and poo interacts with h2 or h in water to form pooh since the dissociation energies of pooh p ooh and pooh are 175 8 kj mol 293 0 kj mol and 376 7 kj mol respectively liu et al 2021b pooh is more easily cleaved to form alkoxy radical po radial 3 and oh tian et al 2019 oh further reacts with po in the presence of o2 to form o2 and then loses electrons to form h2o2 on the one hand the produced oh attacks the main chain resulting in chain scission zhao et al 2021 hu et al 2021 it can be concluded that oh is the main factor leading to the indirect photoaging of mps the difference between the aging of common polyolefin mps and pvc is that the latter involves the cleavage of ccl also referred to as dechlorination miao et al 2020 when pvc mps pcln are exposed to light uv or sunlight or aops long chains of pcln break ccl fractures due to high photon energy and the first type of efpr pcln 1 is formed then h is extracted and produces another efpr pcccln 1 xing et al 2022 along with the rupture of ccl the intermediates converted from efprs react with o2 dissolved o2 to form epoxy groups which are decomposed and rearranged to generate oh bonds subsequently oh resulting from the process attacks oh bonds and c o bonds are formed on pvc chains kelkar et al 2019 throughout the aging process attack of oh on the backbone cleavage of ccl and extraction of h continue to occur fig 4 there are more approaches for aging induced by aops compared to indirect photoaging due to the wide variety of aops the mechanism of aops functioning on mps is mainly free radical initiated oxidation where the initiators include oh o2 h2o2 and other free radicals such as so4 cl and clo reactive chlorine species rcs generated from the attack of specific oxidants like s2o8 2 and cl2 resulting in chain cleavage and the formation of surface oxygen containing functional groups since oh is non selective with a high redox potential 2 8 v wang et al 2021 and leads to the formation of other ros chen et al 2020 to some extent it is considered the main factor for aops induced aging of mps although the current reaction system of aops for the aging of mps is relatively simple the fact that an electro fenton like system achieved 75 of pvc dechlorination in 6 h miao et al 2020 suggests that accelerated aops are a new idea for the efficient removal of mps as proposed in fig 5 where the low molecular products formed by chain scission and oxidation of mps wu et al 2021a mao et al 2020 are potentially mineralized into co2 and h2o2 under the continuous attack of ros and rcs 5 emerging techniques for aging process analysis 5 1 application of 2d cos ftir due to the large molecular weight of mps and lots of free radicals involved in their aging the specific product distribution is not yet clear jeon et al 2021 for technical flaws some researchers have adopted two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos combined with ftir spectra to roughly analyze the conversion pathways and products of mps by univariate analysis as the spectrum alteration has a certain relationship with aging time priyanka and saravanakumar 2022 the coordinates on the synchronous φ x1 x2 and asynchronous ψ x1 x2 maps are generated from the dynamic spectra ỹ x t showing the variations of ftir spectra y x t as a function of wavenumber x and aging time t as follows according to the hilbert noda transform method chen et al 2019 8 φ x 1 x 2 1 t m a x t m i n t m i n t m a x y x 1 t y x 2 t d t 9 ψ x 1 x 2 1 t m a x t m i n t m i n t m a x y x 1 t z x 2 t d t where z x 2 t 1 π t m i n t m a x y x 2 t 1 t t d t is the hilbert transform of the signal ỹ x t and t is the integral variable t m a x and t m i n represent the minimum and maximum aging time respectively the value of φ x 1 x 2 represents the simultaneous or coincidental changes of spectral intensity variations at x 1 and x 2 during the interval between t min and t max and the intensity of ψ x 1 x 2 represents the sequential order of spectral intensity variation at x 1 and x 2 the rules are as follows 1 if φ x1 x2 0 ψ x1 x2 0 the intensity change occurs at x1 before x2 2 if φ x1 x2 0 ψ x1 x2 0 the intensity change occurs at x1 after x2 3 if φ x1 x2 0 the above rules are reversed sun et al 2021 since the ftir spectrum itself can reveal the specific group to which the peak is ascribed the application of 2d cos to further obtain the alteration order of these groups is the main reason for implantation priyanka and saravanakumar 2022 for example seven positive automatic peaks appearing along the diagonal on the synchronous map of ps in the study of mao et al 2020 indicated that all corresponding groups were increased with aging time the asynchronous correlation spectrum suggested that ch2 on ps formed unstable epoxides co and alcohols coh which were then oxidized to form carbonyl groups c o and oc o after chain scission occurred ding et al 2020 also applied ftir 2d cos to perform a similar investigation of the thermal aging 75 c pathways of ps highlighting the c c cleavage on the benzene ring of ps in the initial phase it is obvious that 2d cos does have certain merits for the current study on the aging pathways of mps ding et al 2022 however given that only ftir is currently associated with 2d cos the application of this approach in aops induced aging of mps is limited as the distribution order of active species resulting from the added oxidant that contributes to the spectral signal cannot be provided 5 2 highlights of eem parafac analysis in addition to 2d cos ftir excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac has been employed to analyze the three dimensional fluorescence spectra of mps solution during aging yan et al 2021 to obtain the leachate or products released from mps thereby inferring possible aging pathways generally this analysis can express the ratio of various components in the solution such as aromatic proteins and soluble microbial by product like wang et al 2009 yuan et al 2022 observed that the red shift of eem peaks became significant with exposure time revealing that photoaging may promote the release of low molecular soluble organics photoluminescence pl was defined to indicate the formation of aromatic organic intermediates in the study of liu et al 2021a the strongest pl signal in the first 48 h of photo fenton aging of ps was probably emitted from soluble organic molecules with benzene rings lucas and porter 1988 and the subsequent decrease could be attributed to the opening of the benzene ring these results suggest that changes in mps during aging reflected in eem peak information warrant future application by researchers shi et al 2021 although only a few publications have documented eem as an analytical approach for the aging characteristics of mps 6 factors affecting aging processes as discussed earlier oh plays a significant role in the aging of mps briefly all factors affecting the production of oh could influence aging efficiency for instance hco3 and co3 2 are scavengers of oh vione et al 2009 although the effects on photoaging and aops initiated aging are yet known the formation of ho2 is reduced at lower ph leading to a decrease in oh production halliwell and gutteridge 1984 suggesting aops induced aging treatment like uv h2o2 may be more effective at high ph rosenfeldt et al 2006 furthermore natural organic matter nom can quench oh with little stimulation in oh formation guan et al 2013 thereby retarding the aging process grebel et al 2011 besides the nom surface contains abundant oxygen containing functional groups that integrate with mps through hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions and further influence the aging efficiency by occupying the active sites or photon shielding effect wammer et al 2013 wu et al 2021b considering that nom is ubiquitous in the aqueous system and is frequently used to simulate natural environments yin et al 2015 it is necessary to study the aging of mps under its siege low molecular natural organic acids such as oxalate affect the photoaging of mps by promoting oh production wang et al 2020 halide ions influence the photoaging of mps through the formation of reactive halogenated radicals rhs resulting from the interaction between cl br oh and nom lang et al 2022 such as chlorine radical cl bromine radical br bichloride radical cl2 dibromo radical br2 and chlorobromo radical clbr parker et al 2016 and wu et al 2021a uncovered that cl in seawater can be transformed into cl2 and inhibit the formation of o2 as evidenced by the result that the photoaging efficiency of pp in ultrapure water was significantly higher than that in estuarine and coastal seawater in addition the particle size of mps also affects aging as small sized mps have larger ssa and thus more active sites for example the dechlorination efficiency of pvc with a particle size of 2 µm was higher than that of 150 µm during photoaging wang et al 2020 on the one hand biofilms formed by microorganism colonization on the surface of mps improved their hydrophobicity by the attack on weaker components in the microplastic structure wu et al 2022 such as unsaturated double bonds branched chains and hydrocarbon groups at the end of the main chain and on the other hand they inhibit aging by blocking the exposure of mps to light or aops moreover the chemical additives in mps such as dyes plasticizers stabilizers antioxidants etc might be readily released during aging since they are physically bound to the polymer meng et al 2021 it was reported that additives might drive the initial photooxidation degradation of pe under uv irradiation al harraq et al 2022 however they might slow down the aging process by reducing the surface area of mps exposed to uv or aops luo et al 2020a possible factors affecting the aging of mps are summarized in table 4 7 conclusions and perspectives understanding the aging effects of mps is theoretically fundamental and critical for studying the spatial distribution of environmental pollution as 94 of massive discarded mps are aged and interact actively with inorganic organic contaminants this comprehensive review summarized the aging characteristics of mps in terms of the physiochemical properties environmental behavior mechanisms and affecting factors and evaluated the limitations of the analytical methods for mps in current studies generally the order of aging efficiency was aops composed of oxidation and uv irradiation uv irradiation alone natural aging which is reflected in increased carbonyl index o c atom ratio and ssa the formation of oxygen containing functional groups altered the hydrophobicity and surface charge of aged mps and further affected their adsorption capacities for ppcps and heavy metals by a combined effect of hydrophobic electrostatic π π diffusion and hydrogen bond interaction in addition the aging mechanisms regarding the contribution of epfrs and ros were elucidated all factors affecting the formation of oh and o2 were considered to affect the aging efficiency such as nom ph halogen ions etc finally the pros and cons of two emerging approaches 2d cos ftir and eem parafac for the study of aging pathways and leachate were discussed the investigation of the accelerated aging induced by aops is significant in explaining the formation pathways of secondary mps and enables mineralization more knowledge regarding the overall toxicity of aops is necessary to evaluate the potential risks to human health and ecosystems and more studies on environmental behavior other than the adsorption of aged mps are needed to understand the effect of aging suggestions for future work on the aging of mps are as follows 1 although the gap between laboratory simulation and actual conditions has been reduced by using simulated natural environments such as synthetic seawater most of the mps used by researchers are commercial mps with stable properties natural mps can be employed for the aging analysis to increase environmental relevance in future research 2 more accelerated aging experiments by aops can be carried out to verify the linear and non linear simulations of the relationship between different parameters e g ic vs o c contact angle vs o c and zeta potential vs ci to advance our understanding of aging characteristics 3 studying the intermediate and final products of mps is important for understanding the toxicity of the aging process although some studies have applied 2d cos to analyze the possible aging pathways the identification and toxicity study of the specific products are worthy of further investigation 4 studies show that biofilms can act as a barrier to mps thereby reducing adsorption for pollutants however biofilms can also act as carriers of pollutants to increase adsorption hence specific information about biofilms including microbial species growth rates and effect on microplastic structures should be studied thoroughly 5 mps are mainly separated by traditional methods such as coagulation sedimentation and filtration in water treatment however they continue to exist unless they are eliminated thus the application of aops for the removal of mps is also a topic worthy of research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

15022,adsorptive separation technologies have proven to be effective on organic contaminant removal in aqueous water however the breakthrough of contaminants is inevitable and can be at relatively low bed volumes which makes the regeneration of spent adsorbents an urgent need electrochemically induced regeneration processes are given special attention and may provide ease of operation through in situ regeneration avoiding i removal and transport adsorbents and ii avoiding use of hazardous chemicals i e organic solvents acids or bases therefore this review article critically evaluates the fundamental aspects of in situ electro regeneration for spent carbons and later discusses specific examples related to the treatment of emerging contaminants such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances or pfas the fundamental concepts of electrochemically driven processes are comprehensively defined and addressed in terms of i adsorbent characteristics ii contaminant properties iii adsorption regeneration driving operational parameters and conditions and iv the competitive effects of water matrices additionally future research needs and challenges to enhance understanding of in situ electro regeneration applications for organic contaminants specifically pfas laden adsorbents are identified and outlined as a future key perspective keywords electrochemical water treatment granular activated carbon gac per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas spent carbon water treatment process intensification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mitigation of emerging organic contaminants i e phenolic compounds pesticides per and polyfluoroalkyl substances or pfas in aquatic systems has gained increasing interest in the scientific and regulatory community technologies to ensure desirable complete demineralization of contaminants using destructive approaches are still in early stage technology such as plasma isowamwen et al 2022 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes or photon driven processes tow et al 2021 nienhauser et al 2022 several remediation studies have highlighted that physicochemical separation technologies based on adsorption and ionic exchange resins are the most prominent solutions for water treatment processes to remove organic contaminants from water sources the implementation of adsorption has been preferred as one of the cost effective solutions chosen by practitioners deng et al 2015 du et al 2014 zhi and liu 2016 liang et al 2018 soriano et al 2017 2019 however the main concerns inherent with organic contaminant removal through these non destructive separation techniques i e adsorption ion exchange reverse osmosis nanofiltration or foam fractionation are the disposal of organic contaminant laden activated carbon or non regenerable ion exchange resin membrane adsorbents upon reaching to exhaustion zaggia et al 2016 gagliano et al 2020 on the other side the existing technologies such as regenerable ion exchange resin nanofiltration or reverse osmosis have been applied to separate contaminants from the water to a concentrated brine waste stream and then a destruction demineralization technology is used to destroy the contaminants in the concentrated waste stream on site liang et al 2022 the rapid increase in concentration of organic contaminants in the environment is a disconcerting fact which resulted in inappropriate disposal of spent sorbents in landfills or incineration that may backtrack the contaminants in a pervasive cycle back into the water sources therefore the disposal of organic contaminant laden adsorbents is a major challenge and development of novel regeneration techniques are needed to make adsorptive technologies more sustainable regeneration of organic contaminants laden adsorbents arise as an engineered solution by i extending the operational life of adsorbents and ii providing opportunities to preconcentrate emerging contaminants such as pfas into brines that can be treated by destructive technologies the separation and preconcentration in high salinity background will have positive incidence by increasing the energy efficiency of destructive technologies such as electrochemical oxidation or plasma treatments so far among all the common regeneration techniques i e thermal solvent and microwave for spent carbon media as described in the current literature and practices in the wastewater industry in situ electrochemical regeneration can be a cost effective method that benefits from i minimal adsorbent loss 2 loss in adsorptive capacity per cycle garcia rodriguez et al 2020 ii chemical free operation and iii ease of application in small and medium sized water treatment systems mcquillan et al 2018 zhou et al 2022 however many research questions arise from hybrid adsorbent technologies electro desorption may change adsorbent surface chemistry induced by polarization or faradaic reactions during electro driven desorption processes the pore structure can be altered in which the microporous regions of carbon can be converted into mesoporous regions and thus surface area decreased mcquillan et al 2018 garcia rodriguez et al 2020 the main goal of this comprehensive review is to summarize discuss up to date current literature knowledge on in situ electro regeneration of carbon based adsorbents such as granulated activated carbon gac this review specifically aims to i critically review the current electro regeneration techniques for spent gac ii discuss the role of selected carbon properties contaminant structures operational conditions and background water matrices on the electro regeneration efficiency and iii identify the current gaps of knowledge and provide future research priorities and engineering applications for emerging contaminants such as pfas 2 in situ electrification of spent carbon regeneration in situ electrochemical regeneration technology can be classified into cathodic anodic and combined cathodic anodic regenerations in the current literature garcia rodriguez et al 2020 the adsorbent regeneration efficiency re depends on different parameters such as current density electrolyte type and concentration electrode material and reactor configuration mcquillan et al 2018 zhou et al 2022 however the lack of studies that investigated the application of electro regeneration for emerging contaminants laden carbon adsorbents point an important research gap to be covered limited number of carbonaceous adsorbents have been used as a cathode in the electrochemical regeneration process santos et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 when the cathodic current is applied to the saturated carbon polarized carbon can act as a microelectrode and enhance the degradation of adsorbed contaminants patterson et al 2019 trellu et al 2018 primental et al 2008 due to their conductive and chemically resistant features these carbon based adsorbents can contribute to the increased mass transfer coefficient and reduce the energy consumption wei et al 2010 poza nogveiras et al 2021 2022 a proposed mechanisms for electro regeneration of organic contaminant laden adsorbents in the batch systems are illustrated in fig 1 the electro regeneration of contaminant laden adsorbents may occur in three steps in the first step the local ph of the cathode surface can increase due to the hydrogen evolution reaction yielding oh ions on the cathode according to a reaction shown in eq 1 note that adsorbent surface can become highly negatively charged due to cathodic polarization and then can repel the negatively charged groups of the organic contaminant step ii depending on the functional groups in the organic contaminant structure anionic species of organic contaminants in the aqueous water and therefore cathodic regeneration of organic contaminants laden adsorbent may occur at good efficiency driven by the strong electrostatic repulsions between the cathodically charged adsorbent surface and organic contaminants after being desorbed from the adsorbent mineralization or degradation of contaminants may occur on the anode surface step iii along with oxygen evolution reaction on the anode according to reaction eq 2 briefly repeating the unzipping mineralization or degradation cycles contaminants can be mineralized or degraded to final products such methane h2o and co2 garcia rodriguez et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 nienhauser et al 2022 1 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 g 2 o h 2 2 h 2 o o 2 g 4 h 4 e to become more sustainable and beneficial from techno economic points of view electrochemical regeneration of adsorbents may appear as a promising emerging approach to overcome these limitations garcia rodriguez et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 recently a substantial number of studies have been focused on the electrochemical regeneration of organic contaminants mostly phenol laden active carbon ac and gac table 1 briefly carbon was previously saturated with organic contaminants i e phenol toluene p nitrophenol natural organic matter etc or dyes the performance of an electrochemical process for the spent carbon regeneration was evaluated using several types of electrodes such as platinum graphite rod stemless steel titanium etc and three different reactor configurations were tested such as fluidized bed packed bed with a divided cell and packed bed with an undivided cell in the current literature researchers have mainly evaluated the effects of four operational parameters including current density initial ph reaction time and electrolyte types the current literature studies were reported that according on the varying current density and other operational conditions the electro regeneration efficiencies of up to 90 100 were achieved table 1 according to the re and factor of electron utilization efficiency eur values in table 1 eur values declined with decreasing contact time and current for achieving higher regeneration performance and energy cost effectiveness therefore the in situ electrification approach for spent carbons can be a promising technology in the near future due to its advantageous aspects such as small footprint zero waste and cost effectiveness 3 understanding the role of operational conditions during in situ electro regeneration fig 2 summarizes the most relevant factors that can impact the efficiency of regeneration and the regeneration mechanisms of organic contaminants laden adsorbents however it is important to remark that so far the mechanistic understanding of the relationships between molecular structures of contaminants and their precursors and adsorbents have not been fully explored these different relevant aspects that may rule in situ electro regeneration are thoroughly discussed below 3 1 impact of adsorbent characteristics electro regeneration of spent carbon has been previously proven in a single reactor alternating between adsorption and regeneration cycles it can be conducted in situ at ambient pressure and temperature and do not cause any changes on the carbon mass suggesting gac reuse after several cycles of adsorption and regeneration cycle is possible garcia rodriguez et al 2020 electrical conductivity of gac is the touchstone of electro regeneration process lower potential can be required for the desorption of contaminants if the electrode was more conductive park et al 2007 maarof et al 2017 carbonaceous cathode materials have been identified as suitable electrocatalyst that promote selective oxygen reduction to h2o2 poza nogveiras et al 2021 2022 in situ electrogeneration of h2o2 may benefit post degradation by enacting different aops e g fenton h2o2 uv etc bouzayani et al 2017 garcia espinazo et al 2021 2022 castillo monray et al 2020 electrogeneration of h2o2 depends on dissolved oxygen availability in solution and the electrode potential reached that should be equal or higher than the thermodynamic potential required for the bielectronic reduction of oxygen herein it is important to remark that in some instances the electrode potential reached may not suffice the requirements to effectively produce h2o2 note that the main focus of electro regeneration is to modify the surface charge of the carbon adsorbent by inducing cathodic polarization thus faradaic processes may not occur simultaneously depending on the operational conditions independently of the operational conditions the electro regeneration efficiency of gac might be conditioned not only due to the changes in conductivity but also by physicochemical characteristics of gac pore size distribution surface area and surface chemistry of carbon among all physicochemical characteristics pore size distribution and surface area are the two most important parameters of gacs that control adsorption desorption processes acuña bedoya et al 2020 pore size distribution determines the fraction of total pore volume that can be accessed by organic contaminants during the adsorption process micropore filing is the main mechanism in porous carbons for low molecular weight contaminants berenguer et al 2010 ersan et al 2019 after electro regeneration at high current densities the surface area of gac can decrease due to the collapse of pores on the micropore regions sometimes the loss of micropores can be compensated by an increase in mesopore regions that allow maintaining a constant adsorption electro regeneration efficiency over several consecutive cycles xiao and hill 2017 2019 acuña bedoya et al 2020 so far limited number of studies which has been focusing on the cathodic and anodic regeneration efficiency of contaminant laden gac emphasized that the regeneration efficiency of cathodic surface is about 5 10 higher than anodic regeneration the higher performance under cathodic regime might be explained by the higher amount of oxygen functional groups attached on the gac surface that become negatively charged during cathodic regeneration favoring electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged contaminants narbaitz and cen 1994 berenguer et al 2009 furthermore anodic polarization of carbons may severely damage the adsorbent structure and diminish operational life surface chemistry characteristics of gac can also alter the electro regeneration efficiency since cathodic regeneration can cause deprotonation of oxygen containing functional groups increases negative charge density at the carbon interface which is favorable case for the desorption of organic contaminants the adsorbed contaminants can be released from the gac surface or may be exchanged with inorganic ions in water zaggia et al 2016 it should be also noted that factors such as gac contaminant ratio competition with existing ionic species pore size distribution of carbon carbon type and the existing functional groups are expected to impact the regeneration efficiency of organic contaminant laden carbon zhou et al 2022 garcia rodriguez et al 2020 consequently further investigations must be held in order to better understand the impact of sorbent characteristics and types on the electro regeneration application 3 2 impact of organic contaminant properties organic contaminant properties including geometrical configurations i e carbon chain length and ring structure functional groups of contaminants hydrophobicity and molecular size are important factors controlling the adsorption mechanism the geometrical configurations of organic contaminant showed a significant impact on their interaction with gac because of high surface area and interstitial channel of their surface the planar versus nonplanar molecular structure of organic contaminants may also affect their desorption behavior van noort et al 2009 for example a larger external surface and higher meso macropore regions may provide less favorable desorption to planar molecules than non planar molecules based on the strong pi pi interactions according to table 1 no studies have examined and reported the impact of molecular configuration and chain length on the electro desorption of organic contaminants from carbon in addition based on their terminal functional groups the organic contaminants with a higher hydrophobic property can be preferentially adsorbed on the adsorbent surface due to the strong hydrophobic interactions ersan et al 2017 thus based on the structural properties of contaminants and surface interactions with carbon surface it is expected that during electro regeneration process more hydrophobic contaminants might be first desorbed from the negatively charged gacs surface as compared to less hydrophobic or hydrophilic short chain contaminants further research is warranted to confirm the findings to include more hydrophobic i e polycyclic aromatics hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls etc hydrophilic i e pesticides antibiotics etc complex aliphatic i e pfas trichloroethylene etc and aromatic i e phenanthrene tetracycline etc contaminants other organic contaminant properties i e pka sorbent water partition coefficients and molecular diffusivity in water and sorbent media can also play a role in electro regeneration efficiency of gac more specifically some of the organic contaminants such as pfas exhibit mutually hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties hydrophobic properties are primarily attributed to the low polarizability of fluorine atoms in other words can be attributed to strong c f bonds and long fluorocarbon chains water solubility decreases with increasing carbon chain length gagliano et al 2020 and thus pfas become more lipophilic as indicated by octanol water partition coefficients kow the attachment of terminal functional group to fluoroalkyl chain makes pfas molecule more soluble in the aqueous water i e hydrophilic at environmentally relevant ph 7 7 5 pfas compounds exhibit anionic properties according to their low acid dissociation constant pka values thus pfas hydrophilic head is negatively charged making them behave as surfactants as surfactant pfas have both hydrophobic and lipophobic regions two main driving forces hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions can be volunteered for the electro regeneration of pfas specifically long chained laden gac for example according to the pka values of pfos 3 27 and pfoa 0 3 8 under relevant ph conditions they are fully soluble in the water and thus electrostatic repulsion may occur between the anionic head group of pfas and negatively charged surface group of gacs xiao et al 2017 overall further investigations are still needed to validate these hypothesizes to better understand the impact of different characteristics of organic contaminants specifically mutually hydrophobic and hydrophilic complex molecules on electro regeneration process 3 3 impact of operational parameters oxidation of contaminants require high overpotentials for oxygen evolution to form radical species as redox mediators these electrocatalytic conditions cannot be attained by carbons submitted to anodic polarization cerron calle et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 garcia segura et al 2020a b most organic contaminants can be degraded under anodic potentials way below the potentials required to mineralize for desorption of organic contaminant laden carbon it is important to note that oxidation process on the carbon surface is not favorable due to the high oxidation potential of organic contaminants however cathodic regeneration can be possible for absorbent regeneration which can desorb contaminants from the carbon surface and produce organic contaminant laden brine solutions to be treated on the anode side in this sense the regeneration efficiency of electro regeneration processes depends on multiple factors including current density electrolyte type and concentration electrode material adsorbent properties and reactor configuration following subsections will further discuss each of these factors 3 3 1 current density the effect of current density on electro regeneration efficiency has been evaluated for different organic contaminants laden adsorbents specifically ac recently zhou et al 2019 evaluated the electro regeneration efficiency of phenol laden ac at different currents after 5 h of treatment regeneration efficiencies of 72 76 78 and 86 were reached at 15 30 50 and 80 ma respectively besides zhou et al 2006 evaluated different parameters for electrochemical regeneration of ac in a fluidized bed reactor after p nitrophenol adsorption with using current densities of 2 4 6 8 and 12 ma cm 2 the regeneration efficiency reached 69 81 86 90 and 92 respectively after 1 5 h of treatment at room temperature ph 3 and nacl 5 g l as support electrolyte table 1 the impact of current density should be also related to changes of the local ph and electrolyte type due to water splitting and the negative charge accumulated on the cathode surface zanella et al 2016 the release of contaminants can be expected without carbon losses generated by hydrogenation cracking 3 3 2 electrolyte and anode material electrolyte selection is an important component for in situ electro regeneration due to their role in electrical conductivity and the role of additional electrochemical reactions to date the most used electrolyte is sodium chloride nacl in a concentration range of 0 1 to 1 0 w w narbaitz and chen 1994 mostafa et al 2018 garcia segura et al 2020a cerron calle et al 2022 nacl electrolyte is electroactive and may generate active chlorine species depending on the anode material such as chlorine hclo clo equations 3 6 or chlorine radical cl by eq 7 zhou and lei 2006 mostafa et al 2018 zhou et al 2022 3 c l c l ads e 4 c l ads c l c l 2 e 5 c l 2 h 2 o hocl h c l 6 hocl h oc l 7 c l o h c l o h inert electrolytes such as na2so4 nahco3 and naclo4 were evaluated presenting lower regeneration efficiency for selected organic pollutants i e phenol toluene zhang 2002 the higher regeneration in chloride media can be explained by the positive impact on regeneration of coexisting oxidation events facilitated by active chlorine species as mentioned before at higher ionic strength solubility of organic contaminants decreases and may inhibit gac regeneration thus the investigation of varying electrolytes at different concentrations are required to identify unexpected adsorption desorption characteristic of organic contaminants low concentration of na2so4 enough to reduce the solution resistivity may be an alternative to avoid secondary reactions or avoid generating undesired products i e chlorinated by products electro regeneration of organic contaminant laden adsorbents should be considered as a new framework to evaluate different electrolyte parameters such as ph concentration and different matrixes anode material is an important part of the system configuration despite not being directly involved the selection of suitable anodic materials may enable electrochemical degradation of released contaminants during electro regeneration electrodes with higher overpotential for water oxidation i e boron doped diamond bdd and dimensionally stable anode dsa can generate reactive species depending on the ph and the potential reached acuña bedoya et al 2020 however if the interest relies simply on the carbon regeneration and collection of brine inexpensive anodes can be selected to simply close the electrical circuit it is not necessary to use an expensive or special electrodes to desorb the adsorbate the use of platinum or titanium oxide exemplify alternatives for regeneration systems that do not require oxidation reactions to mineralize the contaminants 3 3 3 reactor design reactor configuration is another important consideration depending on the practical application of the electro regeneration process the electro regeneration of spent carbon changes the intraparticle properties of the spent carbon i e pore regions and specific surface area and thus the intraparticle mass transport rates of all organic contaminants are expected to change this challenge will affect the mass transfer zone for each contaminant in a gac packed bed reactor configuration and affect the design and operation criteria of the gac packed bed reactor fig 3 a to ensure the optimum removal of organic contaminants crittenden et al 2005 for anodic electro regeneration the carbonaceous adsorbents must reach the specific potential to produce direct or indirect oxidation process however cathodic electro regeneration just requires enough superficial charge to release the contaminant garcia oton et al 2005 zhou et al 2022 among all reactor configurations fixed bed fluidized bed undivided and divided reactors are the most commonly used in the current literature for electro regeneration process fixed bed reactor as depicted in fig 3 a fixed bed reactor uses a gac fixed in the bottom in contact with the cathode and the anode this configuration is the simplest arrangement that can control the current density efficiency and scaling up conditions nonetheless short circuiting and low mass transport are the main drawbacks of this configuration weng and hsu 2008 fluidized bed reactor fluidized bed configuration as shown in fig 3b uses electrolyte or a fluid to enhance the mass transfer however the turbulence created decrease the current efficiency since ohmic resistance increases in general this configuration presents higher regeneration efficiency than fixed bed reactor but involves a higher energy consumption liu et al 2022 undivided reactor as presented in fig 3c undivided configuration in difference with fixed bed reactor the adsorbent material is in contact just with one electrode i e cathode or anode in this configuration both electrodes are in the same chamber meanwhile the selected electrode with gac can regenerate the other electrode still being part of the overall electrochemical reactions as mentioned supporting electrolyte can react in the electrode without the adsorbent generating other species or intermediates can be oxidized or reduced in the same chamber weng et al 2008 divided reactor in contrast with undivided reactor divided reactor uses a membrane to separate the electrodes in the solution as shown in fig 3d in this configuration the counter electrode is isolated from the adsorption compartment without any possible interference in the overall process the membrane used allow the migration of ions to close the circuit weng et al 2008 since the oxidation of organic contaminants is unlikely for cathodic electro regeneration of contaminant laden gac the electro regeneration can be accomplished using all these reactor configurations thus regeneration efficiency of gac can warrant to evaluate for different reactor configurations with varying all these parameters in the near future 3 3 4 energy consumption for a recirculation mode under constant current of electro regeneration process the electrical energy consumption ec kwh g is an appropriate technique for evaluating their operational costs garcia rodriguez et al 2020 the required electrical energy used to decrease the concentration of organic contaminant in solution is calculated using ec values for flow through operation eq 8 8 ec e cell i t 1000 a c mass where ecell kw is the potential differences through the electro regeneration system v i is the applied current a t is the contact time h and acmass is the mass of activated carbon in the reactor g and 1000 is the conversion factor the ec can be used to examine impact of varying operational conditions that may affect the regeneration time such as applied current amount of spent carbon in the fixed bed column and the number of adsorption regeneration cycles additionally to calculate the current efficiency for electro regeneration of the spent carbon the eur values have been calculated which represents how many grams of carbon could be regenerated with charged one mole electron used zhou and lei 2006 the higher cost effectiveness of the electro regeneration process is defined by the higher eur value eur is defined as in eq 9 9 e u r m f i t where m is the mass of the regenerated carbon g f is the faraday constant 96 486 c mol 1 i is the current ma and t is the regeneration times h when comparing the energy consumption of current regeneration techniques at the industrial scale the thermal regeneration technique is suffering from high energy cost due to the elevated temperatures up to 1000 c as well as decomposition and loss of spent carbon watanabe et al 2016 2018 xiao et al 2020 the chemical methods i e solvent extraction and wet oxidation are also costly and result in lower adsorption capacities because of residual solvent and catalyst in the adsorbents another alternative regeneration strategy is microwave regeneration which is also costly at 900 kwh kg pan et al 2016 recently only one study has demonstrated the in situ regeneration of ac with an innovative electro fenton reactor design which achieved high efficiency and low energy consumption for phenol laden carbon garcia rodriguez et al 2020 almost 97 phenol removal with energy consumption below 1 kwh kg of ac under optimal conditions was reported in another electro regeneration study zhou and lei 2006 found 90 p nitrophenol desorbed from gac for 1 5 h contact time and the energy consumption per unit kilogram of gac treated was 2 8 kwh kg based on the relationship between electro regeneration efficiency and the energy cost weng and hsu 2008 reported that the energy requirement per unit mass of gac treated range from 5 5 to 1362 7 kwh ton equivalent to the energy cost ranging from 0 3 to 81 8 usd ton based on the current electricity rate in the applied country herein compared with other regeneration techniques the advantages of the electro regeneration process are also included environmental compatibility reusability energy efficiency and low cost therefore electro regeneration is a promising alternative technology to thermal and solvent regeneration techniques for full scale applications in terms of energy requirements for effective regeneration of the spent adsorbents 3 4 impact of background water matrices regeneration efficiency is mainly impacted by gac types and organic contaminant planar vs nonplanar long vs short chain functional group properties and operational conditions but it is also impacted by background water matrix parameters such as the presence of organic matter ph and ionized species 3 4 1 organic matter organic matter is ubiquitous in natural water systems and it can be originated from different organics such as natural nom algal impacted aom and effluent organic matter efom the interactions between organic matter and gac are inevitable and organic matter may change their adsorption desorption efficiency ersan et al 2016 two possible mechanisms play key roles in adsorption desorption processes in the presence of organic matter i loading efficiency of contaminants on gac can decrease because of the site competitions or pore blockage and ii nom molecules can easily oxidize during in situ electro regeneration and thus nom and organic contaminant competition can reduce with increasing regeneration cycles several studies have examined the impact of nom or dissolved organic carbon doc on mitigation of organic contaminant on gac appleman et al 2013 kothawala et al 2017 dixit et al 2020 moral et al 2020 and exhibited that organic matter was not altered sgroi et al 2018 or accelerated the pfas uptake mccleaf et al 2017 therefore we assume that the impact of nom on the adsorption desorption of organic contaminants on gac is highly depended on nom characteristics e g aromaticity molecular weight and size etc adsorbent characteristics and organic contaminant properties this warrants the investigation of electro regeneration efficiency of organic contaminant laden gacs in the presence of organic matter 3 4 2 ph another important factor that can impact the electro regeneration of organic laden adsorbents is the ph of the system based on the ph of the regenerant system the organic contaminants may hold cationic anionic and or zwitterionic functional groups therefore when ph pka and phpzc point of zero charge of the organic contaminants and adsorbents the desorption efficiency may increase due to amplified electrostatic repulsion between ionized organic contaminant and adsorbent surface acuña bedoya et al 2020 the acidic conditions may decrease the contaminant s solubility and neutralize the functional groups on the adsorbent surface e g carboxylic acids once gacs are placed in an electrolytic solution their surface become charged depending on the phpzc of the adsorbent at ph values above the phpzc of adsorbent the net charge on the gac surface is negative because of the deprotonation of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups ersan and ersan 2021 bernal et al 2020 as a result the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged organic contaminant and adsorbent surface become more favorable in contrast when ph phpzc of the adsorbent the net charge on the gac surface becomes positive and electrostatic interaction between contaminants and adsorbent surfaces increases ersan et al 2017 therefore the electro regeneration efficiency of saturated adsorbents is better at high ph levels higher than their phpzc due to increased electrostatic repulsion between anionic functional group of organic contaminants and adsorbent surface 4 current knowledge on regeneration techniques for pfas laden carbon current research is focused on development and demonstration of an effective pfas laden carbon regeneration technology using thermal and chemical regeneration techniques schultz et al 2003 reported that incineration of saturated carbon for 2 s under a combustion chamber reaching temperatures of 1200 c was adequate for pfas destruction and the exhaust gas could be scrubbed to produce a solid caf2 precipitate takemine et al 2013 also observed 90 demineralization of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa using airstream at 700 c more recently other studies have pointed out that thermal regeneration of spent gac can successfully decompose long chain i e pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and short chain pfas i e perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs perfluoro pentanoic acid pfpea perfluorobutanoic acid pfba perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa buck et al 2011 takemine et al 2013 watanabe et al 2016 2018 xiao et al 2020 le et al 2013 rayne and forest 2009 the main limitation of thermal regeneration techniques is that decomposition or demineralization of pfas mostly depend on their functional groups carboxylic versus sulfonic groups as presented in fig 4 the decomposition of short and long chain pfca and pfsa has been reported to be much higher than genx at varying temperature ranges baghirzade et al 2021 winchell et al 2021 among all pfas chemicals pfsa compounds are more recalcitrant at high temperature 250 c xiao et al 2020 therefore thermal regeneration 1000 c is highly impacted by functional groups and carbon chain of pfas le et al 2013 so far the researchers have been only focused on the decomposition mechanisms of spent carbon during thermal reactivation to thoroughly address the impacts of regeneration on the regeneration cycle s efficiency of spent carbon further analysis of the adsorption capacity of pfas on regenerated adsorbents needs to be conducted besides thermal regeneration method involves destruction of carbon micro structure loss of surface area and high energy consumption and produce of co2 h2o hf and sulfur compounds baghirzade et al 2021 winchell et al 2021 wang et al 2020 these undesired side effects of thermal treatment may compromise the competitiveness of regenerated adsorbents one of the major barriers of regenerative incineration is that the process should be conducted off the adsorption packed bed reactors which imply for labor intensive removal of spent carbon ex situ pyrolytic treatment and relocation of the regenerated adsorbent the second conventional regeneration process is the application of organic solvents to desorb pfas from spent gac up to now limited number of studies pointed out the solvent base regeneration of spent carbon including gac siriwardena et al 2021 powder activated carbon pac punyapalakul et al 2013 bamboo derived activated carbon bdac du et al 2015 and reactivated coconut shell based gac r cac du et al 2016 for chemical solvent regeneration as presented in table 2 organic solvents methanol ethanol isopropyl alcohol have been more preferred to use for the regeneration of pfas spent ac punyapalakul et al 2013 du et al 2015 2016 deng et al 2015 chen et al 2017 siriwardena et al 2021 the chemical regeneration method includes mixtures of salt organic and or base solvents for obtaining a range of ionic strengths and then eluting the pfas molecules from the spent carbon however due to the lower solubility of pfas in higher ionic strength background nacl based regenerant solutions were not effective for the regeneration of pfas laden carbon conte et al 2015 deng et al 2015 carter and farrell 2008 with adding an organic solvent to the salt solution the regeneration efficiency drastically increased up to 98 by weakening the hydrophobic interactions between pfas and spent carbon zaggia et al 2016 deng et al 2010 2015 since each of these studies was conducted at the bench scale the flow through system would be needed to be envisioning the gac solvent regeneration at larger scale by mimicking the field applications conditions both regeneration techniques thermal and chemical are highly dependent on several site specific factors e g regenerate salt type gac and pfas properties background water chemistries etc however it should be noted that the regenerant brine solution from gac may contain high concentration of pfas solvents salts and residual organics that will still require proper disposal sustainability and environmental friendliness of this regeneration method might be questioned therefore a novel in situ regeneration destruction technique is needed for carbon based adsorbents to date electrochemically driven technologies on site pilot scale or lab scale have been only used for defluorination demineralization of emerging contaminants such as pfas in the concentrated waste streams niu et al 2012 le et al 2019 schaefer et al 2019 2020 uwayezu et al 2021 liang et al 2022 nienhauser et al 2022 these novel studies have pointed out that mineralization of pfas in brine solution can occur on sno2 and pbo2 mixed metal oxide lin et al 2012 2013 boron doped diamond bdd carter et al 2008 liao et al 2009 and magneli phase titanium suboxide ceramic le et al 2019 wang et al 2020 anodes these promising features of electrochemical technologies can provide luxury for simultaneous electro regeneration and destruction of pfas from the spent carbon the current literature demonstrates that electro regeneration is an effective and cost effective method for the regeneration of organic contaminants i e phenol and dyes laden gac however the development and application of this regeneration technique has progressed slowly for highly hydrophobic hydrophilic complex aliphatic and aromatic contaminants the present critical review on in situ electro regeneration of contaminant laden adsorbents suggests that the electro regeneration of short long chain pfas laden carbons under realistic treatment conditions i e initial concentration of contaminants ph organic matter and presence of ionized species is strongly advised for investigation more specifically the chain length c4 c8 and terminal functional groups carboxylic vs sulfonic head groups of pfas and the pore size distribution highly micropores vs mesopores carbon conductivity metal doped vs virgin carbon surface area and the chemical characteristics of carbon should be evaluated for the electro regeneration efficiency of pfas laden gacs additionally electro regeneration efficiency must be also evaluated under different water sources such as groundwater semiconductor fabrication wastewater high aromatic and dark colored natural organic matter sources described as a high suva254 uv254 doc water and or low aromatic and pale colored low suva254 water sources besides an advanced characterization of gac before and after electro regeneration should be investigated to better understand change in physicochemical properties moreover electro regeneration parameters should be explored to identify best suitable anode and electrolyte types and operational parameters current density levels and flow rate of column tests and reactor configuration for organic contaminant laden adsorbent regeneration on the other side the impact of ph and ionic strength should be investigated for the electro regeneration process under varying ph and ionic strength conditions lastly techno economic analysis tea model

15022,adsorptive separation technologies have proven to be effective on organic contaminant removal in aqueous water however the breakthrough of contaminants is inevitable and can be at relatively low bed volumes which makes the regeneration of spent adsorbents an urgent need electrochemically induced regeneration processes are given special attention and may provide ease of operation through in situ regeneration avoiding i removal and transport adsorbents and ii avoiding use of hazardous chemicals i e organic solvents acids or bases therefore this review article critically evaluates the fundamental aspects of in situ electro regeneration for spent carbons and later discusses specific examples related to the treatment of emerging contaminants such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances or pfas the fundamental concepts of electrochemically driven processes are comprehensively defined and addressed in terms of i adsorbent characteristics ii contaminant properties iii adsorption regeneration driving operational parameters and conditions and iv the competitive effects of water matrices additionally future research needs and challenges to enhance understanding of in situ electro regeneration applications for organic contaminants specifically pfas laden adsorbents are identified and outlined as a future key perspective keywords electrochemical water treatment granular activated carbon gac per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas spent carbon water treatment process intensification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mitigation of emerging organic contaminants i e phenolic compounds pesticides per and polyfluoroalkyl substances or pfas in aquatic systems has gained increasing interest in the scientific and regulatory community technologies to ensure desirable complete demineralization of contaminants using destructive approaches are still in early stage technology such as plasma isowamwen et al 2022 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes or photon driven processes tow et al 2021 nienhauser et al 2022 several remediation studies have highlighted that physicochemical separation technologies based on adsorption and ionic exchange resins are the most prominent solutions for water treatment processes to remove organic contaminants from water sources the implementation of adsorption has been preferred as one of the cost effective solutions chosen by practitioners deng et al 2015 du et al 2014 zhi and liu 2016 liang et al 2018 soriano et al 2017 2019 however the main concerns inherent with organic contaminant removal through these non destructive separation techniques i e adsorption ion exchange reverse osmosis nanofiltration or foam fractionation are the disposal of organic contaminant laden activated carbon or non regenerable ion exchange resin membrane adsorbents upon reaching to exhaustion zaggia et al 2016 gagliano et al 2020 on the other side the existing technologies such as regenerable ion exchange resin nanofiltration or reverse osmosis have been applied to separate contaminants from the water to a concentrated brine waste stream and then a destruction demineralization technology is used to destroy the contaminants in the concentrated waste stream on site liang et al 2022 the rapid increase in concentration of organic contaminants in the environment is a disconcerting fact which resulted in inappropriate disposal of spent sorbents in landfills or incineration that may backtrack the contaminants in a pervasive cycle back into the water sources therefore the disposal of organic contaminant laden adsorbents is a major challenge and development of novel regeneration techniques are needed to make adsorptive technologies more sustainable regeneration of organic contaminants laden adsorbents arise as an engineered solution by i extending the operational life of adsorbents and ii providing opportunities to preconcentrate emerging contaminants such as pfas into brines that can be treated by destructive technologies the separation and preconcentration in high salinity background will have positive incidence by increasing the energy efficiency of destructive technologies such as electrochemical oxidation or plasma treatments so far among all the common regeneration techniques i e thermal solvent and microwave for spent carbon media as described in the current literature and practices in the wastewater industry in situ electrochemical regeneration can be a cost effective method that benefits from i minimal adsorbent loss 2 loss in adsorptive capacity per cycle garcia rodriguez et al 2020 ii chemical free operation and iii ease of application in small and medium sized water treatment systems mcquillan et al 2018 zhou et al 2022 however many research questions arise from hybrid adsorbent technologies electro desorption may change adsorbent surface chemistry induced by polarization or faradaic reactions during electro driven desorption processes the pore structure can be altered in which the microporous regions of carbon can be converted into mesoporous regions and thus surface area decreased mcquillan et al 2018 garcia rodriguez et al 2020 the main goal of this comprehensive review is to summarize discuss up to date current literature knowledge on in situ electro regeneration of carbon based adsorbents such as granulated activated carbon gac this review specifically aims to i critically review the current electro regeneration techniques for spent gac ii discuss the role of selected carbon properties contaminant structures operational conditions and background water matrices on the electro regeneration efficiency and iii identify the current gaps of knowledge and provide future research priorities and engineering applications for emerging contaminants such as pfas 2 in situ electrification of spent carbon regeneration in situ electrochemical regeneration technology can be classified into cathodic anodic and combined cathodic anodic regenerations in the current literature garcia rodriguez et al 2020 the adsorbent regeneration efficiency re depends on different parameters such as current density electrolyte type and concentration electrode material and reactor configuration mcquillan et al 2018 zhou et al 2022 however the lack of studies that investigated the application of electro regeneration for emerging contaminants laden carbon adsorbents point an important research gap to be covered limited number of carbonaceous adsorbents have been used as a cathode in the electrochemical regeneration process santos et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 when the cathodic current is applied to the saturated carbon polarized carbon can act as a microelectrode and enhance the degradation of adsorbed contaminants patterson et al 2019 trellu et al 2018 primental et al 2008 due to their conductive and chemically resistant features these carbon based adsorbents can contribute to the increased mass transfer coefficient and reduce the energy consumption wei et al 2010 poza nogveiras et al 2021 2022 a proposed mechanisms for electro regeneration of organic contaminant laden adsorbents in the batch systems are illustrated in fig 1 the electro regeneration of contaminant laden adsorbents may occur in three steps in the first step the local ph of the cathode surface can increase due to the hydrogen evolution reaction yielding oh ions on the cathode according to a reaction shown in eq 1 note that adsorbent surface can become highly negatively charged due to cathodic polarization and then can repel the negatively charged groups of the organic contaminant step ii depending on the functional groups in the organic contaminant structure anionic species of organic contaminants in the aqueous water and therefore cathodic regeneration of organic contaminants laden adsorbent may occur at good efficiency driven by the strong electrostatic repulsions between the cathodically charged adsorbent surface and organic contaminants after being desorbed from the adsorbent mineralization or degradation of contaminants may occur on the anode surface step iii along with oxygen evolution reaction on the anode according to reaction eq 2 briefly repeating the unzipping mineralization or degradation cycles contaminants can be mineralized or degraded to final products such methane h2o and co2 garcia rodriguez et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 nienhauser et al 2022 1 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 g 2 o h 2 2 h 2 o o 2 g 4 h 4 e to become more sustainable and beneficial from techno economic points of view electrochemical regeneration of adsorbents may appear as a promising emerging approach to overcome these limitations garcia rodriguez et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 recently a substantial number of studies have been focused on the electrochemical regeneration of organic contaminants mostly phenol laden active carbon ac and gac table 1 briefly carbon was previously saturated with organic contaminants i e phenol toluene p nitrophenol natural organic matter etc or dyes the performance of an electrochemical process for the spent carbon regeneration was evaluated using several types of electrodes such as platinum graphite rod stemless steel titanium etc and three different reactor configurations were tested such as fluidized bed packed bed with a divided cell and packed bed with an undivided cell in the current literature researchers have mainly evaluated the effects of four operational parameters including current density initial ph reaction time and electrolyte types the current literature studies were reported that according on the varying current density and other operational conditions the electro regeneration efficiencies of up to 90 100 were achieved table 1 according to the re and factor of electron utilization efficiency eur values in table 1 eur values declined with decreasing contact time and current for achieving higher regeneration performance and energy cost effectiveness therefore the in situ electrification approach for spent carbons can be a promising technology in the near future due to its advantageous aspects such as small footprint zero waste and cost effectiveness 3 understanding the role of operational conditions during in situ electro regeneration fig 2 summarizes the most relevant factors that can impact the efficiency of regeneration and the regeneration mechanisms of organic contaminants laden adsorbents however it is important to remark that so far the mechanistic understanding of the relationships between molecular structures of contaminants and their precursors and adsorbents have not been fully explored these different relevant aspects that may rule in situ electro regeneration are thoroughly discussed below 3 1 impact of adsorbent characteristics electro regeneration of spent carbon has been previously proven in a single reactor alternating between adsorption and regeneration cycles it can be conducted in situ at ambient pressure and temperature and do not cause any changes on the carbon mass suggesting gac reuse after several cycles of adsorption and regeneration cycle is possible garcia rodriguez et al 2020 electrical conductivity of gac is the touchstone of electro regeneration process lower potential can be required for the desorption of contaminants if the electrode was more conductive park et al 2007 maarof et al 2017 carbonaceous cathode materials have been identified as suitable electrocatalyst that promote selective oxygen reduction to h2o2 poza nogveiras et al 2021 2022 in situ electrogeneration of h2o2 may benefit post degradation by enacting different aops e g fenton h2o2 uv etc bouzayani et al 2017 garcia espinazo et al 2021 2022 castillo monray et al 2020 electrogeneration of h2o2 depends on dissolved oxygen availability in solution and the electrode potential reached that should be equal or higher than the thermodynamic potential required for the bielectronic reduction of oxygen herein it is important to remark that in some instances the electrode potential reached may not suffice the requirements to effectively produce h2o2 note that the main focus of electro regeneration is to modify the surface charge of the carbon adsorbent by inducing cathodic polarization thus faradaic processes may not occur simultaneously depending on the operational conditions independently of the operational conditions the electro regeneration efficiency of gac might be conditioned not only due to the changes in conductivity but also by physicochemical characteristics of gac pore size distribution surface area and surface chemistry of carbon among all physicochemical characteristics pore size distribution and surface area are the two most important parameters of gacs that control adsorption desorption processes acuña bedoya et al 2020 pore size distribution determines the fraction of total pore volume that can be accessed by organic contaminants during the adsorption process micropore filing is the main mechanism in porous carbons for low molecular weight contaminants berenguer et al 2010 ersan et al 2019 after electro regeneration at high current densities the surface area of gac can decrease due to the collapse of pores on the micropore regions sometimes the loss of micropores can be compensated by an increase in mesopore regions that allow maintaining a constant adsorption electro regeneration efficiency over several consecutive cycles xiao and hill 2017 2019 acuña bedoya et al 2020 so far limited number of studies which has been focusing on the cathodic and anodic regeneration efficiency of contaminant laden gac emphasized that the regeneration efficiency of cathodic surface is about 5 10 higher than anodic regeneration the higher performance under cathodic regime might be explained by the higher amount of oxygen functional groups attached on the gac surface that become negatively charged during cathodic regeneration favoring electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged contaminants narbaitz and cen 1994 berenguer et al 2009 furthermore anodic polarization of carbons may severely damage the adsorbent structure and diminish operational life surface chemistry characteristics of gac can also alter the electro regeneration efficiency since cathodic regeneration can cause deprotonation of oxygen containing functional groups increases negative charge density at the carbon interface which is favorable case for the desorption of organic contaminants the adsorbed contaminants can be released from the gac surface or may be exchanged with inorganic ions in water zaggia et al 2016 it should be also noted that factors such as gac contaminant ratio competition with existing ionic species pore size distribution of carbon carbon type and the existing functional groups are expected to impact the regeneration efficiency of organic contaminant laden carbon zhou et al 2022 garcia rodriguez et al 2020 consequently further investigations must be held in order to better understand the impact of sorbent characteristics and types on the electro regeneration application 3 2 impact of organic contaminant properties organic contaminant properties including geometrical configurations i e carbon chain length and ring structure functional groups of contaminants hydrophobicity and molecular size are important factors controlling the adsorption mechanism the geometrical configurations of organic contaminant showed a significant impact on their interaction with gac because of high surface area and interstitial channel of their surface the planar versus nonplanar molecular structure of organic contaminants may also affect their desorption behavior van noort et al 2009 for example a larger external surface and higher meso macropore regions may provide less favorable desorption to planar molecules than non planar molecules based on the strong pi pi interactions according to table 1 no studies have examined and reported the impact of molecular configuration and chain length on the electro desorption of organic contaminants from carbon in addition based on their terminal functional groups the organic contaminants with a higher hydrophobic property can be preferentially adsorbed on the adsorbent surface due to the strong hydrophobic interactions ersan et al 2017 thus based on the structural properties of contaminants and surface interactions with carbon surface it is expected that during electro regeneration process more hydrophobic contaminants might be first desorbed from the negatively charged gacs surface as compared to less hydrophobic or hydrophilic short chain contaminants further research is warranted to confirm the findings to include more hydrophobic i e polycyclic aromatics hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls etc hydrophilic i e pesticides antibiotics etc complex aliphatic i e pfas trichloroethylene etc and aromatic i e phenanthrene tetracycline etc contaminants other organic contaminant properties i e pka sorbent water partition coefficients and molecular diffusivity in water and sorbent media can also play a role in electro regeneration efficiency of gac more specifically some of the organic contaminants such as pfas exhibit mutually hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties hydrophobic properties are primarily attributed to the low polarizability of fluorine atoms in other words can be attributed to strong c f bonds and long fluorocarbon chains water solubility decreases with increasing carbon chain length gagliano et al 2020 and thus pfas become more lipophilic as indicated by octanol water partition coefficients kow the attachment of terminal functional group to fluoroalkyl chain makes pfas molecule more soluble in the aqueous water i e hydrophilic at environmentally relevant ph 7 7 5 pfas compounds exhibit anionic properties according to their low acid dissociation constant pka values thus pfas hydrophilic head is negatively charged making them behave as surfactants as surfactant pfas have both hydrophobic and lipophobic regions two main driving forces hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions can be volunteered for the electro regeneration of pfas specifically long chained laden gac for example according to the pka values of pfos 3 27 and pfoa 0 3 8 under relevant ph conditions they are fully soluble in the water and thus electrostatic repulsion may occur between the anionic head group of pfas and negatively charged surface group of gacs xiao et al 2017 overall further investigations are still needed to validate these hypothesizes to better understand the impact of different characteristics of organic contaminants specifically mutually hydrophobic and hydrophilic complex molecules on electro regeneration process 3 3 impact of operational parameters oxidation of contaminants require high overpotentials for oxygen evolution to form radical species as redox mediators these electrocatalytic conditions cannot be attained by carbons submitted to anodic polarization cerron calle et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 garcia segura et al 2020a b most organic contaminants can be degraded under anodic potentials way below the potentials required to mineralize for desorption of organic contaminant laden carbon it is important to note that oxidation process on the carbon surface is not favorable due to the high oxidation potential of organic contaminants however cathodic regeneration can be possible for absorbent regeneration which can desorb contaminants from the carbon surface and produce organic contaminant laden brine solutions to be treated on the anode side in this sense the regeneration efficiency of electro regeneration processes depends on multiple factors including current density electrolyte type and concentration electrode material adsorbent properties and reactor configuration following subsections will further discuss each of these factors 3 3 1 current density the effect of current density on electro regeneration efficiency has been evaluated for different organic contaminants laden adsorbents specifically ac recently zhou et al 2019 evaluated the electro regeneration efficiency of phenol laden ac at different currents after 5 h of treatment regeneration efficiencies of 72 76 78 and 86 were reached at 15 30 50 and 80 ma respectively besides zhou et al 2006 evaluated different parameters for electrochemical regeneration of ac in a fluidized bed reactor after p nitrophenol adsorption with using current densities of 2 4 6 8 and 12 ma cm 2 the regeneration efficiency reached 69 81 86 90 and 92 respectively after 1 5 h of treatment at room temperature ph 3 and nacl 5 g l as support electrolyte table 1 the impact of current density should be also related to changes of the local ph and electrolyte type due to water splitting and the negative charge accumulated on the cathode surface zanella et al 2016 the release of contaminants can be expected without carbon losses generated by hydrogenation cracking 3 3 2 electrolyte and anode material electrolyte selection is an important component for in situ electro regeneration due to their role in electrical conductivity and the role of additional electrochemical reactions to date the most used electrolyte is sodium chloride nacl in a concentration range of 0 1 to 1 0 w w narbaitz and chen 1994 mostafa et al 2018 garcia segura et al 2020a cerron calle et al 2022 nacl electrolyte is electroactive and may generate active chlorine species depending on the anode material such as chlorine hclo clo equations 3 6 or chlorine radical cl by eq 7 zhou and lei 2006 mostafa et al 2018 zhou et al 2022 3 c l c l ads e 4 c l ads c l c l 2 e 5 c l 2 h 2 o hocl h c l 6 hocl h oc l 7 c l o h c l o h inert electrolytes such as na2so4 nahco3 and naclo4 were evaluated presenting lower regeneration efficiency for selected organic pollutants i e phenol toluene zhang 2002 the higher regeneration in chloride media can be explained by the positive impact on regeneration of coexisting oxidation events facilitated by active chlorine species as mentioned before at higher ionic strength solubility of organic contaminants decreases and may inhibit gac regeneration thus the investigation of varying electrolytes at different concentrations are required to identify unexpected adsorption desorption characteristic of organic contaminants low concentration of na2so4 enough to reduce the solution resistivity may be an alternative to avoid secondary reactions or avoid generating undesired products i e chlorinated by products electro regeneration of organic contaminant laden adsorbents should be considered as a new framework to evaluate different electrolyte parameters such as ph concentration and different matrixes anode material is an important part of the system configuration despite not being directly involved the selection of suitable anodic materials may enable electrochemical degradation of released contaminants during electro regeneration electrodes with higher overpotential for water oxidation i e boron doped diamond bdd and dimensionally stable anode dsa can generate reactive species depending on the ph and the potential reached acuña bedoya et al 2020 however if the interest relies simply on the carbon regeneration and collection of brine inexpensive anodes can be selected to simply close the electrical circuit it is not necessary to use an expensive or special electrodes to desorb the adsorbate the use of platinum or titanium oxide exemplify alternatives for regeneration systems that do not require oxidation reactions to mineralize the contaminants 3 3 3 reactor design reactor configuration is another important consideration depending on the practical application of the electro regeneration process the electro regeneration of spent carbon changes the intraparticle properties of the spent carbon i e pore regions and specific surface area and thus the intraparticle mass transport rates of all organic contaminants are expected to change this challenge will affect the mass transfer zone for each contaminant in a gac packed bed reactor configuration and affect the design and operation criteria of the gac packed bed reactor fig 3 a to ensure the optimum removal of organic contaminants crittenden et al 2005 for anodic electro regeneration the carbonaceous adsorbents must reach the specific potential to produce direct or indirect oxidation process however cathodic electro regeneration just requires enough superficial charge to release the contaminant garcia oton et al 2005 zhou et al 2022 among all reactor configurations fixed bed fluidized bed undivided and divided reactors are the most commonly used in the current literature for electro regeneration process fixed bed reactor as depicted in fig 3 a fixed bed reactor uses a gac fixed in the bottom in contact with the cathode and the anode this configuration is the simplest arrangement that can control the current density efficiency and scaling up conditions nonetheless short circuiting and low mass transport are the main drawbacks of this configuration weng and hsu 2008 fluidized bed reactor fluidized bed configuration as shown in fig 3b uses electrolyte or a fluid to enhance the mass transfer however the turbulence created decrease the current efficiency since ohmic resistance increases in general this configuration presents higher regeneration efficiency than fixed bed reactor but involves a higher energy consumption liu et al 2022 undivided reactor as presented in fig 3c undivided configuration in difference with fixed bed reactor the adsorbent material is in contact just with one electrode i e cathode or anode in this configuration both electrodes are in the same chamber meanwhile the selected electrode with gac can regenerate the other electrode still being part of the overall electrochemical reactions as mentioned supporting electrolyte can react in the electrode without the adsorbent generating other species or intermediates can be oxidized or reduced in the same chamber weng et al 2008 divided reactor in contrast with undivided reactor divided reactor uses a membrane to separate the electrodes in the solution as shown in fig 3d in this configuration the counter electrode is isolated from the adsorption compartment without any possible interference in the overall process the membrane used allow the migration of ions to close the circuit weng et al 2008 since the oxidation of organic contaminants is unlikely for cathodic electro regeneration of contaminant laden gac the electro regeneration can be accomplished using all these reactor configurations thus regeneration efficiency of gac can warrant to evaluate for different reactor configurations with varying all these parameters in the near future 3 3 4 energy consumption for a recirculation mode under constant current of electro regeneration process the electrical energy consumption ec kwh g is an appropriate technique for evaluating their operational costs garcia rodriguez et al 2020 the required electrical energy used to decrease the concentration of organic contaminant in solution is calculated using ec values for flow through operation eq 8 8 ec e cell i t 1000 a c mass where ecell kw is the potential differences through the electro regeneration system v i is the applied current a t is the contact time h and acmass is the mass of activated carbon in the reactor g and 1000 is the conversion factor the ec can be used to examine impact of varying operational conditions that may affect the regeneration time such as applied current amount of spent carbon in the fixed bed column and the number of adsorption regeneration cycles additionally to calculate the current efficiency for electro regeneration of the spent carbon the eur values have been calculated which represents how many grams of carbon could be regenerated with charged one mole electron used zhou and lei 2006 the higher cost effectiveness of the electro regeneration process is defined by the higher eur value eur is defined as in eq 9 9 e u r m f i t where m is the mass of the regenerated carbon g f is the faraday constant 96 486 c mol 1 i is the current ma and t is the regeneration times h when comparing the energy consumption of current regeneration techniques at the industrial scale the thermal regeneration technique is suffering from high energy cost due to the elevated temperatures up to 1000 c as well as decomposition and loss of spent carbon watanabe et al 2016 2018 xiao et al 2020 the chemical methods i e solvent extraction and wet oxidation are also costly and result in lower adsorption capacities because of residual solvent and catalyst in the adsorbents another alternative regeneration strategy is microwave regeneration which is also costly at 900 kwh kg pan et al 2016 recently only one study has demonstrated the in situ regeneration of ac with an innovative electro fenton reactor design which achieved high efficiency and low energy consumption for phenol laden carbon garcia rodriguez et al 2020 almost 97 phenol removal with energy consumption below 1 kwh kg of ac under optimal conditions was reported in another electro regeneration study zhou and lei 2006 found 90 p nitrophenol desorbed from gac for 1 5 h contact time and the energy consumption per unit kilogram of gac treated was 2 8 kwh kg based on the relationship between electro regeneration efficiency and the energy cost weng and hsu 2008 reported that the energy requirement per unit mass of gac treated range from 5 5 to 1362 7 kwh ton equivalent to the energy cost ranging from 0 3 to 81 8 usd ton based on the current electricity rate in the applied country herein compared with other regeneration techniques the advantages of the electro regeneration process are also included environmental compatibility reusability energy efficiency and low cost therefore electro regeneration is a promising alternative technology to thermal and solvent regeneration techniques for full scale applications in terms of energy requirements for effective regeneration of the spent adsorbents 3 4 impact of background water matrices regeneration efficiency is mainly impacted by gac types and organic contaminant planar vs nonplanar long vs short chain functional group properties and operational conditions but it is also impacted by background water matrix parameters such as the presence of organic matter ph and ionized species 3 4 1 organic matter organic matter is ubiquitous in natural water systems and it can be originated from different organics such as natural nom algal impacted aom and effluent organic matter efom the interactions between organic matter and gac are inevitable and organic matter may change their adsorption desorption efficiency ersan et al 2016 two possible mechanisms play key roles in adsorption desorption processes in the presence of organic matter i loading efficiency of contaminants on gac can decrease because of the site competitions or pore blockage and ii nom molecules can easily oxidize during in situ electro regeneration and thus nom and organic contaminant competition can reduce with increasing regeneration cycles several studies have examined the impact of nom or dissolved organic carbon doc on mitigation of organic contaminant on gac appleman et al 2013 kothawala et al 2017 dixit et al 2020 moral et al 2020 and exhibited that organic matter was not altered sgroi et al 2018 or accelerated the pfas uptake mccleaf et al 2017 therefore we assume that the impact of nom on the adsorption desorption of organic contaminants on gac is highly depended on nom characteristics e g aromaticity molecular weight and size etc adsorbent characteristics and organic contaminant properties this warrants the investigation of electro regeneration efficiency of organic contaminant laden gacs in the presence of organic matter 3 4 2 ph another important factor that can impact the electro regeneration of organic laden adsorbents is the ph of the system based on the ph of the regenerant system the organic contaminants may hold cationic anionic and or zwitterionic functional groups therefore when ph pka and phpzc point of zero charge of the organic contaminants and adsorbents the desorption efficiency may increase due to amplified electrostatic repulsion between ionized organic contaminant and adsorbent surface acuña bedoya et al 2020 the acidic conditions may decrease the contaminant s solubility and neutralize the functional groups on the adsorbent surface e g carboxylic acids once gacs are placed in an electrolytic solution their surface become charged depending on the phpzc of the adsorbent at ph values above the phpzc of adsorbent the net charge on the gac surface is negative because of the deprotonation of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups ersan and ersan 2021 bernal et al 2020 as a result the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged organic contaminant and adsorbent surface become more favorable in contrast when ph phpzc of the adsorbent the net charge on the gac surface becomes positive and electrostatic interaction between contaminants and adsorbent surfaces increases ersan et al 2017 therefore the electro regeneration efficiency of saturated adsorbents is better at high ph levels higher than their phpzc due to increased electrostatic repulsion between anionic functional group of organic contaminants and adsorbent surface 4 current knowledge on regeneration techniques for pfas laden carbon current research is focused on development and demonstration of an effective pfas laden carbon regeneration technology using thermal and chemical regeneration techniques schultz et al 2003 reported that incineration of saturated carbon for 2 s under a combustion chamber reaching temperatures of 1200 c was adequate for pfas destruction and the exhaust gas could be scrubbed to produce a solid caf2 precipitate takemine et al 2013 also observed 90 demineralization of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa using airstream at 700 c more recently other studies have pointed out that thermal regeneration of spent gac can successfully decompose long chain i e pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and short chain pfas i e perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs perfluoro pentanoic acid pfpea perfluorobutanoic acid pfba perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa buck et al 2011 takemine et al 2013 watanabe et al 2016 2018 xiao et al 2020 le et al 2013 rayne and forest 2009 the main limitation of thermal regeneration techniques is that decomposition or demineralization of pfas mostly depend on their functional groups carboxylic versus sulfonic groups as presented in fig 4 the decomposition of short and long chain pfca and pfsa has been reported to be much higher than genx at varying temperature ranges baghirzade et al 2021 winchell et al 2021 among all pfas chemicals pfsa compounds are more recalcitrant at high temperature 250 c xiao et al 2020 therefore thermal regeneration 1000 c is highly impacted by functional groups and carbon chain of pfas le et al 2013 so far the researchers have been only focused on the decomposition mechanisms of spent carbon during thermal reactivation to thoroughly address the impacts of regeneration on the regeneration cycle s efficiency of spent carbon further analysis of the adsorption capacity of pfas on regenerated adsorbents needs to be conducted besides thermal regeneration method involves destruction of carbon micro structure loss of surface area and high energy consumption and produce of co2 h2o hf and sulfur compounds baghirzade et al 2021 winchell et al 2021 wang et al 2020 these undesired side effects of thermal treatment may compromise the competitiveness of regenerated adsorbents one of the major barriers of regenerative incineration is that the process should be conducted off the adsorption packed bed reactors which imply for labor intensive removal of spent carbon ex situ pyrolytic treatment and relocation of the regenerated adsorbent the second conventional regeneration process is the application of organic solvents to desorb pfas from spent gac up to now limited number of studies pointed out the solvent base regeneration of spent carbon including gac siriwardena et al 2021 powder activated carbon pac punyapalakul et al 2013 bamboo derived activated carbon bdac du et al 2015 and reactivated coconut shell based gac r cac du et al 2016 for chemical solvent regeneration as presented in table 2 organic solvents methanol ethanol isopropyl alcohol have been more preferred to use for the regeneration of pfas spent ac punyapalakul et al 2013 du et al 2015 2016 deng et al 2015 chen et al 2017 siriwardena et al 2021 the chemical regeneration method includes mixtures of salt organic and or base solvents for obtaining a range of ionic strengths and then eluting the pfas molecules from the spent carbon however due to the lower solubility of pfas in higher ionic strength background nacl based regenerant solutions were not effective for the regeneration of pfas laden carbon conte et al 2015 deng et al 2015 carter and farrell 2008 with adding an organic solvent to the salt solution the regeneration efficiency drastically increased up to 98 by weakening the hydrophobic interactions between pfas and spent carbon zaggia et al 2016 deng et al 2010 2015 since each of these studies was conducted at the bench scale the flow through system would be needed to be envisioning the gac solvent regeneration at larger scale by mimicking the field applications conditions both regeneration techniques thermal and chemical are highly dependent on several site specific factors e g regenerate salt type gac and pfas properties background water chemistries etc however it should be noted that the regenerant brine solution from gac may contain high concentration of pfas solvents salts and residual organics that will still require proper disposal sustainability and environmental friendliness of this regeneration method might be questioned therefore a novel in situ regeneration destruction technique is needed for carbon based adsorbents to date electrochemically driven technologies on site pilot scale or lab scale have been only used for defluorination demineralization of emerging contaminants such as pfas in the concentrated waste streams niu et al 2012 le et al 2019 schaefer et al 2019 2020 uwayezu et al 2021 liang et al 2022 nienhauser et al 2022 these novel studies have pointed out that mineralization of pfas in brine solution can occur on sno2 and pbo2 mixed metal oxide lin et al 2012 2013 boron doped diamond bdd carter et al 2008 liao et al 2009 and magneli phase titanium suboxide ceramic le et al 2019 wang et al 2020 anodes these promising features of electrochemical technologies can provide luxury for simultaneous electro regeneration and destruction of pfas from the spent carbon the current literature demonstrates that electro regeneration is an effective and cost effective method for the regeneration of organic contaminants i e phenol and dyes laden gac however the development and application of this regeneration technique has progressed slowly for highly hydrophobic hydrophilic complex aliphatic and aromatic contaminants the present critical review on in situ electro regeneration of contaminant laden adsorbents suggests that the electro regeneration of short long chain pfas laden carbons under realistic treatment conditions i e initial concentration of contaminants ph organic matter and presence of ionized species is strongly advised for investigation more specifically the chain length c4 c8 and terminal functional groups carboxylic vs sulfonic head groups of pfas and the pore size distribution highly micropores vs mesopores carbon conductivity metal doped vs virgin carbon surface area and the chemical characteristics of carbon should be evaluated for the electro regeneration efficiency of pfas laden gacs additionally electro regeneration efficiency must be also evaluated under different water sources such as groundwater semiconductor fabrication wastewater high aromatic and dark colored natural organic matter sources described as a high suva254 uv254 doc water and or low aromatic and pale colored low suva254 water sources besides an advanced characterization of gac before and after electro regeneration should be investigated to better understand change in physicochemical properties moreover electro regeneration parameters should be explored to identify best suitable anode and electrolyte types and operational parameters current density levels and flow rate of column tests and reactor configuration for organic contaminant laden adsorbent regeneration on the other side the impact of ph and ionic strength should be investigated for the electro regeneration process under varying ph and ionic strength conditions lastly techno economic analysis tea model

15023,this review compiles information on sidestream characteristics that result from anaerobic digestion dewatering conventional and preceded by a thermal hydrolysis process biological and primary sludge thickening the objective is to define a range of concentrations for the different characteristics found in literature and to confront them with the optimal operating conditions of sidestream processes for nutrient treatment or recovery each characteristic of sidestream tss vss cod n p al3 ca2 cl fe2 3 mg2 k na so4 2 heavy metals micro pollutants and pathogens is discussed according to the water resource recovery facility configuration wastewater characteristics and implications for the recovery of nitrogen and phosphorus based on current published knowledge on the processes implemented at full scale the thorough analysis of sidestream characteristics shows that anaerobic digestion sidestreams have the highest ammonium content compared to biological and primary sludge sidestreams phosphate content in anaerobic digestion sidestreams depends on the type of applied phosphorus treatment but is also highly dependent on precipitation reactions within the digester thermal hydrolysis process thp mainly impacts cod n and alkalinity content in anaerobic digestion sidestreams surprisingly the concentration of phosphate is not higher compared to conventional anaerobic digestion thus offering more attractive recovery possibilities upstream of the digester rather than in sidestreams all sidestream processes investigated in the present study struvite partial nitrification anammox ammonia stripping membranes bioelectrochemical system electrodialysis ion exchange system and algae production suffer from residual tss in sidestreams above a certain threshold residual cod and ions can also deteriorate the performance of the process or the purity of the final nutrient based product this article also provides a list of characteristics to measure to help in the choice of a specific process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reject water nutrient recovery anaerobic digestion wastewater thermal hydrolysis process data availability data have been shared in the repository datagouv https doi org 10 57745 fohrhy 1 introduction wastewater characteristics have been studied for decades because they are key to design and optimise the operation of wastewater treatment processes the usual characteristics of urban wastewater including total solids organic matter total nitrogen total phosphorous and organic matter biodegradability from different countries is well documented especially in view of process modelling rieger et al 2012 and experimental methods to characterise the composition of wastewater have been established and benchmarked gillot and choubert 2010 van loosdrecht et al 2016 at the same time there is a growing interest in the characterisation of both the solid and the liquid phase of sewage sludge this interest is primarily motivated by the need to reduce sludge volumes and associated sludge management costs zhen et al 2017 as well as to maximise their reuse as fertiliser kacprzak et al 2017 one of the current concerns is the concentration of heavy metals and emerging contaminants when sludge disposal route is land application appels et al 2010 steele et al 2022 as part of sewage sludge management in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs sludge thickening and dewatering units result in the production of different types of sidestreams also called reject water centrate supernatant or filtrate recycled into the main wastewater treatment line the major concern about these streams arose with the overall tightening of wrrfs effluent standards preisner et al 2020 and the development of anaerobic digestion ad that generates a nutrient rich supernatant gourdet et al 2017 in the context of a wastewater identified as a resource rather than a waste stream ad has proved to be an essential technology as it reduces sludge volume stabilises sludge and more importantly recovers energy as methane appels et al 2011 sidestreams in wrrfs equipped with ad can contain up to 25 of the total nitrogen load and 10 of the total phosphorus load to the facilities couturier et al 2001 grulois et al 1993 this phosphorus load can be even higher up to 30 when enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is implemented in the water line ueno and fujii 2001 also to boost ad and dewatering performance several sludge pre treatments have been developed carrère et al 2010 amongst them the thermal hydrolysis process thp is the most applied technology and existing full scale references have so far reported an enhancement of ad performance after thp pre treatment kor bicakci and eskicioglu 2019 the main drawback of thp is that it generates streams with high concentration of refractory compounds and an increase in sidestream ammonia concentration barber 2016 bougrier et al 2008 dwyer et al 2008b high nutrient content in sidestreams can lead to increased energy consumption and degradation of effluent quality cullen et al 2013 janus and van der roest 1997 especially when the facility operates close to full scale capacity in such conditions sidestream processes are good opportunities for upgrading treatment capacity without needing to expand existing works van loosdrecht and salem 2006 the main biological processes for the treatment of nitrogen in sidestreams includes nitritation denitritation nitrification denitrification partial nitrification anammox bioaugmentation and algae production eskicioglu et al 2018 sidestream processes also offer an excellent opportunity for nutrient recovery essential for sustaining the food production industry currently nitrogen based fertilisers are mainly produced by the energy intensive haber bosch process while rock phosphate is the main raw material in phosphorus based fertilisers nancharaiah et al 2016 shaddel et al 2019 the implementation of these production routes on the long term is questioned because 1 phosphorus depletion is expected by 2100 van vuuren et al 2010 and 2 fertilisers production currently accounts for more than 1 of the world s emissions of greenhouse gases ghg kehrein et al 2020 municipal wastewater is thus an interesting nutrient source as its nitrogen and phosphorus content accounts respectively for 14 and 7 of the global fertiliser demand qadir et al 2020 several reviews present in detail the technologies available for nutrient recovery from wastewater they are mainly based on physical physicochemical and bio electrochemical mechanisms guilayn et al 2020 vaneeckhaute et al 2017 ye et al 2018 struvite precipitation ammonia stripping membrane filtration electrodialysis bio electrochemical system ammonia and phosphate sorption are the most investigated processes performances of such processes depend on sidestream characteristics their efficiency the capacity for nutrient removal the energy and chemical consumption and the quality of recovered products have to be specified the nutrient based products must also comply with the current n p fertiliser characteristics and legislation in addition to complete cod n and p fractionation the detailed ionic strength of sidestreams is necessary to correctly design and model treatment or recovery processes as they are mainly based on physicochemical reactions this information is especially required as input of the new advanced plant wide models that couple biokinetics with physicochemical framework flores alsina et al 2015 kazadi mbamba et al 2015 lizarralde et al 2015 solon et al 2015 vaneeckhaute et al 2018b despite the growing interest in the implementation of sidestream processes a complete characterisation of this stream is relatively scarce and sparse in the literature published data include phosphorus martí et al 2017 nitrogen kassouf et al 2020 cod fractionation noutsopoulos et al 2018 and ionic composition bhuiyan et al 2009 however no synthesis compares sidestream characteristics from different wrrfs considering a large number of components solids concentration cod biodegradability n p ions heavy metals and ionic composition that constitute wastewater metcalf and eddy inc et al 2003 this review article compiles and analyses literature data of sidestream characteristics from different locations in wrrfs the aim is to bring knowledge on sidestream characteristics to assist in selection design and modelling of sidestream processes data are questioned in order to choose the most optimal operating conditions of the main sidestream processes and to identify potential limits of application implications in terms of plant wide modelling are also mentioned in order to improve sidestream description and nutrient recovery options finally the need for data on characterisation of sidestreams are highlighted to support the development of processes that can improve environmental and economic impacts of wrrfs 2 literature data compilation the set of data used in this study results from the compilation of information from 87 documents peer reviewed and grey literature the characteristics found have been classified according to the source of sidestreams biological sludge for sidestreams resulting from the thickening of biological sludge primary sludge for sidestreams resulting from the thickening of primary sludge anaerobic digestion for sidestreams resulting from the dewatering of digested sludge thp anaerobic digestion for sidestreams resulting from the dewatering of digested sludge preceded by a thermal hydrolysis process thp the collection and description of the data can be found in the associated data paper and the dataset is available on the french repository datagouv https doi org 10 57745 fohrhy only papers with clear information on sidestream sources were selected sidestreams from full scale measurements only were included in the dataset all figures presented in this document have been generated with rstudio software version 4 1 2 most of the data is presented in the form of a violin plot overlaid on a boxplot outliers have been detected with the bonferroni test bretz et al 2010 for each boxplot when the p value is below 5 they are indicated in the figures in grey but are not included in the calculation of the median nor in the count of the total number of values the different sources of sidestreams were statistically compared using the kruskal wallis test the pairwise comparison using the wilcoxon test was also used to compare the impact of different wrrf configurations in addition correlations between different parameters were identified using the spearman test 3 sidestream characteristics in the following sidestream characteristics are first described in terms of major pollutants tss cod and nutrients concentrations and mass loads are analysed the ionic composition of sidestreams are then described as well as ph alkalinity and temperature collected data mainly refer to streams from the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge a few data on sidestreams from primary or biological sludge thickening are also presented when available 3 1 major pollutants in sidestreams 3 1 1 concentration of total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss fig 1 presents the tss concentrations in sidestreams from anaerobic digestion preceded or not by a thp tss concentrations are highly variable from one study to another this variability is partly due to the sampling methodology as most of the values have been obtained on grab samples there is no significant difference between both types of sidestreams which means that tss concentration in sidestreams is mainly driven by other factors than the presence of a thp such as the dewatering unit performance interestingly most of the data compiled on anaerobic digestion sidestreams came from centrifuges the centrifuge has a solid capture rate between 95 and 99 depending on sludge conditioning metcalf and eddy inc et al 2003 considering a tss concentration in digested sludge of 25 g l the tss concentration in sidestreams from an anaerobic digester would not exceed 1500 mg l outliers in fig 1 are much higher than this value indicating that the centrifuge may sometimes underperform besides variability of water content and particle size of sludge induced by sludge transport and storage can impact the demand for polymers and therefore the performance of the dewatering unit andreoli et al 2007 henze and comeau 2008 anaerobic digestion sidestream has a median vss to tss ratio of 70 fig 1b a value in the range of 55 75 is expected bowden et al 2015 which corresponds to volatile solids vs range for digested sludge andreoli et al 2007 3 1 2 concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod the concentrations of total cod and soluble cod are significantly different between anaerobic digestion and thp anaerobic digestion sidestreams fig 2 as for tss there is a large variability of cod concentration which is explained by the significant correlation between total cod and tss the difference of total cod concentration between both types of sidestreams is mainly due to the higher soluble cod concentration in thp anaerobic digestion sidestreams induced by a higher solubilisation rate barber 2016 devos et al 2020 part of this additional soluble cod has been reported to be refractory compounds produced through the maillard and amadori reaction that also impacts the effluent cod of the wrrf the amount of refractory compounds produced is dependent on the temperature of thp and becomes significant at a temperature higher than 160 c toutian et al 2020 for six facilities in berlin without sidestream processes and for different thp temperatures the increase in effluent soluble cod was estimated to be in the range of 2 15 mg l toutian et al 2020 another study reported that thp implementation in five facilities led to a 3 8 mg l increase of effluent cod concentration depending on the quantity of primary sludge versus the quantity of biological sludge svennevik et al 2020 the concentration of total cod in biological sludge sidestreams and in the treated water are usually close except in the case of thickening unit malfunction the concentration of cod in primary sludge sidestreams is similar to wastewater and is in the range of 250 800 mg l constantine 2006 however higher values of 823 mg l roldán et al 2020 and up to 4244 mg l have been encountered probably due to sludge loss following a rain event in the gravity thickener noutsopoulos et al 2018 3 1 3 organic matter biodegradability in sidestreams table 1 shows cod biodegradable fractions in sidestreams based on literature review for a given type of sidestreams results show a large variability explained on the one hand by varying methods employed to characterise the biodegradability and on the other hand by differences in operating conditions of ad and thp t c sludge concentration retention time the fractionation of cod into different classes of biodegradability slowly biodegradable rapidly biodegradable inert soluble and particulate is essential for design operation purposes and modelling gillot and choubert 2010 however more data are required to compare the sludge biodegradability after anaerobic digestion and thp anaerobic digestion sidestreams primary sludge thickening sidestreams has a biodegradable fraction similar to wastewater generally between 54 88 gillot and choubert 2010 of total cod the biodegradable fraction of biological sludge thickening sidestreams is similar to the one of treated wastewater which is generally 70 to 80 lower than the untreated wastewater 3 1 4 concentration of nitrogen species for conventional mesophilic anaerobic digesters the resulting ammonium nnh4 concentration in sidestreams typically ranges from 400 mg l to 1 300 mg l metcalf and eddy inc et al 2003 which is in line with present data fig 3 variability of nnh4 can be linked to the quantity of wash water used in the dewatering unit metcalf and eddy inc et al 2003 and to ad operating conditions sludge concentration vs removal nnh4 is significantly higher in anaerobic digestion with thp compared to ad without thp which is explained by the fact that thp favours 1 an increase in the sludge concentration in the digester due to reduced viscosity urrea et al 2015 2 a higher solubilisation rate dwyer et al 2008a wilson and novak 2009 and 3 an increase in biodegradation of organic matter and therefore of proteins content bougrier et al 2008 likewise increased release of ammonium in the digester is expected it was reported that total ammonium release per mass of volatile solids removed is equivalent for conventional mesophilic ad and thp whatever the sludge type wilson et al 2011 soluble nitrogen in ad dewatering sidestreams is mainly in the form of ammonium and soluble organic nitrogen accounts for a maximum of 10 of soluble tkn of this soluble organic nitrogen fraction approximately 50 is considered non biodegradable the soluble organic nitrogen is believed to be produced through cell metabolism and decay of the anaerobic bacteria and waste activated sludge therefore typical digester sidestream will add approximately 0 2 mg l of refractory dissolved organic nitrogen to the wrrf effluent metcalf and eddy inc et al 2003 a recent survey on soluble organic nitrogen content in treated wastewater reported an average final concentration of 0 93 mg l with a range of 0 2 5 mg l galvagno et al 2016 therefore the non biodegradable fraction brought by ad dewatering sidestreams will account for approximatively 25 of final organic nitrogen this quantity can be higher with thp pre treatment ahuja 2015 as expected nnh4 concentration in biological sludge and primary sludge sidestreams is significantly lower compared to anaerobic digestion sidestreams however the formation of anaerobic zones in thickening units such as gravity thickener or dissolved air flotation can lead to sludge hydrolysis thus favouring ions release which can explain outliers of 50 mg l for biological sludge sidestreams and 123 mg l for primary sludge sidestreams not clearly visible in fig 3 due to the scaling 3 1 5 concentration of phosphate phosphate p po4 concentration for different sources of sidestreams is shown in fig 4 the concentration of phosphate in biological sludge and primary sludge sidestreams is significantly lower compared to anaerobic digestion sidestreams outliers in fig 4 with very high concentrations of phosphate up to 180 mg l for biological sludge sidestreams was attributed by barat et al 2009 to the formation of anaerobic zones in the thickener this phenomenon is unlikely to happen in fast thickening processes such as centrifuge rotary drum or belt press wild et al 1997 in addition as thp increases phosphorus solubilisation a higher phosphate content in ad dewatering sidestreams was expected compared to conventional digestion khunjar et al 2019 surprisingly this was not supported by literature data whilst the intracellular phosphorus can be released during thp this phosphorus can be directly immobilised by metallic ions such as mg2 fe2 3 ca2 and al3 han et al 2020 consequently the phosphorus content in the thp return liquor does not differ from the one of conventional ad this result was found without considering the different types of applied phosphorus treatment because more data is needed to complete this comparative analysis to investigate the high phosphate concentration variability in anaerobic digestion sidestreams fig 5 shows phosphate concentration according to the phosphorus treatment type installed in the water line enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr chemical phosphorus removal a combination of both biological and chemical phosphorus removal and no specific phosphorus treatment only wrrfs operated with ebpr lead to higher phosphate in anaerobic digestion sidestreams compared to chemical phosphorus removal and no specific phosphorus treatment the high phosphate concentration range for biological phosphorus removal and the combination of biological with chemical phosphorus removal can be attributed to different level of precipitation inside the anaerobic digester and different iron dosage 3 1 6 contribution to the inlet mass flows the flow of the different sources of sidestreams accounts for less than 5 of the total flow at the wrrf inlet fig 6 mass flow of total cod and tss also represent less than 5 of the total mass flow at wrrf inlet for biological sludge and anaerobic digestion sidestreams primary sludge can excess this 5 threshold especially after a rain event as expected the highest sidestream contribution for total phosphorus and total nitrogen comes from anaerobic digestion sidestreams regarding the nitrogen mass flow sidestreams from anaerobic digestion contribute on average to 17 of the nitrogen mass flow at the wrrf inlet which is much higher than the contribution of biological sludge sidestreams 1 and primary sludge sidestreams 3 8 the variability of the nitrogen mass flow is due to the wide range of nnh4 concentration found in anaerobic digestion sidestreams and the different load of nitrogen at the wrrf inlet phosphorus mass flow depends on the type of phosphorus treatment implemented in the water line similarly to the concentration of phosphate in anaerobic digestion sidestreams 3 1 5 for wrrfs with ebpr anaerobic digestion sidestreams can contribute up to 34 of the total phosphorus mass flow mass flow of total phosphorus from primary sludge sidestreams and biological sludge sidestreams can exceed 5 especially when the thickening unit favours the formation of anaerobic zones gravity thickener dissolved air flotation 3 2 ionic composition of sidestreams fig 7 shows the concentration of different ions in sidestreams from anaerobic digestion the concentration of aluminium al3 and iron ions fe2 3 is very low because these metals precipitate easily with phosphorus or sulphur wilfert et al 2015 only a high salt dosage can lead to residual iron or aluminium in the soluble phase the addition of salts lead to a large variability of chloride cl concentration from one study to another this variability can be explained by different dose of salts or chemicals applied within the wrrf but also during disinfection of potable water or in sewers howe et al 2012 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 potassium k sodium na and sulphate so4 2 concentrations depend on tap water characteristics that result from the distribution network water source and treatment geographical location and geology hori et al 2021 the higher the concentration at the wrrf inlet the higher the concentration in sidestreams a study on tap water characteristics also indicated a positive correlation between na cl and between ca2 mg2 alkalinity banks et al 2015 positive correlations between ca2 mg2 and na cl have also been found in anaerobic digestion sidestreams with the dataset used in the present study p value 5 table 2 shows typical ion concentrations for domestic wastewater the concentration range are systematically more extensive in sidestreams with values that can be very different compared to wastewater sulphate concentration is lower in sidestreams compared to wastewater because sulphur is usually removed from wastewater to prevent h2s formation in the digester and it can also be stripped as h2s gas for the other ions the concentration in sidestreams may results from 1 the addition of industrial wastewater to be treated in the urban wrrf 2 their accumulation in sludge and subsequent reaction of precipitation dissolution in the digester and in the thickening or dewatering unit and 3 the addition of chemicals such as lime for example calcium concentration in wastewater can increase up to 500 1500 mg l with industrial wastewater arabi and nakhla 2008 besides calcium potassium and magnesium are present in wastewaters as organic or inorganic forms these ions can accumulate in sludge and ca2 and k removal of 23 and 38 in wastewater has been observed in a wrrf in iran hosseinipour dizgah et al 2018 therefore during anaerobic digestion there is a release of ions which can then lead to precipitation as phosphates and carbonates of calcium and or magnesium marti et al 2008 consequently even if wastewater characteristics have an impact on the quantity of ions in sidestreams the concentration of ions throughout the plant can vary as an example a wrrf performing nutrient removal reported ca2 mg2 and k concentrations of respectively 63 12 and 284 mg l in sidestreams whereas the concentration in wastewater was respectively of 131 26 and 27 mg l martí et al 2017 in the latter example ca2 and mg2 have a lower concentration in sidestreams compared to wrrf inlet but the opposite occurs for k because k do not precipitate in high extent in digester barat et al 2009 3 3 alkalinity ph and temperature fig 8 presents alkalinity in sidestreams from anaerobic digestion and thp anaerobic digestion a significant difference between both types of sidestreams is observed the high alkalinity concentration in thp anaerobic digestion is due to the retention of carbon dioxide in the digester bulk liquid to balance the positively charged ammonium ion at the typical ph range of the digesters metcalf and eddy inc et al 2003 the correlation between alkalinity and ammonia has been confirmed with the set of data p value 5 in addition the mass ratio alkalinity nnh4 is similar between anaerobic digestion 0 24 0 12 and thp anaerobic digestion 0 27 0 2 the alkalinity in primary sludge and biological sidestreams 699 mg l and 409 mg l respectively are lower than anaerobic digestion sidestreams because of the lower ammonia concentration 3 3 the ph values from anaerobic digester sidestreams not shown ranged from 6 6 to 8 6 median value of 7 8 this ph is in the high range of typical ph of digesters 6 5 7 5 paul and liu 2012 the low ph values can be due to co2 stripping in dewatering units van rensburg et al 2003 ph in primary sludge and biological sludge sidestreams ranged from 6 3 to 7 6 the temperature in anaerobic digestion sidestreams is comprised between 18 c and 27 c this reflects the cooling between the outlet of the anaerobic digester 35 38 c and the dewatering unit 3 4 heavy metals micro pollutants and pathogens sidestreams valorisation through a nitrogen or a phosphorus based product is possible only if the latter complies with the regulations with reference to trace elements including heavy metals micropollutants and pathogens rey martínez et al 2022 indeed heavy metals can be incorporated into the crystal in case of struvite recovery reducing the purity of the product muys et al 2020 uysal et al 2010 in table 3 heavy metal concentrations in sidestreams are compared with their concentrations in wastewater the concentrations in sidestreams can be higher than in wastewater due to the accumulation of metals in sludge in terms of fluxes a study reported that ad dewatering sidestreams load contributed to 10 10 15 10 5 10 10 of the load entering the wrrf for cd cr cu hg ni pb and zn respectively yoshida et al 2015 for organic micropollutants information of their concentration in sidestreams have been found in the work of yoshida et al 2015 and uysal et al uysal et al 2010 for the following species bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp polychlorinated biphenyl pcbs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs the ad dewatering sidestreams load contribute to 15 5 30 of the load entering the wrrf for dehp pcbs and pahs respectively 4 how do sidestream characteristics impact the choice of a treatment valorisation process 4 1 struvite precipitation struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o is a white crystalline substance precipitating in a theoretical molar ratio of 1 1 1 nh4 po4 mg le corre et al 2009 struvite precipitation is usually used to recover phosphorus in ad dewatering sidestreams when p po4 concentration is above 50 mg l wu and vaneeckhaute 2022 this process was implemented first to help reduce struvite clogging issues in pumps and pipes kleemann et al 2015 the different technologies available on the market generally use a fluidised bed column reactor due to different solid and hydraulic retention time as well as to facilitate the recovery of struvite ghosh et al 2019 even if the performance of p recovery through struvite in sidestreams is over 90 jaffer et al 2002 münch and barr 2001 parsons et al 2001 yoshino et al 2003 the overall plant wide efficiency is lower than 50 muys et al 2020 the recovered struvite can be applied directly to the field as a slow release fertiliser if permitted and proven to be a favourable option for agricultural use melia et al 2017 the ph at which struvite may precipitate is one of the main factors influencing the crystallisation process le corre et al 2009 the ph in a struvite precipitation reactor is usually between 7 5 liu and qu 2017 and 9 5 daneshgar et al 2019 with optimal conditions around 8 5 münch and barr 2001 as the ph in ad dewatering sidestreams is from 6 6 to 8 9 3 6 adding sodium hydroxide to adjust the ph above 8 can be required because mg p ratio from 1 to 2 enhances the degree of supersaturation desmidt et al 2013 mg is generally added to the precipitation reactor as magnesium chloride or magnesium oxide münch and barr 2001 xavier et al 2014 consumption of high quantities of magnesium can limit the economic interest of struvite recovery technologies astals et al 2021 likewise low cost magnesium source have been envisaged such as magnesium from nano filtration of seawater shaddel et al 2020 however this option also brings others ions so a good knowledge of sidestreams is paramount before adding new sources of impurities lahav et al 2013 other parameters can affect the performance of struvite reactors tss above a concentration of 1000 mg l barnes et al 2007 has been reported to interfere with crystal growth by reducing the aggregation of crystals hence their final size muys et al 2020 tss even at a low concentration under 20 mg l can also adsorb to the surface of struvite crystals and decrease struvite purity desmidt et al 2015 ping et al 2016 not only tss but vss content can be responsible of a low phosphate removal efficiency because organic material can react with ions both on the media and on the surface of crystal nucleus ping et al 2016 tong and chen 2007 other ions play a significant role in the purity of the final product indeed amorphous calcium phosphate brucite magnesium phosphate calcite newberyite k struvite can precipitate in sidestreams musvoto et al 2000 the impact of ca2 in the purity of struvite depends on both ca2 p po4 and ca2 mg2 molar ratio as well as the initial p po4 concentration for a ca2 mg2 molar ratio over 0 5 struvite is heavily impacted by calcium and co precipitated with amorphous calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate korchef et al 2011 tao et al 2016 even sometimes for a ca2 mg2 molar ratio between 0 2 and 0 5 yan and shih 2016 and from ratio over 1 no struvite can be formed le corre et al 2005 if initial concentration of phosphate is higher than 60 mg l there is no influence of calcium on struvite precipitation for a ca2 mg2 molar ratio lower than 0 2 however at concentration of phosphate lower than 40 mg l struvite was affected by the presence of calcium for every ratio of ca2 mg2 consequently calcium phosphate precipitation will be more interesting than struvite precipitation for wastewaters with low phosphate concentrations desmidt et al 2013 in addition even if the heavy metals concentrations in sidestreams are very low 3 7 they can accumulate in the minerals precipitated a concentration of mercury in sidestreams of 0 426 mg l can result in a concentration of 4 23 mg kg dry matter in struvite uysal et al 2010 exceeding the limit of 1 mg kg dry matter european commission 2019 as far as pathogens are concerned struvite crystallisation selectively seem to exclude them leaving them in the anaerobic digestion sidestreams muys et al 2020 4 2 partial nitritation anaerobic ammonium oxidation pn anammox the pn anammox process is the most innovative worldwide applied technology for nitrogen removal in wrrfs in recent years the technologies used at full scale are single stage or separate stage systems that can be divided into 3 groups moving bed biofilm reactors granular sludge processes or sequencing bed reactors lackner et al 2014 in comparison to conventional nitrification denitrification and to nitritation denitritation this process does not require supplemental carbon addition consumes less oxygen 1 9 kg o2 kg n instead of 4 6 kg o2 kg n for nitrification denitrification and has lower sludge production van hulle et al 2010 the process transforms a mix of nh4 and no2 into n2 and a small quantity of no3 according to the following equation ahn 2006 n h 4 1 32 n o 2 0 66 h c o 3 0 13 h 0 066 c h 2 o 0 5 n 0 15 1 02 n 2 2 03 h 2 o 0 26 n o 3 under anoxic conditions anaerobic ammonium oxidising bacteria anammox can oxidise ammonium to molecular nitrogen using nitrite as the final electron acceptor and co2 as carbon donor the doubling time of anammox bacteria is about 10 12 days at 35 c talan et al 2021 therefore reactors providing high biomass retention time such as biofilm reactors are often used this process has been applied worldwide particularly in sidestreams from anaerobic digestion because these warm effluents with high nitrogen and low carbon content comply with optimal growth conditions of anammox bacteria kartal et al 2010 however process instability has been noted in connection with high or varying tss concentration increased tss load affects sludge withdrawal and consequently active biomass content in the reactor lackner et al 2014 inhibitions by soluble colloids and particulate cod has also been reported in literature arora et al 2021 jin et al 2012 2016 lackner et al 2014 talan et al 2021 a low cod nnh4 ratio generally lower than 2 lackner et al 2014 is recommended for the operation of the pn anammox process indeed for a cod nnh4 ratio higher than 2 inhibition has been reported in a laboratory scale reactor with particulate cod concentration as low as 300 mg l chamchoi et al 2008 which is expected in sidestreams from anaerobic digestion 3 2 particulate cod and colloidal cod were identified as the main inhibitory parameters that decreased aerobic ammonium oxidising bacteria aob rate under high levels of colloidal matter oxygen transfer efficiency decreased resulting in limited dissolved oxygen availability and consequently a poor nitrification performance this was resolved by improving the dewatering process through an optimised polymer dosing to capture the colloidal fraction no decrease of anammox activity was observed during operation of the reactor as long as the soluble cod concentration remained below 2500 mg l zhang et al 2016 this value corresponds to a cod nnh4 ratio of 2 4 and creates inhibition of anoxic ammonium oxidizing bacteria due to competition with denitrifiying bacteria such competitions between heterotrophic bacteria that outcompete both aob and anammox bacteria has been described by different authors especially with thp and high cod content baeten et al 2019 molinuevo et al 2009 to avoid such phenomena a dilution was suggested to maintain a constant soluble cod concentration in the process and to decrease toxicity effects from refractory compounds especially for anaerobic digestion sidestreams preceded by thp that can reach elevated cod concentrations 3 2 driessen et al 2020 the potential drawback of a higher dilution is the temperature drop zhang et al 2016 below anammox optimal temperature growth rate of 30 40 c shao et al 2019 a ph of 7 8 was reported to be suitable for anammox activity talan et al 2021 and in range for avoiding inhibition by free ammonia and free nitrous acid the inhibition at high ph is caused by the increase of free ammonia however a low ph value enhances free nitrous acid inhibition a free ammonia concentration of 20 mg l fernández et al 2012 or even lower during process startup jung et al 2007 can cause instability of the process figdore et al 2011 this concentration is expected at a temperature of 27 c ph 7 8 and a concentration of nnh4 of 810 mg l 3 3 and 3 7 dilution and ph control is one solution to stabilise the operation of deammonification processes lackner et al 2014 ochs et al 2021 a gradual start up for biomass acclimation is nevertheless possible up to 150 mg nnh3 l aktan et al 2012 inhibition of anammox activity by phosphate was reported for a wide range of concentration 57 6 mg l jin et al 2012 235 mg l yang et al 2019 310 mg l arora et al 2021 475 mg l eskicioglu et al 2018 however the underlying mechanisms are still under debate and are likely to vary depending on many parameters such as phosphate concentration aggregate state flocculated or densified biomass ph conditions degree of acclimation of the biomass and duration of the inhibition test short vs long term amongst others according to zhang et al 2017 the formation of dihydrogen phosphate ion under weakly basic conditions and high phosphate concentration may be responsible for the inhibition of the enzymes of the anammox reaction this effect seems less pronounced in granules due to their multi layer structure and higher extracellular polymeric substances levels that act as a protective layer for anammox bacteria biologically induced precipitation of calcium phosphate was confirmed in p na granular sludge and could be an additional explanation for the higher tolerance to phosphate stress of granules compared to anammox flocs johansson et al 2017 although essential nutrients ca k fe mg mn co cu mo ni zn are usually sufficiently available in digested sewage sludge reject liquors burgess et al 1999 fulvic and humic like organic substances generated by the thp process are known for binding metal ions possibly reducing the bioavailability of essential trace elements zhang et al 2018 table 4 shows that fe cu al and zn content in sidestreams do not always meet the minimum requirements for biomass growth to ensure optimal biological activity and growth of the biomass micronutrients essential trace metals are sometimes dosed to the anammox reactor especially for anaerobic digestion sidestreams with thp driessen et al 2020 besides it has been reported that the specific anammox growth rate could be significantly enhanced by adding ferrous oxide zhang et al 2022 high concentrations of heavy metals can inhibit anammox activity as it is reported in table 4 but such elevated concentrations are not likely to be encountered in municipal wrrf sidestreams reduction of sulphate to h2s often occurs in anaerobic digestion processes forouzanmehr et al 2022 and in anammox based system arora et al 2021 inducing the presence of sulphide in sidestreams in addition one should also mention that sulphate can be biologically reduced to sulphide bi et al 2020 the concentration of sulphide is mitigated by the formation of insoluble metal sulfide complexes in the anaerobic digester forouzanmehr et al 2021 the intermediate sulphide produced biologically was reported in a review to inhibit anammox activity starting from a concentration of 32 mg l jin et al 2013 4 3 ammonia stripping stripping of ammonia lies on the liquid gas equilibrium where ammonia from the liquid phase is transferred to a gas phase in a packed tower the ammonia gas is then sent to an air scrubber for ammonia absorption to an acid generally sulphuric acid in order to recover a solution of ammonium sulphate nh4 2so4 boehler et al 2015 this process has been applied at full scale but it is generally not favourable from the energy and chemicals consumption point of view except for a niche market fernández arévalo et al 2017 shaddel et al 2019 the main bottlenecks of this process are scaling and fouling of the packing material and the consequent high energy and chemical requirements to avoid that removal of ca mg carbonates and tss is required gopalakrishnan et al 2000 for a concentration of tss higher than 1000 mg l a separation solid liquid is required before entering the process vaneeckhaute et al 2018a the minimum alkalinity is 4000 mg l as caco3 to satisfy the ph requirements by stripping out co2 without the use of chemicals as naoh vaneeckhaute et al 2018c the quantity of cl above 20 kmol m3 which corresponds to 564 mg l negatively impacts the nh3 removal efficiency because it decreases the ph while increasing the ionic strength of the solution vaneeckhaute et al 2018c as discussed in 3 1 3 5 and 3 6 these threshold levels can be reached in anaerobic digestion sidestreams and pre treatment step is required when the conditions are not met for the correct operation of the process moreover the minimum ammonia concentration for this process is 1000 mg l to be economically viable wu and vaneeckhaute 2022 one study shows lower disadvantages by applying a thin film evaporator directly on digested sludge costamagna et al 2020 4 4 emerging processes three emerging technologies are briefly presented in the following section together with the main sidestream characteristics that may impact their performance according to literature data 4 4 1 membrane hollow fibre membrane contactor is a promising technology for n recovery in this system ammonia passes through a microporous hydrophobic membrane and a sulfuric acid solution is used as draw solution to recover n as a valuable product robles et al 2020 this technology has been applied at full scale in only one wrrf seco et al 2018 richter et al 2020 but the presence of suspended solids and colloidal materials can make the use of membrane based technologies for separate treatment of ad sidestream difficult due to membrane fouling eskicioglu et al 2018 metcalf and eddy inc et al 2003 wäeger baumann and fuchs 2012 nevertheless the optimisation of the materials used and recent works have shown an application of membranes for nitrogen recovery directly in digested sludge rivera et al 2022 regarding the final nitrogen based product obtained it can be contaminated by other ions present in the original substrate therefore membranes should be consider with additional steps tss cod and foreign ions removal to obtain a pure ammonia product darestani et al 2017 beckinghausen et al 2020 application of forward osmosis membrane or membrane distillation have not been found for sidestream application because of excessive fouling vu et al 2019 4 4 2 electrodialysis bioeletrochemical system ion exchange resin electrodialysis process uses an electric current to migrate ions to the cathode or anode and trap them on ion exchange membranes a concentrated ammonia or phosphate solution is obtained ward et al 2018 in bioelectrochemical systems the oxidation of organics produces electrons used as energy for the migration of nh4 ions from the anode to the cathode in order to maintain charge neutrality de fouchécour et al 2022 in the cathode chamber nh4 is transformed into nh3 thanks to the high ph value to be recovered nancharaiah et al 2016 ion exchange systems use resins which can exchange an ion adsorbed on the resin surface with a specific cation or anion in the centrate huang et al 2020 performance of these systems depend on electrode membrane and resin fouling because high calcium magnesium tss and carbonate can lead to significant deposit as calcium carbonate struvite or accumulation of colloidal particles beckinghausen et al 2020 feng et al 2017 mondor et al 2009 for the bioelectrochemical system the low cod content in sidestreams limits its development at full scale and this technology is best suitable for wastewater rather than centrate al sahari et al 2021 phosphorus adsorption is also highly dependent of ph value because it affects the surface charges of the absorbent the co existing of different ions such as so4 2 no3 and cl may inhibit p adsorption due to ions completion for the vacant adsorption sites song and li 2019 ye et al 2017 4 4 3 algae production microalgae based wastewater treatment systems can be used for the removal of organic and inorganic carbon as well as for nutrients from wastewater al momani and örmeci 2020 the main interest of this process lies in the production of a high growth rate algae biomass for biogas or biofuel production romero villegas et al 2017 the algae biomass has low carbon requirement which can be attractive for anaerobic digestion sidestreams treatment peralta et al 2019 however high content of tss can negatively impact the growth of microalgae biomass because algal biomass can then compete with other bacteria for n p and alkalinity marazzi et al 2019 another limit of this process is the design of the algae culture system as harvesting the biomass produced is still a challenging step zhao et al 2018 5 discussion the selection of processes for nutrient treatment recovery of anaerobic digestion sidestreams have been discussed based on current published information on their operation although of high importance current literature review revealed that it is challenging to define operational limits of the processes with regards to sidestream characteristics based on full scale data published data are indeed scarce and most of the time only limited characteristics were evaluated or investigated in addition it is likely that reported threshold values for sidestream characteristics leading to a decrease of process performance or to an inhibition embed the effect of other operational parameters it is therefore not excluded that process configuration the way it is operated as well as the exposition time and the acclimation of the biomass to an inhibitor highly affects the range of reported values this is especially critical when limited data are available based on literature data fig 9 presents the most important parameters to be measured before choosing a specific process comparison of the ranges of concentrations found and the list of sidestream characteristics shows that the range of concentrations from literature is large in comparison to the inhibition mentioned in the previous sections consequently installation of a pretreatment step for tss or cod removal for example can be required to ensure stable process performance nutrient recovery in sidestreams and especially in anaerobic digestion sidestreams seem promising but a well defined product with high purity is required if recovery as fertiliser is considered for example organic farmers have a need for a pure nitrogen fertiliser rather than a combination that includes p or k beckinghausen et al 2020 as seen in previous paragraphs other ions and organic matter can impact the purity of the final recovered product or the efficiency of the process to obtain these products therefore more investigations have to be carried out on the feasibility of producing a product with higher purity considering the full ionic composition of ad dewatering sidestreams shaddel et al 2019 thp can in addition to improving the performance of anaerobic digestion improve the possibilities of recovering nitrogen because the nnh4 content is higher in sidestreams compared to a conventional digester sidestream however this does not apply for p which is released as phosphate upstream of the ad through the thp but then precipitates in the digester with ca2 and mg2 the potential for p recovery upstream of ad needs to be more expanded as only a few examples exist to date bouzas et al 2019 nutrient recovery from primary sludge and biological sludge sidestreams has not been extensively explored indeed the concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen are lower than in the anaerobic digestion sidestreams however nutrient content in these sidestreams can be interesting for the recovery in some specific cases especially when there is a thickening unit with high retention time as the release of ions is stimulated in such specific context sidestreams can be joined together and the process installed on this sidestream combination latimer et al 2016 overall there is not always local demand for nitrogen or phosphorus fertiliser kehrein et al 2020 robles et al 2020 and nutrient recovery technologies need a large quantity of energy and chemicals which induces higher environmental impacts pradel and aissani 2019 future research should focus on the definition of evaluation criteria that take into account the wrrf performance effluent quality and operation costs but also the environmental impacts the efficiency of the recovery process and purity and the destination of the final product to do so there is an urgent need to develop shared databases with updated information on recovery processes including performance and operating conditions because there is a lack of information on recovery processes in real conditions puchongkawarin et al 2015 plant wide modelling could also help in the choice and comparison of different routes to treat or valorise sidestreams even if some models already include precipitation as struvite lizarralde et al 2019 or ammonia stripping vaneeckhaute et al 2018b they still need to be validated not only for the targeted nutrient but also considering the different compounds that can interact mg2 ca2 fe2 3 so4 2 k cl access to data from full scale measurement campaigns is therefore essential in order to understand the full ionic distribution in different locations in the wrrf and to integrate new mechanisms into existing models 6 conclusions sidestream processes are increasingly being optimised to mitigate their effects on the water treatment line but also to recover nutrients in water resource recovery facilities the implementation of such processes depends on sidestream characteristics ranges of concentrations of the main components observed in sidestreams at full scale have been discussed to aid in the development design and optimum operation of sidestream processes this critical review identified the following key points 1 anaerobic digestion sidestreams contribute significantly to the nitrogen 17 and phosphorus 11 mass flows at the wrrf inlet the quantity of phosphate in sidestreams depends on the type of applied phosphorus treatment with a median value of 33 mg l for chemical phosphorus removal and of 167 mg l for enhanced biological phosphorus removal 2 the concentration of cod n and alkalinity are higher in thp anaerobic digestion sidestreams than conventional anaerobic digestion however there is no difference in the phosphorus content because the phosphate release during thp is directly immobilised by others ions ca2 mg2 fe2 3 phosphorus recovery before anaerobic digestion should be considered in the presence of thp and the quantity of ca2 mg2 and fe2 3 should be quantified to assess the potential for p recovery 3 the variability of ion concentrations al3 ca2 cl fe2 3 mg2 k na so4 2 depends on 1 wastewater characteristics in particular the presence of industrial wastewater 2 the use of chemicals such as iron chloride or lime and 3 dissolution and precipitation mechanisms in thickening or dewatering unit the latter should be further investigated to better assess the impact of the full ionic composition on nutrient treatment or recovery 4 all the characteristics previously mentioned can have an impact on sidestream processes however the definition of a concentration range or threshold value to ensure the successful operation of these processes is not a straightforward task indeed the information about inhibitions is sparse in the literature and depends on a lot of different parameters reactor configuration scale biomass acclimatisation operating conditions this review provides a list of characteristics to be measured in order to select the most suitable sidestream process for each specific application 5 future research should focus on further data acquisition especially on the concentration of the different ions to better assess the potential for nutrient recovery and to minimise the economic and environmental impact of wrrfs credit authorship contribution statement perrine devos conceptualization investigation writing original draft

15023,this review compiles information on sidestream characteristics that result from anaerobic digestion dewatering conventional and preceded by a thermal hydrolysis process biological and primary sludge thickening the objective is to define a range of concentrations for the different characteristics found in literature and to confront them with the optimal operating conditions of sidestream processes for nutrient treatment or recovery each characteristic of sidestream tss vss cod n p al3 ca2 cl fe2 3 mg2 k na so4 2 heavy metals micro pollutants and pathogens is discussed according to the water resource recovery facility configuration wastewater characteristics and implications for the recovery of nitrogen and phosphorus based on current published knowledge on the processes implemented at full scale the thorough analysis of sidestream characteristics shows that anaerobic digestion sidestreams have the highest ammonium content compared to biological and primary sludge sidestreams phosphate content in anaerobic digestion sidestreams depends on the type of applied phosphorus treatment but is also highly dependent on precipitation reactions within the digester thermal hydrolysis process thp mainly impacts cod n and alkalinity content in anaerobic digestion sidestreams surprisingly the concentration of phosphate is not higher compared to conventional anaerobic digestion thus offering more attractive recovery possibilities upstream of the digester rather than in sidestreams all sidestream processes investigated in the present study struvite partial nitrification anammox ammonia stripping membranes bioelectrochemical system electrodialysis ion exchange system and algae production suffer from residual tss in sidestreams above a certain threshold residual cod and ions can also deteriorate the performance of the process or the purity of the final nutrient based product this article also provides a list of characteristics to measure to help in the choice of a specific process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reject water nutrient recovery anaerobic digestion wastewater thermal hydrolysis process data availability data have been shared in the repository datagouv https doi org 10 57745 fohrhy 1 introduction wastewater characteristics have been studied for decades because they are key to design and optimise the operation of wastewater treatment processes the usual characteristics of urban wastewater including total solids organic matter total nitrogen total phosphorous and organic matter biodegradability from different countries is well documented especially in view of process modelling rieger et al 2012 and experimental methods to characterise the composition of wastewater have been established and benchmarked gillot and choubert 2010 van loosdrecht et al 2016 at the same time there is a growing interest in the characterisation of both the solid and the liquid phase of sewage sludge this interest is primarily motivated by the need to reduce sludge volumes and associated sludge management costs zhen et al 2017 as well as to maximise their reuse as fertiliser kacprzak et al 2017 one of the current concerns is the concentration of heavy metals and emerging contaminants when sludge disposal route is land application appels et al 2010 steele et al 2022 as part of sewage sludge management in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs sludge thickening and dewatering units result in the production of different types of sidestreams also called reject water centrate supernatant or filtrate recycled into the main wastewater treatment line the major concern about these streams arose with the overall tightening of wrrfs effluent standards preisner et al 2020 and the development of anaerobic digestion ad that generates a nutrient rich supernatant gourdet et al 2017 in the context of a wastewater identified as a resource rather than a waste stream ad has proved to be an essential technology as it reduces sludge volume stabilises sludge and more importantly recovers energy as methane appels et al 2011 sidestreams in wrrfs equipped with ad can contain up to 25 of the total nitrogen load and 10 of the total phosphorus load to the facilities couturier et al 2001 grulois et al 1993 this phosphorus load can be even higher up to 30 when enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is implemented in the water line ueno and fujii 2001 also to boost ad and dewatering performance several sludge pre treatments have been developed carrère et al 2010 amongst them the thermal hydrolysis process thp is the most applied technology and existing full scale references have so far reported an enhancement of ad performance after thp pre treatment kor bicakci and eskicioglu 2019 the main drawback of thp is that it generates streams with high concentration of refractory compounds and an increase in sidestream ammonia concentration barber 2016 bougrier et al 2008 dwyer et al 2008b high nutrient content in sidestreams can lead to increased energy consumption and degradation of effluent quality cullen et al 2013 janus and van der roest 1997 especially when the facility operates close to full scale capacity in such conditions sidestream processes are good opportunities for upgrading treatment capacity without needing to expand existing works van loosdrecht and salem 2006 the main biological processes for the treatment of nitrogen in sidestreams includes nitritation denitritation nitrification denitrification partial nitrification anammox bioaugmentation and algae production eskicioglu et al 2018 sidestream processes also offer an excellent opportunity for nutrient recovery essential for sustaining the food production industry currently nitrogen based fertilisers are mainly produced by the energy intensive haber bosch process while rock phosphate is the main raw material in phosphorus based fertilisers nancharaiah et al 2016 shaddel et al 2019 the implementation of these production routes on the long term is questioned because 1 phosphorus depletion is expected by 2100 van vuuren et al 2010 and 2 fertilisers production currently accounts for more than 1 of the world s emissions of greenhouse gases ghg kehrein et al 2020 municipal wastewater is thus an interesting nutrient source as its nitrogen and phosphorus content accounts respectively for 14 and 7 of the global fertiliser demand qadir et al 2020 several reviews present in detail the technologies available for nutrient recovery from wastewater they are mainly based on physical physicochemical and bio electrochemical mechanisms guilayn et al 2020 vaneeckhaute et al 2017 ye et al 2018 struvite precipitation ammonia stripping membrane filtration electrodialysis bio electrochemical system ammonia and phosphate sorption are the most investigated processes performances of such processes depend on sidestream characteristics their efficiency the capacity for nutrient removal the energy and chemical consumption and the quality of recovered products have to be specified the nutrient based products must also comply with the current n p fertiliser characteristics and legislation in addition to complete cod n and p fractionation the detailed ionic strength of sidestreams is necessary to correctly design and model treatment or recovery processes as they are mainly based on physicochemical reactions this information is especially required as input of the new advanced plant wide models that couple biokinetics with physicochemical framework flores alsina et al 2015 kazadi mbamba et al 2015 lizarralde et al 2015 solon et al 2015 vaneeckhaute et al 2018b despite the growing interest in the implementation of sidestream processes a complete characterisation of this stream is relatively scarce and sparse in the literature published data include phosphorus martí et al 2017 nitrogen kassouf et al 2020 cod fractionation noutsopoulos et al 2018 and ionic composition bhuiyan et al 2009 however no synthesis compares sidestream characteristics from different wrrfs considering a large number of components solids concentration cod biodegradability n p ions heavy metals and ionic composition that constitute wastewater metcalf and eddy inc et al 2003 this review article compiles and analyses literature data of sidestream characteristics from different locations in wrrfs the aim is to bring knowledge on sidestream characteristics to assist in selection design and modelling of sidestream processes data are questioned in order to choose the most optimal operating conditions of the main sidestream processes and to identify potential limits of application implications in terms of plant wide modelling are also mentioned in order to improve sidestream description and nutrient recovery options finally the need for data on characterisation of sidestreams are highlighted to support the development of processes that can improve environmental and economic impacts of wrrfs 2 literature data compilation the set of data used in this study results from the compilation of information from 87 documents peer reviewed and grey literature the characteristics found have been classified according to the source of sidestreams biological sludge for sidestreams resulting from the thickening of biological sludge primary sludge for sidestreams resulting from the thickening of primary sludge anaerobic digestion for sidestreams resulting from the dewatering of digested sludge thp anaerobic digestion for sidestreams resulting from the dewatering of digested sludge preceded by a thermal hydrolysis process thp the collection and description of the data can be found in the associated data paper and the dataset is available on the french repository datagouv https doi org 10 57745 fohrhy only papers with clear information on sidestream sources were selected sidestreams from full scale measurements only were included in the dataset all figures presented in this document have been generated with rstudio software version 4 1 2 most of the data is presented in the form of a violin plot overlaid on a boxplot outliers have been detected with the bonferroni test bretz et al 2010 for each boxplot when the p value is below 5 they are indicated in the figures in grey but are not included in the calculation of the median nor in the count of the total number of values the different sources of sidestreams were statistically compared using the kruskal wallis test the pairwise comparison using the wilcoxon test was also used to compare the impact of different wrrf configurations in addition correlations between different parameters were identified using the spearman test 3 sidestream characteristics in the following sidestream characteristics are first described in terms of major pollutants tss cod and nutrients concentrations and mass loads are analysed the ionic composition of sidestreams are then described as well as ph alkalinity and temperature collected data mainly refer to streams from the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge a few data on sidestreams from primary or biological sludge thickening are also presented when available 3 1 major pollutants in sidestreams 3 1 1 concentration of total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss fig 1 presents the tss concentrations in sidestreams from anaerobic digestion preceded or not by a thp tss concentrations are highly variable from one study to another this variability is partly due to the sampling methodology as most of the values have been obtained on grab samples there is no significant difference between both types of sidestreams which means that tss concentration in sidestreams is mainly driven by other factors than the presence of a thp such as the dewatering unit performance interestingly most of the data compiled on anaerobic digestion sidestreams came from centrifuges the centrifuge has a solid capture rate between 95 and 99 depending on sludge conditioning metcalf and eddy inc et al 2003 considering a tss concentration in digested sludge of 25 g l the tss concentration in sidestreams from an anaerobic digester would not exceed 1500 mg l outliers in fig 1 are much higher than this value indicating that the centrifuge may sometimes underperform besides variability of water content and particle size of sludge induced by sludge transport and storage can impact the demand for polymers and therefore the performance of the dewatering unit andreoli et al 2007 henze and comeau 2008 anaerobic digestion sidestream has a median vss to tss ratio of 70 fig 1b a value in the range of 55 75 is expected bowden et al 2015 which corresponds to volatile solids vs range for digested sludge andreoli et al 2007 3 1 2 concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod the concentrations of total cod and soluble cod are significantly different between anaerobic digestion and thp anaerobic digestion sidestreams fig 2 as for tss there is a large variability of cod concentration which is explained by the significant correlation between total cod and tss the difference of total cod concentration between both types of sidestreams is mainly due to the higher soluble cod concentration in thp anaerobic digestion sidestreams induced by a higher solubilisation rate barber 2016 devos et al 2020 part of this additional soluble cod has been reported to be refractory compounds produced through the maillard and amadori reaction that also impacts the effluent cod of the wrrf the amount of refractory compounds produced is dependent on the temperature of thp and becomes significant at a temperature higher than 160 c toutian et al 2020 for six facilities in berlin without sidestream processes and for different thp temperatures the increase in effluent soluble cod was estimated to be in the range of 2 15 mg l toutian et al 2020 another study reported that thp implementation in five facilities led to a 3 8 mg l increase of effluent cod concentration depending on the quantity of primary sludge versus the quantity of biological sludge svennevik et al 2020 the concentration of total cod in biological sludge sidestreams and in the treated water are usually close except in the case of thickening unit malfunction the concentration of cod in primary sludge sidestreams is similar to wastewater and is in the range of 250 800 mg l constantine 2006 however higher values of 823 mg l roldán et al 2020 and up to 4244 mg l have been encountered probably due to sludge loss following a rain event in the gravity thickener noutsopoulos et al 2018 3 1 3 organic matter biodegradability in sidestreams table 1 shows cod biodegradable fractions in sidestreams based on literature review for a given type of sidestreams results show a large variability explained on the one hand by varying methods employed to characterise the biodegradability and on the other hand by differences in operating conditions of ad and thp t c sludge concentration retention time the fractionation of cod into different classes of biodegradability slowly biodegradable rapidly biodegradable inert soluble and particulate is essential for design operation purposes and modelling gillot and choubert 2010 however more data are required to compare the sludge biodegradability after anaerobic digestion and thp anaerobic digestion sidestreams primary sludge thickening sidestreams has a biodegradable fraction similar to wastewater generally between 54 88 gillot and choubert 2010 of total cod the biodegradable fraction of biological sludge thickening sidestreams is similar to the one of treated wastewater which is generally 70 to 80 lower than the untreated wastewater 3 1 4 concentration of nitrogen species for conventional mesophilic anaerobic digesters the resulting ammonium nnh4 concentration in sidestreams typically ranges from 400 mg l to 1 300 mg l metcalf and eddy inc et al 2003 which is in line with present data fig 3 variability of nnh4 can be linked to the quantity of wash water used in the dewatering unit metcalf and eddy inc et al 2003 and to ad operating conditions sludge concentration vs removal nnh4 is significantly higher in anaerobic digestion with thp compared to ad without thp which is explained by the fact that thp favours 1 an increase in the sludge concentration in the digester due to reduced viscosity urrea et al 2015 2 a higher solubilisation rate dwyer et al 2008a wilson and novak 2009 and 3 an increase in biodegradation of organic matter and therefore of proteins content bougrier et al 2008 likewise increased release of ammonium in the digester is expected it was reported that total ammonium release per mass of volatile solids removed is equivalent for conventional mesophilic ad and thp whatever the sludge type wilson et al 2011 soluble nitrogen in ad dewatering sidestreams is mainly in the form of ammonium and soluble organic nitrogen accounts for a maximum of 10 of soluble tkn of this soluble organic nitrogen fraction approximately 50 is considered non biodegradable the soluble organic nitrogen is believed to be produced through cell metabolism and decay of the anaerobic bacteria and waste activated sludge therefore typical digester sidestream will add approximately 0 2 mg l of refractory dissolved organic nitrogen to the wrrf effluent metcalf and eddy inc et al 2003 a recent survey on soluble organic nitrogen content in treated wastewater reported an average final concentration of 0 93 mg l with a range of 0 2 5 mg l galvagno et al 2016 therefore the non biodegradable fraction brought by ad dewatering sidestreams will account for approximatively 25 of final organic nitrogen this quantity can be higher with thp pre treatment ahuja 2015 as expected nnh4 concentration in biological sludge and primary sludge sidestreams is significantly lower compared to anaerobic digestion sidestreams however the formation of anaerobic zones in thickening units such as gravity thickener or dissolved air flotation can lead to sludge hydrolysis thus favouring ions release which can explain outliers of 50 mg l for biological sludge sidestreams and 123 mg l for primary sludge sidestreams not clearly visible in fig 3 due to the scaling 3 1 5 concentration of phosphate phosphate p po4 concentration for different sources of sidestreams is shown in fig 4 the concentration of phosphate in biological sludge and primary sludge sidestreams is significantly lower compared to anaerobic digestion sidestreams outliers in fig 4 with very high concentrations of phosphate up to 180 mg l for biological sludge sidestreams was attributed by barat et al 2009 to the formation of anaerobic zones in the thickener this phenomenon is unlikely to happen in fast thickening processes such as centrifuge rotary drum or belt press wild et al 1997 in addition as thp increases phosphorus solubilisation a higher phosphate content in ad dewatering sidestreams was expected compared to conventional digestion khunjar et al 2019 surprisingly this was not supported by literature data whilst the intracellular phosphorus can be released during thp this phosphorus can be directly immobilised by metallic ions such as mg2 fe2 3 ca2 and al3 han et al 2020 consequently the phosphorus content in the thp return liquor does not differ from the one of conventional ad this result was found without considering the different types of applied phosphorus treatment because more data is needed to complete this comparative analysis to investigate the high phosphate concentration variability in anaerobic digestion sidestreams fig 5 shows phosphate concentration according to the phosphorus treatment type installed in the water line enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr chemical phosphorus removal a combination of both biological and chemical phosphorus removal and no specific phosphorus treatment only wrrfs operated with ebpr lead to higher phosphate in anaerobic digestion sidestreams compared to chemical phosphorus removal and no specific phosphorus treatment the high phosphate concentration range for biological phosphorus removal and the combination of biological with chemical phosphorus removal can be attributed to different level of precipitation inside the anaerobic digester and different iron dosage 3 1 6 contribution to the inlet mass flows the flow of the different sources of sidestreams accounts for less than 5 of the total flow at the wrrf inlet fig 6 mass flow of total cod and tss also represent less than 5 of the total mass flow at wrrf inlet for biological sludge and anaerobic digestion sidestreams primary sludge can excess this 5 threshold especially after a rain event as expected the highest sidestream contribution for total phosphorus and total nitrogen comes from anaerobic digestion sidestreams regarding the nitrogen mass flow sidestreams from anaerobic digestion contribute on average to 17 of the nitrogen mass flow at the wrrf inlet which is much higher than the contribution of biological sludge sidestreams 1 and primary sludge sidestreams 3 8 the variability of the nitrogen mass flow is due to the wide range of nnh4 concentration found in anaerobic digestion sidestreams and the different load of nitrogen at the wrrf inlet phosphorus mass flow depends on the type of phosphorus treatment implemented in the water line similarly to the concentration of phosphate in anaerobic digestion sidestreams 3 1 5 for wrrfs with ebpr anaerobic digestion sidestreams can contribute up to 34 of the total phosphorus mass flow mass flow of total phosphorus from primary sludge sidestreams and biological sludge sidestreams can exceed 5 especially when the thickening unit favours the formation of anaerobic zones gravity thickener dissolved air flotation 3 2 ionic composition of sidestreams fig 7 shows the concentration of different ions in sidestreams from anaerobic digestion the concentration of aluminium al3 and iron ions fe2 3 is very low because these metals precipitate easily with phosphorus or sulphur wilfert et al 2015 only a high salt dosage can lead to residual iron or aluminium in the soluble phase the addition of salts lead to a large variability of chloride cl concentration from one study to another this variability can be explained by different dose of salts or chemicals applied within the wrrf but also during disinfection of potable water or in sewers howe et al 2012 calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 potassium k sodium na and sulphate so4 2 concentrations depend on tap water characteristics that result from the distribution network water source and treatment geographical location and geology hori et al 2021 the higher the concentration at the wrrf inlet the higher the concentration in sidestreams a study on tap water characteristics also indicated a positive correlation between na cl and between ca2 mg2 alkalinity banks et al 2015 positive correlations between ca2 mg2 and na cl have also been found in anaerobic digestion sidestreams with the dataset used in the present study p value 5 table 2 shows typical ion concentrations for domestic wastewater the concentration range are systematically more extensive in sidestreams with values that can be very different compared to wastewater sulphate concentration is lower in sidestreams compared to wastewater because sulphur is usually removed from wastewater to prevent h2s formation in the digester and it can also be stripped as h2s gas for the other ions the concentration in sidestreams may results from 1 the addition of industrial wastewater to be treated in the urban wrrf 2 their accumulation in sludge and subsequent reaction of precipitation dissolution in the digester and in the thickening or dewatering unit and 3 the addition of chemicals such as lime for example calcium concentration in wastewater can increase up to 500 1500 mg l with industrial wastewater arabi and nakhla 2008 besides calcium potassium and magnesium are present in wastewaters as organic or inorganic forms these ions can accumulate in sludge and ca2 and k removal of 23 and 38 in wastewater has been observed in a wrrf in iran hosseinipour dizgah et al 2018 therefore during anaerobic digestion there is a release of ions which can then lead to precipitation as phosphates and carbonates of calcium and or magnesium marti et al 2008 consequently even if wastewater characteristics have an impact on the quantity of ions in sidestreams the concentration of ions throughout the plant can vary as an example a wrrf performing nutrient removal reported ca2 mg2 and k concentrations of respectively 63 12 and 284 mg l in sidestreams whereas the concentration in wastewater was respectively of 131 26 and 27 mg l martí et al 2017 in the latter example ca2 and mg2 have a lower concentration in sidestreams compared to wrrf inlet but the opposite occurs for k because k do not precipitate in high extent in digester barat et al 2009 3 3 alkalinity ph and temperature fig 8 presents alkalinity in sidestreams from anaerobic digestion and thp anaerobic digestion a significant difference between both types of sidestreams is observed the high alkalinity concentration in thp anaerobic digestion is due to the retention of carbon dioxide in the digester bulk liquid to balance the positively charged ammonium ion at the typical ph range of the digesters metcalf and eddy inc et al 2003 the correlation between alkalinity and ammonia has been confirmed with the set of data p value 5 in addition the mass ratio alkalinity nnh4 is similar between anaerobic digestion 0 24 0 12 and thp anaerobic digestion 0 27 0 2 the alkalinity in primary sludge and biological sidestreams 699 mg l and 409 mg l respectively are lower than anaerobic digestion sidestreams because of the lower ammonia concentration 3 3 the ph values from anaerobic digester sidestreams not shown ranged from 6 6 to 8 6 median value of 7 8 this ph is in the high range of typical ph of digesters 6 5 7 5 paul and liu 2012 the low ph values can be due to co2 stripping in dewatering units van rensburg et al 2003 ph in primary sludge and biological sludge sidestreams ranged from 6 3 to 7 6 the temperature in anaerobic digestion sidestreams is comprised between 18 c and 27 c this reflects the cooling between the outlet of the anaerobic digester 35 38 c and the dewatering unit 3 4 heavy metals micro pollutants and pathogens sidestreams valorisation through a nitrogen or a phosphorus based product is possible only if the latter complies with the regulations with reference to trace elements including heavy metals micropollutants and pathogens rey martínez et al 2022 indeed heavy metals can be incorporated into the crystal in case of struvite recovery reducing the purity of the product muys et al 2020 uysal et al 2010 in table 3 heavy metal concentrations in sidestreams are compared with their concentrations in wastewater the concentrations in sidestreams can be higher than in wastewater due to the accumulation of metals in sludge in terms of fluxes a study reported that ad dewatering sidestreams load contributed to 10 10 15 10 5 10 10 of the load entering the wrrf for cd cr cu hg ni pb and zn respectively yoshida et al 2015 for organic micropollutants information of their concentration in sidestreams have been found in the work of yoshida et al 2015 and uysal et al uysal et al 2010 for the following species bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp polychlorinated biphenyl pcbs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs the ad dewatering sidestreams load contribute to 15 5 30 of the load entering the wrrf for dehp pcbs and pahs respectively 4 how do sidestream characteristics impact the choice of a treatment valorisation process 4 1 struvite precipitation struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o is a white crystalline substance precipitating in a theoretical molar ratio of 1 1 1 nh4 po4 mg le corre et al 2009 struvite precipitation is usually used to recover phosphorus in ad dewatering sidestreams when p po4 concentration is above 50 mg l wu and vaneeckhaute 2022 this process was implemented first to help reduce struvite clogging issues in pumps and pipes kleemann et al 2015 the different technologies available on the market generally use a fluidised bed column reactor due to different solid and hydraulic retention time as well as to facilitate the recovery of struvite ghosh et al 2019 even if the performance of p recovery through struvite in sidestreams is over 90 jaffer et al 2002 münch and barr 2001 parsons et al 2001 yoshino et al 2003 the overall plant wide efficiency is lower than 50 muys et al 2020 the recovered struvite can be applied directly to the field as a slow release fertiliser if permitted and proven to be a favourable option for agricultural use melia et al 2017 the ph at which struvite may precipitate is one of the main factors influencing the crystallisation process le corre et al 2009 the ph in a struvite precipitation reactor is usually between 7 5 liu and qu 2017 and 9 5 daneshgar et al 2019 with optimal conditions around 8 5 münch and barr 2001 as the ph in ad dewatering sidestreams is from 6 6 to 8 9 3 6 adding sodium hydroxide to adjust the ph above 8 can be required because mg p ratio from 1 to 2 enhances the degree of supersaturation desmidt et al 2013 mg is generally added to the precipitation reactor as magnesium chloride or magnesium oxide münch and barr 2001 xavier et al 2014 consumption of high quantities of magnesium can limit the economic interest of struvite recovery technologies astals et al 2021 likewise low cost magnesium source have been envisaged such as magnesium from nano filtration of seawater shaddel et al 2020 however this option also brings others ions so a good knowledge of sidestreams is paramount before adding new sources of impurities lahav et al 2013 other parameters can affect the performance of struvite reactors tss above a concentration of 1000 mg l barnes et al 2007 has been reported to interfere with crystal growth by reducing the aggregation of crystals hence their final size muys et al 2020 tss even at a low concentration under 20 mg l can also adsorb to the surface of struvite crystals and decrease struvite purity desmidt et al 2015 ping et al 2016 not only tss but vss content can be responsible of a low phosphate removal efficiency because organic material can react with ions both on the media and on the surface of crystal nucleus ping et al 2016 tong and chen 2007 other ions play a significant role in the purity of the final product indeed amorphous calcium phosphate brucite magnesium phosphate calcite newberyite k struvite can precipitate in sidestreams musvoto et al 2000 the impact of ca2 in the purity of struvite depends on both ca2 p po4 and ca2 mg2 molar ratio as well as the initial p po4 concentration for a ca2 mg2 molar ratio over 0 5 struvite is heavily impacted by calcium and co precipitated with amorphous calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate korchef et al 2011 tao et al 2016 even sometimes for a ca2 mg2 molar ratio between 0 2 and 0 5 yan and shih 2016 and from ratio over 1 no struvite can be formed le corre et al 2005 if initial concentration of phosphate is higher than 60 mg l there is no influence of calcium on struvite precipitation for a ca2 mg2 molar ratio lower than 0 2 however at concentration of phosphate lower than 40 mg l struvite was affected by the presence of calcium for every ratio of ca2 mg2 consequently calcium phosphate precipitation will be more interesting than struvite precipitation for wastewaters with low phosphate concentrations desmidt et al 2013 in addition even if the heavy metals concentrations in sidestreams are very low 3 7 they can accumulate in the minerals precipitated a concentration of mercury in sidestreams of 0 426 mg l can result in a concentration of 4 23 mg kg dry matter in struvite uysal et al 2010 exceeding the limit of 1 mg kg dry matter european commission 2019 as far as pathogens are concerned struvite crystallisation selectively seem to exclude them leaving them in the anaerobic digestion sidestreams muys et al 2020 4 2 partial nitritation anaerobic ammonium oxidation pn anammox the pn anammox process is the most innovative worldwide applied technology for nitrogen removal in wrrfs in recent years the technologies used at full scale are single stage or separate stage systems that can be divided into 3 groups moving bed biofilm reactors granular sludge processes or sequencing bed reactors lackner et al 2014 in comparison to conventional nitrification denitrification and to nitritation denitritation this process does not require supplemental carbon addition consumes less oxygen 1 9 kg o2 kg n instead of 4 6 kg o2 kg n for nitrification denitrification and has lower sludge production van hulle et al 2010 the process transforms a mix of nh4 and no2 into n2 and a small quantity of no3 according to the following equation ahn 2006 n h 4 1 32 n o 2 0 66 h c o 3 0 13 h 0 066 c h 2 o 0 5 n 0 15 1 02 n 2 2 03 h 2 o 0 26 n o 3 under anoxic conditions anaerobic ammonium oxidising bacteria anammox can oxidise ammonium to molecular nitrogen using nitrite as the final electron acceptor and co2 as carbon donor the doubling time of anammox bacteria is about 10 12 days at 35 c talan et al 2021 therefore reactors providing high biomass retention time such as biofilm reactors are often used this process has been applied worldwide particularly in sidestreams from anaerobic digestion because these warm effluents with high nitrogen and low carbon content comply with optimal growth conditions of anammox bacteria kartal et al 2010 however process instability has been noted in connection with high or varying tss concentration increased tss load affects sludge withdrawal and consequently active biomass content in the reactor lackner et al 2014 inhibitions by soluble colloids and particulate cod has also been reported in literature arora et al 2021 jin et al 2012 2016 lackner et al 2014 talan et al 2021 a low cod nnh4 ratio generally lower than 2 lackner et al 2014 is recommended for the operation of the pn anammox process indeed for a cod nnh4 ratio higher than 2 inhibition has been reported in a laboratory scale reactor with particulate cod concentration as low as 300 mg l chamchoi et al 2008 which is expected in sidestreams from anaerobic digestion 3 2 particulate cod and colloidal cod were identified as the main inhibitory parameters that decreased aerobic ammonium oxidising bacteria aob rate under high levels of colloidal matter oxygen transfer efficiency decreased resulting in limited dissolved oxygen availability and consequently a poor nitrification performance this was resolved by improving the dewatering process through an optimised polymer dosing to capture the colloidal fraction no decrease of anammox activity was observed during operation of the reactor as long as the soluble cod concentration remained below 2500 mg l zhang et al 2016 this value corresponds to a cod nnh4 ratio of 2 4 and creates inhibition of anoxic ammonium oxidizing bacteria due to competition with denitrifiying bacteria such competitions between heterotrophic bacteria that outcompete both aob and anammox bacteria has been described by different authors especially with thp and high cod content baeten et al 2019 molinuevo et al 2009 to avoid such phenomena a dilution was suggested to maintain a constant soluble cod concentration in the process and to decrease toxicity effects from refractory compounds especially for anaerobic digestion sidestreams preceded by thp that can reach elevated cod concentrations 3 2 driessen et al 2020 the potential drawback of a higher dilution is the temperature drop zhang et al 2016 below anammox optimal temperature growth rate of 30 40 c shao et al 2019 a ph of 7 8 was reported to be suitable for anammox activity talan et al 2021 and in range for avoiding inhibition by free ammonia and free nitrous acid the inhibition at high ph is caused by the increase of free ammonia however a low ph value enhances free nitrous acid inhibition a free ammonia concentration of 20 mg l fernández et al 2012 or even lower during process startup jung et al 2007 can cause instability of the process figdore et al 2011 this concentration is expected at a temperature of 27 c ph 7 8 and a concentration of nnh4 of 810 mg l 3 3 and 3 7 dilution and ph control is one solution to stabilise the operation of deammonification processes lackner et al 2014 ochs et al 2021 a gradual start up for biomass acclimation is nevertheless possible up to 150 mg nnh3 l aktan et al 2012 inhibition of anammox activity by phosphate was reported for a wide range of concentration 57 6 mg l jin et al 2012 235 mg l yang et al 2019 310 mg l arora et al 2021 475 mg l eskicioglu et al 2018 however the underlying mechanisms are still under debate and are likely to vary depending on many parameters such as phosphate concentration aggregate state flocculated or densified biomass ph conditions degree of acclimation of the biomass and duration of the inhibition test short vs long term amongst others according to zhang et al 2017 the formation of dihydrogen phosphate ion under weakly basic conditions and high phosphate concentration may be responsible for the inhibition of the enzymes of the anammox reaction this effect seems less pronounced in granules due to their multi layer structure and higher extracellular polymeric substances levels that act as a protective layer for anammox bacteria biologically induced precipitation of calcium phosphate was confirmed in p na granular sludge and could be an additional explanation for the higher tolerance to phosphate stress of granules compared to anammox flocs johansson et al 2017 although essential nutrients ca k fe mg mn co cu mo ni zn are usually sufficiently available in digested sewage sludge reject liquors burgess et al 1999 fulvic and humic like organic substances generated by the thp process are known for binding metal ions possibly reducing the bioavailability of essential trace elements zhang et al 2018 table 4 shows that fe cu al and zn content in sidestreams do not always meet the minimum requirements for biomass growth to ensure optimal biological activity and growth of the biomass micronutrients essential trace metals are sometimes dosed to the anammox reactor especially for anaerobic digestion sidestreams with thp driessen et al 2020 besides it has been reported that the specific anammox growth rate could be significantly enhanced by adding ferrous oxide zhang et al 2022 high concentrations of heavy metals can inhibit anammox activity as it is reported in table 4 but such elevated concentrations are not likely to be encountered in municipal wrrf sidestreams reduction of sulphate to h2s often occurs in anaerobic digestion processes forouzanmehr et al 2022 and in anammox based system arora et al 2021 inducing the presence of sulphide in sidestreams in addition one should also mention that sulphate can be biologically reduced to sulphide bi et al 2020 the concentration of sulphide is mitigated by the formation of insoluble metal sulfide complexes in the anaerobic digester forouzanmehr et al 2021 the intermediate sulphide produced biologically was reported in a review to inhibit anammox activity starting from a concentration of 32 mg l jin et al 2013 4 3 ammonia stripping stripping of ammonia lies on the liquid gas equilibrium where ammonia from the liquid phase is transferred to a gas phase in a packed tower the ammonia gas is then sent to an air scrubber for ammonia absorption to an acid generally sulphuric acid in order to recover a solution of ammonium sulphate nh4 2so4 boehler et al 2015 this process has been applied at full scale but it is generally not favourable from the energy and chemicals consumption point of view except for a niche market fernández arévalo et al 2017 shaddel et al 2019 the main bottlenecks of this process are scaling and fouling of the packing material and the consequent high energy and chemical requirements to avoid that removal of ca mg carbonates and tss is required gopalakrishnan et al 2000 for a concentration of tss higher than 1000 mg l a separation solid liquid is required before entering the process vaneeckhaute et al 2018a the minimum alkalinity is 4000 mg l as caco3 to satisfy the ph requirements by stripping out co2 without the use of chemicals as naoh vaneeckhaute et al 2018c the quantity of cl above 20 kmol m3 which corresponds to 564 mg l negatively impacts the nh3 removal efficiency because it decreases the ph while increasing the ionic strength of the solution vaneeckhaute et al 2018c as discussed in 3 1 3 5 and 3 6 these threshold levels can be reached in anaerobic digestion sidestreams and pre treatment step is required when the conditions are not met for the correct operation of the process moreover the minimum ammonia concentration for this process is 1000 mg l to be economically viable wu and vaneeckhaute 2022 one study shows lower disadvantages by applying a thin film evaporator directly on digested sludge costamagna et al 2020 4 4 emerging processes three emerging technologies are briefly presented in the following section together with the main sidestream characteristics that may impact their performance according to literature data 4 4 1 membrane hollow fibre membrane contactor is a promising technology for n recovery in this system ammonia passes through a microporous hydrophobic membrane and a sulfuric acid solution is used as draw solution to recover n as a valuable product robles et al 2020 this technology has been applied at full scale in only one wrrf seco et al 2018 richter et al 2020 but the presence of suspended solids and colloidal materials can make the use of membrane based technologies for separate treatment of ad sidestream difficult due to membrane fouling eskicioglu et al 2018 metcalf and eddy inc et al 2003 wäeger baumann and fuchs 2012 nevertheless the optimisation of the materials used and recent works have shown an application of membranes for nitrogen recovery directly in digested sludge rivera et al 2022 regarding the final nitrogen based product obtained it can be contaminated by other ions present in the original substrate therefore membranes should be consider with additional steps tss cod and foreign ions removal to obtain a pure ammonia product darestani et al 2017 beckinghausen et al 2020 application of forward osmosis membrane or membrane distillation have not been found for sidestream application because of excessive fouling vu et al 2019 4 4 2 electrodialysis bioeletrochemical system ion exchange resin electrodialysis process uses an electric current to migrate ions to the cathode or anode and trap them on ion exchange membranes a concentrated ammonia or phosphate solution is obtained ward et al 2018 in bioelectrochemical systems the oxidation of organics produces electrons used as energy for the migration of nh4 ions from the anode to the cathode in order to maintain charge neutrality de fouchécour et al 2022 in the cathode chamber nh4 is transformed into nh3 thanks to the high ph value to be recovered nancharaiah et al 2016 ion exchange systems use resins which can exchange an ion adsorbed on the resin surface with a specific cation or anion in the centrate huang et al 2020 performance of these systems depend on electrode membrane and resin fouling because high calcium magnesium tss and carbonate can lead to significant deposit as calcium carbonate struvite or accumulation of colloidal particles beckinghausen et al 2020 feng et al 2017 mondor et al 2009 for the bioelectrochemical system the low cod content in sidestreams limits its development at full scale and this technology is best suitable for wastewater rather than centrate al sahari et al 2021 phosphorus adsorption is also highly dependent of ph value because it affects the surface charges of the absorbent the co existing of different ions such as so4 2 no3 and cl may inhibit p adsorption due to ions completion for the vacant adsorption sites song and li 2019 ye et al 2017 4 4 3 algae production microalgae based wastewater treatment systems can be used for the removal of organic and inorganic carbon as well as for nutrients from wastewater al momani and örmeci 2020 the main interest of this process lies in the production of a high growth rate algae biomass for biogas or biofuel production romero villegas et al 2017 the algae biomass has low carbon requirement which can be attractive for anaerobic digestion sidestreams treatment peralta et al 2019 however high content of tss can negatively impact the growth of microalgae biomass because algal biomass can then compete with other bacteria for n p and alkalinity marazzi et al 2019 another limit of this process is the design of the algae culture system as harvesting the biomass produced is still a challenging step zhao et al 2018 5 discussion the selection of processes for nutrient treatment recovery of anaerobic digestion sidestreams have been discussed based on current published information on their operation although of high importance current literature review revealed that it is challenging to define operational limits of the processes with regards to sidestream characteristics based on full scale data published data are indeed scarce and most of the time only limited characteristics were evaluated or investigated in addition it is likely that reported threshold values for sidestream characteristics leading to a decrease of process performance or to an inhibition embed the effect of other operational parameters it is therefore not excluded that process configuration the way it is operated as well as the exposition time and the acclimation of the biomass to an inhibitor highly affects the range of reported values this is especially critical when limited data are available based on literature data fig 9 presents the most important parameters to be measured before choosing a specific process comparison of the ranges of concentrations found and the list of sidestream characteristics shows that the range of concentrations from literature is large in comparison to the inhibition mentioned in the previous sections consequently installation of a pretreatment step for tss or cod removal for example can be required to ensure stable process performance nutrient recovery in sidestreams and especially in anaerobic digestion sidestreams seem promising but a well defined product with high purity is required if recovery as fertiliser is considered for example organic farmers have a need for a pure nitrogen fertiliser rather than a combination that includes p or k beckinghausen et al 2020 as seen in previous paragraphs other ions and organic matter can impact the purity of the final recovered product or the efficiency of the process to obtain these products therefore more investigations have to be carried out on the feasibility of producing a product with higher purity considering the full ionic composition of ad dewatering sidestreams shaddel et al 2019 thp can in addition to improving the performance of anaerobic digestion improve the possibilities of recovering nitrogen because the nnh4 content is higher in sidestreams compared to a conventional digester sidestream however this does not apply for p which is released as phosphate upstream of the ad through the thp but then precipitates in the digester with ca2 and mg2 the potential for p recovery upstream of ad needs to be more expanded as only a few examples exist to date bouzas et al 2019 nutrient recovery from primary sludge and biological sludge sidestreams has not been extensively explored indeed the concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen are lower than in the anaerobic digestion sidestreams however nutrient content in these sidestreams can be interesting for the recovery in some specific cases especially when there is a thickening unit with high retention time as the release of ions is stimulated in such specific context sidestreams can be joined together and the process installed on this sidestream combination latimer et al 2016 overall there is not always local demand for nitrogen or phosphorus fertiliser kehrein et al 2020 robles et al 2020 and nutrient recovery technologies need a large quantity of energy and chemicals which induces higher environmental impacts pradel and aissani 2019 future research should focus on the definition of evaluation criteria that take into account the wrrf performance effluent quality and operation costs but also the environmental impacts the efficiency of the recovery process and purity and the destination of the final product to do so there is an urgent need to develop shared databases with updated information on recovery processes including performance and operating conditions because there is a lack of information on recovery processes in real conditions puchongkawarin et al 2015 plant wide modelling could also help in the choice and comparison of different routes to treat or valorise sidestreams even if some models already include precipitation as struvite lizarralde et al 2019 or ammonia stripping vaneeckhaute et al 2018b they still need to be validated not only for the targeted nutrient but also considering the different compounds that can interact mg2 ca2 fe2 3 so4 2 k cl access to data from full scale measurement campaigns is therefore essential in order to understand the full ionic distribution in different locations in the wrrf and to integrate new mechanisms into existing models 6 conclusions sidestream processes are increasingly being optimised to mitigate their effects on the water treatment line but also to recover nutrients in water resource recovery facilities the implementation of such processes depends on sidestream characteristics ranges of concentrations of the main components observed in sidestreams at full scale have been discussed to aid in the development design and optimum operation of sidestream processes this critical review identified the following key points 1 anaerobic digestion sidestreams contribute significantly to the nitrogen 17 and phosphorus 11 mass flows at the wrrf inlet the quantity of phosphate in sidestreams depends on the type of applied phosphorus treatment with a median value of 33 mg l for chemical phosphorus removal and of 167 mg l for enhanced biological phosphorus removal 2 the concentration of cod n and alkalinity are higher in thp anaerobic digestion sidestreams than conventional anaerobic digestion however there is no difference in the phosphorus content because the phosphate release during thp is directly immobilised by others ions ca2 mg2 fe2 3 phosphorus recovery before anaerobic digestion should be considered in the presence of thp and the quantity of ca2 mg2 and fe2 3 should be quantified to assess the potential for p recovery 3 the variability of ion concentrations al3 ca2 cl fe2 3 mg2 k na so4 2 depends on 1 wastewater characteristics in particular the presence of industrial wastewater 2 the use of chemicals such as iron chloride or lime and 3 dissolution and precipitation mechanisms in thickening or dewatering unit the latter should be further investigated to better assess the impact of the full ionic composition on nutrient treatment or recovery 4 all the characteristics previously mentioned can have an impact on sidestream processes however the definition of a concentration range or threshold value to ensure the successful operation of these processes is not a straightforward task indeed the information about inhibitions is sparse in the literature and depends on a lot of different parameters reactor configuration scale biomass acclimatisation operating conditions this review provides a list of characteristics to be measured in order to select the most suitable sidestream process for each specific application 5 future research should focus on further data acquisition especially on the concentration of the different ions to better assess the potential for nutrient recovery and to minimise the economic and environmental impact of wrrfs credit authorship contribution statement perrine devos conceptualization investigation writing original draft

15024,manganese oxides mnxoy are critical for determining the environmental behaviors and fate of antimonite sb iii however little is known about the qualitative quantitative connection between mnxoy structures and sb iii fate herein the reactions of sb iii and six mnxoy with different structures were systematically investigated the initial oxidation rates of sb iii r init on six mnxoy decreased in the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 β mno2 phinitial 7 0 from 0 32 0 04 to 11 17 1 61 mmol min mol mn the amounts of antimony retained i e the sum of sb iii and antimonate sb v on these mnxoy followed the same trend as that of oxidation oxidation of sb iii released mn ii and created more sites for adsorption outwardly mnxoy with higher reduction potential e0 and specific surface area ssa favored faster sb iii oxidation inwardly mn iii and oxygen vacancies ov exhibited a synergistic effect on sb iii oxidation mn iii can easier accept electron than mn iv based on the change in gibbs free energy calculation ov can adsorb free oxygen to form surface oxygen osur which is much more reactive than lattice oxygen olatt moreover ov is in close proximity to mn iii in high valent mnxoy which facilitated the reactions between sb iii and mn iii through the enhancement of sb iii adsorption and electron transfer ov in low valent mnxoy is adjacent to mn ii thus it showed weaker enhancement than that in high valent mnxoy part of δ mno2 and almost all mn3o4 were converted to γ mnooh during their reaction with sb iii while the other four mnxoy were barely changed the results obtained provide mechanistic insight into the reactions occurring within sb iii and mnxoy which are helpful for better understanding and prediction of the fate of sb iii in mn rich environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords manganese oxides antimonite mn iii oxygen vacancies adsorption oxidation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antimony sb is a priority environmental pollutant with various valance states 3 0 3 and 5 abbasi et al 2022 the u s epa and eu have established maximum permissible sb concentrations of 6 0 and 10 μg l in drinking water directive 1980 usepa 1984 respectively in china the maximum admissible sb level in surface water used for centralized sources of drinking water is 5 0 μg l antimonite sb iii and antimonate sb v are the predominant sb species in natural environments and mainly exist in anoxic and oxic conditions respectively he et al 2012 in the natural environment sb iii and sb v mainly exist in sb oh 3 and sb oh 6 forms respectively herath et al 2017 the toxicity mobility and bioavailability of sb vary with its speciation sb iii is much more toxic than sb v but it is less mobile than sb v under natural conditions luo et al 2017 sun et al 2019 despite sb being a trace element in the earth s crust sb at elevated levels was observed in several environmental matrices as a result of human activities and natural processes he et al 2012 however there is still a mystery about the occurrence of elevated levels of sb species in environmental compartments due to the intricacies of environmental matrices and sb species manganese mn is the third most abundant crustal transition metal morgan 2000 and its oxides widely exist in soil sediment and aquatic environments feng et al 2007 manganese oxide mnxoy is the most robust mineral oxidant in the natural environment huang et al 2018 mnxoy has high reactivity for several variable valence metals and metalloid elements e g arsenic antimony chromium and thallium and strongly affects their toxicity bioavailability and fate liu et al 2020 rathi et al 2020 sun et al 2018 weaver and hochella jr 2003 the physicochemical properties and chemical reactivity of mnxoy are highly dependent on their structures liu et al 2020 weaver and hochella jr 2003 zhang et al 2017 generally mnxoy with a higher specific surface area ssa and larger tunnels can provide more adsorption sites liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 the oxidation ability of mnxoy was reported to be positively correlated with the contents of mn iii and surface adsorbed oxygen osur but negatively correlated with its crystallinity liu et al 2020 weaver and hochella jr 2003 given the distinct properties among mnxoy and the varied properties among sb species a full understanding of the interaction between mnxoy and sb is necessary to clearly elucidate the fate of sb in the environment solid evidence has shown that mnxoy is important for controlling the environmental fate of sb through coprecipitation adsorption and oxidation mechanisms belzile et al 2001 sun et al 2019 sun et al 2018 different types of mnxoy have shown different impacts on sb fate luo et al 2017 nie et al 2022 sun et al 2019 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2021 γ mnooh exhibited superiority in sb iii adsorption and oxidation than β mno2 because it has higher ssa and mn iii content wang et al 2021 α mno2 and birnessite δ mno2 and triclinic birnessite presented a stronger affinity toward sb iii than sb v due to the oxidation of sb iii luo et al 2017 sun et al 2019 reductive dissolution of birnessite and α mno2 generated mn ii and new mn iii luo et al 2017 sun et al 2019 mn ii can either neutralize the negative charges on the mnxoy surface to enhance the electrostatic adsorption of sb v or form manganese antimonate precipitates when sb is present at high levels sun et al 2019 sun et al 2018 meanwhile the interaction between mn ii and raw mnxoy could produce thermodynamically more stable mn iii oxides and hydroxides to react with sb karimian et al 2021 the end mnxoy products were highly dependent on the aqueous mn ii concentration solution ph and the presence of other metals karimian et al 2021 interestingly sb v demonstrated a concentration dependent effect on δ mno2 transformation karimian et al 2021 taken together the reaction between mnxoy and sb iii could strongly affect the sb iii fate and mnxoy structure however these previous studies were restricted to limited kinds of mnxoy luo et al 2017 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2012 e g δ mno2 α mno2 and γ mnooh and only a few of them compared the otherness of different mnxoy in determining the fate of sb nie et al 2022 wang et al 2021 moreover conflicting results were reported related to the mnxoy structure on its oxidation ability for instance there is controversy regarding which sites i e mn iv and mn iii in δ mno2 are more powerful for sb iii oxidation sun et al 2018 wang et al 2017a meanwhile the sb oxidation and adsorption ability of mnxoy were also reported to positively correlate with either their edge sites or ssa and mn iii content sun et al 2019 wang et al 2021 moreover it is also controversial whether mno2 has a stronger oxidation ability toward sb iii than mnooh since mn iii mn ii 1 50 v kostka et al 1995 has a higher redox potential than mn iv mn ii 1 29 v wang et al 2012 therefore there is still a lack of systematic understanding of the structure reactivity relationships of the reactions between mnxoy and sb iii to further explore the environmental fate of sb and develop effective mnxoy based technologies for sb remediation a systematic investigation of the mnxoy structure on the transformation of sb species and retention of sb is imperative to this end reactions occurring between sb iii and six mnxoy were studied and sb v was used for comparison typical structural parameters of six mnxoy were characterized and their effects on sb iii oxidation and sb retention were systematically evaluated meanwhile the changes in mnxoy structures during their reaction with sb iii and how these changes affected sb retention were also examined finally the obtained results were fully analyzed and compared with those in literatures to achieve a mechanistic understanding of the reaction between mnxoy and sb iii 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorption experiments the chemicals and reagents used are detailed in text s1 of the supporting information four types of high valent mnxoy mainly in mn iv mckenzie 1989 namely birnessite δ mno2 cryptomelane α mno2 and pyrolusite β mno2 and two low valent mnxoy i e without mn iv i e hausmannite mn3o4 and manganite γ mnooh were synthesized according to the literatures text s2 feng et al 2007 frierdich et al 2016 fu et al 2009 hou et al 2013 pokhrel et al 2015 adsorption experiments were conducted in 100 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes which were placed in a thermostatic reciprocating shaker in the dark the shaking speed temperature and reaction volume were set at 150 rpm 25 0 0 2 c and 50 ml respectively since the speciation of sb is ph dependent the effect of ph on adsorption was evaluated in the range of 3 0 10 8 the initial ph of 3 0 was directly adjusted using hcl ph values of 5 0 7 0 and 10 8 were obtained using acetic acid sodium acetate hac naac 3 n morpholino propane sulfonic acid mops and carbonate bicarbonate na2co3 nahco3 buffers all at 2 mm respectively hu et al 2014 shan et al 2014 sun et al 2019 since our work was mainly focused on comparing the differences in the reactions between six mnxoy and sb iii potential interferences brought by these organic buffers could barely affect our results mnxoy suspensions at predetermined concentrations were separately added to the reaction system to initiate the adsorption process specifically δ α γ mno2 at 0 5 mm mn was used and the other three mnxoy with lower adsorption ability were dosed at 1 0 mm mn for the convenience of analysis and clear illustration of adsorption after 24 h of equilibrium adsorption 10 ml of the reaction mixture was sampled centrifuged and filtered using a 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene filter ptfe the filtrates were collected and stored for the analysis of sb iii and total sb within 24 h the solid phases after centrifugation were freeze dried and stored for characterization experiments performed in the absence of mnxoy were used as controls to monitor the potential oxidation of sb iii by dissolved oxygen and sb iii precipitation mn2 at 0 01 5 0 mm was spiked into the reaction system to evaluate its role in sb adsorption all experiments were repeated for three times 2 2 oxidation experiments oxidation experiments were carried out at a reaction volume of 200 ml in 250 ml beakers wrapped with a tinfoil to shield the light the reaction mixtures were magnetically stirred constantly at 500 rpm the initial sb iii concentration and reaction temperature were set at 8 2 μm and 25 0 0 2 c respectively for the convenience of analysis and clear illustration of oxidation the initial concentrations of mnxoy were fixed at 64 0 μm mn except for β mno2 128 0 μm mn was used the effects of ph on oxidation were studied in the range of 3 0 10 8 the same as those in adsorption experiments 2 0 ml of the reaction mixture was regularly collected from the reaction system of which 1 0 ml sample was quenched by 1 0 ml 0 1 m na2c2o4 ph 2 2 for the determination of total sb iii and sb v in the reaction system abbreviated as sb iii t and sb v t respectively belzile et al 2001 sun et al 2018 na2c2o4 barely affected the distributions of sb species in the reaction mixtures data not shown belzile et al 2001 sun et al 2018 the other 1 0 ml sample was filtered directly to analyze sb iii and sb v in the aqueous phase abbreviated sb iii aq and sb v aq respectively all samples were analyzed within 24 h the dynamic distributions of sb iii and sb v in the liquid and solid phases were calculated via mass balance to further elucidate the roles of mn iii and ov on sb iii oxidation α mno2 with different contents of mn iii and ov were used for oxidizing sb iii in ph 7 0 buffer 2 3 analytical characterization and calculation methods analytical methods for sb species total sb k and mn in the aqueous phase methods to characterize the changes in the structural properties of mnxoy before and after their reaction with sb iii and the distribution characteristics of sb on the mnxoy surfaces are presented in text s3 calculation methods for the relative oxygen vacancy ov concentration and average oxidation state aos of mn are listed in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mnxoy fig 1 a1 a6 show the xrd patterns of six mnxoy the exact matching of characteristic peaks with those of the standard materials suggests the successful preparation of δ mno2 jcpds 86 0666 ponnusamy et al 2019 α mno2 jcpds 44 0141 wang et al 2020 γ mno2 jcpds 14 0644 fu et al 2009 β mno2 jcpds 24 0735 liu et al 2020 mn3o4 jcpds 24 0734 feng et al 2007 and γ mnooh jcpds 41 1379 frierdich et al 2016 fig 1 a1 a6 their structural parameters including the tunnel size crystal system and unit cell are detailed in table s1 the morphologies of all mnxoy were obtained through sem and tem analyses fig 1 b1 b6 c1 c6 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mno2 β mno2 mn3o4 and γ mnooh show spherical structures consisting of a hierarchical structure of nanosheets with a thickness dendritic nanostructure sea urchin structure consisting of interlaced urchin spines rod like structures irregular lumpy morphology and needle and fibrous features respectively fig 1 b1 b6 c1 c6 consistent with those in the literatures frierdich et al 2016 huang et al 2019a liu et al 2020 lattice fringes at interplanar spacings of 0 71 0 69 0 39 0 31 and 0 19 0 24 and 0 34 nm on hr tem images suggested that the crystal planes on δ mno2 α mno2 γ mno2 β mno2 mn3o4 and γ mnooh are 003 110 120 110 and 210 211 and 11 1 respectively fig 1 d1 d6 huang et al 2019a huang et al 2019b yang et al 2019 details regarding these characterizations are shown in text s5 relative contents of mn species i e mn iv mn iii and mn ii for each mnxoy were calculated based on the mn 2p3 2 xps spectra fig 1 e1 e6 a series of multiplet peaks other than signal peaks were used to curve fit the mn states to guarantee the reliable results of mn species distribution banerjee and nesbitt 1999 specifically these mn 2p3 2 multiplet peaks at the half maximum were assigned the same full width and these peaks were fitted using a peak shape of 70 30 gaussian lorentzian banerjee and nesbitt 1999 the binding energies of these mn 2p3 2 multiplet peaks were referred to the literature banerjee and nesbitt 1999 and these peaks were fixed at the same relative intensities the aos of these mnxoy were calculated by mn 3s spectra fitting huang et al 2018 and then these values were compared with those obtained by chemical titration and lbb leucoberbelin blue colorimetric methods zhu et al 2017 table s2 and fig s1 one way analysis of variance shows the results obtained by the three methods have no significant differences with each other the aos obtained for all mnxoy were lower than their stoichiometric values suggesting the presence of structural defects huang et al 2019a liu et al 2020 ponnusamy et al 2019 two kinds of oxygen were observed in the o 1s xps spectrum fig 1 f1 f6 and table s2 namely lattice oxygen species olatt 529 2 530 8 ev and surface chemisorbed oxygen species osur 531 0 532 6 ev huang et al 2018 ponnusamy et al 2019 the content of osur which is indicative of the extent of surface oxygen defects wang et al 2020 on δ α γ mno2 being higher than that on the other mnxoy table s2 other properties of these mnxoy are summarized in table s2 and figures s2 s4 including specific surface area ssa isoelectric point phiep reduction potential e0 and oxygen vacancies ov how these physiochemical parameters affect their reactions with sb iii will be discussed in the later section 3 2 apparent adsorption of sb iii on mnxoy sb iii was barely oxidized and precipitated in the absence of mnxoy under our experimental conditions fig s5 since the oxidation of sb iii by mnxoy and the release of sb v occurred simultaneously with sb iii adsorption apparent adsorption was used to evaluate the overall amounts of sb species retained on mnxoy surfaces during the reactions between sb iii and mnxoy the apparent adsorption of sb iii on mnxoy at ph 3 0 10 8 is shown in fig 2 the langmuir isotherm model was used to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity q m of six mnxoy towards sb iii to compare their differences on sb retention table s3 and fig 2 the ssa of all mnxoy covers three orders of magnitude indicating that varied degrees of agglomeration might exist within these mnxoy thus q m was normalized to mn content rather than ssa sb iii exists mainly as h3sbo3 at ph 3 0 10 8 herath et al 2017 the apparent adsorption of sb iii changed with ph suggesting that the oxidation of sb iii to sb v occurred wang et al 2021 much more sb v was observed in the δ α γ mno2 system than in the other systems figs s6 s7 and table s4 the mount of sb iii oxidized at the end of reaction decreased with the increasing ph figs s6 s7 sb v exists mainly as a monovalent anion sb oh 6 in ph 3 0 solution herath et al 2017 its adsorption on mnxoy should decrease with the increasing ph due to the increased electrostatic repulsion sun et al 2018 as expected the apparent adsorption capacities of γ mnooh mn3o4 and β mno2 decreased with the increasing ph because a smaller amount of sb iii was oxidized to sb v than that of δ α γ mno2 fig 2 and table s3 for the other mnxoy the apparent adsorption capacities increased with the increasing ph fig 2 and table s3 the causes could be explained by the reductive dissolution of mnxoy much more mn was released into aqueous phase at the end of reaction at ph 7 0 fig s8 which might lead to the destruction of the main structure of δ α γ mno2 as a consequence ssa and active sites on δ α γ mno2 could be lower at ph 7 0 than at ph 7 0 meanwhile mn ii precipitates forms more easily at higher ph which can create new sites for sb adsorption in addition mn ii can neutralize the negative charge on mnxoy surfaces to reduce electrostatic repulsion between mnxoy and sb v and can also form mn iv o mn ii sb oh 6 complexes and antimonate precipitates with sb v to enhance sb retention the amount of sb v reteined increased with the externally added mn ii fig s9 confirming the critical role of mn ii in adsorption hence the apparent adsorption of sb iii on δ α γ mno2 increased with the increasing ph the adsorption capacity of mnxoy positively correlated with its ssa at ph 7 0 and 10 8 fig s10 and tables s2 s3 the apparent adsorption capacities for mnxoy decreased in the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 β mno2 at ph of 7 0 from 528 98 111 51 to 10 92 0 87 mmol mol mn table s3 higher ssa facilitated the adsorption of pb ii and tl i by mnxoy with different structures were also documented liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 at lower ph 5 0 much more sb iii was oxidized to sb v figs s6 s7 and table s4 and the amount of sb reteined decreased in the order of δ mno2 α mno2 γ mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 β mno2 fig 2 and table s3 much more mn was dissolved into aqueous phase in γ mno2 system than in δ α mno2 system at ph 3 0 and 5 0 figure s8 resulting in a more significant decrease in its ssa than δ α mno2 wei et al 2019 moreover δ mno2 exhibits a layered structure the reductive dissolution of mn could continuously generate new edge sites to adsorb sb rathi et al 2020 sun et al 2018 both causes resulted in the lower adsorption of γ mno2 than δ α mno2 fig 2 and table s3 the oxidation of sb iii by mnxoy will be discussed in detail later 3 3 oxidation of sb iii on mnxoy fig 3 shows the evolution of sb species as well as their distributions during the oxidation of sb iii on mnxoy sb v concentration in the system increased rapidly in the first 10 min and gradually reached equilibrium in the next 80 min which could be attributed to the passivation of mnxoy surfaces resulting from the adsorption of sb mainly sb v fig 3 sun et al 2018 sb v remaining on mnxoy surfaces was lower than that in aqueous phase at all ph except for α mno2 at ph 10 8 fig 3 suggesting the easy release of sb v from the mnxoy surface the recognized initial rate method was applied to quantify the initial oxidation rate of sb iii r init on mnxoy since mn directly participated in the reaction with sb iii r init values were all normalized by mn content r init decreased with increasing ph fig 4 the following aspects were involved first the protonation of mnxoy accelerated electron transfer and enhanced the coordination reaction on the surface driehans et al 1995 meanwhile h is the reactant in the oxidation process eqs 1 3 and lower ph can provide more h sun et al 2018 1 mno2 h3sbo3 h mn2 h2sbo4 h2o 2 mn3o4 h3sbo3 5h 3mn2 h2sbo4 3h2o 3 2mnooh h3sbo3 3h 2mn2 h2sbo4 3h2o moreover more mn was dissolved from mnxoy at lower ph figure s11 resulting in the formation of more active sites for adsorption and oxidation luo et al 2017 sun et al 2019 according to charge balance the reaction between sb iii and mn3o4 should release more mn ii than other mnxoy in accordance with the experimental results fig s11 r init calculated for the oxidation of sb iii on mnxoy at ph 5 0 and 7 0 followed the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 β mno2 table s5 the highest r init 11 17 1 61 mmol min mol mn at ph 7 0 was approximately 18 times the lowest one 0 32 0 04 mmol min mol mn fig 4 suggesting the critical roles of structural properties on the oxidation of mnxoy previous studies reported that the oxidation ability of mnxoy was highly related to one or several structural parameters i e ssa reduction potential osur ov aos mn iii and mn iv huang et al 2019a liu et al 2020 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the connections between the structural properties of mnxoy and their abilities to oxidize sb iii will be discussed in detail in the subsequent section 3 4 connections between the mnxoy structure and sb iii oxidation 3 4 1 effects of reduction potential and specific surface area oxidant with higher reduction potential e0 generally exhibits stronger oxidation ability former studies documented that mnxoy with higher e0 showed faster oxidation of phenol and 2 mercaptobenzo thiazole liu et al 2009a ukrainczyk and mcbride 1992 therefore e0 of the six mnxoy was determined using cyclic voltammetry method and the results are presented in fig s4 e0 of all mnxoy decreased in the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 β mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 fig s4 except for β mno2 r init in the other five mnxoy systems was positively correlated with their e0 fig s12a the lowest r init in β mno2 could be explained by the much lower ssa than that of other mnxoy 3 50 vs 24 97 103 05 m2 g table s2 which hindered its reaction with sb iii the rate of atrazine and 2 mercaptobenzo thiazole degradation by different mnxoy were reported to increase with ssa liu et al 2009a shin and cheney 2004 it is expected that larger ssa could provide more active sites for the reaction liu et al 2009a shin and cheney 2004 to eliminate the interference brought by ssa all r init were then normalized by ssa fig s12b β mno2 with the lowest ssa exhibited the highest r init per ssa among the six mnxoy in other words the unit ssa of β mno2 contained more mn than the other mnxoy fig s12b thus mnxoy with both of higher e0 and ssa could show more robust performance on sb iii oxidation 3 4 2 effects of oxygen species as illustrated in eq 1 3 oxygen species osur and olatt in mnxoy can act as reactants to take part in the reactions between mnxoy and sb iii therefore the reactivities of oxygen species could potentially affect sb iii oxidation because of the higher mobility of osur than olatt it has been reported to play a significant role in the direct oxidation of sulfamethoxazole and toluene by different mnxoy wan et al 2015 meanwhile it was also documented that mnxoy with higher olatt contents exhibited stronger oxidation ability toward vocs at high temperature in air in which olatt could be replenished by o2 santos et al 2010 however the replenishment of olatt is hard to occur in aqueous solutions at room temperature wang et al 2020 that is to say osur could be more reactive than olatt to participate in the reaction in solutions as expected higher r init occurred in mnxoy with higher osur and lower olatt contents fig 5a b the relative contents of osur and olatt were calculated based on the deconvolution of o1s xps fig 1 f1 f6 and table s2 o2 tpd was further conducted to evaluate the mobility of oxygen species in mnxoy fig 5c in which o2 desorbed at temperatures of 400 400 700 and 700 c were assigned to surface active oxygen subsurface lattice oxygen and bulk lattice oxygen respectively wang et al 2020 the higher the osur content of mnxoy the lower the desorption temperature of the first reduction peak in the o2 tpd spectra wang et al 2020 the temperature for the first reduction peaks of mnxoy increased in the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 β mno2 from 378 to 553 c fig 5c indicating that osur contents decreased in the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 β mno2 in consistent with the xps results similar findings were observed in the catalytic transformation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and toluene on mnxoy with different structures i e mnxoy with lower desorption temperature of oxygen species which suggested more osur were shown greater reactivities wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 moreover osur on mnxoy can accept electrons to form superoxide radicals o2 to enhance the oxidation wang et al 2020 we speculated that mnxoy with higher osur could have a higher potential to generate o2 as expected the intensities representing the formation of o2 in the epr spectrum i e dmpoooh signal decreased in the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 fig 5d the absence of dmpoooh signal for β mno2 could be attributed to its lowest osur content among all mnxoy fig 5d moreover quenching experiments were performed to further investigate the role of o2 in sb iii oxidation sod was used as the scavenger of o2 the presence of sod slightly inhibited the oxidation of o2 in δ α γ mno2 systems suggesting the role of o2 fig s13a s13c however the presence of sod barely affected sb iii oxidation in other mnxoy fig s13d s13f due to the lower amount of o2 generated in accordance with the epr results altogether these results consistently suggested the role of osur in sb iii oxidation however it should be noted that osur is formed by the capture of free oxygen by ov generated by structural defects zhang et al 2019 and osur content depends on ov as expected the osur content was positively correlated with the ov content in six mnxoy fig 5e our results were similar with the catalytic transformation of pahs on five mnxoy that a higher content of ov favored faster degradation of pahs by adsorbing more oxygen to form osur wang et al 2020 likewise it is reasonable that r init showed a good positive relationship with the ov content of six mnxoy fig 5f suggesting the important role of ov in sb iii oxidation 3 4 3 effects of aos and mn species the aos of mn in mnxoy is an important indicator for its oxidative reactivity for instance liu et al 2009b found that mno2 with higher aos showed stronger oxidation ability toward sulfadiazine while other reports demonstrated that lower aos of mnxoy facilitated the faster oxidation of cr iii tl i bisphenol a and pahs huang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 weaver and hochella jr 2003 however r init was not positively negatively correlated with aos as expected fig 6 a r init of high valent mnxoy i e δ α γ and β mno2 were found to be negatively correlated with aos while that in low valent mnxoy i e mn3o4 and γ mnooh showed the opposite rule fig 6a as we know more mn iii mn ii leads to lower aos mn iii has been documented to play a role in the oxidation of cr iii thallium i bisphenol a and pahs by different mno2 huang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 weaver and hochella jr 2003 therefore relationships between the content of mn species and r init were evaluated figs 6b and s14 r init for low valent mnxoy were negatively correlated with mn ii content which was predictable since mn ii could barely oxidize sb iii fig s14a while r init was found to be positively correlated with the mn ii content in four high valent mnxoy fig s14a and it was negatively correlated with the mn vi content fig s14b because mn iii and mn ii generally appear together with ov in high valent mnxoy mn4 o2 mn4 mn3 mn2 ov mn3 mn2 1 2 o2 and the redox potential of mn iii is higher than that of mn iv 1 50 vs 1 29 v kostka et al 1995 wang et al 2012 these results suggested that mn iii could play a critical role in sb iii oxidation as expected r init for high valent and low valent mnxoy was positively correlated with the mn iii content respectively fig 6b mn iii oxides complexes are robust for oxidizing various contaminants huang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 mn iii has d4 ions in the t2g 3eg 1 state and because of the jahn teller effect caused by antibonding eg 1 electron fig s15 mn iii o bond is longer than mn iv o nico and zasoski 2000 robinson et al 2013 ukrainczyk and mcbride 1992 thus mn iii could directly accept an electron by direct coordination with pollutants without changing the mn spin state t2g 3eg 1 t2g 3eg 2 but the electron transfer between mn vi and pollutants requires a change in mn spin state t2g 3 t2g 3eg 2 nico and zasoski 2000 robinson et al 2013 ukrainczyk and mcbride 1992 moreover we calculated the changes in the standard gibbs free energies δg for mn iv and mn iii to form mn iii and mn ii respectively marcus and sutin 1985 the change in δg obtained for mn iv to accept an electron to form mn iii mn iv e mn iii e0 0 95 v is 91 66 kj mol v which is much higher than that of mn iii mn iii e mn ii e0 1 50 v i e 144 73 kj mol v further confirming that mn iii accepts electron more readily than mn iv kostka et al 1995 wang et al 2012 meanwhile we found that low valent mnxoy with more mn iii showed slower oxidation toward sb iii than high valent mnxoy fig 6b this contradictory result could be explained as follows mn iii in high valent mnxoy is formed from the structural defects along with ov to maintain the electrostatic balance of mnxoy mn4 o2 mn4 mn3 mn2 ov mn3 mn2 1 2 o2 thus mn iii is expected to be infinitely close to ov ov could provide a dangling bond to facilitate sb iii adsorption which increased the probability of collision between sb iii and mn iii and thus promoted their reaction wang et al 2017b meanwhile the local electric field formed around ov is expected to accelerate electron transfer between sb iii and mn iii zhang et al 2021 however ov in low valent mnxoy coexists with mn ii mn3 o2 mn3 mn2 ov mn2 1 2 o2 li et al 2021 which could hardly to achieve the comparable effect on mn iii as that in high valent mnxoy wang et al 2020 a previous study also documented that mnxoy with mixed valence of mn iii iv exhibited a more robust oxidizing ability than mnxoy without mn iv huang et al 2018 meanwhile the mn iii content decreased in low valent mnxoy as expected after the reaction while in high valent mnxoy the relative mn iii content increased table s7 and fig s16 similar to the oxidation of tl i by mno2 liu et al 2020 this result could be explained by the disproportionated reactions occurred within the mn species mn iv mn ii 2mn iii and sb iii oxidation by mn iv 2mn iv sb iii 2mn iii sb v karimian et al 2021 moreover h2 temperature programmed reduction h2 tpr was performed to further compare the reactivity of six mnxoy fig 6c peak at lower temperature is attributed to the reduction of mno2 to mn2o3 and then to mn3o4 while peak at higher temperature is due to the reduction of mn3o4 to mno wang et al 2017c the h2 tpr spectra of γ mno2 and β mno2 showed two characteristic peaks at 267 and 326 c and at 326 and 434 c respectively fig 6c two peaks on that of δ mno2 and α mno2 overlapped at the ranges of 270 330 c fig 6c which could be explained by the simultaneous reductions of mn iv and mn iii species wang et al 2017c because the absence of mn iv only one peak was observed for mn3o4 at 402 c and γ mnooh at 394 c respectively fig 6c the lower temperature of the first reduction peak suggests the higher oxidative activity of mnxoy wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 thus the oxidative activities of six mnxoy could be ordered as γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 β mno2 based on the h2 tpr results fig 6c which was consistent with our former results huang et al 2018 also reported that high valent mnxoy with mixed valence of mn iii iv was more reactive than low valent mnxoy i e mnooh and mn2o3 for bisphenol a degradation h2 consumption was then calculated to evaluate the relative contents of mn species in all mnxoy high valent mnxoy with more mn iii could consume less h2 while that of low valent mnxoy could consume more h2 according to the charge balance calculation the total h2 consumption for the reduction of mn3o4 γ mnooh γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 and β mno2 was 5 47 6 78 10 41 11 54 12 53 and 14 68 mmol g respectively this result is consistent with the mn iii content calculated by xps analysis that is the mn iii content in high valent mnxoy decreased by the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 β mno2 and the mn iii content in γ mnooh was higher than that in mn3o4 table s2 finally three α mno2 with different contents of mn iii and ov were synthesized to further verify the roles of mn iii and ov in the oxidation of sb iii figs s17 s18 and table s6 hou et al 2013 it s exciting that the oxidation of sb iii on the three new α mno2 exhibited the same rules as the former four high valent mnxoy figs 5 a b e f and 6b which further supported the critical role of mn iii and ov in sb iii oxidation taken together connections between the physicochemical properties of mnxoy and their abilities to oxidize sb iii can be concluded as follows outwardly mnxoy with higher e0 and ssa has a more robust ability for sb iii oxidation inwardly because mn iii is more reactive than mn iv and ov can adsorb oxygen to form osur provide a dangling bond to enhance sb iii adsorption and enhance electron transfer mn iii and ov together play the critical role in determining the oxidation ability of mnxoy moreover ov in high valent mnxoy is in close proximity with mn iii which makes mn iii react with sb iii more easily resulting in faster sb iii oxidation in high valent mnxoy than that in low valent mnxoy 3 5 evolution of mnxoy structures the structures of mnxoy after their reaction with sb iii were characterized and compared with those of the raw mnxoy two main peaks i e at 83 9 0 8 and 89 0 0 5 ev on mn 3s spectrum for all mnxoy were shifted after the reaction fig s19 suggesting changes in the mn valence distribution because more mn was reduced by sb iii in δ α γ β mno2 than in mn3o4 and γ mnooh the drop in aos in the former was more obvious than that in the latter fig s19 and table s7 oxidation of sb iii increased the mn iii and mn ii contents while decreasing the mn vi content in δ α γ β mno2 fig s19 and table s7 for mn3o4 and γ mnooh the mn vi content increased at the end of the reaction due to mn iii disproportionation these results suggested electron transfer within mn species in mnxoy liu et al 2020 characteristic peaks in the xrd pattern of δ mno2 at d spacings of 7 10 3 59 and 1 42 å disappeared or weakened after the reaction suggesting the reaction might mainly occur on 003 006 and 110 planes fig 7 a1 meanwhile nanowires of groutite α mnooh and manganite γ mnooh were generated fig 7 a1 which was further confirmed by tem analysis fig 7 b1 c1 karimian et al 2021 the results of edx elemental mapping suggested that sb was mostly enriched on the δ mno2 surface while a smaller part was distributed on the surface of newly generated γ mnooh fig 7 d1 dissolution of mn from mnxoy could lead to lattice distortion nie et al 2022 characteristic peaks in the xrd patterns of α mno2 and γ mno2 were shifted to lower diffraction angles after the reaction fig 7 a2 a3 the morphology of α mno2 barely changed while the sea urchin shape of γ mno2 became loose fig 7 b2 c2 b3 c3 sb was uniformly distributed on the surface of α mno2 and γ mno2 fig 7 d2 d3 oxidation of sb iii showed little effect on the crystal structure and morphology of β mno2 and γ mnooh fig 7 a4 a6 b4 b6 c4 c6 and sb was uniformly distributed on their surface fig 7 d4 d6 mn3o4 was converted to γ mnooh fig 7 a5 b5 c5 and sb were mainly located at the γ mnooh surface fig 7 d5 the following aspects were involved in the structural transformation of mnxoy mn ii on the δ mno2 surface can donate one electron to mn iv mn2 mn iv o2 2h2o 2mn iii ooh 2h resulting in the formation of mn iii hydroxides karimian et al 2021 mn ii can compete with sb for edge sites resulting in more mn ii being embedded into the structural defects and cationic vacancies of δ mno2 which facilitates the transformation of δ mno2 to mn iii containing minerals karimian et al 2021 meanwhile mnxoy can catalyze the oxidation of mn ii adsorbed on its surface by o2 mn2 1 6o2 aq h2o 1 3 mn3o4 2h lind 1988 moreover because mn iii protonation mn3o4 was transformed to γ mnooh mn3o4 2h γ mnooh mn2 lind 1988 ftir analysis was performed to elucidate the mechanisms of sb binding on mnxoy fig s20 characteristic peaks at 400 800 cm 1 in all mnxoy were assigned to vibrations of mn o and mn o mn fig s20a s20f zhong et al 2020 peaks at 1630 and 3500 cm 1 were attributed to the bending vibration of mn oh and stretching vibration of oh in water respectively fig s20a s20f li et al 2021 meanwhile peaks at 1082 1116 and 1156 cm 1 represented the bending vibration of oh in the γ oh δ 2 oh and δ 1 oh modes in γ mnooh respectively fig s2f li et al 2021 peaks at 1630 and 3430 cm 1 on all mnxoy were shifted after the reaction suggesting that the oh group may participate in sb adsorption via surface complexation mechanisms sun et al 2018 xu et al 2011 meanwhile the shift at the peak of 1105 cm 1 which represented the deformation vibration of δ oh on sb v confirmed the involvement of oh in adsorption fig s20 mccomb et al 2007 sun et al 2019 because the vibration signals of ν sb o bands 500 700 cm 1 overlapped with those of ν mn o 400 700 cm 1 ν sb o was not detected fig s20 mccomb et al 2007 xu et al 2011 moreover the presence of peaks at 1087 1117 and 1151 cm 1 which were attributed to bending vibration oh in γ mnooh on mn3o4 after the reaction suggested partial transformation of mn3o4 to γ mnooh figure s20e li et al 2021 which is consistent with the xrd and tem results 3 6 oxidation mechanisms possible mechanisms of sb iii oxidation on mnxoy were elucidated based on the results obtained in this work and literature results four potential electron transfer patterns were involved in δ α γ mno2 systems fig 8 sb iii can directly donate two electrons to one mn iv sb iii mn vi sb v mn ii pattern 1 wang et al 2021 or two mn vi sb iii 2mn vi sb v 2mn iii pattern 2 wang et al 2021 mn iii can also act as an electron acceptor to accept electron from sb iii sb iii 2mn iii sb v 2mn ii pattern 3 nie et al 2022 finally mn iv and mn iii around ov accept one electron from sb iii mn iv mn iii sb iii ov sb v mn ii aq mn iii pattern 4 nie et al 2022 released mn ii can reabsorb onto mnxoy to enhance sb v adsorption through the cation bridge effect sun et al 2018 mn ii adsorbed on the mn iv site can generate two new mn iii sites through a comproportionation reaction fig 8a karimian et al 2021 moreover the coexistence of sb v and mn ii in a molar ratio of 2 1 also has the potential to form mnsb2o6 fig 8b johnson et al 2013 however mnsb2o6 was not observed in this work due to the low concentrations of sb iii and mn used patterns 1 2 and 4 were involved in β mno2 fig 8 while pattern 3 was the only route in γ mnooh and mn3o4 fig 8 meanwhile the o2 formed was also involved in sb iii oxidation in the δ α γ mno2 systems fig 8 4 conclusions mnxoy is an important factor that controls the geochemical cycles of metal and metalloid elements in the environment mnxoy with different structures show significant variations in their geochemical properties however how the structural properties of mnxoy affect the geochemical behavior of sb iii is still under dispute herein we compared the reactions occurring between sb iii and six mnxoy and demonstrated the strong connection between the geochemical behavior of sb iii and the mnxoy structure apparently mnxoy with higher e0 and ssa favored faster oxidation of sb iii low valent mnxoy i e mn3o4 and γ mnooh exhibited much lower adsorption and oxidation ability than high valent mnxoy i e δ α and γ mno2 mn iii and ov exhibited a synergistic effect on sb iii oxidation higher contents of ov is in close proximity to mn iii in high valent mnxoy which facilitated the reaction between mn iii and sb iii by enhancing sb iii adsorption and electron transfer meanwhile ov could adsorb free oxygen to form osur which has a much higher reactivity than olatt to enhance the oxidation of sb iii ov in low valent mnxoy is adjacent to mn ii which exhibited a weaker synergistic effect on improving the reactivity in low valent mnxoy the oxidation of sb iii to sb v by mnxoy reduced its toxicity but increased its mobility therefore the oxidation of sb iii to sb v might increase the bioavailability of sb to plants in environmental settings rich in δ α or γ mno2 however the toxicity of sb to microorganisms and geobionts should gain more attention in environments containing β mno2 mn3o4 or γ mnooh because a certain proportion of sb iii might still exist this study furthers our understanding of the structure reactivity relationships between mnxoy and sb iii and may provide novel insight into designing mn based materials for removing sb in aqueous environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15024,manganese oxides mnxoy are critical for determining the environmental behaviors and fate of antimonite sb iii however little is known about the qualitative quantitative connection between mnxoy structures and sb iii fate herein the reactions of sb iii and six mnxoy with different structures were systematically investigated the initial oxidation rates of sb iii r init on six mnxoy decreased in the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 β mno2 phinitial 7 0 from 0 32 0 04 to 11 17 1 61 mmol min mol mn the amounts of antimony retained i e the sum of sb iii and antimonate sb v on these mnxoy followed the same trend as that of oxidation oxidation of sb iii released mn ii and created more sites for adsorption outwardly mnxoy with higher reduction potential e0 and specific surface area ssa favored faster sb iii oxidation inwardly mn iii and oxygen vacancies ov exhibited a synergistic effect on sb iii oxidation mn iii can easier accept electron than mn iv based on the change in gibbs free energy calculation ov can adsorb free oxygen to form surface oxygen osur which is much more reactive than lattice oxygen olatt moreover ov is in close proximity to mn iii in high valent mnxoy which facilitated the reactions between sb iii and mn iii through the enhancement of sb iii adsorption and electron transfer ov in low valent mnxoy is adjacent to mn ii thus it showed weaker enhancement than that in high valent mnxoy part of δ mno2 and almost all mn3o4 were converted to γ mnooh during their reaction with sb iii while the other four mnxoy were barely changed the results obtained provide mechanistic insight into the reactions occurring within sb iii and mnxoy which are helpful for better understanding and prediction of the fate of sb iii in mn rich environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords manganese oxides antimonite mn iii oxygen vacancies adsorption oxidation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antimony sb is a priority environmental pollutant with various valance states 3 0 3 and 5 abbasi et al 2022 the u s epa and eu have established maximum permissible sb concentrations of 6 0 and 10 μg l in drinking water directive 1980 usepa 1984 respectively in china the maximum admissible sb level in surface water used for centralized sources of drinking water is 5 0 μg l antimonite sb iii and antimonate sb v are the predominant sb species in natural environments and mainly exist in anoxic and oxic conditions respectively he et al 2012 in the natural environment sb iii and sb v mainly exist in sb oh 3 and sb oh 6 forms respectively herath et al 2017 the toxicity mobility and bioavailability of sb vary with its speciation sb iii is much more toxic than sb v but it is less mobile than sb v under natural conditions luo et al 2017 sun et al 2019 despite sb being a trace element in the earth s crust sb at elevated levels was observed in several environmental matrices as a result of human activities and natural processes he et al 2012 however there is still a mystery about the occurrence of elevated levels of sb species in environmental compartments due to the intricacies of environmental matrices and sb species manganese mn is the third most abundant crustal transition metal morgan 2000 and its oxides widely exist in soil sediment and aquatic environments feng et al 2007 manganese oxide mnxoy is the most robust mineral oxidant in the natural environment huang et al 2018 mnxoy has high reactivity for several variable valence metals and metalloid elements e g arsenic antimony chromium and thallium and strongly affects their toxicity bioavailability and fate liu et al 2020 rathi et al 2020 sun et al 2018 weaver and hochella jr 2003 the physicochemical properties and chemical reactivity of mnxoy are highly dependent on their structures liu et al 2020 weaver and hochella jr 2003 zhang et al 2017 generally mnxoy with a higher specific surface area ssa and larger tunnels can provide more adsorption sites liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 the oxidation ability of mnxoy was reported to be positively correlated with the contents of mn iii and surface adsorbed oxygen osur but negatively correlated with its crystallinity liu et al 2020 weaver and hochella jr 2003 given the distinct properties among mnxoy and the varied properties among sb species a full understanding of the interaction between mnxoy and sb is necessary to clearly elucidate the fate of sb in the environment solid evidence has shown that mnxoy is important for controlling the environmental fate of sb through coprecipitation adsorption and oxidation mechanisms belzile et al 2001 sun et al 2019 sun et al 2018 different types of mnxoy have shown different impacts on sb fate luo et al 2017 nie et al 2022 sun et al 2019 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2021 γ mnooh exhibited superiority in sb iii adsorption and oxidation than β mno2 because it has higher ssa and mn iii content wang et al 2021 α mno2 and birnessite δ mno2 and triclinic birnessite presented a stronger affinity toward sb iii than sb v due to the oxidation of sb iii luo et al 2017 sun et al 2019 reductive dissolution of birnessite and α mno2 generated mn ii and new mn iii luo et al 2017 sun et al 2019 mn ii can either neutralize the negative charges on the mnxoy surface to enhance the electrostatic adsorption of sb v or form manganese antimonate precipitates when sb is present at high levels sun et al 2019 sun et al 2018 meanwhile the interaction between mn ii and raw mnxoy could produce thermodynamically more stable mn iii oxides and hydroxides to react with sb karimian et al 2021 the end mnxoy products were highly dependent on the aqueous mn ii concentration solution ph and the presence of other metals karimian et al 2021 interestingly sb v demonstrated a concentration dependent effect on δ mno2 transformation karimian et al 2021 taken together the reaction between mnxoy and sb iii could strongly affect the sb iii fate and mnxoy structure however these previous studies were restricted to limited kinds of mnxoy luo et al 2017 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2012 e g δ mno2 α mno2 and γ mnooh and only a few of them compared the otherness of different mnxoy in determining the fate of sb nie et al 2022 wang et al 2021 moreover conflicting results were reported related to the mnxoy structure on its oxidation ability for instance there is controversy regarding which sites i e mn iv and mn iii in δ mno2 are more powerful for sb iii oxidation sun et al 2018 wang et al 2017a meanwhile the sb oxidation and adsorption ability of mnxoy were also reported to positively correlate with either their edge sites or ssa and mn iii content sun et al 2019 wang et al 2021 moreover it is also controversial whether mno2 has a stronger oxidation ability toward sb iii than mnooh since mn iii mn ii 1 50 v kostka et al 1995 has a higher redox potential than mn iv mn ii 1 29 v wang et al 2012 therefore there is still a lack of systematic understanding of the structure reactivity relationships of the reactions between mnxoy and sb iii to further explore the environmental fate of sb and develop effective mnxoy based technologies for sb remediation a systematic investigation of the mnxoy structure on the transformation of sb species and retention of sb is imperative to this end reactions occurring between sb iii and six mnxoy were studied and sb v was used for comparison typical structural parameters of six mnxoy were characterized and their effects on sb iii oxidation and sb retention were systematically evaluated meanwhile the changes in mnxoy structures during their reaction with sb iii and how these changes affected sb retention were also examined finally the obtained results were fully analyzed and compared with those in literatures to achieve a mechanistic understanding of the reaction between mnxoy and sb iii 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorption experiments the chemicals and reagents used are detailed in text s1 of the supporting information four types of high valent mnxoy mainly in mn iv mckenzie 1989 namely birnessite δ mno2 cryptomelane α mno2 and pyrolusite β mno2 and two low valent mnxoy i e without mn iv i e hausmannite mn3o4 and manganite γ mnooh were synthesized according to the literatures text s2 feng et al 2007 frierdich et al 2016 fu et al 2009 hou et al 2013 pokhrel et al 2015 adsorption experiments were conducted in 100 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes which were placed in a thermostatic reciprocating shaker in the dark the shaking speed temperature and reaction volume were set at 150 rpm 25 0 0 2 c and 50 ml respectively since the speciation of sb is ph dependent the effect of ph on adsorption was evaluated in the range of 3 0 10 8 the initial ph of 3 0 was directly adjusted using hcl ph values of 5 0 7 0 and 10 8 were obtained using acetic acid sodium acetate hac naac 3 n morpholino propane sulfonic acid mops and carbonate bicarbonate na2co3 nahco3 buffers all at 2 mm respectively hu et al 2014 shan et al 2014 sun et al 2019 since our work was mainly focused on comparing the differences in the reactions between six mnxoy and sb iii potential interferences brought by these organic buffers could barely affect our results mnxoy suspensions at predetermined concentrations were separately added to the reaction system to initiate the adsorption process specifically δ α γ mno2 at 0 5 mm mn was used and the other three mnxoy with lower adsorption ability were dosed at 1 0 mm mn for the convenience of analysis and clear illustration of adsorption after 24 h of equilibrium adsorption 10 ml of the reaction mixture was sampled centrifuged and filtered using a 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene filter ptfe the filtrates were collected and stored for the analysis of sb iii and total sb within 24 h the solid phases after centrifugation were freeze dried and stored for characterization experiments performed in the absence of mnxoy were used as controls to monitor the potential oxidation of sb iii by dissolved oxygen and sb iii precipitation mn2 at 0 01 5 0 mm was spiked into the reaction system to evaluate its role in sb adsorption all experiments were repeated for three times 2 2 oxidation experiments oxidation experiments were carried out at a reaction volume of 200 ml in 250 ml beakers wrapped with a tinfoil to shield the light the reaction mixtures were magnetically stirred constantly at 500 rpm the initial sb iii concentration and reaction temperature were set at 8 2 μm and 25 0 0 2 c respectively for the convenience of analysis and clear illustration of oxidation the initial concentrations of mnxoy were fixed at 64 0 μm mn except for β mno2 128 0 μm mn was used the effects of ph on oxidation were studied in the range of 3 0 10 8 the same as those in adsorption experiments 2 0 ml of the reaction mixture was regularly collected from the reaction system of which 1 0 ml sample was quenched by 1 0 ml 0 1 m na2c2o4 ph 2 2 for the determination of total sb iii and sb v in the reaction system abbreviated as sb iii t and sb v t respectively belzile et al 2001 sun et al 2018 na2c2o4 barely affected the distributions of sb species in the reaction mixtures data not shown belzile et al 2001 sun et al 2018 the other 1 0 ml sample was filtered directly to analyze sb iii and sb v in the aqueous phase abbreviated sb iii aq and sb v aq respectively all samples were analyzed within 24 h the dynamic distributions of sb iii and sb v in the liquid and solid phases were calculated via mass balance to further elucidate the roles of mn iii and ov on sb iii oxidation α mno2 with different contents of mn iii and ov were used for oxidizing sb iii in ph 7 0 buffer 2 3 analytical characterization and calculation methods analytical methods for sb species total sb k and mn in the aqueous phase methods to characterize the changes in the structural properties of mnxoy before and after their reaction with sb iii and the distribution characteristics of sb on the mnxoy surfaces are presented in text s3 calculation methods for the relative oxygen vacancy ov concentration and average oxidation state aos of mn are listed in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mnxoy fig 1 a1 a6 show the xrd patterns of six mnxoy the exact matching of characteristic peaks with those of the standard materials suggests the successful preparation of δ mno2 jcpds 86 0666 ponnusamy et al 2019 α mno2 jcpds 44 0141 wang et al 2020 γ mno2 jcpds 14 0644 fu et al 2009 β mno2 jcpds 24 0735 liu et al 2020 mn3o4 jcpds 24 0734 feng et al 2007 and γ mnooh jcpds 41 1379 frierdich et al 2016 fig 1 a1 a6 their structural parameters including the tunnel size crystal system and unit cell are detailed in table s1 the morphologies of all mnxoy were obtained through sem and tem analyses fig 1 b1 b6 c1 c6 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mno2 β mno2 mn3o4 and γ mnooh show spherical structures consisting of a hierarchical structure of nanosheets with a thickness dendritic nanostructure sea urchin structure consisting of interlaced urchin spines rod like structures irregular lumpy morphology and needle and fibrous features respectively fig 1 b1 b6 c1 c6 consistent with those in the literatures frierdich et al 2016 huang et al 2019a liu et al 2020 lattice fringes at interplanar spacings of 0 71 0 69 0 39 0 31 and 0 19 0 24 and 0 34 nm on hr tem images suggested that the crystal planes on δ mno2 α mno2 γ mno2 β mno2 mn3o4 and γ mnooh are 003 110 120 110 and 210 211 and 11 1 respectively fig 1 d1 d6 huang et al 2019a huang et al 2019b yang et al 2019 details regarding these characterizations are shown in text s5 relative contents of mn species i e mn iv mn iii and mn ii for each mnxoy were calculated based on the mn 2p3 2 xps spectra fig 1 e1 e6 a series of multiplet peaks other than signal peaks were used to curve fit the mn states to guarantee the reliable results of mn species distribution banerjee and nesbitt 1999 specifically these mn 2p3 2 multiplet peaks at the half maximum were assigned the same full width and these peaks were fitted using a peak shape of 70 30 gaussian lorentzian banerjee and nesbitt 1999 the binding energies of these mn 2p3 2 multiplet peaks were referred to the literature banerjee and nesbitt 1999 and these peaks were fixed at the same relative intensities the aos of these mnxoy were calculated by mn 3s spectra fitting huang et al 2018 and then these values were compared with those obtained by chemical titration and lbb leucoberbelin blue colorimetric methods zhu et al 2017 table s2 and fig s1 one way analysis of variance shows the results obtained by the three methods have no significant differences with each other the aos obtained for all mnxoy were lower than their stoichiometric values suggesting the presence of structural defects huang et al 2019a liu et al 2020 ponnusamy et al 2019 two kinds of oxygen were observed in the o 1s xps spectrum fig 1 f1 f6 and table s2 namely lattice oxygen species olatt 529 2 530 8 ev and surface chemisorbed oxygen species osur 531 0 532 6 ev huang et al 2018 ponnusamy et al 2019 the content of osur which is indicative of the extent of surface oxygen defects wang et al 2020 on δ α γ mno2 being higher than that on the other mnxoy table s2 other properties of these mnxoy are summarized in table s2 and figures s2 s4 including specific surface area ssa isoelectric point phiep reduction potential e0 and oxygen vacancies ov how these physiochemical parameters affect their reactions with sb iii will be discussed in the later section 3 2 apparent adsorption of sb iii on mnxoy sb iii was barely oxidized and precipitated in the absence of mnxoy under our experimental conditions fig s5 since the oxidation of sb iii by mnxoy and the release of sb v occurred simultaneously with sb iii adsorption apparent adsorption was used to evaluate the overall amounts of sb species retained on mnxoy surfaces during the reactions between sb iii and mnxoy the apparent adsorption of sb iii on mnxoy at ph 3 0 10 8 is shown in fig 2 the langmuir isotherm model was used to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity q m of six mnxoy towards sb iii to compare their differences on sb retention table s3 and fig 2 the ssa of all mnxoy covers three orders of magnitude indicating that varied degrees of agglomeration might exist within these mnxoy thus q m was normalized to mn content rather than ssa sb iii exists mainly as h3sbo3 at ph 3 0 10 8 herath et al 2017 the apparent adsorption of sb iii changed with ph suggesting that the oxidation of sb iii to sb v occurred wang et al 2021 much more sb v was observed in the δ α γ mno2 system than in the other systems figs s6 s7 and table s4 the mount of sb iii oxidized at the end of reaction decreased with the increasing ph figs s6 s7 sb v exists mainly as a monovalent anion sb oh 6 in ph 3 0 solution herath et al 2017 its adsorption on mnxoy should decrease with the increasing ph due to the increased electrostatic repulsion sun et al 2018 as expected the apparent adsorption capacities of γ mnooh mn3o4 and β mno2 decreased with the increasing ph because a smaller amount of sb iii was oxidized to sb v than that of δ α γ mno2 fig 2 and table s3 for the other mnxoy the apparent adsorption capacities increased with the increasing ph fig 2 and table s3 the causes could be explained by the reductive dissolution of mnxoy much more mn was released into aqueous phase at the end of reaction at ph 7 0 fig s8 which might lead to the destruction of the main structure of δ α γ mno2 as a consequence ssa and active sites on δ α γ mno2 could be lower at ph 7 0 than at ph 7 0 meanwhile mn ii precipitates forms more easily at higher ph which can create new sites for sb adsorption in addition mn ii can neutralize the negative charge on mnxoy surfaces to reduce electrostatic repulsion between mnxoy and sb v and can also form mn iv o mn ii sb oh 6 complexes and antimonate precipitates with sb v to enhance sb retention the amount of sb v reteined increased with the externally added mn ii fig s9 confirming the critical role of mn ii in adsorption hence the apparent adsorption of sb iii on δ α γ mno2 increased with the increasing ph the adsorption capacity of mnxoy positively correlated with its ssa at ph 7 0 and 10 8 fig s10 and tables s2 s3 the apparent adsorption capacities for mnxoy decreased in the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 β mno2 at ph of 7 0 from 528 98 111 51 to 10 92 0 87 mmol mol mn table s3 higher ssa facilitated the adsorption of pb ii and tl i by mnxoy with different structures were also documented liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 at lower ph 5 0 much more sb iii was oxidized to sb v figs s6 s7 and table s4 and the amount of sb reteined decreased in the order of δ mno2 α mno2 γ mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 β mno2 fig 2 and table s3 much more mn was dissolved into aqueous phase in γ mno2 system than in δ α mno2 system at ph 3 0 and 5 0 figure s8 resulting in a more significant decrease in its ssa than δ α mno2 wei et al 2019 moreover δ mno2 exhibits a layered structure the reductive dissolution of mn could continuously generate new edge sites to adsorb sb rathi et al 2020 sun et al 2018 both causes resulted in the lower adsorption of γ mno2 than δ α mno2 fig 2 and table s3 the oxidation of sb iii by mnxoy will be discussed in detail later 3 3 oxidation of sb iii on mnxoy fig 3 shows the evolution of sb species as well as their distributions during the oxidation of sb iii on mnxoy sb v concentration in the system increased rapidly in the first 10 min and gradually reached equilibrium in the next 80 min which could be attributed to the passivation of mnxoy surfaces resulting from the adsorption of sb mainly sb v fig 3 sun et al 2018 sb v remaining on mnxoy surfaces was lower than that in aqueous phase at all ph except for α mno2 at ph 10 8 fig 3 suggesting the easy release of sb v from the mnxoy surface the recognized initial rate method was applied to quantify the initial oxidation rate of sb iii r init on mnxoy since mn directly participated in the reaction with sb iii r init values were all normalized by mn content r init decreased with increasing ph fig 4 the following aspects were involved first the protonation of mnxoy accelerated electron transfer and enhanced the coordination reaction on the surface driehans et al 1995 meanwhile h is the reactant in the oxidation process eqs 1 3 and lower ph can provide more h sun et al 2018 1 mno2 h3sbo3 h mn2 h2sbo4 h2o 2 mn3o4 h3sbo3 5h 3mn2 h2sbo4 3h2o 3 2mnooh h3sbo3 3h 2mn2 h2sbo4 3h2o moreover more mn was dissolved from mnxoy at lower ph figure s11 resulting in the formation of more active sites for adsorption and oxidation luo et al 2017 sun et al 2019 according to charge balance the reaction between sb iii and mn3o4 should release more mn ii than other mnxoy in accordance with the experimental results fig s11 r init calculated for the oxidation of sb iii on mnxoy at ph 5 0 and 7 0 followed the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 β mno2 table s5 the highest r init 11 17 1 61 mmol min mol mn at ph 7 0 was approximately 18 times the lowest one 0 32 0 04 mmol min mol mn fig 4 suggesting the critical roles of structural properties on the oxidation of mnxoy previous studies reported that the oxidation ability of mnxoy was highly related to one or several structural parameters i e ssa reduction potential osur ov aos mn iii and mn iv huang et al 2019a liu et al 2020 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the connections between the structural properties of mnxoy and their abilities to oxidize sb iii will be discussed in detail in the subsequent section 3 4 connections between the mnxoy structure and sb iii oxidation 3 4 1 effects of reduction potential and specific surface area oxidant with higher reduction potential e0 generally exhibits stronger oxidation ability former studies documented that mnxoy with higher e0 showed faster oxidation of phenol and 2 mercaptobenzo thiazole liu et al 2009a ukrainczyk and mcbride 1992 therefore e0 of the six mnxoy was determined using cyclic voltammetry method and the results are presented in fig s4 e0 of all mnxoy decreased in the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 β mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 fig s4 except for β mno2 r init in the other five mnxoy systems was positively correlated with their e0 fig s12a the lowest r init in β mno2 could be explained by the much lower ssa than that of other mnxoy 3 50 vs 24 97 103 05 m2 g table s2 which hindered its reaction with sb iii the rate of atrazine and 2 mercaptobenzo thiazole degradation by different mnxoy were reported to increase with ssa liu et al 2009a shin and cheney 2004 it is expected that larger ssa could provide more active sites for the reaction liu et al 2009a shin and cheney 2004 to eliminate the interference brought by ssa all r init were then normalized by ssa fig s12b β mno2 with the lowest ssa exhibited the highest r init per ssa among the six mnxoy in other words the unit ssa of β mno2 contained more mn than the other mnxoy fig s12b thus mnxoy with both of higher e0 and ssa could show more robust performance on sb iii oxidation 3 4 2 effects of oxygen species as illustrated in eq 1 3 oxygen species osur and olatt in mnxoy can act as reactants to take part in the reactions between mnxoy and sb iii therefore the reactivities of oxygen species could potentially affect sb iii oxidation because of the higher mobility of osur than olatt it has been reported to play a significant role in the direct oxidation of sulfamethoxazole and toluene by different mnxoy wan et al 2015 meanwhile it was also documented that mnxoy with higher olatt contents exhibited stronger oxidation ability toward vocs at high temperature in air in which olatt could be replenished by o2 santos et al 2010 however the replenishment of olatt is hard to occur in aqueous solutions at room temperature wang et al 2020 that is to say osur could be more reactive than olatt to participate in the reaction in solutions as expected higher r init occurred in mnxoy with higher osur and lower olatt contents fig 5a b the relative contents of osur and olatt were calculated based on the deconvolution of o1s xps fig 1 f1 f6 and table s2 o2 tpd was further conducted to evaluate the mobility of oxygen species in mnxoy fig 5c in which o2 desorbed at temperatures of 400 400 700 and 700 c were assigned to surface active oxygen subsurface lattice oxygen and bulk lattice oxygen respectively wang et al 2020 the higher the osur content of mnxoy the lower the desorption temperature of the first reduction peak in the o2 tpd spectra wang et al 2020 the temperature for the first reduction peaks of mnxoy increased in the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 β mno2 from 378 to 553 c fig 5c indicating that osur contents decreased in the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 β mno2 in consistent with the xps results similar findings were observed in the catalytic transformation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and toluene on mnxoy with different structures i e mnxoy with lower desorption temperature of oxygen species which suggested more osur were shown greater reactivities wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 moreover osur on mnxoy can accept electrons to form superoxide radicals o2 to enhance the oxidation wang et al 2020 we speculated that mnxoy with higher osur could have a higher potential to generate o2 as expected the intensities representing the formation of o2 in the epr spectrum i e dmpoooh signal decreased in the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 fig 5d the absence of dmpoooh signal for β mno2 could be attributed to its lowest osur content among all mnxoy fig 5d moreover quenching experiments were performed to further investigate the role of o2 in sb iii oxidation sod was used as the scavenger of o2 the presence of sod slightly inhibited the oxidation of o2 in δ α γ mno2 systems suggesting the role of o2 fig s13a s13c however the presence of sod barely affected sb iii oxidation in other mnxoy fig s13d s13f due to the lower amount of o2 generated in accordance with the epr results altogether these results consistently suggested the role of osur in sb iii oxidation however it should be noted that osur is formed by the capture of free oxygen by ov generated by structural defects zhang et al 2019 and osur content depends on ov as expected the osur content was positively correlated with the ov content in six mnxoy fig 5e our results were similar with the catalytic transformation of pahs on five mnxoy that a higher content of ov favored faster degradation of pahs by adsorbing more oxygen to form osur wang et al 2020 likewise it is reasonable that r init showed a good positive relationship with the ov content of six mnxoy fig 5f suggesting the important role of ov in sb iii oxidation 3 4 3 effects of aos and mn species the aos of mn in mnxoy is an important indicator for its oxidative reactivity for instance liu et al 2009b found that mno2 with higher aos showed stronger oxidation ability toward sulfadiazine while other reports demonstrated that lower aos of mnxoy facilitated the faster oxidation of cr iii tl i bisphenol a and pahs huang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 weaver and hochella jr 2003 however r init was not positively negatively correlated with aos as expected fig 6 a r init of high valent mnxoy i e δ α γ and β mno2 were found to be negatively correlated with aos while that in low valent mnxoy i e mn3o4 and γ mnooh showed the opposite rule fig 6a as we know more mn iii mn ii leads to lower aos mn iii has been documented to play a role in the oxidation of cr iii thallium i bisphenol a and pahs by different mno2 huang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 weaver and hochella jr 2003 therefore relationships between the content of mn species and r init were evaluated figs 6b and s14 r init for low valent mnxoy were negatively correlated with mn ii content which was predictable since mn ii could barely oxidize sb iii fig s14a while r init was found to be positively correlated with the mn ii content in four high valent mnxoy fig s14a and it was negatively correlated with the mn vi content fig s14b because mn iii and mn ii generally appear together with ov in high valent mnxoy mn4 o2 mn4 mn3 mn2 ov mn3 mn2 1 2 o2 and the redox potential of mn iii is higher than that of mn iv 1 50 vs 1 29 v kostka et al 1995 wang et al 2012 these results suggested that mn iii could play a critical role in sb iii oxidation as expected r init for high valent and low valent mnxoy was positively correlated with the mn iii content respectively fig 6b mn iii oxides complexes are robust for oxidizing various contaminants huang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 mn iii has d4 ions in the t2g 3eg 1 state and because of the jahn teller effect caused by antibonding eg 1 electron fig s15 mn iii o bond is longer than mn iv o nico and zasoski 2000 robinson et al 2013 ukrainczyk and mcbride 1992 thus mn iii could directly accept an electron by direct coordination with pollutants without changing the mn spin state t2g 3eg 1 t2g 3eg 2 but the electron transfer between mn vi and pollutants requires a change in mn spin state t2g 3 t2g 3eg 2 nico and zasoski 2000 robinson et al 2013 ukrainczyk and mcbride 1992 moreover we calculated the changes in the standard gibbs free energies δg for mn iv and mn iii to form mn iii and mn ii respectively marcus and sutin 1985 the change in δg obtained for mn iv to accept an electron to form mn iii mn iv e mn iii e0 0 95 v is 91 66 kj mol v which is much higher than that of mn iii mn iii e mn ii e0 1 50 v i e 144 73 kj mol v further confirming that mn iii accepts electron more readily than mn iv kostka et al 1995 wang et al 2012 meanwhile we found that low valent mnxoy with more mn iii showed slower oxidation toward sb iii than high valent mnxoy fig 6b this contradictory result could be explained as follows mn iii in high valent mnxoy is formed from the structural defects along with ov to maintain the electrostatic balance of mnxoy mn4 o2 mn4 mn3 mn2 ov mn3 mn2 1 2 o2 thus mn iii is expected to be infinitely close to ov ov could provide a dangling bond to facilitate sb iii adsorption which increased the probability of collision between sb iii and mn iii and thus promoted their reaction wang et al 2017b meanwhile the local electric field formed around ov is expected to accelerate electron transfer between sb iii and mn iii zhang et al 2021 however ov in low valent mnxoy coexists with mn ii mn3 o2 mn3 mn2 ov mn2 1 2 o2 li et al 2021 which could hardly to achieve the comparable effect on mn iii as that in high valent mnxoy wang et al 2020 a previous study also documented that mnxoy with mixed valence of mn iii iv exhibited a more robust oxidizing ability than mnxoy without mn iv huang et al 2018 meanwhile the mn iii content decreased in low valent mnxoy as expected after the reaction while in high valent mnxoy the relative mn iii content increased table s7 and fig s16 similar to the oxidation of tl i by mno2 liu et al 2020 this result could be explained by the disproportionated reactions occurred within the mn species mn iv mn ii 2mn iii and sb iii oxidation by mn iv 2mn iv sb iii 2mn iii sb v karimian et al 2021 moreover h2 temperature programmed reduction h2 tpr was performed to further compare the reactivity of six mnxoy fig 6c peak at lower temperature is attributed to the reduction of mno2 to mn2o3 and then to mn3o4 while peak at higher temperature is due to the reduction of mn3o4 to mno wang et al 2017c the h2 tpr spectra of γ mno2 and β mno2 showed two characteristic peaks at 267 and 326 c and at 326 and 434 c respectively fig 6c two peaks on that of δ mno2 and α mno2 overlapped at the ranges of 270 330 c fig 6c which could be explained by the simultaneous reductions of mn iv and mn iii species wang et al 2017c because the absence of mn iv only one peak was observed for mn3o4 at 402 c and γ mnooh at 394 c respectively fig 6c the lower temperature of the first reduction peak suggests the higher oxidative activity of mnxoy wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 thus the oxidative activities of six mnxoy could be ordered as γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 γ mnooh mn3o4 β mno2 based on the h2 tpr results fig 6c which was consistent with our former results huang et al 2018 also reported that high valent mnxoy with mixed valence of mn iii iv was more reactive than low valent mnxoy i e mnooh and mn2o3 for bisphenol a degradation h2 consumption was then calculated to evaluate the relative contents of mn species in all mnxoy high valent mnxoy with more mn iii could consume less h2 while that of low valent mnxoy could consume more h2 according to the charge balance calculation the total h2 consumption for the reduction of mn3o4 γ mnooh γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 and β mno2 was 5 47 6 78 10 41 11 54 12 53 and 14 68 mmol g respectively this result is consistent with the mn iii content calculated by xps analysis that is the mn iii content in high valent mnxoy decreased by the order of γ mno2 δ mno2 α mno2 β mno2 and the mn iii content in γ mnooh was higher than that in mn3o4 table s2 finally three α mno2 with different contents of mn iii and ov were synthesized to further verify the roles of mn iii and ov in the oxidation of sb iii figs s17 s18 and table s6 hou et al 2013 it s exciting that the oxidation of sb iii on the three new α mno2 exhibited the same rules as the former four high valent mnxoy figs 5 a b e f and 6b which further supported the critical role of mn iii and ov in sb iii oxidation taken together connections between the physicochemical properties of mnxoy and their abilities to oxidize sb iii can be concluded as follows outwardly mnxoy with higher e0 and ssa has a more robust ability for sb iii oxidation inwardly because mn iii is more reactive than mn iv and ov can adsorb oxygen to form osur provide a dangling bond to enhance sb iii adsorption and enhance electron transfer mn iii and ov together play the critical role in determining the oxidation ability of mnxoy moreover ov in high valent mnxoy is in close proximity with mn iii which makes mn iii react with sb iii more easily resulting in faster sb iii oxidation in high valent mnxoy than that in low valent mnxoy 3 5 evolution of mnxoy structures the structures of mnxoy after their reaction with sb iii were characterized and compared with those of the raw mnxoy two main peaks i e at 83 9 0 8 and 89 0 0 5 ev on mn 3s spectrum for all mnxoy were shifted after the reaction fig s19 suggesting changes in the mn valence distribution because more mn was reduced by sb iii in δ α γ β mno2 than in mn3o4 and γ mnooh the drop in aos in the former was more obvious than that in the latter fig s19 and table s7 oxidation of sb iii increased the mn iii and mn ii contents while decreasing the mn vi content in δ α γ β mno2 fig s19 and table s7 for mn3o4 and γ mnooh the mn vi content increased at the end of the reaction due to mn iii disproportionation these results suggested electron transfer within mn species in mnxoy liu et al 2020 characteristic peaks in the xrd pattern of δ mno2 at d spacings of 7 10 3 59 and 1 42 å disappeared or weakened after the reaction suggesting the reaction might mainly occur on 003 006 and 110 planes fig 7 a1 meanwhile nanowires of groutite α mnooh and manganite γ mnooh were generated fig 7 a1 which was further confirmed by tem analysis fig 7 b1 c1 karimian et al 2021 the results of edx elemental mapping suggested that sb was mostly enriched on the δ mno2 surface while a smaller part was distributed on the surface of newly generated γ mnooh fig 7 d1 dissolution of mn from mnxoy could lead to lattice distortion nie et al 2022 characteristic peaks in the xrd patterns of α mno2 and γ mno2 were shifted to lower diffraction angles after the reaction fig 7 a2 a3 the morphology of α mno2 barely changed while the sea urchin shape of γ mno2 became loose fig 7 b2 c2 b3 c3 sb was uniformly distributed on the surface of α mno2 and γ mno2 fig 7 d2 d3 oxidation of sb iii showed little effect on the crystal structure and morphology of β mno2 and γ mnooh fig 7 a4 a6 b4 b6 c4 c6 and sb was uniformly distributed on their surface fig 7 d4 d6 mn3o4 was converted to γ mnooh fig 7 a5 b5 c5 and sb were mainly located at the γ mnooh surface fig 7 d5 the following aspects were involved in the structural transformation of mnxoy mn ii on the δ mno2 surface can donate one electron to mn iv mn2 mn iv o2 2h2o 2mn iii ooh 2h resulting in the formation of mn iii hydroxides karimian et al 2021 mn ii can compete with sb for edge sites resulting in more mn ii being embedded into the structural defects and cationic vacancies of δ mno2 which facilitates the transformation of δ mno2 to mn iii containing minerals karimian et al 2021 meanwhile mnxoy can catalyze the oxidation of mn ii adsorbed on its surface by o2 mn2 1 6o2 aq h2o 1 3 mn3o4 2h lind 1988 moreover because mn iii protonation mn3o4 was transformed to γ mnooh mn3o4 2h γ mnooh mn2 lind 1988 ftir analysis was performed to elucidate the mechanisms of sb binding on mnxoy fig s20 characteristic peaks at 400 800 cm 1 in all mnxoy were assigned to vibrations of mn o and mn o mn fig s20a s20f zhong et al 2020 peaks at 1630 and 3500 cm 1 were attributed to the bending vibration of mn oh and stretching vibration of oh in water respectively fig s20a s20f li et al 2021 meanwhile peaks at 1082 1116 and 1156 cm 1 represented the bending vibration of oh in the γ oh δ 2 oh and δ 1 oh modes in γ mnooh respectively fig s2f li et al 2021 peaks at 1630 and 3430 cm 1 on all mnxoy were shifted after the reaction suggesting that the oh group may participate in sb adsorption via surface complexation mechanisms sun et al 2018 xu et al 2011 meanwhile the shift at the peak of 1105 cm 1 which represented the deformation vibration of δ oh on sb v confirmed the involvement of oh in adsorption fig s20 mccomb et al 2007 sun et al 2019 because the vibration signals of ν sb o bands 500 700 cm 1 overlapped with those of ν mn o 400 700 cm 1 ν sb o was not detected fig s20 mccomb et al 2007 xu et al 2011 moreover the presence of peaks at 1087 1117 and 1151 cm 1 which were attributed to bending vibration oh in γ mnooh on mn3o4 after the reaction suggested partial transformation of mn3o4 to γ mnooh figure s20e li et al 2021 which is consistent with the xrd and tem results 3 6 oxidation mechanisms possible mechanisms of sb iii oxidation on mnxoy were elucidated based on the results obtained in this work and literature results four potential electron transfer patterns were involved in δ α γ mno2 systems fig 8 sb iii can directly donate two electrons to one mn iv sb iii mn vi sb v mn ii pattern 1 wang et al 2021 or two mn vi sb iii 2mn vi sb v 2mn iii pattern 2 wang et al 2021 mn iii can also act as an electron acceptor to accept electron from sb iii sb iii 2mn iii sb v 2mn ii pattern 3 nie et al 2022 finally mn iv and mn iii around ov accept one electron from sb iii mn iv mn iii sb iii ov sb v mn ii aq mn iii pattern 4 nie et al 2022 released mn ii can reabsorb onto mnxoy to enhance sb v adsorption through the cation bridge effect sun et al 2018 mn ii adsorbed on the mn iv site can generate two new mn iii sites through a comproportionation reaction fig 8a karimian et al 2021 moreover the coexistence of sb v and mn ii in a molar ratio of 2 1 also has the potential to form mnsb2o6 fig 8b johnson et al 2013 however mnsb2o6 was not observed in this work due to the low concentrations of sb iii and mn used patterns 1 2 and 4 were involved in β mno2 fig 8 while pattern 3 was the only route in γ mnooh and mn3o4 fig 8 meanwhile the o2 formed was also involved in sb iii oxidation in the δ α γ mno2 systems fig 8 4 conclusions mnxoy is an important factor that controls the geochemical cycles of metal and metalloid elements in the environment mnxoy with different structures show significant variations in their geochemical properties however how the structural properties of mnxoy affect the geochemical behavior of sb iii is still under dispute herein we compared the reactions occurring between sb iii and six mnxoy and demonstrated the strong connection between the geochemical behavior of sb iii and the mnxoy structure apparently mnxoy with higher e0 and ssa favored faster oxidation of sb iii low valent mnxoy i e mn3o4 and γ mnooh exhibited much lower adsorption and oxidation ability than high valent mnxoy i e δ α and γ mno2 mn iii and ov exhibited a synergistic effect on sb iii oxidation higher contents of ov is in close proximity to mn iii in high valent mnxoy which facilitated the reaction between mn iii and sb iii by enhancing sb iii adsorption and electron transfer meanwhile ov could adsorb free oxygen to form osur which has a much higher reactivity than olatt to enhance the oxidation of sb iii ov in low valent mnxoy is adjacent to mn ii which exhibited a weaker synergistic effect on improving the reactivity in low valent mnxoy the oxidation of sb iii to sb v by mnxoy reduced its toxicity but increased its mobility therefore the oxidation of sb iii to sb v might increase the bioavailability of sb to plants in environmental settings rich in δ α or γ mno2 however the toxicity of sb to microorganisms and geobionts should gain more attention in environments containing β mno2 mn3o4 or γ mnooh because a certain proportion of sb iii might still exist this study furthers our understanding of the structure reactivity relationships between mnxoy and sb iii and may provide novel insight into designing mn based materials for removing sb in aqueous environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare
